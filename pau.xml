There was no immediate word on casualties or official comment.

The blast occurred in a city that has been at the heart of an Islamist insurgency waged by Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) for nearly two decades which has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions across the northeast.

No group has claimed responsibility, but militants have previously targeted mosques and crowded places in Maiduguri in suicide bombings and improvised explosive device attacks.

Boko Haram launched its uprising in Borno state in 2009, seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate. Despite military offensives and regional cooperation, sporadic attacks continue to threaten civilians in the northeast.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why all the running? Sporting craze draws in record numbers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/the-debate/20251224-why-all-the-running-sporting-craze-draws-in-record-numbers</link><description>Not everyone will run a 41-kilometre race in 2026, but more and more will take up what's arguably the world's oldest sport . Why the trend? Is it a mere post-pandemic fad, or the sign of something deeper?

We think of running as a solitary pursuit, but it's increasingly a social activity. Running clubs are particularly in vogue among the young, who seek a release from a life that's increasingly happening in front of a screen.

Technology is also seeping into the experience, be it with equipment, monitors or apps , to the point that some bemoan the gamification of running.

So what's running about: a pursuit or an escape? Goals to achieve or the experience of the journey?

"We, States of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom condemn the approval by the Israeli security cabinet of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank," said a joint statement released by the French foreign ministry.

"We recall our clear opposition to any form of annexation and to the expansion of settlement policies," it added.

On Sunday, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the authorities had greenlit the settlements, saying the move was aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.

In their statement, the countries stressed such unilateral actions "violate international law" and risk undermining a fragile ceasefire in Gaza as mediators push for the implementation of the second phase of the truce.

The countries urged Israel "to reverse this decision, as well as the expansion of settlements".

They also reaffirmed their "unwavering commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the two-state solution... where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side-by-side in peace and security".

Israel has occupied the West Bank following a war in 1967.

Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents.

Earlier this month, the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank – all of which are illegal under international law – had reached its highest level since at least 2017.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 19:19:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1cb306c8-e0f7-11f0-9867-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25339610597954.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>White House orders U.S. forces focus on 'quarantine' of Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/white-house-orders-us-forces-focus-quarantine-venezuela-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The White House has ordered U.S. military forces to focus almost exclusively on enforcing the "quarantine" of Venezuela, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump's administration began releasing files related to criminal investigations of Epstein, the late American financier who was friends with Trump in the 1990s, to comply with a law passed by Congress last month.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress passed the law over Trump's objections, requiring that all documents be released by December 19 while allowing partial redactions to protect victims.

Releases so far have contained extensive redactions, angering some Republicans and doing little to defuse a scandal threatening the party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

In a message shared on social media on Wednesday, the Justice Department said more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been uncovered by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, without elaborating on when or how the documents were found.

"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible," the department said. "Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 20:23:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ILFJKU4RBI2JEN73NHPR7JWBE.jpg?auth=9870531b243b02eb90743d6cbd5cb89d9c1eb3be566a5196ab8c69edad16adf1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed in blast at mosque in northeast Nigeria</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251224-several-killed-in-blast-at-mosque-in-northeast-nigeria</link><description>An explosion ripped through a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri and killed at least seven worshippers Wednesday, witnesses and security sources told AFP.

No armed groups immediately claimed responsibility for what anti-jihadist militia leader Babakura Kolo said was a suspected bombing.

Maiduguri is the capital of Borno state, home to a years-long insurgency by jihadist groups Boko Haram and an offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, though the city itself has not seen a major attack in years.

The bomb went off inside a crowded mosque in the city's Gamboru market, as Muslim faithful gathered for evening prayers around 6:00 pm (1700 GMT), according to witnesses.

One of the leaders of the mosque, Malam Abuna Yusuf, put the toll at eight dead, though officials have not yet released a casualty count.

"We can confirm there has been an explosion," police spokesman Nahum Daso told AFP, adding that an explosive ordnance disposal team was already on-site.

Kolo said that seven were killed.

He said it was suspected that the bomb was placed inside the mosque and exploded midway through prayers, while some witnesses described a suicide bombing .

It was not immediately clear how many people were injured, though witness Isa Musa Yusha'u told AFP: "I saw many victims being taken away for medical treatment."

Videos taken in the aftermath and seen by AFP showed a person covered in blood writhing on the ground, and what appeared to be bodies covered by a sheet.

A security alert sent by an international NGO to its staff in Maiduguri, seen by AFP, advised its workers to stay away from the Gamboru market area.

Nigeria has been battling a jihadist insurgency since 2009 in a conflict that has killed at least 40,000 and displaced around two million from their homes in the northeast, according to the UN .

Though the violence has waned since its peak a decade ago, it has spilt into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon .

And concerns are growing about a resurgence of violence in parts of the northeast, where insurgent groups remain capable of mounting deadly attacks despite years of sustained military operations.

Maiduguri itself – once the scene of nightly gun battles and bombings -- has been calm in recent years, with the last major attack recorded in 2021.

But reminders of the conflict are never far off in the state capital, where major military operations are headquartered.

Military pick-ups lumber through town daily, their beds filled with soldiers whose helmets shield them from the hot afternoon sun.

Evening checkpoints are still in effect, even as markets that once closed in the early afternoon throng into the night.

Meanwhile, in the countryside, the insurgency continues to rage, with analysts warning of an uptick in jihadist violence this year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 20:25:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/edad9848-e0fb-11f0-aa07-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25077805366921.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump-backed Asfura wins Honduras presidency after weeks of delays in disputed election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-backed-asfura-wins-honduras-presidency-after-weeks-delays-disputed-2025-12-24/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Dec 24 - Nasry Asfura, the conservative National Party candidate backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, has won Honduras' presidential election, the electoral body said on Wednesday as it finally declared a victor of the November 30 presidential election after weeks of delays, technical problems, and allegations of fraud.

The electoral authority, known as the CNE, said Asfura had won 40.3% of the vote, edging out center-right Liberal Party candidate Salvador Nasralla who garnered 39.5%. Results were so tight and the ballot processing system so chaotic that around 15% of the tally sheets comprising hundreds of thousands of ballots had to be counted by hand to determine the winner.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:20:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NTEZFQ35AFIJFIPMWSYIL2Q7TE.jpg?auth=0a0c3957f3fd9919e78e4f9516d0400cb9b73d61760eb4eeb38babc709edeaa0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over a million more documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein discovered, DOJ says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251224-over-a-million-more-documents-linked-to-jeffrey-epstein-discovered-doj-says</link><description>The US Department of Justice said Wednesday that more than a million more documents potentially related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered and are being reviewed for release.

The DOJ began releasing records last week from the investigation into Epstein, a wealthy financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act passed nearly unanimously by Congress last month and signed into law by President Donald Trump mandated the release of all of the Epstein files by December 19.

The Justice Department failed to meet that deadline, however, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche blaming the delay on the need to painstakingly redact the identities of Epstein's victims from the files.

The DOJ said Wednesday it would need a "few more weeks" to sort and redact the new material.

It said the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI had "uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case."

"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible," the DOJ said on X.

"Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:21:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f5a754f8-e10a-11f0-9db2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25357204107900-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jong Un oversees test-firing of long-range missile, building of nuclear submarine, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-oversees-test-firing-long-range-missile-building-2025-12-24/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 25 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw test-firing of a long-range surface-to-air missile at a test site near the East Sea on Wednesday, state media KCNA reported on Thursday.

Electoral authorities declared Asfura the victor of the November 30 presidential election after weeks of delays, technical problems and allegations of fraud.

Trump threw his support behind Asfura, a 67-year-old politician and businessman who is the former mayor of the capital Tegucigalpa, writing in a Truth Social post before the election that he was the "only real friend of Freedom in Honduras" and urging people to vote for him.

Trump also threatened to cut off U.S. financial support to Honduras if Asfura did not win. Despite casting himself as a foe of illegal drugs, Trump also pardoned former President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was from Asfura's National Party and had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. after his conviction on drug trafficking and firearms charges.

"The United States urges all parties to respect the confirmed results so that Honduran authorities may swiftly ensure a peaceful transition of authority to President-Elect Nasry Asfura," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

"We look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security cooperation, end illegal immigration to the United States, and strengthen the economic ties between our two countries."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:20:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2W4BRUNMIRN7JMP2T2CVU6MYQ4.jpg?auth=39bd47d32fae6ef33d1494402e83eb82d191538e4c6c3c4b0ef4d1778e89c777&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, Canada, Germany and others condemn Israel's West Bank settlement plan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/uk-canada-germany-others-condemn-israels-west-bank-settlement-plan-2025-12-24/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Countries including Britain, Canada, Germany and others on Wednesday condemned the Israeli security cabinet's approval of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank , saying they violated international law and risked fuelling instability.

"We recall that such unilateral actions, as part of a wider intensification of the settlement policies in the West Bank, not only violate international law but also risk fuelling instability," the statement said.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rejected the statement by foreign countries in an X post on Wednesday, saying the decision aimed to help address security threats faced by Israel.

"Foreign governments will not restrict the right of Jews to live in the Land of Israel, and any such call is morally wrong and discriminatory against Jews," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KXUYSUG7LVJZVMMI5RYKPSUWSE.jpg?auth=608166132b0197fc8804149d94583381dfe955645c18ac912fdff54acd778bf9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE agents involved in Maryland shooting, injuring two</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-agents-involved-maryland-shooting-injuring-two-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Federal immigration agents were involved in a shooting on Wednesday that left one person shot and wounded and another with injuries, authorities said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees federal immigration officers, said in a statement that ICE agents were carrying out an operation to target two men in the U.S. illegally in Glen Burnie, Maryland, just south of Baltimore.

When the agents approached a van carrying the two men, the driver drove the van into agents' vehicles, and then drove the van directly at ICE officers in an attempt to run them over, DHS said.

The agents then "defensively fired their service weapons, striking the driver," DHS wrote. The van then wrecked between two buildings and injured the passenger. Both men were taken to a hospital.

ABC News, citing the Anne Arundel County Police Department, reported the man who was shot was in stable condition, and the other man did not suffer serious injury.

The Anne Arundel County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maryland Governor Wes Moore, a Democrat, wrote on social media he was "aware of the ICE-involved shooting that occurred earlier today" and his office was working with local officials to learn more and provide support.

Federal immigration officers have been involved in several confrontations with both the subjects of their raids and people witnessing and objecting to their tactics as they work to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation plan.

ICE agents in September shot and killed a man who they said had tried to run them over with a car, though security and body camera footage raised doubts about the situation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo, on Christmas Eve, says denying help to poor is rejecting God</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-christmas-eve-says-denying-help-poor-is-rejecting-god-2025-12-24/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Pope Leo said in a Christmas Eve sermon on Wednesday that the story of Jesus being born in a stable because there was no room at an inn should remind Christians that refusing to help the poor and strangers today is tantamount to rejecting God himself.

Leo, who has made care for immigrants and the poor key themes of his early papacy, said Jesus' birth showed God's presence in every person as the pontiff led the world's 1.4 billion Catholics into Christmas at a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.

"On earth, there is no room for God if there is no room for the human person. To refuse one is to refuse the other," said the pope during the solemn service, attended by about 6,000 inside the basilica.

Leo, the first U.S.-born pope, is celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world's cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis .

The pope, who has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump 's divisive immigrant crackdown, quoted a line from the late Pope Benedict XVI lamenting that the world does not care for children, the poor or foreigners.

"While a distorted economy leads us to treat human beings as mere merchandise, God becomes like us, revealing the infinite dignity of every person," said Leo.

"Where there is room for the human person, there is room for God," he said. "Even a stable can become more sacred than a temple."

Outside the basilica, about 5,000 people watched the service on screens from St. Peter's Square, holding umbrellas and wearing ponchos under a hard rain in Rome.

Leo, 70, came outside to greet them before the start of the Mass. "I admire and respect and thank you for your courage and your wanting to be here this evening," he said, "even in this weather."

On Thursday, the pope will celebrate a Christmas Day Mass and deliver a twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message and blessing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OUEQZTNAUFIN3OPKG7BRQ7CWYQ.jpg?auth=d809ba2fc8531377c6bc4712266a2245b8919b26ee9c13102c5cb106bea5076e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Atmospheric river drenches Los Angeles, triggers widespread flooding</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/atmospheric-river-drenches-los-angeles-triggers-widespread-flooding-2025-12-24/</link><description>LOS ANGELES, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Torrential rains drenched Southern California on Wednesday, unleashing widespread flash flooding as authorities urged motorists to stay off roads and residents living downslope of wildfire-scarred foothills and canyons to evacuate.

Downpours measuring an inch (2.54 cm) or more of rain an hour in some areas were spawned by the region's latest atmospheric river storm, a vast airborne current of dense moisture siphoned from the Pacific and swept inland over the greater Los Angeles area.

The Christmas Eve storm was expected to persist into Friday, posing unsafe driving conditions during what would normally be a busy holiday travel period, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.

"Life-threatening" storm conditions were expected to persist through Christmas Day over Southern California, "where widespread flash flooding is underway," the weather service said.

A flash-flood warning was posted across much of Los Angeles County until 6 p.m. PST, urging motorists: "Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area, subject to flooding or under an evacuation order."

Los Angeles city officials urged residents to heed evacuation orders issued for about 130 homes considered especially vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows in areas where last year's wildfires ravaged the community of Pacific Palisades.

Wednesday's heavy rainfall was accompanied by gusty winds that forecasters said were likely to topple trees and power lines. In upper elevations of the Sierra mountains, the storm was expected to dump heavy snow.

NWS meteorologist Ariel Cohen said 4 to 8 inches of rain had fallen in some foothill areas by 9 a.m. PST, and the Los Angeles City News Service reported numerous rockslides in the mountains. Forecasts called for more than a foot (30.48 cm) of rain falling over some lower-terrain mountain areas by week's end.

Forecasters even issued a rare tornado warning for a small portion of east-central Los Angeles County due to heavy thunderstorm activity over the community of Alhambra.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YYZQMU5PURIE5I6CH2HGH4MIBA.jpg?auth=2044f01af404750e8d34b7ad8632b3acf956a42a53ea14fbd804062c8912db94&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four bodies found believed to be from one Liechtenstein family</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/four-bodies-found-believed-be-one-liechtenstein-family-2025-12-24/</link><description>ZURICH, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Police on Wednesday discovered the bodies of two men and two women believed to belong to a single family from Liechtenstein, authorities in the tiny Alpine principality said.

Local police said at around 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT), the body of a 41-year-old man from Liechtenstein was found on the Swiss side of the bank of the Rhine next to Liechtenstein's capital Vaduz. The cause of death was unclear, Swiss police said.

Subsequent investigations led police to an apartment in Vaduz where they discovered the bodies of a 73-year-old man and two women, aged 68 and 45.

According to initial findings, the three were the parents and sister of the 41-year-old man, Liechtenstein police said in a statement. What caused their deaths is still being determined, a spokesperson for Liechtenstein police said.

The state police's criminal investigation department is investigating the deaths with a large deployment of officers.

"The investigation is proceeding in all directions," the police statement said.

The message said "heroic" participation of North Korean soldiers in the war in Russia's western Kursk region "clearly proved the invincible friendship" between the two countries, according to KCNA.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z34O5Z3UBNO5JJCYNKOUAVKK4M.jpg?auth=0c84ab82c58619bbfe751e44a9f10c07e788ee8c9f96e5a73a65c6e95f691c01&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Somalia's capital votes in first step toward restoring universal suffrage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/somalias-capital-votes-first-step-toward-restoring-universal-suffrage-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOGADISHU, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Residents of Somalia's capital Mogadishu will vote on Thursday in municipal elections meant to pave the way for the East African country's first direct national polls in more than half a century.

With the exception of votes in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland and the breakaway region of Somaliland, Somalia last held direct elections in 1969, months before military general, Mohamed Siad Barre, took power in a coup.

After years of civil war that followed Barre's fall in 1991, indirect elections were introduced in 2004. The idea was to promote consensus among rival clans in the face of an Islamist insurgency , although some Somalis say politicians prefer indirect elections because they create opportunities for corruption.

Under the system, clan representatives elect lawmakers, who then choose the president. The president, in turn, has been responsible for appointing Mogadishu's mayor.

The vote in Mogadishu, a city of some 3 million people where security conditions have improved in recent years despite continuing attacks by al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants, is seen as a test run for direct elections at the national level.

Around 1,605 candidates are running on Thursday for 390 posts in Mogadishu's district councils, said Abdishakur Abib Hayir, a member of the National Electoral Commission. Council members will then choose a mayor.

"It shows Somalia is standing on its feet and moving forward," Hayir told Reuters. "After the local election, elections can and will take place in the entire country."

A 2024 law restored universal suffrage ahead of federal elections expected next year. However, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud reached a deal in August with some opposition leaders stipulating that while lawmakers would be directly elected in 2026, the president would still be chosen by parliament.

Opposition parties have argued the rapid introduction of a new electoral system would benefit Mohamud's re-election prospects.

They also question whether the country is safe enough for mass voting given al Shabaab's control over vast areas of the countryside and regular strikes on major population centres.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 04:56:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZIGO6H4I2FKOVOP5SJ7IQRDYXM.jpg?auth=892c16cbe0bf0e6db6dbe34252f29c65532c2fd213748eb21a38b6f82843d0d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Christmas celebrations muted at Bondi as Australians grieve after deadly shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/christmas-celebrations-muted-bondi-australians-grieve-after-deadly-shooting-2025-12-25/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Christmas celebrations were muted at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach on Thursday in the aftermath of a terror attack that killed 15 people there more than a week ago, as the community continued to grapple with the country's deadliest mass shooting in nearly three decades.

Police patrolled across the beachfront in Bondi, a traditional Christmas destination, as hundreds of people, many wearing Santa hats, gathered on the sands.

"I think it's tragic, and I think everybody respects and is very sad for what happened, and I think people here are out on the beach, because it's like a celebration but everybody has got it in their memories and everybody is respectful of what happened," British tourist Mark Conroy told Reuters.

"Everyone is feeling for the family and friends who are going through the worst possible thing you could imagine."

The gun attack on December 14 at a Jewish Hannukah celebration has prompted calls for stricter gun laws and tougher action against antisemitism, while public gathering rules in Sydney have been tightened under new laws passed on Wednesday.

Beachgoers were seen taking photos next to a Christmas tree while some posed with lifeguards, although windy weather conditions appear to thin crowds.

"It's not the best conditions for Christmas Day today, it's a bit choppy. ... so not ideal, but people are still here," Surf Life Saving Patrol Captain Thomas Hough said.

Flags flew at half mast outside the heritage-listed Bondi Pavilion building near the site of the attack , which police say was allegedly carried out by a father and son, inspired by the militant group Islamic State.

In Melbourne, a car with a "Happy Chanukah!" sign was set alight on Christmas Day in the city's southeast, with no injuries reported, Australian media reported.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, facing mounting criticism from opponents who argue his government has not done enough to curb a rise in antisemitism, called the firebombing of the car "just beyond comprehension."

"What sort of evil ideology and thoughts at a time like this would motivate someone?," Albanese told reporters on Thursday.

Since the start of Israel's war in Gaza in October 2023, there have been attacks against synagogues, Jewish buildings and cars in Australia.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:48:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRBRP4J7IBLIFCRFPEOZJWI5BM.jpg?auth=c7da7cbb03d844398c5f5eef42c310ab03349aa935fa9975cd487d6257007332&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China social media thrashes one-child policy after population control czar dies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-social-media-thrashes-one-child-policy-after-population-control-czar-dies-2025-12-25/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 25 (Reuters) - The death of a former head of China's one-child policy has been met not by tributes but by castigation of the abandoned policy on social media this week.

State media praised Peng Peiyun, head of China's Family Planning Commission from 1988 to 1998, as "an outstanding leader" in her work related to women and children.

The reaction on China's social media to Peng's death in Beijing on Sunday, just shy of her 96th birthday, was less positive.

"Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there" in the afterlife, one person posted on China's popular micro-blog Weibo.

China's near-universal mandate of just one child per couple from 1980 through 2015 prompted local officials to compel women to undergo abortions and sterilisations.

Beijing launched the one-child policy as leaders worried about population growth potentially spiralling out of control. But China's population, long the world's highest, later slowed and last year tumbled for the third year in a row.

"If the one-child policy had been implemented for 10 years less, China's population would not have plummeted like this!" a Weibo post said.

After falling behind India's in 2023, China's population declined last year to 1.39 billion. Experts warn the downtrend will accelerate in coming years. Data for 2025 will be released next month.

As population czar, Peng focused her commission's work on the countryside.

In rural China, large families were once seen as a goal for couples looking to ensure that they would be taken care of in their old age. Sons who could carry on the family name were also favoured, leading to unwanted infant girls and even aborted female foetuses.

"Those children, if they were born, would be almost 40 years old, in the prime of their lives," one person posted on Weibo.

By the 2010s, Peng had publicly shifted her views, saying the one-child policy should be eased. Now Beijing is trying to boost the flagging birth rate with childcare subsidies, longer maternity leave and tax benefits.

The shrinking and greying of the population has spurred worries that the world's second-biggest economy will struggle as the number of workers declines. Rising costs from elderly care and retirement benefits will also likely create additional budgetary strains for already indebted local governments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 06:34:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BKRUX7F4BBLZ3DUIXLGHDK5SZQ.jpg?auth=ac6305ac03d49d2f283fe1ed263574565fd6d6bfb5de4d3323b8491ec9eb9c11&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia says Yemen group should withdraw its forces from seized provinces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-says-yemen-group-should-withdraw-its-forces-seized-provinces-2025-12-25/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it remains hopeful that Yemen's main southern separatist group will end an escalation that has given it broad control across the south , deepening uncertainties in a country already divided between two administrations since civil war erupted over a decade ago.

In a foreign ministry statement, the kingdom described the military operations by Yemen's Southern Transitional Council (STC) - through which the group seized the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra earlier this month - as an "unjustified escalation."

"The kingdom remains hopeful that the public interest will prevail through ending the escalation by the Southern Transitional Council and the withdrawal of its forces from the two governorates in an urgent and orderly manner," the statement said.

The UAE-backed STC forces were initially part of the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis. But the STC turned on the government and sought self-rule in the south, including the major port city of Aden where the Saudi-backed administration is headquartered.

A joint Saudi-Emirati military delegation arrived in Aden on December 12 to discuss measures aimed at defusing tensions. Saudi Arabia said the teams were sent to put "the necessary arrangements" to ensure the return of STC forces to their previous positions outside the two provinces.

The kingdom added, however, that these efforts remain in progress to restore the situation to its previous state.

Yemen has been marred by civil war since 2014, through which the Houthis took control of the northern part of the country including the capital, Sanaa, pushing the Saudi-backed government to flee south and headquarter in the port city of Aden.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 06:34:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh leader considered top PM candidate returns from exile ahead of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-leader-considered-top-pm-candidate-returns-exile-ahead-polls-2025-12-25/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting Chairman Tarique Rahman returned from nearly 17 years in exile on Thursday, a homecoming the party hopes will energise supporters with Rahman poised to be the top contender for prime minister in February.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters lined the route from Dhaka’s airport to the reception venue, waving party flags and carrying placards, banners and flowers, while chanting slogans welcoming Rahman, as senior BNP leaders received him at the airport under tight security.

Rahman, 60, the son of ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has lived in London since 2008 and led the BNP as acting chairman since 2018.

Dressed in a light grey, finely checkered blazer over a crisp white shirt, Rahman exited the airport, removed his shoes to step barefoot onto Bangladeshi soil, and picked up a handful of earth in a symbolic gesture marking his return to the South Asian nation.

He was seen standing beside the driver’s seat in a bus taking him to the reception venue, smiling and waving as crowds surged to catch a glimpse of their returning leader.

He had been unable to return while facing multiple criminal cases at home. Rahman was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The rulings were overturned after Hasina was ousted last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to his return.

His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception venue before visiting his mother.

The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasina’s removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda largely alternated in office. A December survey by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race.

Hasina's Awami League party, which has been barred from the February 12 election, has threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote.

Bangladesh is heading into the polls under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. While authorities have pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman’s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:23:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZVVK7HB2BVNZZNTEQBLB2NW2XQ.jpg?auth=c2c6d1a76057ec0a9de023b4e0639c5f163b8e15e86c81dcb729becb1e4bfd84&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia-ally Touadera seeks third term in Central African Republic</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/russia-ally-touadera-seeks-third-term-central-african-republic-2025-12-25/</link><description>BANGUI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera is seeking a third term in an election on Sunday, campaigning on security gains after signing deals with rebel groups and enlisting support from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan forces.

He faces six opposition candidates including Anicet-Georges Dologuele, a former prime minister and runner-up in the 2020 election, but is likely to win in part due to his control over state institutions, analysts say.

Such a result would likely further the interests of Russia, which has traded security assistance for access to resources including gold and diamonds. Touadera is also offering access to the country's lithium and uranium reserves to anyone interested.

The 68-year-old mathematician took power in 2016 after the worst crisis in the chronically unstable country's history, when three years of intercommunal strife forced a fifth of the population to flee their homes, either internally or abroad.

Touadera has signed peace deals this year with several rebel groups, while others have been weakened in the face of Russian mercenaries and troops from Rwanda deployed to shore up Touadera's government as well as U.N. peacekeepers.

"During the 10 years that we have been working together, you yourselves have seen that peace is beginning to return, starting from all our borders and reaching the capital," Touadera told a rally at a stadium in the capital Bangui this month.

His opponents , meanwhile, have denounced a constitutional referendum in 2023 that scrapped the presidential term limit, saying it was proof Touadera wants to be president for life.

They have also accused him of failing to make significant progress towards lifting the 5.5 million population out of poverty.

"The administrative infrastructure has been destroyed and, as you know, the roads are in a very poor state of repair," Dologuele told a recent press conference.

"In short, the Central African economy is in ruins."

The presidential contest is taking place alongside legislative, regional and municipal elections, with provisional results expected to be announced by January 5.

If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, a presidential runoff will take place on February 15, while legislative runoffs will take place on April 5.

A smooth voting process could reinforce Touadera's claim that stability is returning, which was buttressed last year with the U.N. Security Council's lifting of an arms embargo and the lifting of a separate embargo on diamond exports.

"The fact that these measures were lifted, it shows that we're gradually getting back to normal. Or at least that's the narrative," said Romain Esmenjaud, associate researcher at the Institut Francais de Geopolitique.

The peace deals are credited with a decline in violence in some areas and an expected boost in economic growth projections to 3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has said the U.N. should hand security back to the government soon.

But serious security threats remain. Rebels have not fully disarmed, reintegration is incomplete, and incursions by combatants from neighbouring Sudan fuel insecurity in the east.

Pangea-Risk, a consultancy, wrote in a note to clients that the risk of unrest after the election was high as opponents were likely to challenge Touadera's expected victory.

"The election will take place in an atmosphere marked by heightened grievances over political marginalization, increasing repression, and allegations of electoral fraud," said chief executive Robert Besseling.

Dologuele alleged fraud after he was recorded as winning 21.6% of the vote in 2020, when rebel groups still threatened the capital and prevented voting at 800 polling stations across the country, or 14% of the total. A court upheld Touadera's win.

Paul-Crescent Beninga, a political analyst, said voters will be closely scrutinising the voting and counting processes.

"If they do not go well, it gives those who promote violence an excuse to mobilise violence and sow panic among the population of the Central African Republic. So that is why we must ensure that the elections take place in relatively acceptable conditions," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:23:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CEQT5QLT2BLFFEUTM2AXC2BILU.jpg?auth=3677d7c713068f5455e0b677e2e1c92523c7ef56e7c9ee5810c65783fb6b78cf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Helicopter crash on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro kills five, aviation authority says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/helicopter-crash-tanzanias-mount-kilimanjaro-kills-five-aviation-authority-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>DAR ES SALAAM, Dec 25 (Reuters) - A helicopter crashed on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro, killing five people, the civil aviation authority said on Thursday, while local media reported that the aircraft was on a medical rescue mission.

The helicopter crashed near the mountain's Barafu Camp on Wednesday, Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement.

Mwananchi newspaper and East Africa TV, citing Kilimanjaro region's head of police, Simon Maigwa, reported that the helicopter was on a medical rescue mission.

Among the dead were a guide, a doctor, the pilot and two foreign tourists, Mwananchi cited Maigwa as saying, without giving the tourists' nationalities.

Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, is nearly 6,000 meters (20,000 ft) above sea level.

The crash happened between 4670 and 4700 metres, Mwananchi reported.

No group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which comes amid heightened security concerns in Nigeria’s northeast, where Islamist insurgents Boko Haram and its ISWAP faction have waged a 15-year campaign of violence targeting civilians, mosques, and markets.

The blast at the Al-Adum mosque occurred around 6 p.m. local time as congregants gathered for evening worship. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as victims were rushed to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and the State Specialist Hospital.

“Nobody knows what happened. It was during prayers that the bomb exploded. Allah has destined that this will happen but nobody can give details of how it happened,” said Masta Dalori, a market leader.

Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum condemned the attack, calling it “utterly condemnable, barbaric and inhumane”. In a statement, he urged heightened vigilance in places of worship and public spaces during the festive season.

“Attacking a place of worship is a desecration of its sanctity at a time when Muslim faithful are performing acts of worship,” he said, offering condolences to families of the dead and prayers for the injured.

Police confirmed the casualty figures and said bomb disposal teams had cordoned off the area. “Ongoing sweeping operations by police EOD are in progress,” said Kenneth Daso, spokesperson for Borno State Command.

He added that investigations were underway and advised residents to remain calm and vigilant.

Last August, gunmen attacked a mosque and nearby homes in northwest Katsina State killing at least 50, according to local officials and residents.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:24:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XSXZUZAFJVNCROHLDI7GPM2VMY.jpg?auth=f85aa88ca83d523f53960a2b877efdc9f77ee3f10484fe65cfbf74fc95db148a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo to renew call for peace during first Christmas blessing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-pope-leo-to-renew-call-for-peace-during-first-urbi-et-orbi-christmas-blessing</link><description>Pope Leo XIV is expected to renew his calls for peace Thursday when he delivers his first Christmas blessing from St Peter's Basilica at the end of a year overshadowed by conflict, but also marked by hopes for peace in Gaza.

In Bethlehem, the Christian community celebrated its first festive Christmas in more than two years as the occupied West Bank city emerged from the shadow of the war in Gaza .

However, the Pope's call this week for a one-day global truce went unheeded in Ukraine , where fighting continued, as the pontiff prepared to deliver his "Urbi et Orbi" blessing at 12:00 – during which popes usually speak about conflicts around the world and urge peace .

Before the address, the Pope celebrated his first Christmas Mass Wednesday evening where he described the celebration as a feast of "faith, charity and hope".

He also spoke in front of St Peter's Basilica to offer Christmas wishes and thank those who had come to follow the mass on outdoor screens despite rainy weather.

"St Peter's is very large but unfortunately it is not large enough to receive all of you," he told the crowd of around 5,000 people.

Leo will also hold another mass on Christmas Day, renewing a tradition from the times of late pope John Paul II (1978-2005).

Hundreds of worshippers also gathered for mass at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem Wednesday night as the Palestinian city ushered in its first festive Christmas during the Gaza war.

Throughout the conflict that began with Hamas 's attack on Israel in October 2023, a sombre tone had marked Christmases in the biblical birthplace of Jesus Christ.

But celebrations returned Wednesday with parades and music in the West Bank city, as a fragile truce held in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face winter in makeshift tents.

With pews of the Church of the Nativity filled long before midnight, many stood or sat on the floor for the traditional mass to usher in Christmas Day.

At 11:15 pm organ music rang out as a procession of dozens of clergymen entered, followed by Jerusalem 's Latin Patriarch, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, who blessed the crowd with signs of the cross.

In his homily, Pizzaballa urged peace, hope and rebirth, saying the Nativity story still held relevance in the turbulence of modern times.

He also spoke of his visit to Gaza over the weekend, where he said "suffering is still present" despite the ceasefire .

"The wounds are deep, yet I have to say, here too, there too, their proclamation of Christmas resounds," he said. "When I met them, I was struck by their strength and desire to start over."

Hundreds took part in the parade down Bethlehem's narrow Star Street on Wednesday, while a dense crowd massed in the square.

"Today is full of joy because we haven't been able to celebrate because of the war," said Milagros Anstas, 17.

Men dressed as Santa Claus sold toffee apples and toys as families took photographs in front of a nativity scene framed by a giant star.

As darkness fell, multi-coloured lights shone over Manger Square and a towering Christmas tree glittered next to the Church of the Nativity.

The basilica dates back to the fourth century and was built on top of a grotto where Christians believe Jesus was born more than 2,000 years ago.

Bethlehem residents hoped the return of Christmas festivities would breathe life back into the city.

"We need to get the message to the whole world and this is the only way," said George Hanna, from the neighbouring town of Beit Jala.

In Syria , Christmas lights illuminated Damascus's Old City despite the Christian community's fears of violence after a deadly attack in June.

Around the district, home to several important churches, red baubles hung from trees, shopkeepers put up Christmas decorations and street vendors peddled warm chestnuts.

"Syria deserves joy and for us to be happy, and to hope for a new future," said student Loris Aasaf, 20.

In stark contrast to the messages of religious leaders, US President Donald Trump wished a Merry Christmas "to everyone, including the radical left-wing scum", referring to Democrats.

North Korea and Russia have drawn closer since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, and Pyongyang has sent troops to fight for Russia.

In return, Russia is sending North Korea financial aid, military technology and food and energy supplies, analysts say.

The "heroic" efforts of North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk region "clearly proved the invincible friendship" between Moscow and Pyongyang, Putin said in a message to Kim, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Two ‍oil ​product tanks ⁠caught fire at the ​southern ‍Russian port ​of Temryuk after what regional ​authorities in the Krasnodar region said was a Ukrainian drone ‍attack.

Flames covered ​an area of about 2,000 square ‌metres, authorities at the ‍Krasnodar operational headquarters said on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian nuclear-capable bombers conducted a "scheduled" flight over the Norwegian and Barents Seas, prompting "fighter jets of foreign countries" to escort them, Russia's Defence Ministry said, according to Russian news agencies.

Neither the date of the Tu-95 flights nor the countries that deployed monitoring aircraft were specified.

"Russian Tu-95MS strategic bombers and missile carriers carried out a scheduled flight over the neutral waters of the Barents and Norwegian Seas," the ministry said, referring to bodies of water north of Scandinavia and northwest of Russia.

"At certain stages of the route, long-range bombers were escorted by fighter jets of foreign countries," it added.

Foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian was responding to a question at a press briefing on whether China might exploit a recent easing of tensions with India over disputed border areas to keep ties between the United States and India from deepening.

China views its ties with India from a strategic and long-term perspective, Lin said, adding that the border issue was a matter between China and India and "we object to any country passing judgment about this issue".

The Pentagon said in a report on Tuesday that China "probably seeks to capitalize on decreased tension ... to stabilize bilateral relations and prevent the deepening of U.S.-India ties".</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 08:29:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3I42MQ6O2FLM5F5J2GHX2K3JL4.jpg?auth=d6feaa07beb68428049845e3afd1d8af8a61bccc987504ca79202323ad2e4ef7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In first Christmas sermon, Pope Leo decries conditions for Palestinians in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/first-christmas-sermon-pope-leo-decries-conditions-palestinians-gaza-2025-12-25/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Pope Leo decried conditions for Palestinians in Gaza in his Christmas sermon on Thursday, in an unusually direct appeal during what is normally a solemn, spiritual service on the day Christians across the globe celebrate the birth of Jesus.

Leo, the first U.S. pope , said the story of Jesus being born in a stable showed that God had "pitched his fragile tent" among the people of the world.

"How, then, can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?" he asked.

Leo, celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world's cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis , has a more quiet, diplomatic style than his predecessor and usually refrains from making political references in his sermons.

But the new pope has also lamented the conditions for Palestinians in Gaza several times recently and told journalists last month that the only solution in the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people must include a Palestinian state.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of intense bombardment and military operations , but humanitarian agencies say there is still too little aid getting into Gaza, where nearly the entire population is homeless .

In Thursday's service with thousands in St. Peter's Basilica, Leo also lamented conditions for the homeless across the globe and the destruction caused by the wars roiling the world.

"Fragile is the flesh of defenseless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds," said the pope.

"Fragile are the minds and lives of young people forced to take up arms, who on the front lines feel the senselessness of what is asked of them and the falsehoods that fill the pompous speeches of those who send them to their deaths," he said.

Later on Thursday the pope will deliver a twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message and blessing, which usually addresses global conflicts.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:23:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MK3CJZ73W5ISDMQX3B42WM33XI.jpg?auth=77baa33446795703f800f4db5a078b0c67fc6d5a88230a7cf2a63f39e6610723&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drones hit oil and gas facilities in Russia, SBU official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drones-hit-oil-gas-facilities-russia-sbu-official-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>Ukrainian long-range drones hit oil product tanks in the Russian port of Temryuk and a gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg, an official at the SBU security service told Reuters on Thursday.

A tradition dating back to the ​Cold War era of 1955, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) tracks Santa's overnight journey around the world, starting from his home base at the North Pole.

NORAD, a joint US-Canadian military command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, has provided images and updates on Santa's worldwide journey for seven decades, along with its main task of monitoring air defenses and issuing aerospace and maritime warnings.

But the details of Santa's mission are known only to him.

"NORAD tracks Santa, but only Santa knows his route, which means we cannot predict where or when he will arrive at your house," a senior NORAD official said in a press statement.

The Santa tracker tradition originated from a ‍1955 misprint in a Colorado Springs newspaper, which attempted to print the telephone number of a department store that children could call to speak with Santa. But the printed number went ​instead to what was then known as Continental Air Defense Command.

An understanding officer took the children's calls and assured them that Santa was airborne and on schedule to deliver presents to good girls and boys, flying aboard his reindeer-powered sleigh.

According to its website , NORAD detects Santa's liftoff with its polar radar network, then follows his journey with the same satellites used to warn of ‍any possible missile launches aimed at North America. As soon as Santa's lead reindeer, Rudolph, switches on his shiny red nose, military personnel can zero in on his location using the satellites' infrared sensors.

US President Donald Trump appeared to be following NORAD's Santa tracker on Wednesday as he sat by a Christmas tree at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida , fielding telephone calls from children around the country. As he spoke to one youngster from Pennsylvania, Trump said, "So Santa right now is in Copenhagen , Denmark , but he's heading toward our country. ‍What would you like from Santa?"

Speaking to another caller, Trump jokingly explained the rationale for tracking Santa in terms of national security, saying, "We want ‌to make sure he's ​not infiltrated, that we're not infiltrating into our country a bad Santa."</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:25:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/514c6c84-e175-11f0-bf80-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/NORAD2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia made a proposal to France on jailed French researcher Vinatier, the Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-made-proposal-france-jailed-french-researcher-vinatier-kremlin-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russia had made a proposal to France regarding Laurent Vinatier, a French researcher jailed for violating Russia's foreign agent laws, and the ball is now in Paris's court, the Kremlin said on Thursday.

Vinatier was sentenced in 2024 to three years in jail for failing to comply with laws requiring individuals deemed "foreign agents" to register and meet a number of stipulations. He is now facing additional espionage charges.

France has said Vinatier was arbitrarily detained and has called for his release. President Emmanuel Macron has denied that Vinatier worked for the French state and has described his arrest as part of a misinformation campaign by Moscow.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that there had been contacts with France on the issue.

"There were indeed relevant contacts between us and the French," Peskov told reporters. "Indeed, an offer was made to the French about this. The ball is in France's court right now."

Countries on NATO's eastern flank have been on high alert for potential airspace incursions since September when three Russian military jets violated Estonia's airspace for 12 minutes just days after more than 20 Russian drones had entered Polish airspace.

"This morning, over the international waters of the Baltic Sea, Polish fighter jets intercepted, visually identified, and escorted from their area of ​​responsibility a Russian reconnaissance aircraft flying near the borders of Polish airspace," the army said.

It also said that at night, objects were observed entering Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus.

"After detailed analysis, it was determined that these were most likely smuggling balloons, moving in accordance with the wind direction and speed," the army said. It added that part of the airspace over northeast Poland's Podlaskie region, which borders Belarus, was temporarily closed to civilian traffic to ensure security.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:20:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Christmas traditions: festivities that continue well into the New Year</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-french-christmas-traditions-festivities-continue-well-into-new-year</link><description>The Christmas season is a time when the French set aside their treasured notions of being a staunchly secular country to revel in holiday traditions, many of them rooted in the religious practices of ancient Rome and continuing into the early part of the year.

Although France shares many Christmas traditions with its European neighbours, others are quintessentially French – like oysters on ice, the bûche de Noël (Christmas log cake) and a decided emphasis on Champagne.

As in countries across Europe, Christmas markets often spring up in France starting in November, with many continuing through the first week of January. Kiosks resembling wooden Swiss chalets sell mulled wine, gingerbread ( pain d’épice ) and various gifts and crafts, continuing a tradition dating from the Middle Ages.

Paris hosts an array of Christmas markets in a typical year with additional "pop-up" markets appearing for just a day or a weekend. Among the most well known of the annual markets are the Villages de Noël near the Eiffel Tower and the largest one at the Tuileries Garden , as well as those at Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) in the Marais, Notre-Dame in the city centre and in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

In the Alsace region bordering Germany , Strasbourg proclaims itself the " Capital of Christmas ". The city is known for its Christmas market, which is the oldest in France (dating from 1570) and one of the oldest in Europe.

Every year, a 30-metre-tall Christmas tree is brought to Place Kléber and decorated with ornaments and lights while merchants and craftsmen offer their wares at the some 300 wooden chalets dotted all over the city centre. For most of December, Strasbourg becomes one of the most illuminated cities in France.

The first day of Advent on December 1 marks the official countdown to Christmas in many Christian traditions. French supermarkets and other stores invariably carry advent calendars ( calendriers de l'avent ) – box calendars with a folding door for each day leading up to Christmas that reveals a chocolate or small trinket when opened.

Advent wreaths (c ouronnes de l’Avent ) may also make an appearance around this time, often adorned with pine cones, bows and four candles. Traditionally, one candle will be lit on each Sunday leading up to Christmas.

In parts of northeastern France and beyond, Père Fouettard is a frightening figure designed to scare children into being well-behaved – traditionally his role is to punish the naughty while Santa Claus rewards the nice. With his black beard, shaggy hair and soot-smeared face, Père Fouettard whips misbehaved children on December 6, the day of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children.

Those who have not been good over the past year may also find their long-awaited Christmas gifts consist of coal, beets or onions, all thanks to Père Fouettard.

Meanwhile, well-behaved children are given chocolate and other sweets on the day of Saint Nicholas.

Gradually, the December 6 tradition has disappeared in most French regions and the ritual giving of chocolate and gingerbread has been incorporated into Christmas.

Papillotes are small gifts of chocolate, wrapped with a little note inside decorative paper with fringed ends. They are thought to have been invented around 1790 by a young apprentice chocolatier in Lyon who fell in love with a girl from the neighbourhood and sent her chocolates wrapped in love notes. When the master chocolatier, Monsieur Papillot, discovered these unique gifts he decided to manufacture and market them, and the papillote en chocolat was born.

Today, the candies often come wrapped in gold foil along with little holiday messages or proverbs and are popular in France around Christmas as well as New Year 's.

Adorning many a Christmas crèche in the southern Provence region are handmade and painted ceramic figurines known as santons , from the Provençal term " santoun " (for little saint).

While Joseph, Mary and Jesus are represented in many a manger scene, the santons often depict a whole village, including craftsmen, farmers and the local baker. An iconic figure among the santons is the Ravi, a man depicted with outstretched arms who is openly marvelling at the miracle of the nativity.

Another Provençale tradition is that of the 13 desserts, which are said to symbolise Christ and the 12 apostles. An array of 13 offerings – including dried fruits, nuts, nougat, marzipan candies and an olive oil cake called Pompe à l’huile – are laid out in the week before Christmas so that holiday visitors will have something to nibble on. Tradition holds that partaking of each of the 13 treats will bring good luck in the coming year.

Christmas would not be complete without a sumptuous feast, and in France that meal is known as the Réveillon de Noël (from réveiller , to rouse or awaken) and often takes place on December 24. The table may be decorated with an Advent wreath and candles, and some advise knotting the ends of the tablecloth so the Devil can't get under the table.

In the Middle Ages, midnight Mass was preceded by a meagre meal; it was customary to eat only a little bread, fish or vegetable broth and drink a glass of water. Christmas dinner was the big traditional meal served to worshippers on December 25 after a long nighttime church service. Though fewer people these days attend midnight Mass, the tradition of a big Christmas Eve or Christmas Day meal has survived.

Throughout December, supermarket shelves are laden with cans and jars of foie gras , a French specialty of fattened duck or goose liver, often served as a starter on warm toast with some jam, often onion or fig.

Though many have stopped eating foie gras because of the way the birds’ livers are artificially fattened through gavage , or force-feeding, it remains one of the most popular food items for a French Christmas meal, and France today remains its largest producer by far.

Literally translated as “fat liver”, foie gras originated in ancient Egypt before it spread throughout the Mediterranean and was adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans. Later, in the Middle Ages, the tradition of gavage was continued by the Jewish population, since goose meat was viewed as a good source of nutrition and its cooking fat conformed to Jewish dietary laws.

The popularity of foie gras grew during the Renaissance, when it became associated with the kings of France. The term “ foyes gras ” was coined during the reign of Louis XIV and it was served at royal banquets under Louis XV, but it was Louis XVI who declared it the “ dish of kings ".

Foie gras is also often served pan-roasted, or sliced over a cut of meat, or as a sauce. It is produced in winter, and its high price makes it a luxurious holiday product that is perfect for year-end festivities.

For those who do not eat foie gras , other common starters at a French Christmas or New Year’s dinner are smoked salmon, scallops ( coquilles Saint-Jacques ), shrimp or oysters.

The French are among the largest consumers of oysters in the world, with more than 85,000 tonnes of oysters served each year, a large portion of which is enjoyed at the Christmas dinner table.

Oysters are easy to find in France, with its long coastline, and are relatively healthy for a holiday dish. They are most often served fresh on shaved ice alongside a red wine and shallot vinaigrette (sometimes known as a mignonette ) or simply a wedge of lemon.

It is customary to eat oysters only during months that have an "r" in their names – September through April. This is not only because they taste best during this period but due to habit – long before refrigerated transportation methods were invented, oysters could only be shipped inland from the sea during the cold winter months if they were to stay fresh and not spoil before being served. Salmon, lobster, crayfish and other seafood are also traditionally eaten in winter for the same reason.

Much like in the United States or Great Britain, a staple of French Christmas dinner is the stuffed turkey, or the dinde de Noël .

Before the turkey arrived in Europe from the Americas in the 17th century, the French ate stuffed goose. But the turkey has mostly replaced the goose as the holiday bird of choice because it is less expensive, yet larger and meatier than chicken and thus fit for a feast.

A smaller, succulent fowl that is very popular in France during the winter holidays is the capon ( chapon ), a cockerel that was neutered to render its meat fattier and usually weighing 3-4 kilos, or the even smaller guinea fowl ( pintade ).

Whatever bird is chosen, it is generally roasted and served with a special Christmas stuffing that traditionally includes chestnuts and often mushrooms.

Other holiday main dishes in France include roasted meats such as lamb or beef and also game, such as wild boar, venison or pheasant, which are not often eaten year-round by French people who are not hunters.

No Christmas in France is complete without a bûche de Noël , otherwise known as the Yule log cake. The bûche is an elaborate creation made of a rolled sponge cake filled with cream and frosted to look like tree bark or a log.

It is a reminder of an earlier tradition, dating back to the Iron Age, when people in Europe would gather to welcome the winter solstice on December 21, the longest night of the year. Families would burn large logs, usually from fruit trees, anointed with wine and salt and decorated with pine cones, holly or ivy. The log kept the house warm, and its ashes were said to have medicinal benefits and to guard against evil.

After a meal of stuffed goose, capon or other roasted meat – not to mention Champagne , good wine and a wide variety of rich desserts and chocolates – it’s not surprising that the French speak of a crise de foie (“liver crisis,” also known as indigestion) at the end of the holiday season.

But a little crise de foie is a small price to pay for a festive meal with family and friends to ward off the winter chill.

While the main event may be over as the year draws to a close, the festivities do not yet stop in France, which carries the holiday season into February.

Les Étrennes is a New Year’s Eve tradition of gift-giving dating back to Roman times, when offerings typically included honey, dates or money as well as laurel leaves or branches. Today in France the day is marked by offering an envelope of money and sometimes a card to those who do work for you all year round, notably garbage collectors, firefighters, mailmen and your building's concierge or gardien(ne) .

Much of France marks Épiphanie on January 6 with a galette des rois (king cake) – a flaky, puffed cake layered with frangipane, a sweet almond paste. The cake has a ceramic bauble (the fève , or bean) baked inside. Whoever receives the slice with the fève becomes king or queen for the day and is given a gold paper crown, sold with the cake.

When the cake is served, the youngest person present traditionally crawls under the table to blindly select who will receive the next slice.

Christian legend holds that Epiphany, or Three Kings' Day, is when the three wise men arrived in Bethlehem. But the tradition of the fève dates from Roman celebrations of Saturnalia in late December and early January, when slaves would dine with the rest of the household. If a slave received the fève they could have anything they wanted for the day.

The Chandeleur is celebrated on February 2 to mark 40 days after Christmas. Known by the Christians as Candlemas, it is another tradition that can be traced back to Celtic and Roman pagans, who celebrated that the days were getting longer around this time.

Today in France it is when Christmas nativity scenes are often taken down and a day for eating crêpes that are round and golden like the sun, to herald the return to longer days. Holding a coin in your left hand while successfully flipping a crêpe with your right is thought to bring prosperity.

Forecasters said Southern California could see its wettest Christmas in years and warned of flash flooding and mudslides. Areas scorched by wildfires in January saw evacuation warnings as heavy rains and gusty winds brought mudslides and debris flows.

Many flood areas were in burn scar zones, which were stripped of vegetation by fire and are less able to absorb water.

San Bernardino County firefighters said they rescued people trapped in cars Wednesday when mud and debris rushed down a road leading into Wrightwood, a resort town in the San Gabriel Mountains about 80 miles (130 kilometres) northeast of Los Angeles. It was not immediately clear how many were rescued.

Firefighters also went door to door to check homes, and the area was under a shelter-in-place order, officials said. An evacuation order was issued for Lytle Creek, also in the San Gabriel Mountains.

Travis Guenther and his family were trapped in Lytle Creek after roaring waters washed out the only bridge in or out of their neighbourhood. More than a dozen neighbours took shelter at a community centre or found hotel rooms.

“Everybody that left to go to work this morning is stuck,” he said. “Half the families are here, and half the families are on the other side of the creek.”

Guenther said he had plenty of supplies and was coordinating with other in the community of about 280 people. Two nurses who live on his street offered to help anyone who may need medical attention.

Janice Quick, president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce and a resident of the mountain town for 45 years, said a wildfire in 2024 left much of the terrain without tree coverage.

The storm also stranded Dillan Brown, his wife and 14-month-old daughter at a rented cabin in Wrightwood with almost no food and only enough diapers for about another day. Roads leading off the mountain and to a grocery store became blocked by rocks and debris, Brown said.

A resident learned of his situation and posted a call for help in a Facebook group. In less than an hour, neighbours showed up with more than enough supplies to ride out the storm, including bread, vegetables, milk, diapers and wipes.

“I think we’re a little sad and upset that we’re not going to be home with our families,” Brown said, but the “kindness shown is definitely an overwhelming feeling.”

Residents around burn scar zones from the Airport Fire in Orange County were also ordered to evacuate.

Areas along the coast including Malibu were under flood warnings until Wednesday evening, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Several roads including a part of Interstate 5 near the Burbank Airport closed due to flooding.

The storms were the result of multiple atmospheric rivers carrying massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.

Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimetres) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimetres) with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said.

Heavy snow and gusts created “near white-out conditions” in parts of the Sierra Nevada and made mountain pass trave treacherous. Officials said there was a “considerable” avalanche risk around Lake Tahoe, and a winter storm warning was in effect until Friday morning.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in six counties to allow state assistance in storm response.

The state deployed emergency resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.

The California Highway Patrol reported a seemingly weather-related crash south of Sacramento in which a Sacramento sheriff's deputy died. James Caravallo, who was with the agency for 19 years, was apparently traveling at an unsafe speed, lost control on a wet road and crashed into a power pole, CHP Officer Michael Harper said via email.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:21:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5836f150-e179-11f0-8958-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25359158594505.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia is analysing US documents on Ukraine peace deal, Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-is-analysing-us-documents-ukraine-peace-deal-kremlin-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Kremlin is analysing the documents on ending the war in Ukraine which were brought to Moscow by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev from the United States, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:41:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z6NCRVZ3MBNUZFOOX4LKC37PUI.jpg?auth=2d15cc2e61e9c2fcf982cbf52a1a2a5fa5a0b1b99d409ba3aafac5e2705f86f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Christmas festivities from across the world</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251225-in-pictures-christmas-festivities-from-across-world</link><description>To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

"There were appropriate contacts between our side and the French. Indeed, a proposal was made to the French regarding Vinatier," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters without providing details.

"The ball is now in France 's court," he added.

Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict mediation NGO and was jailed in June 2024, is serving a three-year sentence for failing to register as a "foreign agent" but faces fresh allegations of spying.

Vinatier's family have rejected the accusations against him, saying he is a victim of tensions between Moscow and Paris over the war in Ukraine .

President Vladimir Putin said last week he would look into the case after a French journalist asked him about it during an end-of-year televised press conference.

"I don't know anything about this case. This is the first I've heard of it," Putin said.

"But I promise you I'll definitely find out what it is. And if there's even the slightest chance of resolving this matter favourably, if Russian law allows it, we'll make every effort," Putin said.

Vinatier is one of several Westerners to have been arrested after Putin launched an all-out offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.

Several US citizens have been arrested and then released in prisoner exchanges brokered by both US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden .

In court hearings on his original case, Vinatier, a veteran Russia expert, said he had not known he was required to register with the authorities under Moscow's "foreign agents" law, which is widely used to target and sideline critics of the Kremlin.

He apologised and said through his work he had always tried to represent Russia's interests in international relations.

Moscow has used alleged breaches of the "foreign agents" law to arrest people before hitting them with more serious charges – as happened to Vinatier.

His family remains “cautiously hopeful” but hopes he will be "released during the holidays” between now and Orthodox Christmas on January 7, his lawyer Frédéric Belot said.

“We have every confidence in French diplomacy, which is doing its utmost,” Belot continued, hoping that Vinatier's fate will be discussed during talks between Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e28dd1b0-e17f-11f0-8a4b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24288449590640.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Daughters of King Charles' brother Andrew join royals for Christmas service</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/daughters-king-charles-brother-andrew-join-royals-christmas-service-2025-12-25/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Britain's Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie attended the royal family's traditional Christmas Day church service on Thursday, while their father Andrew, recently stripped of his titles over ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was absent.

King Charles and Queen Camilla led senior royals to a church in Sandringham in eastern England, about 110 miles (175 km) northeast of London, greeting well-wishers in crisp winter weather.

Charles and Camilla walked ahead while the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, and their three children, followed.

Other family members included Princess Anne and her husband Tim Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh with their children, as well as the king's niece Zara and her husband Mike Tindall.

Now known only as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the king's younger brother has faced mounting pressure over his links to Epstein.

In October, Charles stripped him of all titles, including Duke of York and prince, and ordered him to vacate his Windsor home and move to private accommodation on the Sandringham estate, which has been the royal family's traditional venue for their Christmas Day service since 1988.

Buckingham Palace had said the steps taken against Andrew were necessary to protect the monarchy's reputation, adding that the king's thoughts and sympathies were with victims of abuse.

Andrew has denied allegations that he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre, an American woman who said she was trafficked by the late financier Epstein and forced to have sex with Andrew as a teenager - a claim Andrew settled in a U.S. civil lawsuit in 2022 without admitting liability.

The attendance of his daughters Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, underscores their continuing presence at family events despite the controversy surrounding their father.

The royals are expected to return to Sandringham House for lunch before the king's televised Christmas message later in the day.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:32:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MTUVMLU445PTTFGPZ7HPGU4ZO4.jpg?auth=81158f61344cf189c14a9c173274a10264e448f2ab7943443b8ce9a2a03988ce&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia compares US blockade of Venezuela to piracy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-compares-us-blockade-venezuela-piracy-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that the United States was reviving piracy and banditry in the Caribbean Sea by blockading Venezuela and said it hoped that U.S. President Donald Trump's pragmatism would help avoid a disaster.

"Today we are witnessing complete lawlessness in the Caribbean Sea, where long-forgotten theft of other people's property, namely piracy, and banditry, are being revived," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said of the situation.

"We consistently advocate for a de-escalation," Zakharova said. "We hope that the pragmatism and rationality of US President Trump will allow solutions to be found that are mutually acceptable to the parties within the framework of international legal norms."

"We confirm our support for the efforts of the government of Nicolas Maduro aimed at protecting sovereignty and national interests, and maintaining the stable and secure development of his country," she said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:34:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VD7NSDSMUBK7FCTGBVMSJH567U.jpg?auth=ea3e69418456b5bfe04fe70272d28e27d620150b9920a19a0287a6c390ed05c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro endorses son for presidency before more surgery</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-endorses-son-presidency-before-more-surgery-2025-12-25/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro endorsed his son's 2026 presidential campaign on Thursday while out of jail for more surgery that has dogged him since a stabbing seven years ago.

Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, 44, has said he wants to consolidate his father's conservative legacy at the October 4 vote where he will try to unseat leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

"With the commitment of not allowing the popular will to be silenced, I make the decision to nominate Flavio Bolsonaro as a pre-candidate for the presidency in 2026," Jair Bolsonaro said in a letter read out by Flavio in front of a hospital in the city of Brasilia where his father was being treated.

He was undergoing scheduled treatment for a hernia, his wife Michelle Bolsonaro said on social media.

Jair Bolsonaro, 70, has a history of hospitalizations and surgeries related to a stabbing he suffered while campaigning in 2018, including a 12-hour procedure for recurring intestinal issues in April this year.

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorized Bolsonaro to leave prison , where he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup, for the surgery.

But police were ordered to stay outside his room where computers and mobile phones were prohibited.

Deemed a flight risk following his conviction, the ex-president was detained in late November and began serving his 27-year sentence three days later.

News of the younger Bolsonaro's presidential candidacy this month rattled financial markets. Investors had bet the ex-president would back a more seasoned candidate such as Sao Paulo Governor Tarcisio de Freitas, his former infrastructure minister.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 14:21:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TINNE5BYCRI3JEXZ64WSAULC6U.jpg?auth=2aec62cb301630369fe93c9d57fae53ab63a44a3e745fd98ceaec9a18b73d5a1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia sees slow but steady progress in Ukraine peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-sees-slow-steady-progress-ukraine-peace-talks-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russia sees slow but steady progress in peace talks with the United States on Ukraine, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday.

"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong," Charles, 77, said in his fourth annual broadcast since becoming monarch.

"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life."

Charles spoke of "journeying" and the importance of showing kindness to people on the move - themes that resonate at a time of intense public concern over migration around the world.

His message, delivered from Westminster Abbey where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066, came at the end of a year marked by tensions in the royal family.

The king's words were followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir, wearing traditional Ukrainian "vyshyvanka" embroidered shirts, and the London-based Royal Opera Chorus.

Charles has frequently expressed his support for Ukraine and has hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at Windsor Castle three times in 2025 alone, most recently in October .

Although constitutionally required to remain above politics, the king has repeatedly spoken out on global crises, voicing concern over the Israel–Gaza conflict and expressing sorrow after violence against Jewish communities including an attack at a synagogue in northern England in October and Sydney's Bondi Beach shooting this month.

In his Christmas Day broadcast - a tradition dating back to 1932 - Charles praised military veterans and aid workers for their courage in adversity, saying they gave him hope.

In an address rich in references to the Biblical Christmas story, he also recalled his state visit to the Vatican in October, where he and Pope Leo prayed together in the first joint worship by a British monarch and a Catholic pontiff since England broke away from Rome in 1534. The British monarch is supreme governor of the Church of England.

Nearly two years after revealing an unspecified cancer diagnosis, Charles said this month that his treatment could be scaled back in the new year.

His daughter-in-law, Kate, Princess of Wales, announced in January that she was in remission after completing chemotherapy the previous September - rare disclosures for a family that traditionally guards its privacy.

Health was not the only challenge for the monarchy.

Charles stripped his younger brother Andrew of his titles as Duke of York and prince after renewed scrutiny of his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

But the year also brought a rare moment of reconciliation when Charles' younger son, Prince Harry, met his father for tea in September, their first meeting in just under two years.

Harry, who is based in the U.S., later said he hoped for healing, calling life "precious" and acknowledging limited time to mend ties.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:21:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WAF5VRVQSJPHRL7A4AXSWGSJIE.jpg?auth=1fbc08ba3aded865abe77eeefa4c948518b9d3ed979b2f00b99180159d705f78&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Forest great Robertson, 'Picasso of our game', dies at 72</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/forest-great-robertson-picasso-our-game-dies-72-2025-12-25/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 25 (Reuters) - John Robertson, the Nottingham Forest winger described by his manager Brian Clough as "a Picasso of our game", has died at the age of 72, the Premier League club said on Thursday.

He was a key member of Clough's all-conquering Forest team, assisting Trevor Francis's winner in their 1979 European Cup final victory over Malmo before scoring himself to sink Hamburg in the 1980 final.

"We are heartbroken to announce the passing of Nottingham Forest legend and dear friend, John Robertson," Forest said in a statement.

"A true great of our club and a double European Cup winner, John’s unrivalled talent, humility and unwavering devotion to Nottingham Forest will never ever be forgotten."

Robertson spent most of his career at the City Ground, making over 500 appearances across two stints at the club.

Clough once described him as a "scruffy, unfit, uninterested waste of time" who became "one of the finest deliverers of a football I have ever seen", usually with his cultured left foot.

Robertson was a stalwart of Forest's meteoric rise from the second division to winning the English first division title the following season in 1978 before the two European Cup triumphs.

He earned 28 caps for Scotland, scoring the winning goal against England in 1981, and served as assistant manager to former Forest teammate Martin O'Neill at several clubs, including Aston Villa.

"Rest in peace, Robbo… Our greatest," Forest said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:21:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swedish police investigating serious incident in Boden, north Sweden</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swedish-police-investigating-serious-incident-boden-north-sweden-2025-12-25/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Swedish police are investigating a serious incident in the northern town of Boden, they said on Thursday, with daily Aftonbladet reporting that a number of injured people had been taken to hospital.

Daily Aftonbladet said it had information that a violent crime had occurred and that the perpetrator had been shot by police.

A number of people had been taken to hospital, the paper said, citing the local authority.

He turned out to be a senior employee of the municipality of Triesen, south of Vaduz, who had been suspended a few days earlier due to irregularities in the accounts, police said.

Police later found the bodies of a 73-year-old man and two women, aged 68 and 45, in a Vaduz apartment. These were the municipality worker's parents and sister, police said.

"It was a really good conversation: many details, good ideas, that we discussed. There are some new ideas on how to bring the real peace closer, and it concerns formats, meetings, and, certainly, the timeline," Zelenskiy said on the Telegram app.

Trump has been pushing for a deal to end the almost four-year-long war, and in recent weeks peace efforts led by Witkoff and Kushner have been slowly inching forward.

Earlier this week, Zelenskiy presented a 20-point draft peace plan that he described as the main framework for ending the war.

The draft represented a slimmed-down version of an original 28-point plan the U.S. previously discussed with the Russian side that was widely seen as mainly benefiting Moscow as it demanded Kyiv cede territory and put curbs on its army.

However, key territorial questions remain unresolved in the new 20-point draft, Zelenskiy said, adding that a meeting with Trump would be required to solve the most sensitive issues.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Moscow was analysing the documents on ending the war which were brought to Moscow by Russia's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev from the United States.

The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Zelenskiy said that Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov planned to have one more conversation with the U.S. negotiators later in the day.

"We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine and to ensure that all documents and steps are realistic, effective, and reliable," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 18:32:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BRFMIOVEMJLG5C7LGRZ346YKZ4.jpg?auth=db07454891d26ead8ac48691d7398c4998f2a3e60cf75f0fe48a12c0fd8f785c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelensky holds talks with US envoys as Russia sees 'slow but steady' peace progress</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-zelensky-holds-talks-us-envoys-russia-sees-slow-steady-peace-progress</link><description>Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday he had had "very good" talks with US President Donald Trump 's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner , focused on ending the "brutal Russian war".

"We discussed certain substantive details of the ongoing work," he said in a post on social media.

"There are good ideas that can work toward a shared outcome and the lasting peace," he added.

Zelensky thanked the two envoys for their "constructive approach, the intensive work, and the kind words".

"We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine and to ensure that all documents and steps are realistic, effective, and reliable," he added.

They had also agreed during the conversation that Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov would speak with the two envoys again Thursday.

Zelensky's post came a day after having said that Ukraine had won some limited concessions in the latest version of a US-led draft plan to end the Russian invasion.

The 20-point plan, agreed on by US and Ukrainian negotiators, is being reviewed by Moscow . But the Kremlin has previously not shown a willingness to abandon its territorial demands for full Ukrainian withdrawal from the east.

Zelensky conceded on Wednesday that there were some points in the document that he did not like.

But he said Kyiv had succeeded in removing immediate requirements for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk region or that land seized by Moscow's army would be recognised as Russian.

Russia, meanwhile, said talks with the United States were making gradual headway.

"In ​the negotiation process on a settlement of the Ukraine conflict, I mean in the negotiation ‍process with the United States, ​there is slow but steady progress," she said.

Zakharova ‌added that Western European ‍powers were trying to torpedo the progress and suggested that the United States counter such ‍moves.

Washington imposed visa bans on Tuesday on Ahmed and four Europeans, including French former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accuses them of working to censor freedom of speech or unfairly target U.S. tech giants with burdensome regulation. Ahmed lives in New York and is believed to be the only of the five currently in the country.

The move sparked an outcry from European governments who argue regulations and the work of monitoring groups made the internet safer by highlighting false information and compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.

For Ahmed, the 47-year-old CEO of the U.S.-based Center for Countering Digital Hate, it also sparked fears of imminent deportation that would separate him from his wife and child, both U.S. citizens, according to a lawsuit he filed on Wednesday in the Southern District of New York.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, when announcing the visa restrictions, said he had determined the presence of the five in the United States had potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States and they could therefore be deported.

Ahmed named Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump officials in his lawsuit, arguing officials were violating his rights to free speech and due process with the threat of deportation.

U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick issued a temporary restraining order on Thursday, which enjoined officials from arresting, detaining or transferring Ahmed before he has an opportunity for his case to be heard, and scheduled a conference between the parties for December 29.

Ahmed, in a statement provided by a representative, praised the U.S. legal system's checks and balances and said he was proud to call the country his home. "I will not be bullied away from my life’s work of fighting to keep children safe from social media’s harm and stopping antisemitism online," he said.

In response to questions about the case, a State Department spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here."

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

Legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, do not need a visa to remain in the U.S., but the Trump administration has attempted to deport at least one already this year.

Mahmoud Khalil, detained in March after his prominent involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, was released by a judge who argued punishing someone over a civil immigration matter was unconstitutional.

A U.S. immigration judge in September ordered Khalil to be deported over claims he omitted information from his green card application, but he appealed that ruling and separate orders blocking his deportation remain in place.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:19:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IIVEYADSFFPBTPSINDLSK3DXEU.jpg?auth=4624682c77119d5b92492184ef8774bacd7d92318f0c58d3c8b1a92b26d9d7a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US launches strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-launches-strikes-against-islamic-state-militants-northwest-nigeria-trump-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 25 (Reuters) - The United States carried out a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government, U.S. President Donald Trump and the U.S. military said on Thursday, claiming the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state at the request of the Nigerian authorities and killed multiple ISIS militants.

The strike comes after Trump in late October began warning that Christianity faces an "existential threat" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.

Reuters reported on Monday the U.S. had been conducting intelligence-gathering flights over large parts of Nigeria since late November.

Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the strikes were carried out as part of ongoing security cooperation with the United States, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups.

"This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West," the ministry said in a post on X.

A video posted by the Pentagon showed at least one projectile launched from a warship. A U.S. defense official said the strike targeted multiple militants at known ISIS camps.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on X thanked the Nigerian government for its support and cooperation and added: “More to come...”

Nigeria's government has said armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and U.S. claims that Christians face persecution do not represent the complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But it has agreed to work with the U.S. to bolster its forces against militant groups.

The country's population is split between Muslims living primarily in the north and Christians in the south.

Police said earlier on Thursday a suspected suicide bomber killed at least five people and injured 35 others in Nigeria's northeast, another region troubled by Islamist insurgents.

In a Christmas message posted on X earlier, Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu called for peace in his country, "especially between individuals of differing religious beliefs."

He also said: "I stand committed to doing everything within my power to enshrine religious freedom in Nigeria and to protect Christians, Muslims, and all Nigerians from violence."

Trump issued his statement on the strike on Christmas Day while he was at his Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago Club, where he has been spending the holiday. He had no public events during the day and was last seen by the reporters traveling with him on Wednesday night.

The U.S. military last week launched separate large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria , after Trump vowed to hit back in the wake of a suspected ISIS attack on U.S. personnel in the country.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:43:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/42VSMAOQ2JNULDBJDEFT27LIMY.jpg?auth=03c0a9c333315216ea77d2436b99f8054a3d03aa47d337026b2907e46458b42a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Political stability at stake as Malaysia's Najib awaits verdict in biggest 1MDB trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/political-stability-stake-malaysias-najib-awaits-verdict-biggest-1mdb-trial-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will hear a verdict on Friday in the biggest trial he faces over the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal , a ruling that could risk deepening tensions within the administration of current premier Anwar Ibrahim.

Investigators have said about $4.5 billion was allegedly stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund co-founded by Najib in 2009, and that more than $1 billion allegedly made its way into his personal bank accounts.

Najib, 72, last year apologised for mishandling the scandal while in office but he has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying he was misled by 1MDB officials and a fugitive financier, Jho Low, on the source of the funds.

In 2020, Najib was convicted of graft and money laundering for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit and began a 12-year prison sentence two years later after losing all his appeals. That sentence was later halved by a pardons board chaired by Malaysia's king, with Najib due for release in 2028.

A Malaysian high court will decide on Friday whether to convict Najib of four more charges of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering involving the illegal transfer of about 2.2 billion ringgit ($539 million) from 1MDB.

If found guilty, he could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.

The implementation of the penalties, however, could be stayed pending further appeals.

The decision will be closely watched after another court this week dismissed a bid by Najib to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.

That ruling reignited tensions in Anwar's ruling administration, which includes Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation.

UMNO campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll ended in a hung parliament.

Several UMNO leaders expressed disappointment with the decision to deny Najib house arrest, saying it risked diluting the powers of Malaysia's rulers, while others were angered by social media posts by some members of Anwar's coalition celebrating the ruling.

Anwar this week called for all parties to handle news of the verdict with patience and wisdom, adding that it was "inappropriate to muddy the atmosphere or add tension" even if there were those who chose not to sympathize with Najib and his family.

A guilty verdict for Najib on Friday could strain ties further, with some UMNO leaders already calling for the party to review its pact with Anwar or withdraw from the government altogether. An acquittal, however, may weaken Anwar, who has been under pressure to uphold his credentials as an anti-graft campaigner.

Anwar has been accused by critics of betraying progressive voters and allies after prosecutors dropped some corruption charges against Najib and other UMNO figures . The premier has repeatedly said he does not interfere in court cases.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5AKU6KBTAFI7RJOEFMTHLNA7R4.jpg?auth=5f6000b76bf2d89b4c69e0e03c632c92c80d8f4a38bd329209fd13a86b2f1303&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar to hold third phase of election voting on January 25, state media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-hold-third-phase-election-voting-january-25-state-media-reports-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Myanmar will hold a third phase of voting in its general election on January 25, according to an announcement in state media on Friday.

Faced with rising government bond yields and a weak yen, the Takaichi administration has stepped up efforts to reassure investors that the government will not resort to irresponsible debt issuance or tax cuts.

The budget for the year starting from April, to be submitted to parliament early next year, will total a record 122.3 trillion yen ($784.63 billion), exceeding this year's initial budget of 115.2 trillion yen.

Still, new government bond issuance will increase only slightly from this year's 28.6 trillion yen to 29.6 trillion yen, with the debt dependence ratio falling to 24.2%, the lowest since 1998.

Higher tax revenues, projected to rise 7.6% to a record 83.7 trillion yen, will help fund increased spending, though they will not fully offset surging debt-servicing costs, along with higher social welfare and defence outlays.

Debt-servicing costs for interest payments and debt redemption will jump 10.8% to 31.3 trillion yen, with the assumed interest rate set at 3.0%, the highest level in 29 years, as the Bank of Japan exits ultra-loose monetary policy.

Japan already has the highest debt burden in the developed world at more than twice the size of its economy, making it highly sensitive to rising borrowing costs and complicating Takaichi's plans to pursue aggressive fiscal stimulus measures.

Takaichi intends to drop the idea of using the annual primary budget balance as Japan's fiscal consolidation goal and set a new goal that extends through several years to allow more flexible spending.

The country's accident investigation board will not be in a position to release the interim update by the first anniversary on Monday of the worst aircraft accident on South Korean soil, the two board officials said. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

On December 29, 2024, the Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 made an emergency belly landing at Muan airport, overshot the runway then slammed into a concrete embankment and erupted into a fireball, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.

The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes .

The pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after the bird strike, investigators said in a July update that was not released publicly due to objections from victims' families.

Some of the family members said investigators appeared to blame the pilots without exploring other factors, such as the concrete structure beyond the end of the runway that likely made the disaster far more deadly.

"It feels like all kinds of doubts are just growing bigger and bigger. In the meantime, a year has gone by, and it feels like the frustration is only continuing to build," said Ryu Kum-Ji, a 42-year-old woman who lost both of her parents in the crash.

She joined other family members who shaved their heads and staged a protest in front of a presidential office, calling for an independent and transparent probe.

Missteps by the transport ministry, which oversees the investigation board, could also be a factor in the accident, Ryu said.

A transport ministry official told bereaved family members this month that it would examine their concerns.

"We take seriously your concerns saying that government's efforts were not sufficient in the process of (finding the truth)," the second vice minister of the transport ministry said. "The government will stand by the bereaved families and take a closer look."

South Korea's parliament will launch an independent probe into the crash on Tuesday.

Under the U.N. aviation body's rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident, and if that is not possible, an interim statement should be made public on every anniversary detailing the investigation's progress and any safety issues raised.

But the investigation board is not planning to release an update yet because of pending legislation designed to ensure its independence, said the two officials.

Lawmakers have proposed replacing board members and transferring oversight from the transport ministry to the prime minister's office.

"We will respect the decision of the newly formed committee regarding the timing of the interim statement's publication," said one of the board officials.

South Korea's anti-corruption body found in a report this week that the concrete embankment at Muan airport violated local and global standards that call for such structures to be "frangible" so they give way in case of impact. That meant it could "cause fatal damage to aircraft and occupants."

The board had planned public hearings in early December, but delayed them at the request of the victims' families and lawmakers. Police are also investigating the accident.

"All we want is for authorities to admit they were wrong if they did wrong, and apologise. Apology and a proper disclosure of the truth...that is what we want," Ryu said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:54:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UBPNCKVRIBNEJNR6C4HVY4DXVM.jpg?auth=65135a25b2e585b14ef141571e0e4e1aa5c4b89a00c082da29f749f0aaefd08f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Kyiv awaits Moscow’s response to the latest US-led plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251226-live-kyiv-awaits-moscow-s-response-to-the-latest-us-led-plan</link><description>Welcome to the France 24 liveblog covering the war in Ukraine and diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.

Yemen's main southern separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is supported by Abu Dhabi, has pushed the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from its headquarters in Aden while claiming broad control across the south earlier this month.

"The UAE reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to supporting all endeavours aimed at strengthening stability and development in Yemen," the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it remains hopeful that STC will end an escalation and withdraw its forces from the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra.

The STC was initially part of the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis. But the group has turned on the government and sought self-rule in the south.

Yemen has already been marred by a civil war since 2014, with the Houthis controlling the northern part of the country, including the capital Sanaa after forcing the Saudi-backed government to flee south.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 07:22:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia court finds ex-PM Najib Razak guilty of abuse of power in biggest 1MDB trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-court-finds-ex-pm-najib-razak-guilty-abuse-power-biggest-1mdb-trial-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was found guilty of abuse of power on Friday in the biggest trial yet in the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal , a ruling that could have significant political repercussions.

The judge had yet to deliver the full verdict and sentencing.

Malaysia and U.S. investigators say at least $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund Najib co-founded in 2009 while in office. More than $1 billion allegedly made its way into accounts linked to Najib, who has consistently denied wrongdoing.

Najib has been charged with four counts of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering for receiving illegal transfers of more than 2.3 billion ringgit ($569.45 million) from 1MDB. He had consistently denied wrongdoing.

"The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him," Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said in an ongoing reading of the verdict.

Najib could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.

Najib, 72, has been in prison since August 2022, when Malaysia's top court upheld a verdict convicting him of corruption for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit. His 12-year jail sentence in that case was halved last year by a pardons board.

Najib last year apologised for mishandling the scandal while in office but had consistently denied wrongdoing, saying repeatedly that he was misled by 1MDB officials and the fugitive financier, Jho Low, about the source of the funds.

Judge Sequerah in reading the verdict had earlier said evidence had revealed Najib had an "unmistakable bond and connection" with Low, who acted as the then prime minister's "proxy and intermediary" in 1MDB affairs.

Low, who has been charged in the United States for his central role in the case, denies all wrongdoing and his whereabouts are unknown.

Najib has maintained he was misled by Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that funds deposited into his account were donations from the Saudi royal family.

But Sequerah said Najib's argument was "implausible" and dismissed letters on the donations produced by Najib that allegedly originated from the Saudi royal family, saying they were not corroborated by evidence and were probably forgeries.

"The irresistible conclusion is that the Arab donation narrative is not meritorious ... the evidence pointed unmistakably to the fact that the monies were, in fact derived from 1MDB funds," Sequerah said.

The verdict came just days after another court denied a bid by Najib to serve his jail sentence under house arrest - a decision that reignited tensions within current Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration.

Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation, campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll ended in a hung parliament.

Some UMNO leaders expressed disappointment with the decision to deny Najib house arrest and others were angered by social media posts by some members of Anwar's coalition celebrating the earlier ruling.

Anwar on Tuesday called for calm, urging all parties to accept the court verdict with "full patience and wisdom".

Andrei Kolesnikov, the Kremlin correspondent for the Kommersant, one of Russia's top newspapers, said that Putin briefed top businessmen on the details of the plan at a late-night Kremlin meeting on December 24.

"Vladimir Putin asserted that the Russian side is still ready to make the concessions that he made in Anchorage. In other words, that 'Donbas is ours,'" Kommersant reported.

In essence, Putin wants the whole of Donbas but outside that area "a partial exchange of territories from the Russian side is not ruled out," Kolesnikov wrote in the newspaper.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in remarks to reporters released by his office on Wednesday, said Ukrainian and U.S. delegations had inched closer to finalising a 20-point plan at the talks over the weekend in Miami.

But Zelenskiy said Ukraine and the United States had not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas that it still controls - or on the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is controlled by Russian forces.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to end the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two and his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been negotiating with Russia, Ukraine and European powers.

The full detail of the U.S. proposals has not been disclosed, though Russian officials have repeatedly referred to unspecified "understandings" reached between Putin and Trump at a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, in August.

Russia controls all of Crimea which it annexed in 2014, about 90% of Donbas, 75% of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on the principles of the conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO.

According to Kommersant, Putin also raised the issue of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, at his meeting with businessmen.

Putin, according to Kommersant, said that joint Russian-U.S. management of the nuclear power station was being discussed.

Putin also said that the United States had expressed an interest in crypto mining near the plant and that the plant should be used to partially supply Ukraine, Kommersant said.

Zelenskiy has said that sensitive issues, including any compromises on territory, should be discussed at the level of heads of state, and Kyiv has been seeking a face-to-face meeting with Trump.

"We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the New Year," he said on X following the latest round of talks between Ukrainian and U.S. negotiators.

Zelenskiy held talks on Thursday with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

He said that some documents, part of a wider framework aimed at ending the conflict and ensuring Ukraine's reconstruction, were "nearly ready" while others were "fully prepared".

Earlier this week, Zelenskiy unveiled a 20-point draft peace plan that he described as the main framework for ending the war.

While the plan outlined Ukraine receiving security guarantees to prevent further Russian aggression, there was no compromise between Ukraine and the U.S. on the issues of territory, which Moscow is demanding Kyiv cede.

Control over the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant also remained the matter of further discussion.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H3YTXAF2KJLLJE6WDUBPND2AOE.jpg?auth=b848ea5fd9bdba0f29bb9c2a4686e72ac82f270c272a99a2c6d23c8c67c37cf6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones damage foreign-flagged vessels in southern ports, Ukraine says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/russian-drones-damage-foreign-flagged-vessels-southern-ports-ukraine-says-2025-12-26/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Russian overnight drone attacks damaged Slovakia-, Palau- and Liberia-flagged vessels in ports in Ukraine's Odesa and Mykolaiv regions, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Friday.

In recent weeks, Russia has escalated attacks on the southern Odesa region, and Ukrainian officials said Moscow aimed to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and sow chaos among civilians.

There were no casualties in Friday's strikes, Oleksiy Kuleba said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app, but the attacks caused power cuts and damaged elevators and civilian warehouses in the Odesa region.

Separately, Kuleba added, drones damaged a locomotive and a freight car at the northwestern Kovel railway station, around 60 kilometres (37.28 miles) from Poland.

"Despite Russia's deliberate terror, Ukraine's logistics system continues to function," Kuleba said.

Russia did not comment on the matter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seoul court acquits ex-officials of tampering in case of man slain by North Korean troops</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/seoul-court-acquits-ex-officials-tampering-case-man-slain-by-north-korean-troops-2025-12-26/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Friday acquitted five former government officials accused of manipulating facts in a case from 2020 where a fisheries official was killed at sea by North Korean troops.

The Seoul Central District Court cited a "lack of evidence" against the officials, who served in former President Moon Jae-in's administration and included ex-national security advisor Suh Hoon, and returned a verdict of not guilty.

The officials claimed before the trial that fisheries official Lee Dae-jun, who was shot dead by North Korean troops, had sought to defect to the North due to gambling debts, mental health issues and an unhappy life.

Lee's family refuted the allegations.

"The evidence submitted by the prosecutor alone is insufficient to admit that (the defendants) were trying to steer the matter to make it look like a defection to North Korea" beyond a reasonable doubt, the lower court said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear if prosecutors would appeal. The five officials had been on trial since 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says foreign tanker carrying smuggled fuel seized in Gulf</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-foreign-tanker-carrying-smuggled-fuel-seized-gulf-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Iran has seized a foreign oil tanker near the Iranian island of Qeshm in the Gulf, saying it was carrying 4 million litres of smuggled fuel, state media reported on Friday.

Authorities did not name the vessel or disclose its nationality. They said 16 foreign crew members had been detained on criminal charges. State TV said the tanker was seized on Wednesday.

Iranian news websites published video footage and photographs of what they said was the seized tanker.

Iran said last week it had seized another foreign tanker carrying 6 million litres of what it described as smuggled diesel in the Gulf of Oman without identifying the vessel or its nationality.

Iran, which has some of the world's lowest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and a sharp fall in the value of its national currency, has been seeking to curb widespread fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf states.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seoul court acquits ex-officials of tampering in case of man slain by North Korean troops</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/seoul-court-acquits-ex-officials-tampering-case-man-slain-by-north-korean-troops-2025-12-26/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran says foreign tanker carrying smuggled fuel seized in Gulf</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-foreign-tanker-carrying-smuggled-fuel-seized-gulf-2025-12-26/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korean prosecutors seek ten years in prison for ousted president Yoon</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251226-south-korea-prosecutors-request-10-year-term-for-ex-president-yoon-suk-yeol</link><description>An independent counsel on Friday demanded a 10-year prison term for South Korea’s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol in the first of seven criminal cases related to his ill-fated attempt to impose martial law in 2024 and other allegations that flared when he was in office.

The first of Yoon's trials to wrap up covers charges including his defiance of authorities’ attempts to investigate and detain him. Yoon denies all charges and his lawyers have argued that the detainment warrant was invalid and illegal.

The court is expected to render a verdict as early as next month.

Yoon faces other trials on accusations ranging from corruption and favor trading to rebellion, a grave charge that is punishable by life imprisonment or execution. The rebellion trial is also nearing an end.

Yoon’s martial law enactment brought armed troops into Seoul streets and triggered South Korea 's most serious political crisis in decades.

Martial law lasted only a few hours, as lawmakers managed to enter the National Assembly and voted to lift his decree. Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled parliament later in December 2024 before he was formally dismissed as president upon an Constitutional Court ruling in April.

On Friday, independent counsel Cho Eun-suk’s team requested the Seoul Central District Court to sentence Yoon to 10 years in prison on charges of obstruction of official duties, abuse of power, falsification of official documents and destruction of evidence.

Yoon holed up at his residence and hindered authorities' attempts to execute a warrant for his detention for weeks after his impeachment . The standoff caused worries about physical clashes between Yoon's presidential security service and those attempting to detain him and further deepened a national divide.

Park Eok-su, a senior investigator on Cho’s team, called Yoon's actions “an unprecedented obstruction of official duties” during Friday's court session.

Yoon also faces charges that he sidestepped a legally mandated full Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law, and that he fabricated documents including the martial law proclamation and ordered data deleted from phones used by those involved in his martial law imposition.

Yoon has denied those charges and maintained  that his decree was meant to draw public support of his struggle against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which impeached some of his top officials and obstructed his agenda.

Wrapping up a six-month probe last week, Cho’s team said Yoon plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate his political rivals and monopolize power.

Yoon's other trials deal with charges like the ex-leader ordering drone flights over North Korea to deliberately stoke tensions and justify his plans to declare martial law and committing perjury in the trial of his prime minster. Yoon also faces charges that he tried to manipulate the investigation into a marine’s drowning in 2023 and received free opinion surveys from an election broker in return for a political favor.

Yoon has said he wasn't informed of such drone flights and denied wrongdoing in the influence-peddling scandal.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:56:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bfd8e26c-e234-11f0-b5e4-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360240895524.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion at mosque in Syria's Homs kills three, says local official</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-mosque-syrias-homs-kills-three-says-local-official-2025-12-26/</link><description>DAMASCUS, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Three people were killed and five injured when an explosion struck a mosque in an Alawite neighbourhood in the Syrian province of Homs on Friday, a local official said.

President Donald Trump, in a post on Truth Social, claimed the group had been targeting primarily Christians in Nigeria "at levels not seen for many years".

The Sunni Muslim group emerged in Iraq and Syria and quickly created a "caliphate", declaring its rule over all Muslims and largely displacing al Qaeda.

At the height of its power from 2014-2017 it held swathes of the two countries, ruling over millions of people. It had a base only a 30-minute drive from Baghdad, and also held the city of Sirte on Libya's Mediterranean coast.

On its territory, IS sought to rule like a centralised government, imposing its interpretation of Islamic Sharia law strictly and deploying shocking brutality including public executions and torture.

Its fighters also carried out or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world.

The caliphate eventually collapsed in Iraq and in Syria after a sustained military campaign by a U.S.-led coalition.

After being ousted from its bases in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul, the group took refuge in the hinterlands of the two fractured countries.

It retains a significant presence in Syria and Iraq , parts of Africa including the Sahel region, and in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Fighters are scattered in autonomous cells, IS leadership is clandestine and its overall size is hard to quantify. The U.N. estimates a membership of 10,000 in IS heartlands.

Many foreign fighters have joined Islamic State's Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), named after an old term for the region that included parts of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.

In the Philippines, Islamic State affiliates remain active in southern areas, especially Mindanao, where pro-Islamic State militants controlled the city of Marawi in 2017.

IS has always wanted to spread its extreme form of Islam, but has adopted new tactics since the collapse of its forces and a string of other setbacks in the Middle East.

It is now a disparate group often operating through affiliates and sympathisers.

But it has retained the ability to carry out high-profile attacks, which it claims on its Telegram channels, often posting images as part of its plan to spread terror.

While IS militants operating across several regions share an ideology, there are no signs that they exchange weapons or financing.

The U.S. military believes the group's current leader is Abdulqadir Mumin, who heads the Somalia branch.

The shooting attack at a Jewish Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach has raised questions over whether the group is inspiring lone wolf attacks once again. The police said IS appeared to inspire the gunmen, who killed 15 people.

The men accused of carrying out Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years had spent time in the Philippines, where IS-linked networks are known to operate.

IS continues to strike and plot in Syria, where the government has signed a cooperation agreement with the U.S.-led coalition combatting the group .

This month, two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in Syria , opens new tab by a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathising with IS.

The U.S. military launched large-scale strikes against dozens of IS targets in Syria, after Trump vowed to hit back in the wake of a suspected IS attack on U.S. personnel in the country.

IS has expressed hatred for Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, calling him "Trump's boy" and accusing him of "establishing the worst and darkest chapter of treason in Islamic modern history", two days before the U.S. soldiers and interpreter were killed in Syria.

IS has also carried out attacks in Africa, showing it still has a global reach.

In October, it claimed responsibility for an attack that a U.N. mission said had killed at least 43 worshippers during a night mass at a church in eastern Congo.

In February, a military official said IS had attacked military bases in Somalia's northeastern Puntland state with suicide car and motorbike bombs, triggering airstrikes that killed 70 militants.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:46:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MNEAVZS3KRLWTK23R63WPROJUU.jpg?auth=01b39b01c1bd80819c5e0d2b4f3aa421c443a5ea5e8cb32b60c63fd80fbecacb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to meet Ukraine's Zelenskiy at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, Axios reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-meet-ukraines-zelenskiy-mar-a-lago-sunday-axios-reports-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday at Mar-a-Lago, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on social media platform X, citing a Ukrainian official.

His conviction is likely to heap years onto the six-year term he is already serving for a separate case related to the 1MDB fund.

The nation’s High Court found Najib, 72, guilty on four counts of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering related to more than $700 million channelled into his personal bank accounts from the 1MDB fund.

While Najib, the son of one of the country's founding fathers, was groomed for leadership from a young age, he experienced a spectacular fall from power as public anger mounted over the corruption scandal .

Since Najib's 2018 election loss, investigations under successive governments have ensnared him and wife Rosmah Mansor in graft allegations .

Prosecutors say Najib abused his positions as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chairman to move large amounts of money from the fund into his personal accounts more than a decade ago.

According to investigators, proceeds from the state fund were used to bankroll high-end real estate, a luxury yacht and precious artworks.

Friday's hearing opened around 9:00am (0100 GMT) before the Kuala Lumpur High Court in the country's administrative capital of Putrajaya.

Presiding Judge Sequerah started reading a lengthy verdict, before breaking for Friday afternoon prayers, with the hearing resuming at 3:00pm.

During the morning reading, Judge Sequerah dismissed several of the defence lawyers' arguments, including that Najib was duped by his close associate, the shadowy businessman Low Taek Jho , better known as Jho Low.

"The evidence clearly points to the fact that this was no coincidence but was evident of a relationship in which Jho Low operated as a proxy or agent of the accused with regard to the running of the affairs of 1MDB," Sequerah said.

The defence's argument that Najib was "misled and duped by management and by Jho Low is unmeritorious", the judge said.

Low, who is currently on the run, is seen as the mastermind behind the scheme to plunder the country's investment vehicle.

Sequerah also dismissed arguments that the money flowing into Najib's accounts was "donations" from Middle East funders, calling it a "tale that surpassed even those from the Arabian Nights".

The prosecution presented bank records, testimony from over 50 witnesses and documentary evidence.

Najib "paints himself as a victim of rogue subordinates, when in truth, he was the single most powerful decision-maker", deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib told the court during closing arguments.

"The accused wielded absolute financial, executive and political control," he said.

Najib's lawyers have previously said the politician was unaware that 1MDB's management was working hand in glove with Low to siphon large amounts of money from the fund, ostensibly established to foster economic growth in Malaysia .

Najib's lawyer, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, last week told journalists his client "never got a fair trial".

He again blamed Low for the scandal, which dented Malaysia's image abroad.

Najib has apologised for allowing the 1MDB scandal to happen during his tenure, but he maintains he knew nothing about illegal transfers from the fund.

His legal battle was dealt a blow on Monday after he lost a bid to serve the remainder of his current jail term at home rather than the Kajang Prison outside Kuala Lumpur.

Each count of abuse of power is punishable by up to 20 years in jail and a fine of up to five times the amount of the bribe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:48:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f1502624-22d5-11ed-b6bd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-08-23T095503Z_1851378304_RC272W93MP8B_RTRMADP_3_MALAYSIA-POLITICS-NAJIB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thai defence minister to attend truce talks with Cambodia, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-defence-minister-attend-truce-talks-with-cambodia-pm-says-2025-12-26/</link><description>BANGKOK, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Thailand's defence minister will join ongoing talks with Cambodia on Saturday that could lead to a truce, the Thai premier said on Friday, as border clashes between the two Southeast Asian neighbours continued for a third week.

If the defence minister is able to come to an agreement with his Cambodian counterpart, the two countries will make a deal in line with a previous pact brokered with the help of U.S. President Donald Trump following a previous round of clashes in July, he said.

"What is important is that both of us have to keep the promises that both will not threaten, offend, and instigate, and to reduce hostility between the two countries," Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters in Bangkok, referring to a potential deal.

A Cambodian defence ministry spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Thai and Cambodian officials have been holding parleys at a border crossing since Wednesday as hostilities between the two countries continued. The ceasefire broke down in early December, with at least 98 people killed on both sides and more than half a million on displaced.

Since the conflict restarted, neither Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim - chair of the ASEAN bloc that facilitated the previous ceasefire - nor Trump have been successful in halting hostilities.

The warring sides have also been pressed by Beijing to put an end to the fighting, with China's special envoy for Asian affairs Deng Xijun holding talks in Bangkok and Phnom Penh in recent days.

"I hope that this time will be the last time to sign such an agreement, so that there will be peace in the area and people can return to their homes," Anutin said.

Thailand and Cambodia have accused each other of moves that led to the breakdown of the July truce, which was expanded into a wider agreement in October to help settle the conflict.

The neighbours have long disputed sections of their 817-km (508-mile) land border, and the latest fighting has stretched from forested inland areas near Laos to coastal provinces.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 11:20:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XHWH46WONJLC3MULZK7F3ULCJE.jpg?auth=613076f7f3125a1687bf9e74e03ecbcb0689d4c41836b8afe2deb43e62746d5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli reservist rams vehicle into Palestinian man praying in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-reservist-rams-vehicle-into-palestinian-man-praying-west-bank-2025-12-26/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Dec 26 (Reuters) - An Israeli reservist soldier rammed his vehicle into a Palestinian man as he prayed on a roadside in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, after earlier firing shots in the area, the Israeli military said.

"Footage was received of an armed individual running over a Palestinian individual," it said in a statement, adding the individual was a reservist and his military service had been terminated.

The reservist acted "in severe violation of his authority" and his weapon had been confiscated, the military said.

Israeli media reported that he was being held under house arrest.

The Israeli police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Palestinian man went to hospital for checks after the attack, but was unhurt and is now at home.

Video which aired on Palestinian TV shows a man in civilian clothing with a gun slung over his shoulder driving an off-road vehicle into a man praying on the side of the road.

This year ​was one of the most violent on record for Israeli civilian attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to United Nations data that shows more than 750 injuries.

More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 7, 2023 and October 17, 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, according to the U.N. In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 11:40:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly blast hits Alawite mosque in Syria's Homs province</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251226-blast-alawite-mosque-in-syria-homs-province-kills-least-five</link><description>At least five people were killed in an explosion ⁠at a mosque of the Alawite minority sect in the Syrian city of Homs on Friday, Syrian state news agency ​SANA said.

The assailant, from the occupied West Bank, was shot and wounded by a civilian at the scene and taken to hospital, the Israeli police said in a statement.

"This was a rolling terror attack," the police added.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said he had instructed the military to respond forcefully in the West Bank town of Qabaitya , where he said the assailant came from, to thwart any further attacks.

The Israeli military said it was "preparing for an operation" in the area.

The Israeli ambulance service said that a teenager was also hurt in the attack and that the man and woman were pronounced dead at the scene after medics were unable to resuscitate them.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:44:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin sends a signal to Trump on Ukraine proposals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-sends-signal-trump-ukraine-proposals-2025-12-26/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy aide spoke to members of the U.S. administration after Moscow received U.S. proposals about a possible Ukrainian peace deal, the Kremlin said on Friday.

Kremlin foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, spoke by telephone to several members of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He did not say when the call took place.

Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev brought paper copies of U.S. proposals for peace back to Moscow after a meeting in Miami at the weekend - and the details were being analysed by the Kremlin, Peskov said.

"The information was analysed, and on behalf of President Putin, contact took place between representatives of the administrations of Russia and the United States," Peskov said. "It was agreed to continue the dialogue."

When asked how the Kremlin viewed the documents, Peskov said that he did not want to comment as Russia felt making remarks in public could undermine the negotiations.

Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported that Putin told some of Russia's top businessmen that he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces in Ukraine but that he wanted the whole of Donbas.

Asked about the report, Peskov said that the Ukrainian peace discussions were touched upon "in general" and mentioned at the meeting. He gave no further details on the details of what was discussed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WGFEGIY5PVLWZPRBABY42JPBGU.jpg?auth=25ca3e5ec5e3afc0542aeb91a244bfc00328e0808a553d636926d79a7bbe9831&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON 2025: Morocco eye early qualification against Mali</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/sports/20251226-afcon-2025-morocco-eye-early-qualification-against-mali</link><description>Elsewhere in the sports news, the focus remains firmly on the Africa Cup of Nations .

But security experts say it is unclear whether such strikes can do much to hinder Islamist militants who have long menaced communities in the area.

Trump announced on Truth Social on Thursday that U.S. forces had launched a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government.

Local media reported loud explosions in the village of Jabo in the evening of Christmas Day. Reuters has not been able to confirm whether there were casualties.

Abuja confirmed it had approved the operation. Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said on Friday Nigeria had acted jointly with the U.S., but not targeting any specific religion.

“Nigeria is a multi-religious country, and we’re working with partners like the U.S. to fight terrorism and protect lives and property,” Tuggar told Nigeria's Channels Television.

Nigeria's population of over 230 million people is roughly evenly divided among Christians, who predominate in the south, and Muslims who predominate in the north.

Last month, Trump threatened to order his forces to take military action in Nigeria unless the authorities there acted to stop what he described as the persecution of Christians.

While Nigeria has had persistent security challenges, including violence and kidnappings by Islamist insurgents in the north, it strongly denies that Christians are subjected to systematic persecution.

Its government responded to Trump's threat by saying it intended to work with Washington against militants, while rejecting U.S. language that suggested Christians were in particular peril.

“After Trump threatened to come guns-blazing in Nigeria, we saw a Nigerian delegation visit the U.S.,” Kabir Adamu, managing director of Abuja-based Beacon Security and Intelligence Limited, told Reuters.

“The Attorney General was involved, and agreements were signed. Then we learned of U.S. surveillance missions mapping terrorist locations.”

Participating in the strikes could raise a risk that the government could be perceived as endorsing Trump's language on wider sectarian strife, a sensitive issue throughout Nigeria's history.

"Trump is pandering to domestic evangelical Christian objectives with his ‘Christian genocide’ narrative,” Adamu said.

The northwestern area where Thursday's airstrikes took place has been plagued since 2024 by increasing violence from members of the Lakurawa sect, a strict Sunni Islamist movement that claims affiliation with the Islamic State group.

Formed as a vigilante outfit, the group evolved into a jihadist movement enforcing strict Islamist rule across hundreds of villages in the area. Nigeria declared the group a terrorist organisation early this year.

"It’s very likely this is the group Trump referred to when mentioning U.S. military strikes in Nigeria,” said Confidence MacHarry, senior analyst at Lagos-based SBM Intelligence. “They’ve also been linked to widespread cattle theft, with most of the stolen animals ending up in markets along the Nigeria-Niger border."

But Adamu questioned whether the strikes would do much to counter the insurgents, noting that the particular village hit was not previously known for harbouring militants.

"We were told the Nigerian government okayed the attack, but why Jabo when there is no record of any group there?" he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:35:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WTIZZR45R5K4DFWVYXFDTRPUBI.jpg?auth=dbab212b106daa523fcdd101e0b38d3f2dc9cadd2283e756e21c1623f73c418e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia's ex-PM Najib ordered to serve 15 years in jail in 1MDB case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysias-ex-pm-najib-ordered-serve-15-years-jail-1mdb-case-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Friday sentenced former premier Najib Razak to serve 15 years in prison after convicting him on multiple counts of abuse of power and money laundering over his role in the multibillion-dollar fraud scandal at state fund 1MDB.

"Preliminary investigation indicates this was a rolling terror attack that began in the city of Beit Shean, where a pedestrian was run over," the police said in a statement.

"Later, a young woman was stabbed near Road 71, and the suspect was ultimately engaged with gunfire near Maonot Junction in Afula following intervention by a civilian bystander," it said, adding that the attacker was hospitalised with injuries.

The war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and sparked a surge of violence in Israel and the occupied West Bank , with a rise in attacks by Palestinian militants as well as Israeli settler violence against Palestinians.

The U.S. has amassed a huge military presence in the Caribbean, killed dozens in strikes on boats near the Venezuelan coast it alleges were carrying drugs, and seized two fully-loaded Venezuelan crude tankers. President Donald Trump has said it would be smart for Maduro to leave power.

Hundreds of people in Venezuela's capital Caracas and other parts of the South American nation took to the streets after the July 2024 presidential election, banging pots and pans and blocking roads, demanding the opposition be declared victors.

At least 2,000 people were arrested in post-election violence, according to the government, whose top prosecutor in the following moments announced the release of several groups of detainees, including dozens aged under 18.

Venezuela's electoral authority and Supreme Court said Maduro had won the election and that the protests sought to undermine his victory for a third six-year term.

Late on Christmas Day, the penitentiary services ministry said on social media that authorities had "decided to evaluate each case individually and grant precautionary measures in accordance with the law, which has led to the release of 99 citizens."

It said the group had been detained "for their participation in acts of violence and incitement to hatred following the 2024 election day."

The Committee for the Freedom of Social Activists, a local NGO, said on X that this "number does not correspond to reality."

Penal Forum, another NGO, said they had only been able to confirm the release of 45 people - 27 men, 15 women and three teenagers, who had been "arbitrarily detained for political reasons."

"We continue to verify other possible cases," it said.

Maduro's government says it does not have political prisoners but rather "imprisoned politicians" who seek to destabilize the country.

Earlier in December, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that repression of civic space in the South American nation had intensified, stifling people's freedoms as journalists, activists, opposition figures and humanitarian workers face threats, harassment and arbitrary detention.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:45:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel recognises Somaliland, Somalia's breakaway region, as independent state</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-recognises-somaliland-somalias-breakway-region-independent-state-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Israel has recognised Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia, as an "independent and sovereign state," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, making Israel the first country to do so.

The Southern Transitional Council, backed by the United Arab Emirates , said the strikes happened in Yemen’s Hadramout governorate. It wasn’t immediately clear if there were any casualties from the strikes that further raise tensions in the war-torn nation and put at risk a fragile Saudi-led coalition that has been battling the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the country’s north for a decade.

The separatists said they would not be deterred by the strikes, but added that they remained open to working with Riyadh.

“The Council affirms that such actions will not serve any path of understanding and will not deter the people of the South from continuing to move forward toward restoring their full rights,” the STC said in a statement.

Still, the group said it was open to “any coordination or arrangements” that guarantee security and unity in the South, prevent the return of security threats and meet both the aspirations of the southern population and shared interests with Saudi Arabia.

Amr Al Bidh, a foreign affairs special representative for the Council, said in a statement that its fighters had been operating in eastern Hadramout on Friday after facing “multiple ambushes” from gunmen. Those attacks killed two fighters with the STC and wounded 12 others, Al Bidh said.

The Saudi strikes happened after that, he added.

The STC later described their operations in the area as seeking a wanted man and trying to cut off smuggling through the area.

Faez bin Omar, a leading member in a coalition of tribes in Hadramout, said he believed the strikes served as a warning to the STC to withdraw its fighters from the area. An eyewitness to the strikes, Ahmed al-Khed, said he saw destroyed military vehicles afterward, believed to belong to forces allied to the STC.

The STC’s satellite channel AIC aired what appeared to be mobile phone footage it described as showing the strikes. In one video, a man speaking could be heard blaming the strike on Saudi aircraft.

Officials in Saudi Arabia did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, the kingdom called on the Emirati-backed separatists in southern Yemen to withdraw.

The Council moved earlier this month into Yemen’s governorates of Hadramout and Mahra . That had pushed out forces affiliated with the Saudi-backed National Shield Forces, another group in the coalition fighting the Houthis.

Those aligned with the Council have increasingly flown the flag of South Yemen, which was a separate country from 1967-1990. Demonstrators rallied on Thursday in the southern port city of Aden to support political forces calling for South Yemen to secede again from Yemen.

Following the capture of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north by the Houthis in 2014, Aden has been the seat of power for the internationally recognised government and forces aligned against the rebels.

The actions by the separatists have put pressure on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the OPEC+ oil cartel, but also have competed for influence and international business in recent years.

The UAE said in a statement Friday that it “welcomed the efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to support security and stability" in Yemen.

“The UAE reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to supporting all endeavours aimed at strengthening stability and development in Yemen, contributing positively to regional security and prosperity,” it added.

There has also been an escalation of violence in Sudan, another nation on the Red Sea, where the kingdom and the Emirates support opposing forces in that country’s ongoing war.

The Iranian-backed Houthis seized Sanaa in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognised government into exile. Iran denies arming the rebels, although Iranian-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen despite a UN arms embargo.

A Saudi-led coalition armed with US weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015. Years of inconclusive fighting have pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine.

The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the globe’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.

The Houthis, meanwhile, have launched attacks on hundreds of ships in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war, greatly disrupting regional shipping.

Further chaos in Yemen could again draw in the United States.

Washington launched an intense bombing campaign targeting the rebels earlier this year that US President Donald Trump halted just before his trip to the Middle East in October. The Biden administration also conducted strikes against the Houthis, including using B-2 bombers to target what it described as underground bunkers used by the Houthis.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:23:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1b4b4586-e262-11f0-a9da-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25359617616473.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone attack kills two soldiers in Chad near Sudan border, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/drone-attack-kills-two-soldiers-chad-near-sudan-border-sources-say-2025-12-26/</link><description>N'DJAMENA, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A drone attack killed two Chadian soldiers at a military camp near the Sudan border before dawn on Friday, local authorities and a security source said, adding it was not immediately clear who was behind the strike.

Two people were killed and one seriously injured in the attack on the border town of Tine, said Hamit Hassan, prefect of the department that includes Tine. He said he had no information on who was responsible.

A Chadian military intelligence officer told Reuters the drone came from Sudan but it was unclear whether it was launched by the country’s army or paramilitary Rapid Support Force.

"We are still in the process of confirming the origin of this drone. If it is a Sudanese military drone, we will exercise our right to retaliate," the officer, who asked not to be named because he wasn't authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters.

"The air force base in (the eastern city) Abeche is already on high alert and ground reinforcements are already in Tine."

Sudan's army and the RSF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tine serves as a transit camp for Sudanese refugees who later move on to safer camps away from the border, though humanitarian sources say a lack of funds to provide water, sanitation and shelter at inland camps has slowed relocation efforts.

The announcement Friday came hours after the United Nations human rights office released South Korea’s response to investigators urging Seoul to spell out concrete plans to address the grievances of adoptees sent abroad with falsified records or abused by foreign parents.

The issue had rarely been discussed at the UN level, even as South Korea faces growing pressure to confront widespread fraud and abuse that plagued its adoption programme, particularly during a boom in the 1970s and 1980s when it annually sent thousands of children to the West.

The country will phase out foreign adoptions over a five-year period, aiming to reach zero by 2029 at the latest as it tightens welfare policies for children in need of care, Vice Minister of Health and Welfare Lee Seuran said during a briefing.

Watch more South Korean adoption scandal: Belgian adoptees seek justice

South Korea approved foreign adoptions of 24 children in 2025, down from around 2,000 in 2005 and an annual average of more than 6,000 during the 1980s.

In the health ministry’s briefing and response to the UN, officials focused on future improvements rather than past problems.

“Adoptions were mainly handled by private adoption agencies before, and while they presumably prioritised the best interests of the child, there may have also been other competing interests,” Lee said.

“Now, with the adoption system being restructured into a public framework, and with the Health Ministry and the government having a larger role in the process for approving adoptions, we have an opportunity to reassess whether international adoption is truly a necessary option,” she added, citing efforts to promote domestic adoptions.

UN investigators, including special rapporteurs on trafficking, enforced or involuntary disappearances and child abuse, raised the adoption issue with Seoul after months of communication with Yooree Kim. The 52-year-old was sent to a French family in 1984 without her biological parents’ consent, based on documents falsely describing her as an abandoned orphan.

Kim said she endured severe physical and sexual abuse by her adopters and petitioned the UN as part of a broader effort to seek accountability from governments and adoption agencies in South Korea and France .

Citing broader systemic issues and Kim’s case, UN investigators criticised South Korea for failing to give adoptees effective access to remedies for serious abuses and for the “possible denial of their rights to truth, reparations, and memorialisation”.

They also voiced concern over the suspension of a government fact-finding investigation into past adoption abuses and fraud, despite reports of grave violations including cases that may amount to enforced disappearances.

In its response, South Korea highlighted past reforms focused on abuse prevention including a 2011 law that reinstated judicial oversight of foreign adoptions, which ended decades of control by private agencies and resulted in a significant drop in international placements.

South Korea also cited recent steps to centralise adoption authority.

However, the government said further adoption investigations and stronger reparations for victims would hinge on future legislation. It offered no new measures to address the vast backlog of inaccurate or falsified records that have blocked many adoptees from reconnecting with birth families or learning the truth about their origins.

Choi Jung Kyu, a human rights lawyer representing Kim, called South Korea’s response “perfunctory”. He noted that promises of stronger reparations, which were meant to reduce the need for victims to litigate, are not clearly spelled out in draft bills proposing a relaunch of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses.

The government also vetoed a bill in April that would have removed the statute of limitations for state-related human rights violations, although that was before President Lee Jae-myung took office in June. Lee issued an apology in October over past adoption problems, as recommended by the truth commission.

Choi, who represents multiple plaintiffs suing the government over human rights abuses under past dictatorships, said they often face prolonged legal battles when authorities dismiss truth commission findings as inconclusive or cite expired statutes of limitations.

Kim, who could not immediately be reached for comment, filed a rare petition for compensation against the South Korean government in August, noting that authorities at the time of her adoption falsely documented her as an orphan despite having a family.

Following a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the US and Australia, the truth commission in March recognised Kim and 55 other adoptees as victims of human rights violations including falsified child origins, lost records and child protection failures.

That was weeks before the commission halted its adoption investigation following internal disputes among commissioners over which cases warranted recognition as problematic. The fate of the remaining 311 cases, either deferred or incompletely reviewed, hinges on whether lawmakers establish a new truth commission through legislation.

The commission’s findings acknowledged state responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption programme rife with fraud and abuse. The programme was driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children’s backgrounds and origins. The findings largely aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press.

The AP investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to send some 200,000 Korean children overseas despite evidence that many were procured through questionable or unscrupulous means.

Seoul’s past military governments passed special laws promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and giving vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment procedures while shipping thousands of children overseas each year.

Western nations largely ignored the abuses and sometimes pressured South Korea to maintain the supply to meet their high demand for babies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:27:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b58e7d0c-e271-11f0-bc30-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360246423921.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New York plans patriotic NYE ball drop to mark USA's 250th birthday</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251226-new-york-plans-patriotic-nye-ball-drop-mark-usa-250th-year</link><description>When the ball drops on New Year’s Eve in New York City, it will sparkle in red, white and blue, ushering in 2026 and kicking off months of celebrations for the nation’s upcoming 250th birthday.

The patriotic touches at this year’s Times Square gathering, including a second confetti drop, will offer an early glimpse of what’s ahead: hundreds of events and programmes, big and small, planned nationwide to mark the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

“I’m telling you right now, whatever you’re imagining, it’s going to be much more than that,” said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the bipartisan commission created by Congress in 2016 to organise the semiquincentennial anniversary. “It’s going to be one for the ages, the most inspirational celebration this country and maybe the world has ever seen.”

Rios and her group worked with the Times Square Alliance business district and One Times Square, the building from which the ball drops, to make the changes to this year’s ceremonies. They're also planning a second ball drop on July 3, the eve of the nation’s birthday, “in the same beautiful style that Times Square knows how to do it", Rios said.

It will mark the first time in 120 years that there will be a ball drop in Times Square that doesn't occur on New Year’s Eve, she said.

A New Year’s Eve ball was first dropped in Times Square in 1907. Built by a young immigrant metalworker named Jacob Starr, the 700-pound (318-kilogramme), 5-foot- (1.5-metre-) diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs.

Last year, the Constellation Ball, the ninth and largest version, was unveiled. It measured about 12 feet (3.7 metres) in diameter and weighs nearly 12,000 pounds (5,400 kilogrammes).

The only years no ball drop occurred were 1942 and 1943, when the city instituted a nightly “dimout” during World War II to protect itself from attacks. Crowds instead celebrated the new year with a moment of silence followed by chimes rung from the base of One Times Square.

This year, the stroke of midnight will also mark the official launch of America Gives, a national service initiative created by America250. Organisers hope to make 2026 the largest year of volunteer hours ever aggregated in the country.

On the following day, America250 will participate in the New Year’s Day Rose Parade in Pasadena, California , with a float themed “Soaring Onward Together for 250 Years". It will feature three larger-than-life bald eagles representing the country’s past, present and future.

“We want to ring in this new year from sea to shining sea. What better way to think about it than going from New York to California,” Rios said. "This has to be community-driven, this has be grassroots. We’re going from Guam to Alaska, from Fairbanks to Philadelphia, and everything in between.”

President Donald Trump has also announced the “Freedom 250” initiative to coordinate additional events for the 250th anniversary.

Rios said she sees the wide range of celebrations and programmes planned for the coming months, from large fireworks displays and statewide potluck suppers to student contests and citizen oral histories, as an opportunity to unite a politically divided nation.

“If we can find something for everyone ... having those menus of options that people can pick and choose how they want to participate," she said. “That’s how we’re going to get to engaging 350 million Americans.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:50:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8b3db77c-e274-11f0-aa0c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25358639593329.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More rain expected in drenched California before drier weekend</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/more-rain-expected-drenched-california-before-drier-weekend-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Storm-hit Southern California was at risk on Friday of more floods hampering millions of motorists traveling after Christmas, but the National Weather Service predicts a drier weekend.

The holiday deluge that started in earnest on Christmas Eve was spawned by the region's latest atmospheric storm, a vast airborne current of dense moisture siphoned from the Pacific, that swept inland over the greater Los Angeles area.

It dumped 6 inches of rain in the Los Angeles area with up to 18 inches of rain in the mountains, washing out some roads, and spurred evacuations and some shelter-in-place orders.

An additional 1-to-3 inches of rain is expected on Friday, said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, a commercial forecasting company.

"Our overall picture is that there's just one more day of this mess, mostly across Southern California, specifically in the LA area," Kines said on Friday. "We still have some issues today with bouts of heavy rain, but this weekend is mainly dry, thankfully."

More than 14.5 million Californians were expected to travel by car over the Christmas holiday, according to AAA. The coming drier weather should make traveling easier, after days of slick or flooded roads, forecasters said.

The atmospheric river that brought the trouble will wind down through Friday across California with lingering heavy rainfall, heavy mountain snow, and gusty winds.

Many of the evacuation warnings issued in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties were lifted on Christmas Day. But the orders remain on Friday in the hard-hit town of Wrightwood, a rural community with a population of about 5,000 in the San Gabriel Mountains on the border between Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.

Aerial video footage posted online on Christmas Eve by the fire department showed rivers of mud coursing through inundated cabin neighborhoods, and mud-covered cars and homes.

Videos posted online on Thursday showed some residents scrambling over washed-out roads, picking through rubble on Christmas Day as streams of water still flowed over mounds of mud and into gullies that were once streets.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:19:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JOKXC5YHOVKINJKC2APJTAS2P4.jpg?auth=eaa7c3f54390f5b93e08cc21058549809215af1ebb84c18604e800d986724aac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio spoke with Honduras President-elect Asfura after election victory</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rubio-spoke-with-honduras-president-elect-asfura-after-election-victory-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Honduran President-elect Nasry Asfura to congratulate him on his victory, the State Department said on Friday.

Throughout his long political career, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had repeatedly singled out the Iranian Republic as Israel’s number one enemy, saying its nuclear program had one goal: the destruction of the Jewish state.

Meanwhile Iran had long called for Israel’s destruction and provided arms for its opponents in Gaza and Lebanon .

What was unclear was how a conflict between the two adversaries – both of which have considerable military might – could play out.

The question was answered in the early hours of June 13, 2025, as explosions were heard in the Iranian capital Tehran and Netanyahu announced that operation “Rising Lion” had begun.

The armed conflict between the two arch enemies drew in neighbouring countries Jordan and Qatar as well as the US , whose President Donald Trump dubbed it the “12-day war”.

Throughout 2024, Iran and Israel had been launching small-scale attacks on each other, with Tehran firing missiles and drones at Israel while Tel Aviv’s fighter jets targeted Iran’s missile launchers and aerial defences.

But the tit-for-tat skirmishes paled in comparison to Israel’s surprise operation launched on June 13. Overnight, 200 planes targeted military sites throughout Iran and the regime’s major nuclear sites at Natanz, Fordo and Isfahan.

Within a few hours, Israel had seized control of Iranian airspace, and in the 12 days that followed, its air force carried out operations across Iran’s territory.

Israel launched 360 attacks in 27 Iranian provinces throughout the 12-day war, with a third striking Tehran, according to US-based monitor ACLED .

Part of the success of operation “Rising Lion” came down to Israel’s use of of First Person View (FPV) drones , which can be operated remotely using an onboard camera. They were flown by Mossad agents working undercover inside Iran to target sensitive infrastructure and high-profile members of the regime from the conflict's first hours.

By the evening of June 13, Israel had overwhelmed Iran’s air defence system, carried out strikes on several Iranian cities and eliminated at least twenty of the regime’s senior officers.

These included Iran’s highest-ranking military officer, Mohammad Bagher, and Revolutionary Guards commander-in-chief Hossein Salami.

Nine of Iran’s top scientists were killed by targeted strikes in what French newspaper Le Monde described as a “decisive blow” to Tehran’s nuclear program.

Over the next 12 days, a total of 16 scientists would be killed by Israel.

Days after first launching the attack, Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was trying to eliminate Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

Trump said on June 17 that the US forces knew “exactly” where Khamenei was hiding but would not try to eliminate him – “at least not for now”.

Ultimately, Israel did not topple Iran’s longtime leader, but its 12-day assault on Iran did considerably weaken the regime’s military might.

“We have set Iran's nuclear project back by years, and the same goes for its missile program,” said Israeli army chief of staff Eyal Zamir on June 25.

Iran's stockpile of 2,500 ballistic missiles was reduced to a maximum of 1,500, and two-thirds of its missile launchers were destroyed, according to figures from the Israeli army.

In the Iranian capital, strikes targeted government buildings, state media outlets, universities and the infamous Evin prison .

They also hit civilians. Iran’s health ministry said that 610 civilians were killed and 4,700 wounded during the 12-day conflict. It did not say how many members of the military had been killed or wounded.

As Israel launched its attack on Iran, Tehran was quick to respond.

Khamenei issued a statement on June 13 assuring Iranians that Israel would “not remain unscathed from the consequences” of its attack and that the Iranian response would “not be half-measured”.

By the evening of June 13, Iran launched Operation Honest Promise 3, firing Shahed drones and hypersonic missiles towards Israel.

Air raid sirens sounded across the country as missiles flew across the sky above Jerusalem and strikes caused fires in buildings in Tel Aviv.

Iran fired least 150 missiles overnight, according to estimates from the Israeli army, most of which were intercepted with help from the United States and Jordan.

Major targets included Israel's “Pentagon”, the Kirya, and the country’s nuclear facilities. At least two people were killed and around 60 wounded, according to emergency services.

Over the coming days, the Israeli army banned the sharing of videos or photos on social media showing the damage caused by Iranian bombing,

But missile salvos caused significant damage in Israeli towns and cities, an oil refinery in Haifa, power plants, water treatment plants, Soroka Hospital in Beer-Sheva and the research centre at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot.

Iran fired some 550 missiles and 1,000 drones, 90 percent of which were intercepted by Israel and its allies, according to the Israeli army.

Some 36 direct hits on populated areas killed at least 28 civilians and injured 3,000, according to ACLED.

Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz mapped the damage caused by Iranian missiles in urban centres, finding that 480 buildings were damaged in Tel Aviv across five separate sites, “obliterating” some neighbourhoods.

In the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, 237 buildings were damaged across three sites, with around ten being severely damaged.

In Bat Yam, another Tel Aviv suburb, 78 buildings were damaged by a single strike, with 22 of them subsequently condemned for demolition.

Israelis submitted 40,000 compensation claims to the authorities for damage caused by Iran’s attacks, but the population as a whole were overwhelmingly supportive of their prime minister's decision to attack Iran.

As Israel and Iran traded strikes, the US delayed joining the war alongside Tel Aviv. “I may do it, I may not do it,”Trump said on June 18 – day five of the conflict. “Nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

In previous months Trump had urged Netanyahu not to attack Iran as he sought to reach a nuclear deal with Tehran, but was quick to praise Israel’s strikes on the first day of the war as “excellent” and “very successful”.

Meanwhile, Israel was pressing Trump to provide it with “bunker buster” bombs to deliver a fatal blow to Iran's nuclear programme.

The US finally deployed its GBU-57 bombs – 13-ton laser-guided munitions designed to destroy underground bunkers – overnight on June 21 as part of operation "Midnight Hammer".

Seven B2 stealth bombers carrying the munitions took off from the US state of Missouri and entered Iranian airspace, where they targeted the two main sites for the production and storage of enriched uranium buried dozens of metres underground at the Fordo and Natanz sites.

Hidden in desert areas in central Iran, defences at the two sites had already been weakened by Israel's air strikes.

At Fordo, 12 bunker-buster bombs were dropped successively on two ventilation shafts, according to the US military . Two other bombs were dropped on the Natanz site, while US Navy submarines fired two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at the Nuclear Technology Center in Isfahan.

Trump announced that Iran's main nuclear sites had been “completely and totally destroyed” by the strikes, although US intelligence later contradicted this claim .

Two days later, Iran retaliated by bombing the largest US base in the Middle East , Al-Udeid in Qatar .

But Tehran had warned Washington in advance of the strikes, and the dozen missiles caused no American casualties.

Claiming the US had achieved its objectives by preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, Trump took to his social media network on June 24 to declare an end to the war.

“It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE… an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Israel and Iran continued to launch attacks on each other for a few hours, with final strikes targeting the Iranian capital and Beer-Sheva in southern Israel, before fighting stopped – and both sides claimed victory.

Netanyahu claimed a "historic" triumph for his country and warned that Israel would “thwart” any future attempts by Iran to revive its nuclear program.

Iran's top security body, meanwhile, said the Islamic Republic's forces had "compelled" Israel to "unilaterally" stand down.

Denmark was also traditionally thought of as a "frugal" member of the EU when it came to common expenditure. But all this has changed with the war in Ukraine and the long shadow that Russia casts over the Baltic and Nordic regions.

Denmark's stated priority for its presidency of the EU in 2025 is "A Competitive and Green Europe". Combining those two objectives has arguably become a strength for the kingdom, as it has long been a pioneer in green energy . Wind power, especially offshore, produces over 50 percent of the country's electricity needs. Danish Green MEP Rasmus Nordqvist joins us as we visit an iconic wind farm just off the coast of the capital Copenhagen .

Despite its small size, Denmark is also a major player when it comes to agriculture – especially on intensive farming. Here again it's a pioneer, becoming the first country in the world to tax livestock methane emissions, also known as a flatulence tax. Our team visit a dairy farm in Jutland to see the impact there.

Economically, Denmark has historically been export-oriented: its modest population and its maritime history mean it has long been outward facing when it comes to trade. Our team heads to the country's second-biggest container port at Fredericia, to discuss the effects of US President Donald Trump 's and China 's international tariffs . We meet MEP Niels Flemming Hansen, from the conservative European People's Party.

Finally, we tackle another key issue: Greenland . It's an autonomous territory in Denmark with a significant independence movement, and its strategic location and its natural resources make it a tempting target for the US president. Greenland was thrust into the international spotlight earlier this year because of Trump's sudden interest in the territory. Our team interview Jens Heinrich, the head of Greenland's representation in Denmark.

From Danish design and from pharma to farmers, our reporter Luke Brown visits some of the most emblematic sectors of the Danish economy, to gauge the impact of the global economic headwinds.

Denmark was also traditionally thought of as a "frugal" member of the EU when it came to common expenditure. But all this has changed with the war in Ukraine and the long shadow that Russia casts over the Baltic and Nordic regions.

We take a closer look at one of the key priorities of Denmark's EU presidency: Europe 's defence policy, in an era marked by the US retreat from Europe and Russia's increasingly aggressive posture. Indeed, Denmark has been dealing with a series of drone incursions over its territory. To discuss these issues, our team meets with one of the vice-presidents of the European Parliament , Danish MEP Christel Schaldemose from the Socialists and Democrats, as well as with the head of the Danish Defence Intelligence Service, Thomas Ahrenkiel.

We also illuminate a specifically Danish phenomenon: a left-leaning, Social Democratic-led government that pursues a very hard line on migration and asylum. It's a strategy that seems to be gaining ground in the EU. This December, EU member states gave the green light to tightening immigration policy, including the setting up of controversial "return hubs" outside the bloc.

At home, Denmark's move to crack down on what the government calls "parallel societies" has faced accusations that it discriminates against people of migrant heritage. To discuss these questions, we meet with former Renew MEP Karen Melchior from the European think tank CEPS (Centre for European Policy Studies), and we visit Nørrebro, a multicultural district of Copenhagen , where we watch local football team Nørrebro United.

Our reporter Charlotte Prudhomme investigates the impact of fake news in Denmark, and the efforts being made to counter them.

And our reporter Luke Brown meets the people most affected by Denmark’s hard line on immigration: two young women who fled Syria a decade ago. We discuss how they cope with the uncertainty of not knowing if they'll be able to stay in Denmark.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, has become Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending much of his adult life in and out of detention due to his activism, and a rare symbol of opposition to a far-reaching crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

The lengthy imprisonment of Abd el-Fattah, who obtained British citizenship through his mother, Laila Soueif, in 2021, and his repeated hunger strikes alongside her prompted widespread international pleas for his release.

She confirmed his return on Facebook: "Praise be to Allah, Alaa reached London safely".

In a longer statement, his family said he flew to Britain on Friday from Cairo after his travel ban was lifted by Egyptian authorities on December 20. The statement said he would shortly be reunited with his 14-year-old son Khaled, who lives in Brighton in southern England with his mother.

"I'm delighted that Alaa Abd el-Fattah is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief," Starmer said on social media platform X.

"I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment."

Despite campaigns calling for Abd el-Fattah's release, notably during the COP27 climate summit that Egypt hosted in 2022 , Sisi pardoned him in September this year, having ordered authorities to study his possible pardon . Abd el-Fattah's name had been removed from Egypt's "terrorism" list months earlier.

On Friday, Starmer also thanked the president for his decision to grant the pardon.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:16:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man arrested after three women stabbed on Paris metro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251226-man-arrested-after-three-women-stabbed-on-paris-metro</link><description>French police on Friday arrested a man suspected of stabbing three women in the Paris metro as the capital's end-of-year festivities were in full swing, prosecutors told AFP.

The attacks took place at around 4pm on Line 3, where the suspect allegedly stabbed three women at the République, Arts-et-Métiers and Opéra stations, according to the Paris prosecutor’s office.

The man was identified using surveillance-camera footage, and officers tracked the geolocation of his mobile phone to locate and arrest him later in the afternoon in the Val d’Oise region north of Paris.

Prosecutors said they were not immediately able to specify the extent of the victims’ injuries.

The researchers' assessment broadly aligns with U.S. intelligence findings, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share information not authorized for public release.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made clear his intention to place intermediate-range Oreshnik missiles, with an estimated range of up to 3,400 miles (5,500 km), in Belarus, but the exact location has not been previously reported.

Deployment of the Oreshnik would underscore the Kremlin’s growing reliance on the threat of nuclear weapons as it seeks to deter NATO members from supplying Kyiv with weapons that can strike deep inside Russia, some experts said.

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Belarus Embassy declined to comment. The state-run Belta news agency quoted Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin on Wednesday as saying that the Oreshnik’s deployment would not alter the balance of power in Europe and was “our response” to the West’s “aggressive actions.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the CIA declined to comment.

Researchers Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in California, and Decker Eveleth of the CNA research and analysis organization in Virginia, said they based their finding regarding the deployment of Oreshniks on imagery from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, that showed features consistent with a Russian strategic missile base.

Lewis and Eveleth said they were 90 percent certain that mobile Oreshnik launchers would be stationed at the former airbase near Krichev, some 190 miles (307 km) east of the Belarus capital of Minsk, and 300 miles (478 km) southwest of Moscow.

Moscow tested a conventionally armed Oreshnik – Russian for Hazel tree - against a target in Ukraine in November 2024. Putin boasts that it's impossible to intercept because of velocities reportedly exceeding Mach 10.

Putin plans to deploy the weapon “in Belarus to extend its range further into Europe,” said John Foreman, an expert with the Chatham House who served as a British defense attache in Moscow and Kyiv.

Foreman said he also sees such a move as a reaction to the planned stationing in Germany next year by the U.S. of conventional missiles that include the intermediate-range hypersonic Dark Eagle.

The Oreshnik’s deployment would come with only weeks left before the expiration of 2010 New START pact, the last U.S.-Russia treaty limiting deployments of strategic nuclear weapons by the world’s biggest nuclear powers.

Putin said after a December 2024 meeting with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, that the Oreshnik could be stationed in Belarus in the second half of this year - part of a revised strategy in which Moscow is basing nuclear weapons outside its territory for the first time since the Cold War.

Lukashenko last week said that the first missiles had been deployed without mentioning a location.

Lukashenko said up to 10 Oreshniks would be based in Belarus. The American researchers assessed that the site is large enough to accommodate only three launchers and that others may be based at another location.

U.S. President Donald Trump works to reach a deal with Moscow to end its war in Ukraine, which has been urging its Western allies to send weapons that can reach deep inside Russia.

Trump for now has rejected Kyiv’s request for Tomahawk cruise missiles, capable of striking Moscow. Britain and France have supplied cruise missiles to Ukraine. Germany in May announced it will co-produce long-range missiles with Ukraine with no limits on their range or targeting.

The American researchers said reviews of the Planet Labs imagery revealed a hurried construction project that began between August 4-12 and showed features consistent with those of a Russian strategic missile base.

One “dead giveaway” in a November 19 photo is a “military-grade rail transfer point” enclosed by a security fence to which missiles, their mobile launchers and other components could be delivered by train, said Eveleth.

Another feature, said Lewis, is the pouring at the end of the runway of a concrete pad that then was covered with earth that he called “consistent with a camouflaged launch point.

Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based expert on Russia’s nuclear forces, said he was skeptical deploying the Oreshnik would provide Moscow with any additional military or political advantages other than reassuring Belarus of its protection.

“I don’t see how this would be seen in the West...as kind of different from these being deployed in Russia,” he said.

But Lewis said deploying the Oreshnik in Belarus underscored how Russia’s stationing of nuclear weapons outside its territory sent a “political message” of its increased reliance on them.

“Can you imagine if we put a nuclear-armed Tomahawk (cruise missile) in Germany instead of just the conventional ones?” Lewis said. “There is no military reason to put the system in Belarus, only political ones.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:38:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WNWMR54JURLYPCLBDGCLPKPVYE.jpg?auth=5eb5dfaab54de26e837db37339f078f74d3ae5a14bbabae893da9718e1aaf367&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's top court orders detention of ex- head of highway police after escape attempt</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-top-court-orders-detention-ex-head-highway-police-after-escape-attempt-2025-12-26/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Brazil Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Friday ordered the preventive detention of the former head of the country's federal highway police, who was captured in Paraguay, according to a court document seen by Reuters and information from two people familiar with the matter.

Silvinei Vasques, who served under former President Jair Bolsonaro, was caught while trying to board a plane at Asuncion airport in neighboring Paraguay, in an attempt to reach El Salvador, after breaking a court-ordered ankle monitor.

Vasques was recently sentenced to 24 years and six months in prison for his role in a 2023 attempted coup , the same incident for which Bolsonaro is now serving a 27-year sentence for orchestrating the plot.

The former cop, who was not yet in jail, apparently broke his electronic ankle monitor while in Brazil's southern state of Santa Catarina, prompting security alerts at border checkpoints, according to the Supreme Court document.

Vasques, caught with a fake Paraguayan passport, planned the escape using a rented car and even took his dog with him, the document said, adding that the attempt to flee warranted converting precautionary measures like the electronic tag into preventive detention.

Reached by Reuters, Vasques' attorney did not comment on his client´s attempt to flee.

Vasques is not the first official convicted over the 2023 coup attempt who has tried to flee Brazil. In November, the Supreme Court ordered the arrest of the former intelligence agency director Alexandre Ramagem, who left the country in September and has since been living in the United States.

That same month, Moraes ordered Bolsonaro be detained after the former president tried to remove his court-ordered ankle monitor using a soldering iron. Bolsonaro was then under house arrest.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:23:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZN6ET5HN5JLR3MXEAP4TLRLU2M.jpg?auth=ca43379f7fb6c688b10b8fb5d0ba8f9726d411caca7631e803788db97aaf2335&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says Russia using Belarus territory to circumvent Ukrainian defences</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/zelenskiy-says-russia-using-belarus-territory-circumvent-ukrainian-defences-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that Russia was using ordinary apartment blocks on the territory of its ally Belarus to attack Ukrainian targets and circumvent Kyiv's defences.

The Kremlin used Belarusian territory to launch its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and Belarus remains a steadfast ally, though longstanding President Alexander Lukashenko has vowed to commit no troops to the conflict.

"We note that the Russians are trying to bypass our defensive interceptor positions through the territory of neighbouring Belarus. This is risky for Belarus," Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram after a military staff meeting.

"It is unfortunate that Belarus is surrendering its sovereignty in favour of Russia's aggressive ambitions."

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian intelligence had observed that Belarus was deploying equipment to carry out its attacks "in Belarusian settlements near the border, including on residential buildings.

"Antennae and other equipment are located on the roofs of ordinary five-storey apartment buildings, which help guide 'Shaheds' (Russian drones) to targets in our western regions. This is an absolute disregard for human lives, and it is important that Minsk stops playing with this."

The Russian and Belarusian defence ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Zelenskiy said the staff meeting also discussed ways of financing interceptor drones, which officials in Kyiv see as the best economically viable means of tackling Russian drone attacks, which have grown in intensity in recent months.

The president said the Ukrainian military's general staff had been charged with working out changes to strategy in fending off air attacks "to defend infrastructure and frontline positions."

Lukashenko this month said Russia's Oreshnik ballistic missile system, described by Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin as impossible to intercept, had been deployed to Belarus and entered active combat duty.

An assessment by two U.S. researchers, reported by Reuters on Friday , said Moscow was likely stationing the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik at a former air base in eastern Belarus, a development that could bolster Russia’s ability to deliver missiles across Europe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 21:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NFKAV6CM5BPNNHDXJYBYKTGNOI.jpg?auth=dc84c1ada42e2b578f14e8e7e4c5046669d74fb2544ee70faef4743c152a97d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelans held in Salvadoran prison look to challenge deportation in US court</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/venezuelans-held-salvadoran-prison-look-challenge-deportation-us-court-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - A group of Venezuelans who were sent to a maximum-security El Salvador prison from the U.S. and then returned to Venezuela called on Friday for the United States to comply with a ruling that would allow them to challenge their deportation in U.S. courts.

U.S. Judge James Boasberg ruled this week that President Donald Trump's administration must urgently arrange for the return of the hundreds of Venezuelans who were deported to El Salvador, saying their expulsion violated their due process rights and that they have the right to challenge their deportation in court.

Under the ruling, the Trump administration must present a plan to allow their return within two weeks.

"The court ruling now orders that we be granted the opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with the law in the United States," Ysqueibel Peñaloza, a former detainee, said on behalf of some 252 former prisoners.

"We call on the governments of the United States and El Salvador to fully comply with the court order. We demand that the authorities of that country create the conditions that will allow us to participate in the hearing."

Peñaloza asked for national and international help in their defense, without specifying what help they needed.

The Venezuelans were sent to El Salvador from the U.S. in March after Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemy Act - a little-used wartime law - to deport people classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, without carrying out hearings or usual migration procedures.

Many lawyers and family members denied the men in question had any links to gangs and said they were often left in the dark about the location of the detainees.

The deportations drew strong criticism from human rights groups and spawned a legal battle with the Trump administration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:20:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q3TXQ7MC7FLMJIDK75YNF4ZIF4.jpg?auth=d2e96fc1946bc602efada3990e4ed15629f4ccffbde29119b44fd87cc1d5ad4f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian capital Kyiv under massive Russian attack, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-capital-kyiv-under-massive-russian-attack-officials-say-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian capital Kyiv came under a massive Russian attack early on Saturday, with explosions sounding in the city, air defences in operation and the Ukrainian military saying missiles were being deployed.

The Russian action took place two days before a meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he is due to hold in the United States with President Donald Trump to work out details of an accord for settling the nearly four-year-old war pitting Russia against Ukraine.

Reuters eyewitnesses said air defences were in action in the city and unofficial Telegram channels reported explosions.

A military Telegram channel said cruise and ballistic missiles were being deployed in the city.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 03:24:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>بيان لوزارة الدفاع الكمبودية: تايلاند وكمبوديا توقعان اتفاقا لوقف إطلاق النار</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-cambodia-sign-ceasefire-agreement-cambodian-defence-ministry-says-2025-12-27/</link><description>بانكوك 27 ديسمبر كَانُون ٱلْأَوَّل (رويترز) - أعلنت وزارة الدفاع الكمبودية في بيان لها أن تايلاند وكمبوديا وقعتا اتفاقا لوقف إطلاق النار اليوم السبت، وذلك بعد ثلاثة أيام من المحادثات بين الجارتين الواقعتين في جنوب شرق آسيا واللتين خاضتا اشتباكات حدودية عنيفة لأسابيع.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:07:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RSJQETYPTFJUVLQBN32DYO7BLY.jpg?auth=2c2c98f52619d096eef373d750b17643b11f7ce79ee1dc3cc88aab04e6a92672&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones, missiles pound Ukraine before Zelenskiy-Trump meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drones-missiles-pound-ukraine-before-zelenskiy-trump-meeting-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Russia attacked Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine with missiles and drones on Saturday, ahead of what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said would be a key meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to work out a deal to end nearly four years of war.

Before the overnight attacks, Zelenskiy said his talks in Florida on Sunday would focus on the territory to be controlled by each side after a halt to the fighting that began in February 2022 with President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Russia's smaller neighbour, Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

Explosions sounded in Kyiv as Ukraine's air defence units went into action, and the military said on the Telegram messaging app that missiles were being deployed. The air force said Russian drones were targeting the capital and regions in the northeast and south.

An air raid alert remained in effect in the capital some four hours after being introduced. There were no immediate reports of damage or power cuts.

Russia made no immediate comment on the attacks.

On Thursday night, Russia struck Ukraine's energy infrastructure and stepped up attacks on the southern region of Odesa, the site of Ukraine's main seaports.

Amid the continued fierce fighting, territory remains the main diplomatic stumbling block. A 20-point draft in the U.S.-driven campaign to clinch a peace plan is 90% complete, Zelenskiy told journalists in Kyiv.

He said a security guarantee agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. was almost ready - a key element after guarantees in earlier post-Soviet years proved meaningless.

"A lot can be decided before the New Year," Zelenskiy told Politico.

Trump said the United States was the driving force behind the process.

"He doesn't have anything until I approve it," Trump told Politico. "So we'll see what he's got."

Zelenskiy told Axios the U.S. had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to guard against further Russian aggression.

Trump said he believed Sunday's meeting would go well. He also said he expected to speak with Putin "soon, as much as I want."

In addition to territory, a critical point is control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe's largest, seized by Russia in the opening weeks of the war.

Moscow demands that Ukraine withdraw from the areas of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian troops have failed to occupy in their drive to secure all of the Donbas, which also includes the Luhansk region.

Kyiv wants the fighting halted at the current lines.

Under a U.S. compromise, a free economic zone would be set up if Ukraine leaves parts of the Donetsk region, though details have yet to be worked out.

Axios quoted Zelenskiy as saying that if he is not able to push the U.S. to back Ukraine's "strong" position on the land issue, he was willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum - as long as Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold the vote.

He said he wanted more pressure applied to Russia.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Kyiv's version of the 20-point plan differed from what Russia had been discussing with the U.S., according to Interfax-Russia news agency.

But he expressed optimism that matters had reached a "turning point" in the search for a settlement.

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, spoke with members of the Trump administration after Moscow received U.S. proposals about a possible peace deal, the Kremlin said on Friday. It did not disclose how Moscow had viewed the documents.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:07:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ERFF4HEXTNODTFIJFGN5DA4ZCM.jpg?auth=9722bc7db3b121ab7ecea3b5bcceda55c2c25ab22c5caa2b78ef76884fc20368&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar goes to the polls amid civil war and humanitarian crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-goes-polls-amid-civil-war-humanitarian-crisis-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Myanmar heads to the polls on Sunday as it battles a civil war that has ravaged parts of the country as well as one of Asia's worst humanitarian crises.

Already one of Southeast Asia's poorest countries, Myanmar has been hammered by a conflict triggered by a 2021 coup in which the military ousted an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.

Myanmar's humanitarian crisis is one of the most severe in Asia, driven by the intensifying civil war and repeated natural disasters, including a massive earthquake in March.

The ruling junta has previously suppressed information about a severe food crisis gripping the country by pressuring researchers not to collect data about hunger and aid workers not to publish it, Reuters has reported , besides cracking down on journalists since the coup.

Myanmar is one of the world's most under-funded aid operations, with only 12% of required funds received, the United Nations says.

U.S. cuts to humanitarian aid are having a crushing impact on people, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar has said.

The UN estimates that 20 million of Myanmar's 51 million people need aid as soaring inflation and a plunging currency push about half the population below the poverty line.

More than 3.6 million people have been displaced from their homes, with over 6,800 civilians killed in the conflict triggered by the coup, according to UN estimates.

With mounting violence forcing increasing numbers of people to flee, more than 12 million in Myanmar will face acute hunger next year, including 1 million who will need lifesaving support, according to the UN's World Food Programme.

More than 16 million people across Myanmar are acutely food insecure, meaning that their lack of food threatens lives and livelihoods, WFP estimates.

They are the fifth-largest group needing aid anywhere in the world, making Myanmar "a hunger hotspot of very high concern," the agency said.

More than 540,000 children across the country are expected to suffer this year from acute malnutrition - life-threatening wasting that can have severe and lifelong effects – a 26% increase from last year, WFP said.

One in three children under the age of five is already suffering from stunted growth, according to WFP.

Myanmar's economy - once deemed as one of the region's most promising - has struggled in recent years, reeling from the civil war, natural disasters and mismanagement.

But despite the challenges, Myanmar's economy is showing some signs of improvement and its GDP growth is estimated to rebound to 3% in the next fiscal year, the World Bank said this month.

The projected growth is driven by post-earthquake reconstruction and continued targeted assistance for the hardest-hit areas, although inflation is expected to remain above 20%.

With electricity supply deteriorating, exposing millions of people to chronic blackouts, households and businesses are increasingly embracing solar energy for reliable power.

Russia, which has been building ties with the junta, signed an investment agreement with Myanmar in June that it said could open up new opportunities for Russian energy companies in the south Asian country.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:07:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZJDZTPOPFVKG5KQX3IJQR6GURM.jpg?auth=4a0fa285dc22d15abe1793d11eeb79723df381f246ea6ce88a576b166368e753&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Conflict and fear sap campaign energy ahead of Myanmar election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/conflict-fear-sap-campaign-energy-ahead-myanmar-election-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Campaigning ahead of Myanmar's general election that begins on Sunday has been shorn of the energy of previous polls, residents said, as voting is scheduled amid a civil war and a humanitarian crisis as well as wide criticism that it is a sham to help the junta perpetuate power.

Myanmar has been in the throes of a nationwide conflict since the military deposed an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup, alleging poll fraud in a general election held the preceding year.

Although the junta insists the election has popular backing, the vote has been widely criticised by the United Nations, Western governments and human rights groups as an attempt by the military to entrench its rule through political proxies.

Three residents of Myanmar's commercial capital Yangon, parts of which will vote on Sunday, said they remember past campaigns being rife with activity, including lively rallies, noisy road shows and large gatherings.

"This time, the candidates did not really come out on the streets. I only see sign boards on the streets about them," said a 31-year-old from Yangon, who asked not to be named because of security concerns.

"I am someone who goes out the whole day, but I don't see any candidates campaigning even for USDP and for smaller parties," he added, referring to the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party.

After the first phase on Sunday, the military-led administration will hold two more on January 11 and January 25 , covering areas across 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships.

Dates for counting votes and announcing the results have not been declared.

A decade ago, when Myanmar held its second election since the end of five decades of military rule in 2011, streets were awash with sign boards and flags in the signature red of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), creating a carnival-like atmosphere.

Even the 2020 election, subdued by COVID-19 restrictions, had a more visible campaign , four people said.

In the city of Mandalay, about 600 km (370 miles) north of Yangon, the lack of campaigning is palpable, with no sustained canvassing for votes just days ahead of the polls, two residents said.

"The only real activity is the setting up of campaign billboards," 36-year-old Nwe told Reuters, adding that the few rallies being held were under guard.

"When parties campaign in neighborhoods, they don't go alone," she said, "They travel in groups with security."

The USDP, led by former generals from Myanmar's armed forces known as the Tatmadaw, has the most visible campaign presence on the streets, all five voters said.

The United Nations said on Tuesday that civilians were being threatened over their participation in the polls, both by Myanmar's military authorities and by armed groups opposing the Tatmadaw.

"These elections are clearly taking place in an environment of violence and repression," said UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk.

All five residents interviewed by Reuters said they had received no direct instruction from junta officials asking them to vote, although there was fear of the consequences of not casting their ballot.

The shadow National Unity Government, which contains remnants of the NLD and other anti-junta entities, said it was not putting pressure on people to abstain from voting.

Mandalay resident Nwe said people worry that not voting could lead to travel restrictions and other repercussions.

"Rumors are rampant, so even though there is no official news, people are privately terrified," she said.

In Yangon, a 34-year-old resident said his family doesn't want him to vote, fearing that he might be included in a military conscription scheme that the Tatmadaw enacted in 2024.

"For me, I am scared of getting arrested if I don't vote," he told Reuters.

Ahead of the polls, Myanmar's junta has said the election is not being conducted with coercion, force or suppression.

In an opinion piece on Thursday, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar argued that observers were wrong to judge the upcoming polls by Western standards.

"They fail to see that for ordinary citizens, this election – however imperfect – is an exit strategy from the state of emergency and a path back into a legal framework," it said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:09:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LRWZGXWGEBLUNGFQLKXKMXMS3A.jpg?auth=63d5de6a5c6dc1cccabed1f06578fe62e426706a0c710b310117ce35aa3032e7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 7 killed in Vietnam after bus overturns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/least-7-killed-vietnam-after-bus-overturns-2025-12-27/</link><description>HANOI, Dec 27 (Reuters) - At least seven people died on Saturday when a bus carrying 19 passengers overturned on a mountainous road in Vietnam's northern province of Yen Bai, state-run media reported.

The 29-seat bus carrying a charity group was travelling downhill when it flipped and was crushed, according to Vietnam News Agency.

Rescue teams pulled 10 survivors from the wreckage, while others remained trapped as of 10:30 a.m. (0330 GMT) as heavy equipment was deployed to cut through the vehicle, Hoang Anh Tuan, chairman of Phinh Ho commune, told VNA.

Tuan said the crash was likely caused by brake failure.

Calls to authorities of Yen Bai province and Phinh Ho commune went unanswered.

Police, military units, local officials and residents were mobilised for rescue efforts, while authorities said an investigation into the cause of the accident was ongoing, according to VNA.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:52:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S.-backed airstrikes in Nigeria hit two ISIS-linked camps, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-backed-airstrikes-nigeria-hit-two-isis-linked-camps-government-says-2025-12-27/</link><description>LAGOS, Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S.-backed air strikes in Nigeria hit two Islamic State-linked camps in the Bauni forest of Sokoto State, targeting foreign fighters infiltrating from the Sahel, the Nigerian government said.

The strikes carried out on Thursday were approved by President Bola Tinubu and launched from maritime platforms domiciled in the Gulf of Guinea, after extensive intelligence gathering, operational planning, and reconnaissance, the information ministry said in a statement on Friday.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Thursday that U.S. forces had launched a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government. He said the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

"A total of 16 GPS-guided precision munitions were deployed using MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial platforms, successfully neutralising the targeted ISIS elements attempting to penetrate Nigeria from the Sahel corridor," the Nigerian government statement said.

Intelligence indicated the camps were being used by foreign ISIS elements working with local affiliates to plan large-scale attacks inside Nigeria, it added. No civilian casualties were reported, although debris fell in two towns in Sokoto and Kwara states.

Trump described the operation as “numerous perfect strikes” and warned there would be “more to come.”

The operation marks a rare joint action between Abuja and Washington and underscores growing security cooperation as Islamist violence spreads south from the Sahel.

Sokoto State authorities confirmed the strikes and urged residents to remain calm. “The ongoing operations are geared towards securing the state and ensuring the protection of lives and property,” the state government said.

Nigeria has battled Islamist insurgents for more than a decade, but the presence of foreign fighters linked to ISIS signals an escalation in the threat. The Nigerian government said it remains “fully committed to the protection of lives and property” and vowed further action against transnational extremist networks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D2ZJDB7AMVPU5C3YSCUW4ALY3U.jpg?auth=71b3a410e821b269427c5f7412d0e365548ce4741c7aa961fd1997985fa70e06&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's Saudi-led coalition says it will deal with military moves in Hadramout</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-saudi-led-coalition-says-it-will-deal-with-military-moves-hadramout-2025-12-27/</link><description>CAIRO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Yemen's Saudi-led coalition said any military moves by the main southern separatist group STC in the eastern province of Hadramout contrary to de-escalation efforts will be dealt with to protect civilians, the Saudi state news agency reported on Saturday.

The statement from the coalition spokesperson, General Turki al-Malki, was in response to a request from the head of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, to the coalition to take immediate measures to protect civilians in Hadramout from "violations committed armed groups affiliated with the STC".

The STC, which is supported by the United Arab Emirates, has pushed the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from its headquarters in Aden while claiming broad control across the south this month.

On Friday the STC rejected a Saudi call for its forces to withdraw from areas it seized earlier in December, saying it would continue securing the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DHIGYFAPQVIIVGRXLLRZQ4H27I.jpg?auth=24ec9fdc25b80ddfe088ebce9aca7faab43d36ce92e8c08425a1471822207b39&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China passes revised foreign trade law to bolster trade war capabilities</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-revised-foreign-trade-law-bolster-trade-war-capabilities-2025-12-27/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China on Saturday passed revisions to a key piece of legislation aimed at strengthening Beijing's ability to wage trade war, curb outbound shipments from strategic minerals to sex dolls, and further open its $19 trillion economy.

The latest revision to the Foreign Trade Law, approved by China's top legislative body, will take effect on March 1, 2026, state news agency Xinhua reported on Saturday.

The world's second-largest economy is overhauling its trade-related legal frameworks partly to convince members of a major trans-Pacific trade bloc created to counter China's growing influence that the manufacturing powerhouse deserves a seat at the table, as Beijing seeks to reduce its reliance on the U.S.

Adopted in 1994 and revised three times since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, most recently in 2022, the Foreign Trade Law empowers policymakers to hit back against trading partners that seek to curb its exports and to adopt mechanisms such as "negative lists" to open restricted sectors to foreign firms.

The revision also adds a provision that foreign trade should "serve national economic and social development" and help build China into a "strong trading nation", Xinhua said.

It further "expands and improves" the legal toolkit for countering external challenges, according to the report.

The revision focuses on areas such as digital and green trade, along with intellectual property provisions, key improvements China needs to make to meet the standards of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, rather than the trade defence tools the 2020 revamp honed in on following four years of tariff war with the first Trump administration.

Beijing is also sharpening the wording of its powers in anticipation of potential lawsuits from private firms, which are becoming increasingly prominent in China, according to trade diplomats.

"Ministries have become more concerned about private sector criticism," said one Western trade diplomat with decades' of experience working with China. "China is a rule-of-law country, so the government can stop a company's shipment, but it needs a reason."

"It's not totally lawless here. Better to have everything written out in black and white," they added, requesting anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak with media.

China's private exporting firms attracted global attention in November after the French government moved to suspend the Chinese e-commerce platform Shein amid an uproar over childlike sex dolls sold on its marketplace into the French market.

The Chinese government increasingly could also find itself at odds with private enterprise when seeking to carry out sweeping bans, such as Beijing's prohibition of all Japanese seafood imports, as Asia's top two economies continue to feud over Taiwan, trade diplomats say.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4WJ67X4DTNP37H6ZVA2L4FWAK4.jpg?auth=6e6bf242c2950dbe833f407d84c50416c28c8ead098ad6a3e1b1c62f3b6db035&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Poland temporarily closes two airports after Russian strikes on Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251227-live-poland-temporarily-closes-two-airports-after-russian-strikes-on-ukraine</link><description>Several powerful explosions rocked Kyiv on Saturday as authorities warned that the Ukrainian capital was under threat of missile attack.

Yet in 2025, one experience brought them together: protests. Generation Z – born between the late 1990s and early 2010s – shared frustration and anger at elites seen as out of touch, and a determination to be heard.

Across countries separated by thousands of kilometres, similar scenes unfolded, featuring young crowds, hand-painted placards, viral slogans born on platforms like TikTok or Discord and simple demands.

"This is a generation that is not acting only for itself, but so that everyone has access to education, healthcare and housing, and to put an end to corruption in power," said sociologist Michel Wieviorka, director of studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS). “It is a protest driven by universal values.”

The movement began in Indonesia at the end of the summer. In Jakarta, the announcement of housing allowances for MPs – nearly ten times the minimum wage – acted as a trigger, prompting students to take to the streets.

One symbol quickly emerged from the marches: the pirate flag from the world’s best-selling manga, "One Piece", which became the emblem of the Gen Z revolt.

In September, the movement gained dramatic momentum in Nepal. Viral videos on Instagram and TikTok exposed the lavish lifestyles of “nepo-kids”, while the government blocked around twenty digital platforms.

Anger erupted in Kathmandu, where parliament was set on fire . For two days, the country was gripped by violent riots.

The shockwave then reached Africa . In Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo, youth-led protests no longer denounced only water and power cuts but also demanded the resignation of the president.

"We are not asking for luxury, just the means to live with dignity," demonstrators chanted, many of them students or young precarious workers.

In Morocco , mobilisation took a different form. The Gen Z 212 collective – a reference to the country’s telephone code – organised on Discord, coordinating calls to demonstrate and pushing its priorities, including school reform, access to healthcare and social justice.

On the American continent, Peruvian youth mobilised from Lima to Cusco against political instability, corruption and record levels of insecurity.

While demands differed, the broader context was similar.

"These are countries where democracy, if it exists, remains illiberal or weakly liberal," Wieviorka said. "They are also more or less authoritarian regimes, where power responds with repression, fuelling a spiral of violence."

The toll was heavy: a dozen people were killed in Indonesia, at least three in Morocco and five in Madagascar . In Nepal , at least 76 people died and more than 2,000 were injured, according to police.

Despite repression, Generation Z made gains. In Nepal, the protest movement led to the fall of the government.

In an unprecedented move, an interim prime minister – former Supreme Court chief justice Sushila Karki – was appointed following a vote organised on Discord.

A commission of inquiry was tasked with shedding light on the deaths of protesters.

For Nepal’s youth, this marked a victory: for the first time, a mobilisation born online and on the streets resulted in a tangible political transition.

In Madagascar, the outcome left a bitter taste. After several weeks of demonstrations, President Andry Rajoelina was overthrown in a military coup.

The government that followed, however, remained in the hands of a familiar actor in the country’s political life: the army.

"The military hijacked a protest that had failed to constitute itself as a political force," Wieviorka said.

In Morocco, the protest did not shake the monarchy but forced the authorities to respond.

The royal cabinet announced modernisation measures and investments in hospitals and schools, implicitly acknowledging the legitimacy of the demands.

Repression nevertheless tempered the momentum. According to official figures, 1,473 young people remain detained, including 330 minors.

In Nepal, mobilisation has not subsided. Early legislative elections are scheduled for March 2026.

"We are in the second phase of the movement," protester Yujan Rajbhandari told AFP.

The focus has shifted to voter registration and the fight against corruption.

"We won’t stop," he said.

Elsewhere, the future remains uncertain.

"This movement can endure and produce lasting effects, or on the contrary, fade away as a whole," Wieviorka said. "There are no rules."

Recent history urges caution. From the Arab Spring to Spain’s “indignados”, from Occupy Wall Street to France’s Nuit debout , movements have emerged, lost momentum and sometimes left lasting traces, sometimes not.

"Social movements are not eternal," Wieviorka said.

One feature nevertheless distinguishes Generation Z: its ability to organise, impose its themes and extract concessions without immediately seeking to take power.

"They do not have a fully formed political platform,” Wieviorka said. “But they do have a clear horizon: that of profound change."

The issue is one of 20 points laid out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a framework peace proposal.

Here are some of the issues regarding the facility:

Russia took control of the plant in March 2022 and announced plans to connect it to its power grid. Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Zelenskiy stated at the end of December that the U.S. side had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.

Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian proposal envisages Ukrainian-American use of the plant, with the U.S. itself determining how to use 50% of the energy produced.

Russia has considered joint Russian-U.S. use of the plant, according to the Kommersant newspaper.

The plant is located in Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnipro River and the Kakhovka Reservoir, 550 km (342 miles) southeast of the capital Kyiv.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed reactors. They were all built in the 1980s, although the sixth only came online in the mid-1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It has a total capacity of 5.7 gigawatts, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) database.

Four of the six reactors no longer use Russian nuclear fuel, having switched to fuel produced by then-U.S. nuclear equipment supplier Westinghouse.

After Russia took control of the station, it shut down five of its six reactors and the last reactor ceased to produce electricity in September 2022. Rosatom said in 2025 that it was ready to return the U.S. fuel to the United States.

According to the Russian management of the plant, all six reactors are in "cold shutdown."

Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of striking the nuclear plant and of severing power lines to the plant.

The plant's equipment is powered by electricity supplied from Ukraine. Over the past four years these supplies have been interrupted at least eleven times due to breaks in power lines, forcing the plant to switch to emergency diesel generators.

Emergency generators on site can supply electricity to keep the reactors cool if external power lines are cut.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi says that fighting a war around a nuclear plant has put nuclear safety and security in constant jeopardy.

Russia has been preparing to restart the station but says that doing so will depend on the situation in the area. Rosatom chief Alexei Likhachev has not ruled out the supply of electricity produced there to parts of Ukraine.

Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said Moscow intended to use the plant to cover a significant energy deficit in Russia's south.

"That's why they are fighting so hard for this station," he said.

In December 2025, Russia's Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision issued a license for the operation of reactor No. 1, a key step towards restarting the reactor.

Ukraine's energy ministry called the move illegal and irresponsible, risking a nuclear accident.

Russia has been pummelling Ukraine's energy infrastructure for months and some areas have had blackouts during winter.

In recent months, Russia has sharply increased both the scale and intensity of its attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, plunging entire regions into darkness.

Analysts say Ukraine's generation capacity deficit is about 4 gigawatts, or the equivalent of four Zaporizhzhia reactors.

Kharchenko says it would take Ukraine five to seven years to build the generating capacity to compensate for the loss of the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Kharchenko said that if Kyiv regained control of the plant, it would take at least two to three years to understand what condition it was in and another three years to restore the equipment and return it to full operations.

Both Ukrainian state nuclear operator Energoatom and Kharchenko said that Ukraine did not know the real condition of the nuclear power plant today.

In the long term, there is the unresolved problem of the lack of water resources to cool the reactors after the vast Kakhovka hydro-electric dam was blown up in 2023, destroying the reservoir that supplied water to the plant.

Besides the reactors, there are also spent fuel pools at each reactor site used to cool down used nuclear fuel. Without water supply to the pools, the water evaporates and the temperatures increase, risking fire.

An emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel pool caused an explosion in Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.

Energoatom said the level of the Zaporizhzhia power plant cooling pond had dropped by more than 15%, or 3 metres, since the destruction of the dam, and continued to fall.

Ukrainian officials previously said the available water reserves may be sufficient to operate one or, at most, two nuclear reactors.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 10:22:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4G3ZSP2FQJLVJCVJUTH77ISEZU.jpg?auth=d67762e0ceecda8e582464dbdb667325e0464e9babe76e6a28911c25a7900967&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Army chief says Switzerland can't defend itself from full-scale attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/army-chief-says-switzerland-cant-defend-itself-full-scale-attack-2025-12-27/</link><description>ZURICH, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Switzerland cannot defend itself against a full-scale attack and must boost military spending given rising risks from Russia, the head of its armed forces said.

The country is prepared for attacks by "non-state actors" on critical infrastructure and for cyber attacks, but its military still faces major equipment gaps, Thomas Suessli told the NZZ newspaper.

"What we cannot do is defend against threats from a distance or even a full-scale attack on our country," said Suessli, who is stepping down at the end of the year.

"It's burdensome to know that in a real emergency, only a third of all soldiers would be fully equipped," he said in an interview published on Saturday.

Switzerland is increasing defence spending, modernising artillery and ground systems and replacing ageing fighter jets with Lockheed Martin F-35As.

But the plan faces cost overruns, while critics question spending on artillery and munitions amid tight federal finances.

Suessli said attitudes towards the military had not shifted despite the war in Ukraine and Russian efforts to destabilise Europe.

He blamed Switzerland's distance from the conflict, its lack of recent war experience and the false belief that neutrality offered protection.

"But that's historically inaccurate. There are several neutral countries that were unarmed and were drawn into war. Neutrality only has value if it can be defended with weapons," he said.

Switzerland has pledged to gradually raise defence spending to about 1% of GDP by around 2032, up from roughly 0.7% now – far below the 5% level agreed by NATO countries.

At that pace, the Swiss military would only be fully ready by around 2050.

"That is too long given the threat," Suessli said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 10:45:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VBXQOJDH6RPCVC5JX3ONHMLNFQ.jpg?auth=7b73f4696593685ced02fa0e49db175cc19985b628f8514b5d86894a22fac7af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish family missing after boat sinks off Indonesia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/spanish-family-missing-after-boat-sinks-off-indonesia-2025-12-27/</link><description>MADRID, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A Spanish family of four is missing after a boat carrying eleven people sank off the coast of Indonesia in extreme weather, Spanish authorities and an Indonesian news agency said on Saturday.

The strikes carried out on Thursday were approved by President Bola Tinubu and launched from maritime platforms domiciled in the Gulf of Guinea, after extensive intelligence gathering, operational planning, and reconnaissance, the information ministry said in a statement on Friday.

US President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Thursday that his country's forces had launched a strike against Islamic State group militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria 's government. He said the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

"A total of 16 GPS-guided precision munitions were deployed using MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial platforms, successfully neutralising the targeted ISIS elements attempting to penetrate Nigeria from the Sahel corridor," the Nigerian government statement said.

Watch more Nigerians call for government action against worsening insecurity

Intelligence indicated the camps were being used by foreign Islamic State group elements working with local affiliates to plan large-scale attacks inside Nigeria , it added. No civilian casualties were reported, although debris fell in two towns in Sokoto and Kwara states.

Trump described the operation as “numerous perfect strikes” and warned there would be “more to come”.

The operation marks a rare joint action between Abuja and Washington and underscores growing security cooperation as Islamist violence spreads south from the Sahel.

Sokoto State authorities confirmed the strikes and urged residents to remain calm. “The ongoing operations are geared towards securing the state and ensuring the protection of lives and property,” the state government said.

Nigeria has battled Islamist insurgents for more than a decade, but the presence of foreign fighters linked to the Islamic State group signals an escalation in the threat. The Nigerian government said it remains “fully committed to the protection of lives and property” and vowed further action against transnational extremist networks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 11:39:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8c3e567c-e314-11f0-b89a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-26T163203Z-839028605-RC2BOIAF5Q1O-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-NIGERIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 15 dead, 19 injured in Guatemala bus accident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/least-15-dead-19-injured-guatemala-bus-accident-2025-12-27/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Dec 27 (Reuters) - At least 15 people were killed and 19 injured after a passenger bus plunged into a ravine on the Inter-American Highway in western Guatemala, authorities said on Saturday.

Ukraine was embroiled in a string of corruption scandals that led to the resignation of the chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky . They also revealed a $100 million kickback scheme in the battered energy sector, masterminded by an alleged personal friend of the president.

"NABU and SAPO, following an undercover operation, exposed an organised criminal group that included current members of parliament," the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) said.

"Employees of the State Security Department are resisting NABU officers during investigative actions in committees of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine," it added, referring to Ukraine's parliament.

The anti-corruption agency did not reveal details related to the investigation .

Journalists from Ukrainska Pravda media outlet Mykhailo Tkach said in a social media post that detectives were allowed into the government quarters.

The investigation became public as Zelensky departed for talks in the US about efforts to formulate a plan to end the war in Ukraine, and after Russia sent scores of drones and missiles against the capital Kyiv, killing one and wounding dozens.

The reform, presented by Giorgia Meloni's coalition two years ago, limits the powers of Italy's powerful court of auditors, responsible for ensuring compliance with Italian and European Union rules on the use of public funds.

Meloni's right-wing government has clashed frequently with various branches of Italy's judiciary , accusing judges of leftist bias and hampering its initiatives on areas from public works to immigration.

Just two months ago the auditors' court refused to authorise a landmark government plan to build a bridge connecting Sicily to the mainland, a ruling denounced by Meloni as "intolerable interference."

The bill was passed in the upper house Senate on Saturday by 93 votes to 51.

Among the changes introduced, it stipulates that the maximum penalty for administrators who are negligent in the use of public money cannot exceed 30% of the loss caused by their actions, or the equivalent of two years of their salary.

The bill also contains a "silence means consent" clause by which if an administrator requests the court's opinion on a spending authorisation, it must reply within 30 days or else the authorisation is deemed valid and the administrator is shielded from any future sanctions.

The government says the changes will help the economy by speeding up procedures and overcoming a widespread hesitation among politicians to sign off on public works for fear of running foul of the auditors' court.

Members of the court and opposition lawmakers have warned it will lead to wasteful spending and possible malfeasance.

Alfredo Bazoli, a Democratic Party senator, said it showed the government aimed to "demolish controls on those with power."

The reform comes ahead of a more sweeping and contentious overhaul of Italy's justice system to separate the career paths of prosecutors and judges, a move the government says will curb conflict of interest between the two groups and political bias.

That reform faces a national referendum in the spring.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:24:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YOOJMYDPAVIFRALS75XXKR5TNA.jpg?auth=4250de28f6fee788ada883859db76185f83c1452ab224aa156af71cfec24296a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canada to provide $2.5 billion in economic aid for Ukraine, prime minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-provide-25-billion-economic-aid-ukraine-prime-minister-says-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Saturday announced an additional $2.5 billion of economic aid for Ukraine.

Putin said that if Ukraine did not want to resolve the conflict peacefully then Russia would accomplish all goals of its "special military operation" by force, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

Earlier on Saturday, responding to Russia's vast overnight drone and missile attack , Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia was demonstrating its wish to continue the war, while Kyiv wanted peace.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin's remarks.

The Kremlin said earlier that the Russian president, who inspected one of the command posts of the Russian armed forces, received reports from the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, and commanders of the "Centre" and "East" groups of Russian forces.

Russian commanders told Putin that Moscow's forces had captured the towns of Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Artemivka in Ukraine's Donetsk region, as well as Huliaipole and Stepnohirsk in the Zaporizhzhia region, the Kremlin and Russian agencies said on Telegram.

Ukraine’s military said in its regular battlefield update on Saturday that its forces had beaten back Russian attempts to advance in the vicinity of Myrnohrad and Huliaipole.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:51:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3GAORQTQ5ONVOLAY6RL57L5SI.jpg?auth=f76b3678cac1169bd5e133cc3027d3f1598e5c544247204af3575e1c71b5dcff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy arrests nine over alleged Hamas funding through charities</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/italy-arrests-nine-over-alleged-hamas-funding-through-charities-2025-12-27/</link><description>ROME, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors said on Saturday they had arrested nine people on suspicion of financing Hamas through charities based in Italy, in an operation coordinated by anti-mafia and anti-terrorism units.

The suspects are accused of "belonging to and having financed" the Palestinian group, which the European Union designates as a terrorist organisation, prosecutors in the northern Italian city of Genoa said in a statement.

Those arrested allegedly diverted to Hamas-linked entities around 7 million euros ($8.24 million) raised over the last two years for ostensibly humanitarian purposes, prosecutors said. Police seized assets worth more than 8 million euros.

The investigation began after suspicious financial transactions were flagged and expanded through cooperation with Dutch authorities and other EU countries, coordinated through the EU judicial agency Eurojust.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni thanked the authorities for "a particularly complex and important operation" which had uncovered financing for Hamas through "so-called charity organisations."

The Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meloni's support for Israel during its war with Hamas in Gaza has triggered large and repeated street protests in Italy.

Israel's assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 people, according to the enclave's health ministry. It was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.

Bolsonaro, 70, was hospitalized last Wednesday for a separate hernia surgery on the following day which took place uneventfully. At the request of his defense lawyers he was authorized by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to leave prison, where he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup.

In a statement from the hospital, he endorsed his son Flavio's 2026 presidential bid.

The former president has faced health problems since a stabbing he suffered in September 2018, during a presidential campaign event that year in the town of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais state.

Bolsonaro underwent various surgeries in the abdominal region after the stabbing.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 20:22:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JKFT6GXOFVK6DMX3LSBCJJNJSE.jpg?auth=e67473551a9010509c4e820c60d21bd6100771bb7e01811c4488a6d94e49be61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Niger junta orders 'general mobilisation' in fight against jihadists</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251227-niger-junta-orders-general-mobilisation-in-fight-against-jihadists</link><description>Niger 's military rulers have approved a general mobilisation and the requisition of people and goods to fight a long-running jihadist insurgency , according to a government statement  from Saturday.

Since toppling democratically elected president Mohamed Bazoum in a July 2023 coup, the military junta in Niger has been forced to contend with attacks from Islamist militants on multiple fronts.

The country's new rulers adopted the mobilisation and requisition measures at a cabinet meeting on Friday.

"People, property, and services may be requisitioned during general mobilisation to contribute to the defence of the homeland, in compliance with the legislation and regulations in force," said a government statement after the meeting.

"Every citizen is required to respond immediately to any call-up or recall order, to comply without delay with the implementation of measures for the defense of the homeland, and to submit to requisition," it added.

The measures were required by the need to "preserve the integrity of the national territory" and "protect the population", said the statement.

The country has been fighting a deadly jihadist insurgency for a decade now, waged by fighters from Al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad which has left nearly 2,000 people dead, according to ACLED, an NGO that monitors conflicts.

Niger's southeast has also been targeted by Boko Haram and rival militant group ISWAP.

Niger's mobilisation plan comes five years after the country doubled the size of its military to 50,000 troops, and raised the retirement age for ranking officers to 52 years from 47.

The government has also been urging citizens to make "voluntary" contributions to a fund started in 2023 that helps pay for military hardware and agricultural projects.

Soon after taking power, the junta asked French and US soldiers who had been fighting jihadists, notably in the west of the country, to leave Niger.

Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso – all three run by military juntas – have created a joint anti-jihadist force of 5,000 troops.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 22:22:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4850fcb6-e36a-11f0-878e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-36XV4M9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar polls open amid civil war, junta-backed party tipped to win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-polls-open-amid-civil-war-junta-backed-party-tipped-win-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 28 (Reuters) - Overshadowed by civil war and doubts about the credibility of the polls, voters in Myanmar were casting their ballots in a general election starting on Sunday, the first since a military coup toppled the last civilian government in 2021.

The junta that has since ruled Myanmar says the vote is a chance for a fresh start politically and economically for the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.

But the election has been derided by critics - including the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups - as an exercise that is not free, fair or credible, with anti-junta political parties not competing.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, deposed by the military months after her National League for Democracy won the last general election by a landslide in 2020, remains in detention, and the political party she led to power has been dissolved.

Mass protests followed the ouster of Suu Kyi's party, only to be violently suppressed by the military. Many protesters then took up arms against the junta in what became a nationwide rebellion.

In this election, the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party, led by retired generals and fielding one-fifth of all candidates against severely diminished competition, is set to return to power, said Lalita Hanwong, a lecturer and Myanmar expert at Thailand's Kasetsart University.

"The junta's election is designed to prolong the military's power of slavery over people," she said. "And USDP and other allied parties with the military will join forces to form the next government."

Following the initial phase on Sunday, two rounds of voting will be held on January 11 and January 25, covering 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, although the junta does not have complete control of all those areas as it fights in the war that has consumed the country since the coup.

Dates for counting votes and announcing election results have not been declared.

With fighting still raging in parts of the country, the elections are being held in an environment of violence and repression, UN human rights chief Volker Turk said last week.

"There are no conditions for the exercise of the rights of freedom of expression, association or peaceful assembly that allow for the free and meaningful participation of the people," said Turk, the high commissioner for human rights.

The junta maintains that the elections provide a pathway out of the conflict, pointing to previous military-backed polls, including one in 2010 that brought in a quasi-civilian government that pushed through a series of political and economic reforms.

The polls "will turn a new page for Myanmar, shifting the narrative from a conflict-affected, crisis-laden country to a new chapter of hope for building peace and reconstructing the economy," an opinion piece in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said on Saturday.

On the streets of Myanmar's largest cities, there has been none of the energy and excitement of previous election campaigns, residents said, although they did not report any coercion by the military administration to push people to vote.

In the lacklustre canvassing, the USDP was the most visible. Founded in 2010, the year it won an election boycotted by the opposition, the party ran the country in concert with its military backers until 2015, when it was swept away by Suu Kyi's NLD.

The junta's attempt to establish a stable administration in the midst of an expansive conflict is fraught with risk, analysts say, and significant international recognition is unlikely for any military-controlled government - even if it has a civilian veneer.

Myanmar's weakened economy, relentless conflict and a seemingly preordained political route have left some voters dejected, including a 31-year-old man who lives in the commercial capital Yangon.

"No matter who I vote for, the USDP will win," he said, asking not to be named for fear of retribution from junta authorities. "So, I will just vote USDP."</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 23:40:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KN3UVWDGI5OP5JHMDA6XSDKBU4.jpg?auth=5babfb54dca188386b8ac68e5ada7427bb722f6e11ccb64c0368779d9e9569f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African Republic votes, Russia ally Touadera seeks third term</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-votes-russia-ally-touadera-seeks-third-term-2025-12-28/</link><description>BANGUI Dec 28 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera is seeking a third term on Sunday as the chronically unstable country holds national elections, touting security gains made with the help of Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers.

The 68-year-old mathematician oversaw a constitutional referendum in 2023 that scrapped the presidential term limit, drawing an outcry from his critics who accused him of seeking to rule for life.

A Touadera victory - the expected outcome - would likely further the interests of Russia, which has traded security assistance for access to resources including gold and diamonds. Touadera is also offering access to the country's lithium and uranium reserves to anyone interested.

The opposition field of six candidates is led by two former prime ministers, Anicet-Georges Dologuele and Henri-Marie Dondra, both of whom survived attempts by Touadera's supporters to have them disqualified for allegedly holding foreign citizenship.

Though both men remain on the ballot, Touadera is still seen as the favourite given his control over state institutions and superior financial resources, analysts say.

The challenges to the candidacies of Dologuele and Dondra "aligned with an apparent pattern of administrative manoeuvring that has disproportionately impeded opposition politicians while favouring the ruling United Hearts Party," Human Rights Watch said last month.

"Their late admission to the race raises questions about whether voters have been given a genuine choice."

In 2018, CAR became the first country in West and Central Africa to bring in Russia's Wagner mercenaries, a step since also taken by Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.

Two years later Rwanda deployed troops to shore up Touadera's government as rebel groups threatened the capital and tried to disrupt the 2020 elections, ultimately preventing voting at 800 polling stations across the country, or 14% of the total.

The country is more secure now after Touadera signed several peace deals with rebel groups this year.

But those gains remain fragile: Rebels have not fully disarmed, reintegration is incomplete, and incursions by combatants from neighbouring Sudan fuel insecurity in the east.
Beyond the presidential contest, the elections on Sunday cover legislative, regional and municipal positions.

Provisional results are expected by January 5.

If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, a presidential runoff will take place on February 15, while legislative runoffs will take place on April 5.

Pangea-Risk, a consultancy, wrote in a note to clients that the risk of unrest after the election was high as opponents were likely to challenge Touadera's expected victory.

A smooth voting process could reinforce Touadera's claim that stability is returning, which was buttressed last year with the U.N. Security Council's lifting of an arms embargo and the lifting of a separate embargo on diamond exports.

In November, the U.N. Security Council extended the mandate of its peacekeeping mission. The U.S. opposed the decision, calling for a shorter extension and a handover of security to Bangui.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:54:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YR7LFF27BJNFHJZ3GMVLGE56SU.jpg?auth=63f50cc94543c24098e2b7fdff061d68e56de6eafc14bff6d81896ab39a44c2b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo votes in bid to end year-long political impasse</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovo-votes-bid-end-year-long-political-impasse-2025-12-28/</link><description>PRISTINA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Kosovo will hold a parliamentary election on Sunday as nationalist Prime Minister Albin Kurti's party seeks a majority to end a year-long political deadlock that has paralysed parliament and delayed international funding.

The vote is the second this year in Europe's youngest nation after Kurti's Vetevendosje party fell short of a majority in February. Months of failed coalition talks prompted President Vjosa Osmani to dissolve parliament in November and call an early election.

Failure to form a government and reopen parliament would prolong the crisis at a critical time: lawmakers must elect a new president in April and ratify 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in loan agreements from the European Union and World Bank that expire in the coming months.

The Balkan country's opposition parties have refused to govern with Kurti, criticising his handling of ties with Western allies and his approach to Kosovo's ethnically divided north, where a Serb minority lives. Kurti blames the opposition for the impasse.

To woo voters, Kurti has pledged an additional month of salary per year for public sector workers, one billion euros per year in capital investment and a new prosecution unit to fight organised crime. Opposition parties have also focused on improving living standards.

Opinion polls are not published in Kosovo, leaving the outcome uncertain. Many voters say they are disillusioned.

"There wouldn’t be great joy if Kurti wins, nor would there be if the opposition wins. This country needs drastic changes, and I don’t see that change coming," said Edi Krasiqi, a doctor.

Polls open at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) and close at 7 p.m. Exit polls are expected soon after voting ends.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. backing, including a 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbian forces trying to crush an uprising by the 90% ethnic Albanian majority.

Despite international support, the country of 1.6 million has struggled with poverty, instability and organised crime. Kurti's tenure, which began in 2021, was the first time a Pristina government completed a full term.

Tensions with Serbia flared in 2023, prompting the EU to impose sanctions on Kosovo. The bloc said this month it would lift them after ethnic Serb mayors were elected in northern municipalities, but the measures likely cost Kosovo hundreds of millions of euros .

The former special forces commander , believed to be in his early 40s, faces eight other candidates in a fragmented field with no strong challenger. Ousted president Alpha Conde and longtime opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo remain in exile.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou, officially launched last month after years of delay.

Doumbouya has claimed credit for pushing the project forward and ensuring Guinea benefits from its output.

His government this year also revoked EGA subsidiary Guinea Alumina Corporation's license after a refinery dispute, transferring its assets to a state-owned firm.

The turn toward resource nationalism - echoed in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger - has boosted his popularity, as has his youth in a country where the median age is about 19.

"For us young people, Doumbouya represents the opportunity to send the old political class into retirement," said Mohamed Kaba, a mechanic in Conakry. "There is a lot of corruption right now, but I hope these things will be sorted out."

If elected, Doumbouya "will likely utilise his position to further entrench his power and that of the military over Guinea," said Benedict Manzin, lead Middle East and Africa analyst at risk consultancy Sibylline.

"In particular he is likely to position his allies and associates to benefit from the expected economic boom associated with the launch of production" at Simandou, Manzin added.

A transition charter adopted after the coup barred junta members from contesting elections. But in September, Guineans overwhelmingly backed a new constitution removing that clause, extending presidential terms to seven years and creating a Senate.

Provisional results showed turnout at 86.42%, though opposition figures disputed that.

Political debate has been muted under Doumbouya. Civil society groups accuse his government of banning protests, curbing press freedom and restricting opposition activity.

The campaign period "has been severely restricted, marked by intimidation of opposition actors, apparently politically motivated enforced disappearances, and constraints on media freedom," U.N. rights chief Volker Turk said Friday. These conditions "risk undermining the credibility of the electoral process," he added.

The government did not respond to a request for comment.

Doumbouya kept a low profile during the campaign, leaving surrogates to make his case.

At a closing rally on Thursday in Conakry, he skipped a speech although he danced with his wife while Congolese star Koffi Olomide performed.

He wore a white baseball cap and track jacket emblazoned with the name of his movement: "Generation for Modernity and Development."

About 6.7 million people are registered to vote, with provisional results expected within 48 to 72 hours of polls closing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5U7BMFNWMZNBZA43VRCDNIQENA.jpg?auth=ffa2cc9c592e41afaa0cf6c66302c19c2973f8383c92d1ef4fa5ab64dcaa867c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria Super Eagles fly off with 3 points against Tunisia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-nigeria-super-eagles-fly-off-with-3-points-against-tunisia</link><description>Produced by Emily Boyle and Julia Terradot</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0429da76-e379-11f0-8e59-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/WB999021-O-01-20251227-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON big cat fight ends in draw: Senegal 1-1 DR Congo</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-afcon-big-cat-fight-ends-in-draw-senegal-1-1-dr-congo</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d47441c-e378-11f0-9f3a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/WB999022-O-01-20251227-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON Daily Round Up: Super Eagles beat Tunisia 3-2, Big cats Senegal and DRC stay level</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-afcon-daily-round-up-super-eagles-beat-tunisia-3-2-big-cats-senegal-and-drc-stay-level</link><description>Produced by Emily Boyle and Julia Terradot</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20600e62-e375-11f0-be8b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-12856428126950607fcdcfd4-33199485.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia opposes Taiwan independence in any form, FM Lavrov says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-opposes-taiwan-independence-any-form-fm-lavrov-says-2025-12-28/</link><description>Dec 28 (Reuters) - Russia opposes Taiwan’s independence in any form and considers the island an inseparable part of China, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in remarks published on Sunday.

Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelenskiy called it Russia's response to the ongoing U.S.-brokered peace efforts.

Zelenskiy has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine's contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump's Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics.

Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv's control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday's talks might produce.

The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a U.S. proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelenskiy said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote.

Axios said U.S. officials viewed Zelenskiy's willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan.

Zelenskiy's in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States.

Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelenskiy said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90% finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved.

While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.

The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.

Zelenskiy, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of its territory per day in 2025.

Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12% of its territory, including about 90% of Donbas, 75% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO.

Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack NATO members.

The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan , which emerged from talks between U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.

Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and U.S. negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.

Saturday's air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelenskiy said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace "requires a willing Russia."

"The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time," Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83 billion) in additional economic aid to Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelenskiy along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained "a just and lasting peace" that preserved Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country’s security and defense capabilities.

Zelenskiy said he would speak with European leaders again after his meeting with Trump.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:25:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/24KOYIIMQVIRJIVG623QEAKVIA.jpg?auth=74a22907fdcd0ee35979b1676e1ba8deac77372a8fd90fbbad1bdbd593f7a9a5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Zelensky to meet Trump for talks on Ukraine peace plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251228-live-zelensky-to-meet-trump-for-talks-on-ukraine-peace-plan</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will sit down with US President Donald Trump on Sunday and seek to secure his approval for a new proposal to end the nearly four-year war with Russia.

Then it zeroed in on him.

Ossetchkine immediately threw himself to the ground, as did his family – all of whom managed to survive the September 12 assassination attempt .

One month later, four French residents were charged with trying to kill Ossetchkine , who is the director of an NGO that advocates for human rights in Russian prisons and who has lived in France since fleeing Russia 10 years ago.

Were the Biarritz snipers working on the Kremlin’s orders? Some of those arrested were originally from Dagestan , a Russian republic in the North Caucasus, according to an AFP source. `

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, President Vladimir Putin has been accused of orchestrating a vast hybrid-warfare campaign in Europe, including several assassination attempts.

Assassins operating under the Kremlin’s orders are suspected of trying to kill the CEO of Rheinmetall, a German arms manufacturer sending weapons to Ukraine.

FSB Russian intelligence is suspected of coordinating an attempt by six Bulgarians based in the UK to kidnap investigative journalist Christo Grozev and deliver him to Russian operatives.

Three of the group were found guilty by British courts on espionage charges .

But Russia’s hybrid-warfare strategy makes it difficult to trace operations directly back to Moscow.

“An essential characteristic of a hybrid operation is that it is deniable, that you're not sure who is behind it,” says Bart Schuurman, a specialist in political violence at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who is part of a research group compiling a list of hybrid warfare operations targeting Europe.

Across the European continent, a diverse range of hybrid-warfare attacks garnered headlines in 2025, including drone incursions around airports, the sabotage of Polish railways , pigs’ heads left outside mosques in Paris, anti-Semitic acts and assassination attempts.

Russia’s hybrid-warfare campaign appears focused on punishing Europe for its support of Ukraine by destabilising European society, driving wedges between communities and attempting to fracture support for its battlefield adversary.

Schuurman says Moscow’s hybrid campaign is “an attempt to further divide Europe”.

Sabotage, cyber-attacks, vandalism and influence operations “are all an attempt to undermine public and political support for Ukraine in Europe, ultimately helping Russian soldiers win the war”, he adds.

“Hybrid warfare attempts to support what Russia is doing on the battlefield in Ukraine using irregular or covert operations,” he says.

Threatening the CEO of Germany’s Rheinmetall directly sends the message that there is a price to pay for supporting Ukraine.

The hybrid-warfare attacks began in earnest in 2022, coinciding with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine – which Putin reportedly believed would be complete within 10 days.

As the war dragged on, Schuurman notes, hybrid attacks attributed to Russia became more frequent in 2023 and even more so in 2024. “Initially, Russia had hopes that it could win quite simply on the battlefield alone. And as it got more difficult for them to do so, they were looking for other ways to increase their chances of success.”

Overall, 2025 saw a drop in hybrid-warfare operations, despite headline-grabbing incidents like drones closing down airports around Copenhagen and Oslo.

“If we look at the more classic techniques like influence, sabotage, arson, vandalism and terrorism, we're looking at about half of what we saw last year,” says Schuurman.

But why would Russia scale back such efforts when the war in Ukraine is ongoing?

“Maybe there's less of a need for hybrid warfare,” Schuurman says, noting that Russia may be hoping to achieve what it wants through peace negotiations led by the administration of US President Donald Trump.

Moreover, Europe might be getting better at counter-operations.

“European intelligence services have been facing this Russian hybrid threat for a few years, and they have learned how to adapt to it. They've gotten a lot better at detecting plots before they happen,” Schuurman says.

Three Ukrainians were arrested in Germany in May, accused of trying to send packages of explosives on Moscow’s orders. One year earlier, a similar operation resulted in several packages exploding while they were being transported by postal service DHL.

The success of negotiations between Moscow and Washington are likely to dictate whether the Kremlin expands its hybrid-warfare operations in the months ahead, says Schuurman. “If the whole thing falls apart, I think we will see a return to more hybrid operations.”

An increase in operations is also possible if the US decides to withdraw support for Ukraine, he says, “which seems to be more and more likely” under the new administration.

“Then Europe will be more alone, and I think we can expect more tests by Russia to see if it is an opponent to take seriously or not.”

This could also mean that attacks might become more ambitious in scale – and could continue to test the resolve of Europeans, even if Putin gets what he wants in Ukraine.

A target of particular concern is elections, which Moscow have repeatedly tried to influence in favour of extremist parties.

France faces a key municipal vote in 2026 and a presidential election in 2027, with several European nations also set for elections in the coming year.

A Ministry of Defence statement said the deal would provide the British Army with an early capability demonstrator of the RCH 155 system and two units for Germany to test.

The system is manufactured by Franco-German defence group KNDS and Germany's Rheinmetall.

The system can fire eight rounds per minute on the move, operate with two crew members and travel 700 km without refuelling, the statement said.

Sunday’s election is the culmination of a transition process that began four years ago after President Mamady Doumbouya ousted then president Alpha Condé . There are eight other candidates in the race.

Despite Guinea’s rich mineral resources – including as the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, used to make aluminium – more than half of its 15 million people are experiencing record levels of poverty and food insecurity, according to the World Food Program.

“This vote is the hope of young people, especially for us unemployed," said Idrissa Camara, an 18-year-old resident of Conakry, who said he has been unemployed since graduating from university five years ago. "I’m forced to do odd jobs to survive. I hope this vote will improve the standard of living and the quality of life in Guinea," he added.

The election is the latest such vote among African countries that have seen a surge in coups in recent years. At least 10 countries in the young continent have experienced soldiers forcefully taking power after accusing elected leaders of failing to provide good governance and security for citizens.

A total of nine candidates are contesting the election, and Doumbouya’s closest challenger is the little-known Yero Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea party, who was education minister under Condé.

Two opposition candidates, former Prime Minister Lansana Kouyaté and former government minister Ousmane Kaba, were excluded on technical grounds while longtime opposition leaders Cellou Dalein Diallo and Sidya Toure have been forced into exile.

About 6.7 million registered voters are expected to cast ballots at roughly 24,000 polling stations nationwide, with results expected within 48 hours. There will be a runoff if no candidate wins a majority of the votes.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:21:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6055dc2a-e3cc-11f0-8187-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-25T212635Z-123616946-RC2ONIAQDO8X-RTRMADP-3-GUINEA-ELECTION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brigitte Bardot, icon of French cinema, dies at 91</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/brigitte-bardot-has-died-her-foundation-has-said-2025-12-28/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Actress Brigitte Bardot shot to international fame dancing the mambo barefoot in "And God Created Woman", her tousled hair and fierce energy radiating a sexual magnetism rarely before seen in mainstream cinema.

A global icon was born.

At just 21, she scandalised censors and captivated audiences. Her free-spirited performance in the 1956 film, shot by her husband Roger Vadim, marked a decisive break from the demure heroines of the previous era.

Brigitte Bardot, often referred to in France simply as "B.B." and whose later years were marked by animal rights campaigns and far-right political sympathies, has died at the age of 91, her foundation said on Sunday. The cause was not immediately known.

Born in Paris on September 28, 1934, Bardot grew up in an upper-middle-class household. She described herself as a shy, self-conscious child who "wore spectacles and had lank hair".

By 15, however, she graced the cover of Elle magazine, launching a modelling career that soon led to film.

Bardot’s character in "And God Created Woman" was the embodiment of liberated femininity. The controversy only fuelled her appeal. Bardot became a symbol of 1950s and 60s France.

Her allure extended far beyond French cinema. At 15, Bob Dylan is said to have written his first song about her, the never-released "Song for Brigitte", while Andy Warhol painted her portrait.

Bardot's ability to subvert traditional gender roles made her not just a sex symbol, but a pop culture icon and a touchstone for shifting social attitudes.

In 1959, Simone de Beauvoir penned an article for Esquire magazine in which she lionised Bardot's conspicuous sense of freedom. "B.B. does not try to scandalise," the feminist philosopher wrote. "She follows her inclinations. She eats when she is hungry and makes love with the same unceremonious simplicity.

"Moral lapses can be corrected, but how could B.B. be cured of that dazzling virtue — genuineness? It is her very substance."

De Beauvoir concluded: "I hope she will mature, but not change."

Despite her influence, Bardot found celebrity life isolating. She often spoke of being a prisoner of her own fame, unable to enjoy life’s simple pleasures.

"Nobody can imagine how horrific it was, such an ordeal," she reflected decades later. "I couldn't go on living like that."

Her personal life was shaped by four marriages, widely reported affairs, and well-documented struggles with depression.

On her 26th birthday she was found unconscious at a house on the French Riviera after trying to take her own life. Rumours of another attempted suicide surfaced years later when she mysteriously cancelled a 49th birthday party then appeared in hospital.

Alongside her acting, Bardot enjoyed a successful music career. Her collaborations with singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, including the erotic "Je t’aime ... moi non plus" ("I Love You ... Neither Do I"), drew both acclaim and controversy.

In the late 1960s she modelled for a bust of Marianne, the personification of the French Republic.

But she found little satisfaction in the praise she garnered.

"I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy," she told the magazine Paris Match around the time of her 50th birthday. "I've been let down too often. I've had really terrible disappointments in my life. That is why I've chosen to withdraw, to live alone."

Bardot made the last of her 42 films in 1973. Disenchanted with the industry, she declared the world of cinema "rotten" and left public life.

"I will have given 20 years of my life to cinema, that's enough," she said in a TV interview at the time.

She settled in the fashionable French resort of Saint-Tropez, where she found solace among animals and the Mediterranean landscape.

There, she began a passionate defence of animal welfare. "This is my only battle, the only direction I want to give my life," Bardot said in 2013.

Her devotion to animals became legendary. In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals, auctioning off personal souvenirs the following year to raise funds for her cause.

Bardot supported high-profile activists, such as anti-whaling campaigner Paul Watson, and campaigned vigorously against animal cruelty, at times threatening to leave France over animal welfare disputes.

When actor Gérard Depardieu accepted Russian citizenship after a public spat with French authorities, in 2013, Bardot threatened to follow suit if France euthanised two sick circus elephants.

For much of the latter part of her life, Bardot lived alone behind high walls in Saint-Tropez, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses.

This passion, she often suggested, was an antidote to her disappointing relationships. "I gave my beauty and my youth to men," she once said. "I am going to give my wisdom and experience to animals."

As her advocacy intensified, so too did the backlash to her political statements.

Bardot’s public remarks on immigration, Islam and homosexuality led to a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred.

Between 1997 and 2008, she was fined six times by French courts for her comments, particularly those targeting France’s Muslim community.

In one case, a Paris court fined her €15,000 ($17,000) for describing Muslims as "this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts".

In 1992, she married Bernard d’Ormale, a former adviser to the far-right National Front, and later publicly endorsed the party's successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine Le Pen. Bardot called the latter "the Joan of Arc of the 21st century".

Yet, for all her polarising views, Bardot’s influence endured, whether in fashion - with media noting regular comebacks of her trademark hairstyle - or through regular documentaries and coffee‑table books celebrating her rare impact on French cinema.

Asked by French channel BFM TV in May 2025 if she considered herself a symbol of the sexual revolution, she said: "No, because before me, plenty of wild things had already happened — they didn’t wait for me. Feminism isn't my thing; I like men."

In the same interview, she was asked how often she reflected on her film career. "I don’t think about it," she said, "but I don’t reject it, because it’s thanks to it that I’m known everywhere in the world as someone who defends animals."</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:44:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SQHBFHT33JNS5PSZ42YZAIV6OY.jpg?auth=283044af9db33579d5cee1d1decd9c8c5e5f5bde102903461bb1f8c3895cebbb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's DTEK says power restored to 1 million Kyiv-area households</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraines-dtek-says-power-restored-1-million-kyiv-area-households-2025-12-28/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine's leading private energy provider said on Sunday that it had restored power to more than a million households in and around Kyiv a day after a Russian air attack had forced emergency outages.

A combined missile and drone attack early on Saturday had killed two people and knocked out power across broad swathes of the capital and its surrounding region.

In a statement, DTEK said it had restored electricity to 748,000 households in Kyiv and 347,000 outside the city.

It added that consumers on Kyiv's right bank were back to planned power cuts but that the situation remained "more difficult" on the left bank, where emergency outages were still in force.

Two districts of the Kyiv region were also still experiencing emergency outages, DTEK said.

Below are a selection.

"Her films, her voice, her dazzling fame, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne - Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom. A French existence, a universal radiance. She moved us. We mourn a legend of the century."

(Bardot's face was used as the model for an official bust of Marianne, an allegorical female figure who symbolizes the values of the French Republic, which was installed in town halls across the country from the late 1960s onward.)

THE BRIGITTE BARDOT FOUNDATION

"Mrs Brigitte Bardot (was) a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to give up her prestigious career in order to devote her life and energy to the defence of animals and to her Foundation," it said.

"The Brigitte Bardot Foundation wishes to honour the memory of an exceptional woman who gave everything and gave up everything for a world more respectful of animals."

"The French people today lose the Marianne they so deeply loved and whose beauty astonished the world. Brigitte Bardot was a woman of heart, conviction, and character. A passionate patriot and a lover of animals that she protected throughout her life, she alone embodied an entire era of French history, and above all a certain idea of courage and freedom."

"The SPA pays tribute to Brigitte Bardot, an iconic figure and a passionate advocate for the animal cause. Since the 1970s, and later through her foundation created in the 1980s, she devoted her life to defending those who have no voice. Her unwavering commitment helped change attitudes and achieve major advances in animal protection ... Thank you, B.B., for all that you have accomplished."

"An icon of French cinema and an international figure, Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most radiant ambassador. Through her presence, her personality, and her aura, she left her mark on the history of our town and helped to make Saint-Tropez shine across the world," the city said. "Brigitte Bardot now belongs to the collective memory of Saint-Tropez, which we must preserve. She will continue to inhabit the soul of our town."

"She wasn't just one of the most beautiful women in the world - she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and she still is, in fact," he said.

"She had a courage that men still don't reference, and if she cared so deeply about animals ... it's probably because she had been disappointed by men - all men - and I understand that. We are relatively disappointing; I can speak for my own gender."</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 11:40:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S3WKWUL5ONI6HFWW5WISKOOF6M.jpg?auth=6e61a667dde1d3eaf4280de7556aaf992be92ba2a86fbd474e45901dacb42573&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bardot leaves controversial legacy of activism for France’s far right</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251228-bardot-leaves-controversial-legacy-of-activism-for-france-far-right</link><description>French cinema legend Brigitte Bardot, whose death at the age of 91 was announced on Sunday. During her life, she was a 1960s sex symbol who later became a militant animal rights activist and outspoken supporter of France's far right .

After her film career catapulted her to global stardom and sex-symbol status, she suddenly retreated into a hermit-like existence in the French Riviera resort of Saint-Tropez at the age of just 39.

In 1986 she set up the Brigitte Bardot Foundation dedicated to animal protection. She crusaded for baby seals and elephants , called for the abolition of ritual animal sacrifice and the closure of horse abattoirs.

As her advocacy intensified, so too did the backlash to her political statements. Bardot’s public remarks on immigration , Islam and homosexuality led to a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred.

Between 1997 and 2008, she was fined six times by French courts for her comments, particularly those targeting France’s Muslim community.

In one case, a Paris court fined her €15,000 for describing Muslims as "this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts".

In 1992, she married Bernard d’Ormale, a former adviser to the far-right National Front , and later publicly endorsed the party's successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen ‍and his daughter Marine Le Pen . Bardot called the latter "the Joan of Arc of the 21st century".

Jordan Bardella , the head of Le Pen's far-right National Rally party, was among the first to pay hommage.

"Today the French people have lost the Marianne they so loved, whose beauty astonished the world," he wrote on X.

In her final book, "Mon BBcedaire" ("My BB Alphabet"), published weeks before her death, she fired barbs at what she described as a "dull, sad, submissive" France and at her home town of Saint-Tropez, now packed with the wealthy tourists she helped attract. The book also contained derogatory remarks about gay and transgender people.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:42:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ddb28f24-e3e0-11f0-a811-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23108353048742.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Memorable moments from French actress Brigitte Bardot's on-screen career</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251228-memorable-moments-from-french-actress-brigitte-bardot-screen-career</link><description>French 1960s sex symbol Brigitte Bardot , considered one of the major screen sirens of the 20th century, died at the age of 91 , her foundation announced on Sunday.

"And God created Brigitte Bardot" ran the headline in the Financial Times in 2009 when the actress turned 75, capturing the enduring connection between Bardot and the film that catapulted her to stardom as a sexually charged 18-year-old orphan in Saint-Tropez.

The image of a bikini-clad, bronzed Bardot emerging from the sea was the "original epitome of the youthful sexuality that tanned itself on the Cote d'Azur once the austerity of war had worn off", US film historian David Thomson said in his bestselling book "The New Biographical Dictionary of Film" (1975).

Made by her husband at the time, Roger Vadim, the film was a hit both in France and the US, where it took in $4 million at the box office .

It inspired Simone de Beauvoir in 1960 to say, "BB now deserves to be considered an export product as important as Renault automobiles."

Jean-Luc Godard 's arthouse classic set on the island of Capri opened with what would become one of Bardot's most famous scenes but also her most subversive: intercut shots of her body as she lies on a bed in a dark room, asking her husband, "Which part of me do you like best?"

Bardot's full naked figure is never shown as Godard resisted the demands of his producers, and in doing so encouraged a more critical gaze on Bardot's sexualised on-screen body.

Playing a jilted wife whose disdain for her husband swells as the film progresses, "Contempt" was one of Bardot's rare critically acclaimed films, with The New York Times praising it as her best acting performance.

Bardot had a brief and tumultuous affair with legendary French songwriter Serge Gainsbourg .

Their dalliance gave rise to a track based on a poem written by the notorious US outlaw Bonnie Parker, before she and her partner in crime Clyde Barrow were shot dead.

For the video clip of the duet shot in a hay barn, Gainsbourg and Bardot dressed as the legendary pair, with Bardot donning a black beret, dragging on a cigarette and clutching a machine gun around her neck.

The single was from an album of the same name that reached number 12 on the Billboard Top 200.

Gainsbourg also first recorded his famously steamy "Je t'aime... moi non plus" duet with Bardot but she later opposed its release.

He re-recorded the hit with Jane Birkin.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:42:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4d5656e-e3da-11f0-9e06-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23108352888792.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China welcomes Thailand-Cambodia truce ahead of trilateral talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-welcomes-thailand-cambodia-truce-ahead-trilateral-talks-2025-12-28/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 28 (Reuters) - China on Sunday congratulated Cambodia on reaching a ceasefire with Thailand after weeks of deadly border fighting , as officials from the three countries prepared to open a two-day meeting in southwestern China.

Thailand and Cambodia on Saturday ended weeks of fierce border clashes that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million by agreeing their second ceasefire in recent months.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a meeting with his Cambodian counterpart, called the ceasefire "an important step towards restoring peace" and said it was "in line with the shared expectations of countries in the region."

Cambodia's top diplomat, Prak Sokhonn, and his Thai counterpart, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, are both expected to meet Wang in the Chinese province of Yunnan on Sunday and Monday to discuss the border situation.

Cambodia and Thailand should "promote a complete and lasting ceasefire, resume normal exchanges and rebuild mutual trust" Wang said, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

The two countries' diplomats and military officials should use the meeting in Yunnan as an opportunity to "communicate in a flexible manner and enhance understanding," Wang added.

China is willing to provide humanitarian aid to Cambodia for the settlement of those displaced in the border regions, he said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:20:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3T3P6YVJRRKFVBFQQGVYOVYVAE.jpg?auth=0e9d9a7ac152612730c560560e3a8794fb20b12cc874787eb64087ecaa8fe97e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The week in pictures: US strikes on Nigerian jihadists, AFCON 2025 and the death of Brigitte Bardot</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251228-the-week-in-pictures-us-strikes-nigerian-jihadists-afcon-2025-death-brigitte-bardot</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:22:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/435010f4-e32d-11f0-97fb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360683962222.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clashes erupt in Syria as Alawite minority protests deadly Homs mosque bombing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251228-clashes-erupt-syria-alawite-minority-protests-deadly-homs-mosque-bombing</link><description>Clashes broke out on Syria’s coast between protesters from the Alawite religious minority and counter-demonstrators on Sunday, two days after a bombing at an Alawite mosque in the city of Homs killed eight people and wounded 18 others during prayers.

Thousands of protesters gathered in the coastal cities of Latakia and Tartous, and elsewhere. Officials have said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque in Homs, but authorities haven’t publicly identified a suspect yet in Friday’s bombing. Funerals for the dead were held on Saturday.

A little-known group calling itself Saraya Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram channel, in which it indicated that the attack intended to target members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam whom hard-line Islamists consider to be apostates.

Sunday’s demonstrations were called for by Ghazal Ghazal, an Alawite sheikh living outside of Syria who heads a group called the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council in Syria and the Diaspora.

An Associated Press photographer in Latakia saw pro-government counterprotesters throw rocks at the Alawite demonstrators, while a group of protesters beat a counterdemonstrator who crossed to their side.

According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least two people were killed as security forces tried to disperse the protests – and a medical source said two bodies had been taken to a local hospital.

Syrian authorities did not confirm they had opened fire but said they had “contained the situation”. They accused what they called “remnants” of former ruler Bashar al-Assad’ s government of attacking security forces.

Syria’s state-run television also reported that two members of the security forces had been wounded in the area of Tartous after someone threw a hand grenade at a police station. Cars belonging to security forces were also set on fire in Latakia.

The country has experienced several waves of sectarian clashes since the fall of former president Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December 2024 that brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad, an Alawite, fled the country to Russia.

In March, an ambush carried out by Assad’s supporters against security forces triggered days of violence that left hundreds of people dead, most of them Alawites. Since then, although the situation has calmed, Alawites have been targeted sporadically in sectarian attacks. They have also complained of discrimination against them in public employment since Assad’s fall and of young Alawite men detained without charges.

During the rein of the Assad dynasty, Alawites were over-represented in government jobs and in the army and security forces.

Government officials condemned Friday’s attack and promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but have not yet announced any arrests.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:44:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bae6ec84-e3f3-11f0-885d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362464071814.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three dead in Alawite protests on Syrian coast, local officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/three-dead-alawite-protests-syrian-coast-local-officials-say-2025-12-28/</link><description>LATAKIA, Syria Dec 28 - Three people were killed on Sunday when protests in Syria's Alawite heartland of Latakia spiralled into gunfire and other violence, according to the province's media office.

Syria has been rocked by several episodes of sectarian bloodshed since longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who hails from the Muslim Alawite minority, was ousted by a rebel offensive last year and replaced by a Sunni-led government.

Thousands of Alawite protesters gathered on Sunday in Azhari Square in Latakia city to demand a decentralized political system in Syria and the release of thousands of Alawite prisoners.

About two hours into the protest, gunshots rang out from an unidentified location, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene. Security forces then fired in the air and the protest descended into chaos, with demonstrators carrying wounded people away on foot.

A written statement from the Latakia province's media office that was distributed to reporters said three people were killed and more than 40 people wounded. It did not specify if the casualties were all in Azhari Square or in other towns where protests were also taking place.

Syrian state news agency SANA reported that one member of the security forces was killed by gunfire from "armed remnants of the former regime" in Latakia. It said civilians and security personnel were wounded in gunfire by unknown assailants near Azhari Square.

Sunday's rally had been called for by the head of the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council, Ghazal Ghazal.

A similar protest in November lasted barely an hour before being confronted by a rival protest in support of Syria's new government. Syrian security forces used gunfire to break up both.

Protesters on Sunday chanted: "We want federalism!" and, "The Syrian people are one!"

"We came to demand our dignity, a living, we came to demand political federalism just like big states such as America, Germany and the (United Arab) Emirates," one demonstrator, Salman Mansour, told Reuters.

"We came to ask for our right of living after we were killed in our lands," he added. More than 1,000 Alawites were killed in March after a failed insurrection by Assad loyalists sparked revenge killings by government-affiliated forces.

Last week, eight people were killed when a bomb detonated at an Alawite mosque in the nearby city of Homs.

"ًWe will keep asking for federalism for our dignity. They say we hate each other - no!" said another protester, Nisreen Khazem.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:20:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2AH4DIIDZRMMZNEPGZ4E264E5A.jpg?auth=573e4bb098941f45462672bf6d6bfff4e0b22041608dc9c364c0dee1358fd846&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's student-led party allies with Islamists ahead of election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-student-led-party-allies-with-islamists-ahead-election-2025-12-28/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The student-led Bangladeshi party born out of the protest movement that toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has forged an electoral alliance with Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami ahead of February's parliamentary election, stirring internal rifts.

Since last year's uprising, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has cast itself as a centrist, reformist alternative to nepotism and two-party dominance, but as the election nears, it is struggling to turn street power into voter support.

NCP chief Nahid Islam said on Sunday the party had decided to enter into the alliance for greater unity, adding that the final list of candidates would be announced on Monday. Other NCP figures have described the alliance as a pragmatic step in a fragmented political landscape.

But the decision to join forces with Jamaat has already prompted internal ructions.

Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the NCP, becoming a leader in the party, resigned on Saturday and said she would contest the election as an independent candidate. Several other members have also quit.

The alliance has drawn attention because Jamaat has long faced criticism for opposing Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan and its alleged role in 1971 war crimes. Years of trials, leadership bans and political marginalisation have left the party with a limited but loyal support base.

Critics of the NCP's move said it undermined the party's founding ideals.

"The moral support I had for the NCP will no longer exist due to this ideological mismatch," said one university student, asking not to be named.

The partnership comes amid broader political realignments, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) - aligned with ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and effectively led by her son, acting chair Tarique Rahman - regaining momentum following Rahman's return after nearly 17 years in exile.

The February 12 election will be held under an interim administration headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took charge after Hasina's ouster and is seen as crucial to restoring political stability after nearly two years of turmoil.

A December survey by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute showed the NCP in a distant third place with 6% support, behind the BNP at 30% and Jamaat on 26%.

The alliance might shift voting trends but could hurt the NCP's long-term bid to become a dominant force, said Shakil Ahmed, a government and politics professor at Jahangirnagar University.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:26:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LPOIOBCLCVNY3KY4BGOCKTNFKQ.jpg?auth=08719981d0b364fd2c4c5ed0f3ea8cd0a0c3133119dd9ccc5b76ed58829b5f9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian attack damages Kherson heating plant</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russian-attack-damages-kherson-heating-plant-2025-12-28/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Russian forces struck an important heating plant in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, causing "significant damage" to the facility, state oil and gas firm Naftogaz said on Sunday.

The city has been under intensifying Russian drone, missile and bomb strikes in recent months, making daily life increasingly dangerous .

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said that a call between Putin and Trump lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes and took place at the request of Trump ahead of Trump's meeting in Miami with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

"The main thing is that the presidents of Russia and the United States hold similar views that the option of a temporary ceasefire proposed by the Ukrainians and the Europeans under the pretext of preparing for a referendum or under other pretexts only leads to a prolongation of the conflict and is fraught with renewed hostilities," Ushakov said.

Ushakov said that for hostilities to end, Kyiv needed to make a "bold decision" in line with Russian-U.S. discussions on Donbas.

"Given the current situation on the fronts, it would make sense for the Ukrainian regime to make this decision regarding Donbas."

Russia, which controls 90% of Donbas, wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the 10% of the area that Kyiv's forces still control. Overall, Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine.

Trump has repeatedly promised to end the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two and his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been negotiating with Russia, Ukraine and European powers.

Ukraine and its European allies are worried that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated Ukraine after Russian forces took 12-17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukraine per day in 2025.

"Donald Trump listened attentively to Russian assessments of the real prospects for reaching an agreement," Ushakov said.

"Trump persistently pursued the idea that it was really necessary to end the war as soon as possible, and spoke about the impressive prospects for economic cooperation between the United States and Russia and Ukraine that were opening up," Ushakov said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 18:53:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QQPTBBYEJRPCTFANHMQCYSC5YI.jpg?auth=a0bd6b08fd627fde8e40c68dd0ae9967323347aab1a79d248473703811c5f0d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One dead, two missing in southern Spain as torrential rains cause flash floods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/one-dead-two-missing-southern-spain-torrential-rains-cause-flash-floods-2025-12-28/</link><description>VALENCIA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Torrential rains flooded Spain's southern and eastern provinces over the weekend, with one person dead and two missing on Sunday evening as overflowing riverbeds swept away cars and motorcycles and authorities warned residents to stay indoors.

In Valencia, where deadly floods in October last year killed over 220 people and caused billions of euros in damage, authorities issued red alert warnings to people's phones on Sunday evening urging them to stay indoors and on high ground.

Eight other provinces were on orange alert, warning citizens of serious risks to themselves or property and to be prepared for worsening conditions.

The heavy rains in Valencia last year caught authorities off guard, with many blaming local and national officials for warning people of the danger too late, eventually prompting the leader of the region to resign .

In Malaga, Spain's Civil Guard found the body of a man whose van was swept away by an overflowing riverbed on Sunday, according to a post on their X account. A second passenger of the van was still missing.

Emergency teams were also searching for a young person in Granada who was swept away trying to cross a riverbed on a motorcycle, according to state news agency EFE.

Netanyahu said this month that Trump had invited him for talks, as Washington pushes to establish transitional governance and an international security force for the Palestinian enclave.

Trump has said he could meet with the Israeli leader soon, but the White House has not confirmed details. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the meeting.

Netanyahu, who is expected to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago beach club, said on December 22 that discussions were expected to cover the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, as well as Iran and Lebanon.

Washington brokered ceasefires on all three fronts, but Israel is wary of its foes rebuilding their forces after they were considerably weakened in the war.

All sides agreed in October to Trump's ceasefire plan, which calls for Israel to withdraw from Gaza and Hamas to give up its weapons and forgo a governing role in the enclave.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that Washington wants the transitional administration envisioned in Trump's plan - a Board of Peace and a body made up of Palestinian technocrats - to be in place soon to govern Gaza, ahead of the deployment of the international security force that was mandated by a November 17 U.N. Security Council resolution.

But Israel and Hamas have accused each other of major breaches of the deal and look no closer to accepting the much more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase .

Hamas, which has refused to disarm and has not returned the remains of the last Israeli hostage, has been reasserting its control, as Israeli troops remain entrenched in about half the territory.

Israel has indicated that if Hamas is not disarmed peacefully, it will resume military action to make it do so.

While the fighting has abated, it has not stopped entirely. Although the ceasefire officially began in October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 Palestinians — most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials — and Palestinian militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

In Lebanon, a U.S.-backed ceasefire that was agreed to in November 2024 ended more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and required the disarmament of the powerful Iran-backed Shiite group, beginning in areas south of the river adjacent to Israel.

While Lebanon has said it is close to completing the mission within the year-end deadline of disarming Hezbollah, the group has resisted calls to lay down its weapons.

Israel says progress is partial and slow and has been carrying out near-daily strikes in Lebanon, which it says are meant to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding.

Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, said last week that it had conducted missile exercises for the second time this month. Netanyahu said Israel is not seeking a confrontation with Iran, but was aware of the reports, and said he would raise Tehran's activities with Trump.

The Vetevendosje, or Self-Determination, party won nearly 50% of the ballots, far ahead of the opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo with 21%, and the Democratic League of Kosovo with nearly 14%, state election authorities said after nearly all the ballots were counted.

“Congratulations on the biggest victory in the history of the country,” a cheerful Kurti said after results were announced. “Now we have a lot of work ahead of us.”

The snap ballot on Sunday was scheduled after the Self-Determination party failed to form a government despite also winning the most votes in a February 9 election, which led to a months-long political deadlock.

It was not immediately clear whether the Self-Determination party had won 61 seats in the 120-member parliament to be able to rule alone. Kurti said a new parliament and a government would be formed as soon as possible.

“We don’t have time to lose and must move forward together as quickly as possible,” he said.

Hundreds of ruling party supporters gathered outside the party offices in Pristina in celebration, chanting Kurti’s name.

The previous post-election stalemate marked the first time Kosovo could not form a government since it declared independence from Serbia in 2008 following a 1998–99 war that ended in a NATO intervention.

Kosovo has not approved a budget for next year, sparking concern over the already poor economy in the country of 2 million people. Lawmakers are also set to elect a new president in March, as current President Vjosa Osmani’s mandate expires in early April.

After voting on Sunday, Kurti urged Kosovo’s 1.9 million voters to turn out in large numbers to grant “more legitimacy for our institutions”.

Turnout was around 44%, according to state election authorities.

Under Kosovo’s election laws, 20 parliamentary seats are automatically assigned to ethnic Serb representatives and other minority parties.

Opposition parties have accused Kurti of authoritarianism and of alienating Kosovo’s U.S. and European Union allies since he came to power in 2021. Kurti also briefly served as prime minister in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lumir Abdixhiku from the Democratic League of Kosovo earlier on Sunday urged voters to “move away from the gloom, the deadlock and the division that has accompanied us for these years”.

A former political prisoner during Serbia’s rule in Kosovo, the 50-year-old Kurti has taken a tough stance in talks mediated by the European Union on normalising relations with Belgrade. In response, the EU and the United States imposed punitive measures.

Kurti has promised to buy military equipment to boost security.

Ilmi Deliu, a 71-year-old pensioner from the capital, Pristina, said he hoped the election would bring a change or “we will end up in an abyss”.

“Young people no longer want to live here,” he said.

Tensions with restive ethnic Serbs in the north erupted in clashes in 2023 when scores of NATO-led peacekeepers were injured. In a positive step, ethnic Serb mayors this month took power peacefully there after a municipal vote.

Kurti has also agreed to accept third-country migrants deported from the United States as part of tough anti-immigration measures by the administration of President Donald Trump. One migrant has arrived so far, authorities told The Associated Press.

Kosovo has one of the poorest economies in Europe. It is one of the six Western Balkan countries seeking eventual membership of the EU , but both Kosovo and Serbia have been told they must first normalise relations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:20:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75fc16dc-e0ef-11f0-a6b4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/b2912494762f74dd46eef31671f6149ffd86e550.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump, Zelensky say Ukraine peace deal edging closer but key issues unresolved</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251228-trump-zelensky-say-ukraine-peace-deal-closer-key-issues-unresolved</link><description>US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were “getting a lot closer, maybe very close” to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, though both leaders acknowledged that some of the thorniest details remain unresolved.

The two leaders spoke at a joint press conference late on Sunday afternoon after meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Trump said it would be clear “in a few weeks” whether negotiations to end the war would succeed.

Zelensky said an agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine had been reached. Trump was slightly more cautious, saying they were 95% of the way to such an agreement and that he expected European countries to “take over a big part” of that effort with US backing.

Zelensky has said previously that he hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, a Russian demand that would mean ceding some territory held by Ukrainian forces.

Both Trump and Zelensky said on Sunday that the future of the Donbas had not been settled. “It’s unresolved, but it’s getting a lot closer. That’s a very tough issue,” Trump said.

Just before Zelensky and his delegation arrived at Trump’s Florida residence, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke in a call described as “productive” by the US president and “friendly” by Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov.

Ushakov, speaking in Moscow, said Putin told Trump that a 60-day ceasefire proposed by the European Union and Ukraine would prolong the war. The Kremlin aide also said Ukraine needed to make a decision regarding the Donbas “without further delay”, and that Russia had agreed to establish working groups to resolve the conflict, focusing on economic and security concerns.

Zelensky arrived at Mar-a-Lago early on Sunday afternoon as Russian air raids piled pressure on Kyiv. Russia hit the capital and other parts of Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the city.

Zelensky has described the weekend attacks as Russia ’s response to US-brokered peace efforts, but Trump said on Sunday that he believes both Putin and Zelensky are serious about peace.

The US president said he would call Putin again after meeting with Zelensky. Zelensky had previously told journalists he planned to discuss the fate of the contested Donbas region with Trump, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other issues.

Putin said on Saturday that Moscow would continue waging its war if Kyiv did not seek a quick peace. Russia has steadily advanced on the battlefield in recent months, claiming control over several more settlements on Sunday.

While Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, the question of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved. Moscow insists on gaining all of the Donbas, while Kyiv wants the map frozen along current battle lines.

The US, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, though it remains unclear how such a zone would function in practice.

US negotiators have also proposed shared control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Power line repairs have begun there after another local ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the agency said on Sunday.

Russia controls all of Crimea , which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12% of Ukrainian territory, including about 90% of the Donbas, 75% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and smaller parts of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that any peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024, including Ukraine withdrawing from the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim of joining NATO .

Zelensky’s past encounters with Trump have not always gone smoothly, but Sunday’s meeting followed weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to outline post-war security guarantees for Kyiv with US support.

Ahead of the Mar-a-Lago visit, Zelensky said he held a detailed phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer . Trump said he and Zelensky would also hold a call with European leaders during the Florida meeting.

A 20-point plan emerged from subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators, spun off from a Russian-led 28-point proposal that became public in November following discussions involving US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:20:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/52e02106-e438-11f0-a2a5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-28T215401Z-15833044-RC2XPIAPYRS2-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-TRUMP-ZELENSKIY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to press Netanyahu on stalled Gaza ceasefire, Iran and Lebanon</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251228-trump-to-press-netanyahu-on-stalled-gaza-ceasefire</link><description>US President Donald Trump is expected to push for progress in the stalled ceasefire in Gaza when he meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, for talks that will also include Israel’s concerns over Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran.

The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills will involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, in a statement containing a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that will be under sea and air space restrictions for 10 hours from 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT).

This marks China's sixth major round of war games since 2022 after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-governed island, and follow a rise in Chinese rhetoric over Beijing's territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

"This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to 'Taiwan Independence' separatist forces and external interference forces," Shi Yi, a spokesperson for China's Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.

"The exercise focuses on training for maritime and aerial combat readiness patrols, gaining integrated control, sealing off key ports and areas and conducting multi-dimensional deterrence."

The military released a poster titled "Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions," featuring two golden shields emblazoned with the Chinese People's Liberation Army insignia and the Great Wall of China, along with three military aircraft and two ships.

Taiwan's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While the PLA had practiced port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island are aimed at "deterrence" of outside military intervention.

The drills began 11 days after the U.S. announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever weapons package for the island, drawing a protest from China's defence ministry and warnings the military would "take forceful measures" in response.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 01:52:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QUU5URKWYZLEFB3N3RLSMXX43I.jpg?auth=912d85daeae673f9f941cec74ffbda966c0aefd103b4c332dd340e2aa96679df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexican train derailment kills at least 13 people, 98 injured</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/least-13-dead-after-train-derails-mexico-2025-12-29/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Sunday that at least 13 people were killed after an Interoceanic Train carrying 250 people derailed in the southern state of Oaxaca.

The Mexican Navy said the train, which derailed near the town of Nizanda, was carrying nine crew members and 241 passengers.

Of those on board, 139 were reported to be out of danger, while 98 were injured, including 36 who were receiving medical assistance.

President Claudia Sheinbaum said on X that five of the injured were in critical condition, adding that senior officials had been dispatched to the site to assist the families of those killed.

The governor of Oaxaca, Salomon Jara Cruz, expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the accident and said state authorities were coordinating with federal agencies to assist those affected.

Mexico's Attorney General's Office has already opened an investigation into the incident, Attorney General Ernestina Godoy Ramos said in a social media post.

The Interoceanic Train, inaugurated in 2023 under former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, forms part of the broader Interoceanic Corridor project.

The initiative was designed to modernize the rail link across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, connecting Mexico's Pacific port of Salina Cruz with Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf Coast.

The Mexican government has sought to develop the isthmus into a strategic trade corridor, expanding ports, railways and industrial infrastructure with the goal of creating a route that could compete with the Panama Canal.

The train service is also part of a broader push to expand passenger and freight rail in southern Mexico and stimulate economic development in the region.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 01:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven Turkish police wounded in clash with Islamic State militants, media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/seven-turkish-police-wounded-clash-with-islamic-state-militants-media-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Seven Turkish police officers were wounded during a clash with suspected Islamic State militants in Yalova province in northwest Turkey on Monday, state broadcaster TRT Haber reported.

Rapper turned-Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, known as Balen, a popular elected official, joined the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) or national independent party, led by a former TV host-turned politician Rabi Lamichhane on Sunday, party officials said.

They said under the agreement with RSP, 35-year old Balen will become the prime minister if the RSP wins the March 5 elections while Lamichhane will remain the party chief.

Both have vowed to address the demands raised during the "Gen Z" or youth-led protests against widespread corruption in September in which 77 people were killed and led to Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigning.

“It is a very smart and strategic move by the RSP to bring in Balen and his young supporters into its fold,” analyst Bipin Adhikari said.

“Traditional political parties are in pain for fear of losing their young voters to RSP,” he said.

The election commission says nearly 19 million of Nepal’s 30 million people are eligible to vote in the elections. Nearly one million voters – mostly youths – were added after the protests.

Balen was in the spotlight after the protests and was an undeclared leader of the youngsters who led the September protests.

He also helped form the interim government of former Chief Justice Sushila Karki to oversee the vote.

Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) or UML and the centrist Nepali Congress party have shared power between them for most of the past three decades and are most likely to be challenged by Balen.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:49:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OTIX5GVP7JKRPKAC4ZSUWJU6OU.jpg?auth=18f1297836944b44c9843d9c21be3d9e15906fee91282defbd77f3c4140d3a9f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korean president vows to reveal truth on anniversary of Jeju Air crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korean-president-vows-reveal-truth-anniversary-jeju-air-crash-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday apologised to the families of the 179 people who died in a Jeju Air (089590.KS) , opens new tab crash a year ago, vowing to reveal the truth behind the worst aircraft accident on the country's soil.

"As president who has the responsibility to protect the lives and safety of the people, I offer my deepest apologies," Lee said in a message released on Monday.

Relatives of the victims have demanded answers about the accident, after investigators delayed releasing a report on what went wrong on December 29, 2024, when the Jeju Air jet crash-landed and slammed into an embankment at the end of the runway.

It erupted in a ball of flames, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes.

But questions remain about safety lapses, the design of the runway at Muan International Airport where the crash occurred and what actions the pilots took in the last few minutes of the flight.

"The disaster clearly revealed the systematic problems and limitations of our society," Lee said. "What's needed now is not perfunctory promises or empty words but rather real change and action."

Parliament has been reviewing a plan to overhaul the aircraft accident investigation board to ensure independence and greater expertise.

Relatives of the victims are scheduled to hold a memorial service later on Monday at Muan International Airport in the country's southwest to mark the anniversary.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3QWGBPMONLQDJTEYV6WJ2G7IM.jpg?auth=b21b8f6fcc3ee8caf08bbf0f3faa84b1f9bcd1a0753499e75593dd38e6d048f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia says Bondi review to check if terror attack could have been averted</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-says-bondi-review-check-if-terror-attack-could-have-been-averted-2025-12-29/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday an independent review into law enforcement agencies set up after the Bondi mass shooting will assess whether authorities could have taken additional steps to prevent the terror attack.

Albanese said the review will examine whether existing laws or information gaps stopped police and security agencies from acting against the alleged attackers, a father and son, who police say were inspired by the militant group Islamic State.

Fifteen people were killed in the mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach on December 14, shocking a country with strict gun laws and fuelling calls for tougher controls and stronger action against antisemitism.

Families of those killed and injured on Monday urged Albanese to set up a royal commission, the most powerful type of government inquiry, to probe the rise of antisemitism and any intelligence failures tied to the attack, Australian media reported on Monday.

"Announcements made so far by the federal government in response to the Bondi massacre are not nearly enough ... You owe us answers. You owe us accountability. And you owe Australians the truth," said a statement from the families of those involved in the mass shooting, according to media reports.

Reuters could not immediately contact the families for comment.

Albanese, who is facing mounting criticism from opponents who argue his government has not done enough to curb a rise in antisemitism, has been resisting calls to set up a royal commission into the attack. He reiterated it would take years for the inquiry to submit the report.

"The government is committed to making sure that we can't wait years for answers. We need to get on with any changes that are required," Albanese told reporters, while announcing the terms for the review into the attack.

Albanese said the independent committee will submit the report in April and the Parliament will resume as soon as possible next year to consider any legislation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TXRO3KJKURNC7N32SYKIRDAZIY.jpg?auth=3c0a27f5fea00cbf706768d004620fd3ce96e722a4b28437868b278fdc0f5d05&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's ex-First Lady Kim received bribes and meddled in state affairs, prosecutor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/south-koreas-ex-first-lady-kim-received-bribes-meddled-state-affairs-prosecutor-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The wife of former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol interfered in state affairs in return for expensive valuables and money, a special prosecutor said on Monday.

The special prosecutor's investigations, which wrapped up on Sunday, came amid a year-long probe into Yoon's brief imposition of martial law last year and related scandals linked to the once-powerful couple.

The prosecution team earlier this month sought a 15-year prison sentence for former First Lady Kim Keon Hee, who is under detention and currently on trial for suspected acceptance of bribes for mediation and other charges.

Kim has denied any wrongdoing. She apologised to the public for causing concerns during a court hearing earlier this month.

Kim "took advantage of the status of the president's spouse to receive money and expensive valuables, and has been widely involved in various personnel appointments and nominations," special prosecutor Min Joong-ki said at a news conference marking the end of his investigation.

A lower court ruling on Kim is expected on January 28.

The prosecution team has also indicted Unification Church leader Han Hak-ja, now on trial, after the religious group was suspected of giving Kim valuables including two Chanel bags and a diamond necklace as part of its efforts to win influence.

Han has denied that she directed her church to bribe Kim.

"Various people who did not have a common denominator with each other visited Kim Keon Hee, not the president, and asked for what they wanted, and gave money and goods," said assistant special prosecutor Kim Hyeong-geun.

"As a result, their request was realised."

Ousted President Yoon is on trial for suspected masterminding of an insurrection, a charge that could mean a life sentence or even a death penalty. He has denied the charges.

A lower court ruling on Yoon is expected early 2026.

The fire at the Werdha Damai retirement home was finally extinguished late on Sunday and authorities are still investigating its cause, police official Alamsyah P. Hasibuan said.

Footage by news channel Metro TV showed the fire blazing through the home, turning the night sky orange, with residents appearing to help one elderly person escape from the burning building.

Jimmy Rotinsulu, chief of Manado's fire department, told Metro TV that the home's residents, most of whom were elderly, were trapped inside the building, adding that another three people suffered burns.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China blames military drills for reef damage around disputed shoal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/china-blames-military-drills-reef-damage-around-disputed-shoal-2025-12-29/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 29 (Reuters) - China said without naming any country that military activities such as bomb-dropping training in the waters around Scarborough Shoal have damaged the coral reefs there, state broadcaster CCTV said on Monday citing an ecological report.

The report, conducted by the country's natural resources ministry, also said that "illegal fishing" and frequent intrusion activities in recent years have threatened the ecosystem around the shoal.

China and the Philippines both claim territorial rights to Scarborough Shoal , one of Asia's most contested maritime features prized for its rich fisheries, its protective lagoon and proximity to major shipping lanes. But sovereignty has never been established.

It is effectively under Beijing's control although Filipino boats continue to operate there.

In September, China approved the creation of a national nature reserve at the shoal, a plan the Philippines condemned as a "clear pretext for occupation".</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China conducts large-scale Taiwan drills amid rising tensions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251229-china-conducts-large-scale-taiwan-drills-amid-rising-tensions</link><description>China 's military moved army, naval, air force, and artillery units around Taiwan on Monday for its "Justice Mission 2025" drills, as the island vowed to defend democracy and mobilised troops to rehearse repelling a potential Chinese attack.

The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills would involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, accompanied by a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that would be under sea and airspace restrictions for ten hours from 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT).

This marks China's sixth major round of war games since 2022, following then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s visit to the democratically governed island, and comes amid heightened Chinese rhetoric over Beijing's territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could prompt a military response from Tokyo .

The drills began 11 days after the US announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan—the largest ever weapons package for the island—drawing a protest from China's defence ministry and warnings that the military would "take forceful measures" in response. Beijing's exercises increasingly blur the line between routine training and what analysts say could be stage-setting for an attack, a strategy designed to give the US and its allies minimal warning of a potential assault.

China's military said it had deployed fighter jets, bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range rockets, and would practise striking mobile land-based targets while simulating a coordinated assault on the island from multiple directions.

"This [the drills] serves as a serious warning to 'Taiwan Independence' separatist forces and external interference forces," said Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.

Taiwan's government condemned the drills. A presidential office spokesperson urged China not to misjudge the situation or undermine regional peace, calling on Beijing to immediately halt what they described as irresponsible provocations.

The island's defence ministry said two Chinese military aircraft and 11 ships had been operating around Taiwan over the past 24 hours, and that Taiwan's military remained on high alert and poised to carry out "rapid response exercises."

The drill is specifically designed to enable rapid troop mobilisation in case China suddenly turns one of its frequent exercises around the island into an attack.

"All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom," the ministry said.

Taiwan's stock markets were largely unaffected by the drills, rising 0.3% to a record high in morning trading.

The Chinese military released two posters titled "Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions" and "Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial", alongside a graphic depicting four locations across the island with targets locking on, following the drill announcement.

China's state broadcaster said the drills would focus on sealing off Taiwan's vital deep-water ports of Keelung to the north and Kaohsiung to the south, the island’s largest port city.

The first poster features two golden shields emblazoned with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army insignia and the Great Wall of China, along with military aircraft and two ships. China is mobilising an armada of civilian ships capable of supporting an attack on Taiwan. Vessels with ramps and open decks similar to military landing craft used in amphibious assaults since World War Two appear in the poster.

"Any foreign interference that touches the shield [of justice] shall perish! Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!" the poster reads.

The second poster shows flaming arrows raining down on Taiwan, spearing green cartoon bugs. Beijing regularly labels Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te a "parasite" and began using the green bug caricature to represent separatist forces during April’s war games.

While the PLA practised port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island aim to deter outside military intervention.

Takaichi's remarks triggered a surge in Chinese messaging emphasising its sovereignty claims. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump in November that Taiwan's "return to China" after World War Two was central to Beijing's vision of the global order.

Taiwan rejects China's claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island's future.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/785e510a-e460-11f0-90fa-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-29T021724Z-670509462-RC22QIATVZGB-RTRMADP-3-CHINA-TAIWAN-DRILLS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kim oversees cruise missile launch as North Korea touts nuclear readiness</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251229-kim-oversees-cruise-missile-launch-as-north-korea-touts-nuclear-readiness</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw the launch of long-range strategic cruise missiles on Sunday, which confirmed the integrity of the country’s nuclear power and counter-attack readiness in the face of security threats, state media KCNA said on Monday.

The launch is the latest event attended by Kim in a flurry of activity by the North Korean leader to underscore the country’s military and economic progress ahead of a key ruling party congress expected to be held in early 2026.

Kim expressed “great satisfaction” as the cruise missiles flew along their orbit above the sea west of the Korean Peninsula and hit their target, KCNA said.

Kim said that “checking the reliability and rapid response of the components of the DPRK’s nuclear deterrent on a regular basis … (is) just a responsible exercise”, as the country “is facing various security threats”, using North Korea ’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

He affirmed that North Korea would continue devoting all its efforts to the “unlimited” development of its nuclear combat force, KCNA added.

South Korea ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Monday that its military had detected the launch of multiple cruise missiles at around 8 a.m. on Sunday (2300 Saturday GMT) from the Sunan area near Pyongyang .

A series of military activities by the North in the past week, including ongoing work to build a nuclear-powered submarine, are “activities that undermine peace and stability on the Korean peninsula”, a South Korean defence ministry spokesperson said.

Sunday’s launch followed a KCNA report last week that Kim had observed the construction of a nuclear-powered submarine with his daughter, a possible successor, and oversaw the test-firing of long-range surface-to-air missiles.

North Korea could conduct additional missile tests around New Year’s Day, Yonhap news agency said, citing a South Korean military official. South Korea’s military declined to comment on the possibility of further launches.

Hong Min, an expert on North Korea at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said Sunday’s launch was likely intended to test an upgraded cruise missile capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear weapons.

Kim also attended the opening ceremony of a paper mill on Sunday, KCNA said.

Over the past month, Kim has attended multiple openings of facilities including factories and hotels, as the country races to wrap up its current five-year development plan before convening the Ninth Congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea in early 2026.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 04:51:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20251284-e128-11f0-8d6b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-24T224143Z-208249276-RC29NIAR68AC-RTRMADP-3-NORTHKOREA-POLITICS-MISSILES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kolkata's iconic trams face final stop as modernization rolls in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/kolkatas-iconic-trams-face-final-stop-modernization-rolls-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:54:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>No New Year fireworks in Indonesia as nation mourns Sumatra flood victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/no-new-year-fireworks-indonesia-nation-mourns-sumatra-flood-victims-2025-12-29/</link><description>JAKARTA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central government will support the plans of several regions to forgo fireworks while celebrating New Year this week in solidarity with the victims of recent floods on the island of Sumatra, an official in the president's office said on Monday.

Several governments and police forces, including those in the capital Jakarta and on the popular tourist island of Bali, have said they will not allow firework displays out of respect for the victims on Sumatra, where floods and landslides have killed over 1,100 people, with around 400,000 still displaced.

Prasetyo Hadi, spokesperson for President Prabowo Subianto's office, told reporters that the government thinks it is correct that regional governments should ban fireworks or urge people not to set them off during the celebrations.

"It is correct because we have to show empathy and solidarity ... as a nation, that there are some who suffered from a disaster," he said.

Police in Bali's capital of Denpasar have banned New Year's fireworks, state news agency Antara reported on Saturday. Jakarta's governor also said last week that there will be no firework displays in the city of 10 million people, and urged residents not to set any off.

Indonesian authorities have built bridges and housing in the areas of Sumatra hit by the floods, which include the provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra, and Aceh. The recovery is expected to cost at least $3.11 billion .

Several regions on the island remain in a state of emergency, coordinating minister for human development Pratikno said in a press conference on Monday.

Over 20 villages across the three provinces "disappeared" after being swept away by the floods, home affairs minister Tito Karnavian said during the same briefing.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 06:36:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UQOQ67SX7VPVPDVQI4N2ENTM7A.jpg?auth=4f35c9311d3c8ad811470a19319fb9935bd7727ef12756272e6ab0ff95666740&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After 2025 recognition of a Palestinian state, what's next ?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-after-2025-recognition-of-a-palestinian-state-what-s-next</link><description>The Palestinian cause scored a symbolic victory in 2025 as several Western countries that had long shown caution or ambiguity formally recognised the State of Palestine.

In September, on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York, France, Britain, Portugal, Canada, Australia and Belgium, among others, announced they were recognising Palestine, as Israel continued its war in Gaza and stepped up settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank.

France played a driving role in the unprecedented wave of recognitions, prompting strong opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who rejected the creation of a Palestinian state and described it as "a huge reward for terrorism", referring to Hamas and the October 7 attacks.

After years of rhetorical support for a Palestinian state, conditioned on prior peace with Israel, Paris ultimately decided to move to formal recognition on September 22, when President Emmanuel Macron addressed the UN General Assembly.

The decision was presented as an explicit endorsement of the two-state solution, long viewed as the central framework for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

"This recognition is unquestionably a very important moment in the history of this conflict, as well as for French diplomacy, particularly in the way it was carried out," said Jean-Paul Chagnollaud, emeritus professor and honorary president of the Institute for Research and Studies on the Mediterranean and the Middle East (IREMMO). "There is indeed a symbolic dimension, but it is more than that, because it is a significant political act."

"France sought to rally part of the Western world that had previously been reluctant," he added, noting that the broader French initiative led to the New York Declaration, signed by 142 states.

France’s recognition formed part of a wider diplomatic push, including an international conference co-chaired with Saudi Arabia that culminated on September 12 in the UN General Assembly’s adoption of the New York Declaration , which described recognition of the Palestinian state as "essential and indispensable".

The declaration laid out what was described as an "irreversible" roadmap for a political settlement based on the two-state solution and excluded Hamas from any political role in Gaza.

"Ultimately, this kind of recognition comes down to the decision of one person – the president – who, like anyone else, has doubts and hesitations," Chagnollaud said. "Last spring, I wouldn’t have bet a euro on France recognising the (Palestinian) state. But what Emmanuel Macron saw in April, when he travelled close to Gaza during a visit to Egypt, and the atrocities then being committed, pushed him to act."

Despite opening the way for closer bilateral ties and increasing pressure on the Palestinian Authority to pursue reforms, the recognitions remain largely insufficient given the realities on the ground.

Even if France said the move increased pressure on Israel to accept the Gaza ceasefire demanded by US President Donald Trump a couple of weeks after the UN General Assembly, recognition has not ended the occupation, halted settlement expansion or stopped violence against Palestinian civilians. Nor has it sidelined Hamas, which continues to control the Gaza strip.

Without concrete implementation of the New York Declaration, stronger pressure on the Israeli government and a clear US willingness to rebalance power dynamics, the recognitions risk remaining largely symbolic, with little impact on Palestinians’ daily lives.

"The effects are clearly limited and, in some respects, counterproductive," Chagnollaud said. "They are limited because recognition has no direct impact, and because France and the Europeans lack leverage on the ground, unlike the Americans, who are clearly opposed to this recognition and to the New York Declaration."

"The move is counterproductive if all these states that have taken the step of recognition stop there,” he added. “And unfortunately, that is the case since they have not lifted a finger to jointly impose a reality on the ground, for example through sanctions against Israel, which has waged a war that has annihilated an entire society and is doing everything, including in the West Bank, to undermine the very idea of a Palestinian state."

The diplomatic momentum was soon overshadowed by Donald Trump’s peace plan, which succeeded in imposing a ceasefire in Gaza but was structured around US and Israeli security priorities, leaving intact the grievances that fuel violence and undermine prospects for lasting peace.

"We are heading towards the crushing of the Palestinian question, both literally and figuratively,” Chagnollaud said. “I even think that in 2026 we will witness one of the worst periods in Palestinian history."

Trump and Putin agree that a "temporary ceasefire" would "merely prolong the conflict and risk a renewed escalation on the battlefield," Kremlin diplomatic advisor Yuri Ushakov said.

He said that Trump and Putin would speak again "promptly" after the Zelensky meeting.

US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were moving “very close” to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, though both leaders acknowledged that major sticking points, including territory and security guarantees, remain unresolved.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Monday that Kyiv's allies would meet in Paris next month to discuss security guarantees as part of a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

"We will bring together the countries of the Coalition of the Willing in Paris in early January to finalize each one's concrete contributions," Macron said on X after speaking with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky and US President Donald Trump.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 06:37:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b0e8bb32-e479-11f0-8aca-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25352358942018.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria secures Assad-era mass grave revealed by Reuters and opens criminal investigation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-secures-assad-era-mass-grave-revealed-by-reuters-opens-criminal-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 - Syria’s government has ordered soldiers to guard a mass grave created to conceal atrocities under Bashar al-Assad and has opened a criminal investigation, following a Reuters report that revealed a yearslong conspiracy by the fallen dictatorship to hide thousands of bodies on the remote desert site.

The site, in the Dhumair desert east of Damascus, was used during Assad’s rule as a military weapons depot, according to a former Syrian army officer with knowledge of the operation. It was later emptied of personnel in 2018 to ensure secrecy for a plot that involved unearthing the bodies of thousands of victims of the dictatorship buried in a mass grave on the outskirts of Damascus and trucking them an hour’s drive away to Dhumair.

The plot, orchestrated by the dictator’s inner circle, was called “ Operation Move Earth .” Soldiers are stationed at the Dhumair site again, this time by the government that overthrew Assad.

The Dhumair military installation was also reactivated as a barracks and arms depot in November, after seven years of disuse, according to an army officer posted there in early December, a military official and Sheikh Abu Omar Tawwaq, who is the security chief of Dhumair.

The Dhumair site was completely unprotected over the summer, when Reuters journalists made repeated visits after discovering the existence of a mass grave there.

Within weeks of the report in October, the new government created a checkpoint at the entrance to the military installation where the site lies, according to a soldier stationed there who spoke to Reuters in mid-December. Visitors to the site now need access permits from the Defense Ministry.

Satellite images reviewed by Reuters since late November show new vehicle activity around the main base area.

The military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the reactivation of the base is part of efforts to “secure control over the country and prevent hostile parties from exploiting this open strategic area.” The road through the desert connects one of Islamic State’s remaining Syrian strongholds with Damascus.

In November, police opened an investigation into the grave, photographing it, carrying out land surveys and interviewing witnesses, according to Jalal Tabash, head of the al-Dhumair police station. Among those interviewed by police was Ahmed Ghazal, a key source for the Reuters investigation that exposed the mass grave.

“I told them all the details I told you about the operation and what I witnessed during those years,” said Ghazal, a mechanic who repaired trucks carrying bodies that broke down at the Dhumair grave site. Ghazal confirmed that during the time of “Operation Move Earth,” the military installation appeared vacant except for the soldiers involved in accompanying the convoys.

Syria’s Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the re-activation of the base or the investigation into the mass grave.

The National Commission for Missing Persons, which was established after Assad’s ouster to investigate the fate of tens of thousands of Syrians who vanished under his rule, told Reuters it is in the process of training personnel and creating laboratories in order to meet international standards for mass grave exhumations. Exhumations at Syria’s many Assad-era mass graves, including the site at Dhumair, are scheduled for 2027, the commission told Reuters.

The police have referred their report on Dhumair to the Adra district attorney, Judge Zaman al-Abdullah. Al-Abdullah told Reuters that information about Assad-era suspects involved in the Dhumair operation, both inside and outside Syria, is being cross-referenced with documents obtained by security branches after the dictator’s fall in December 2024. He would not describe the suspects, citing the ongoing investigation.

According to military documents reviewed by Reuters and testimony from civilian and military sources, logistics for “Operation Move Earth” were handled by a key man, Col. Mazen Ismander. Contacted through an intermediary, Ismander declined to comment on the initial Reuters report or the new investigation into the mass grave.

When the conspiracy was hatched in 2018, Assad was verging on victory in the civil war and hoped to reclaim legitimacy in the international community after years of sanctions and allegations of brutality. He had been accused of detaining and killing Syrians by the thousands, and the location of a mass grave in the town of Qutayfah, outside Damascus, had been reported by local human rights activists.

So an order came from the presidential palace: Excavate Qutayfah and hide the bodies on the military installation in the Dhumair desert.

For four nights a week for nearly two years, from 2019 to 2021, Ismander oversaw the operation, Reuters found. Trucks hauled corpses and dirt from the exposed mass grave to the vacated military installation in the desert, where trenches were filled with bodies as the Qutayfah site was excavated.

In revealing the conspiracy, Reuters spoke to 13 people with direct knowledge of the two-year effort and analyzed more than 500 satellite images of both mass graves. Under the guidance of forensic geologists, Reuters used aerial drone photography to create high-resolution composite images that helped corroborate the transfer of bodies by showing color changes in the disturbed soil around Dhumair’s burial trenches.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 07:26:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WWGRJCMSQBKVFPRAEJFYQ44XNA.jpg?auth=140586332e11004300634408aaa4b8b3e8e14e1264bcbb1e772293d6c4a7b971&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand and Cambodia agree to 'consolidate ceasefire' in China talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-cambodia-will-gradually-consolidate-ceasefire-china-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Thailand and Cambodia plan to rebuild mutual trust and gradually consolidate a ceasefire after weeks of border clashes, Beijing said in a communique with the two countries following talks in southwestern China.

The Southeast Asian neighbours on Saturday ended weeks of fierce fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million with their second ceasefire since late October.

Thailand and Cambodia's top diplomats travelled to the Chinese province of Yunnan for trilateral talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss the border situation on Sunday and Monday.

In a meeting with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts, Wang called the ceasefire "hard-won," and urged the two nations not to abandon it halfway or allow fighting to resume.

"Discussions between the three parties were beneficial and constructive, and an important consensus was reached," Wang said, according to a statement released by his ministry, which did not mention ASEAN's role in facilitating a ceasefire.

The parties involved must "look forward and move forward," Wang added.

Thailand and Cambodia will "rebuild political mutual trust, achieve a turnaround in relations, and maintain regional peace," according to a joint communique released by China's official Xinhua news agency.

The latest round of clashes began early this month after a breakdown in a ceasefire that U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur to halt a previous round of fighting.

"The implementation of the ceasefire agreement requires continued communication and consultation, and the restoration of bilateral relations must also proceed gradually," Wang said on Monday.

Thai and Cambodian defence officials also joined the talks in China.

Diplomats and defence officials from Thailand and Cambodia held a number of bilateral meetings, the Chinese foreign minister said, adding that both sides held in-depth discussions and showed a "positive and open attitude."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 07:46:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CSNYTMHK4ZOEHL56UYJOWREDSI.jpg?auth=ab768503da1c6cf7141dbc9d3cf39d48b917074461e6778148b8457d989d3616&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One migrant dead and three missing after boat sinks off Greek island of Samos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/one-migrant-dead-three-missing-after-boat-sinks-off-greek-island-samos-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - A woman was found dead and three people remain missing after a migrant boat sank off the Greek island of Samos early on Monday, the coast guard said.

The local government tore down the monument honouring Chinese contributions to the Panama Canal, citing safety issues and an expired land concession, drawing ire from the local Chinese community and criticism from Panama's president.

"The nature of the forced demolition is very bad, which has seriously damaged the feelings of the vast number of overseas Chinese in Panama, and runs counter to the overall situation of China-Panama friendship," foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, told a regular press briefing.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 08:35:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W6GF7QXQLZOBZNE6REPMDBAW6E.jpg?auth=c52dabcd71c012fa122dc983286eff15027a18fec2bf062bfee492a93e2b5353&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netanyahu and Trump to meet in Florida to discuss second phase of Gaza ceasefire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-netanyahu-and-trump-to-meet-in-florida-to-discuss-second-phase-of-gaza-ceasefire</link><description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida on Monday, with the US president pushing to move to the next stage of the fragile Gaza truce plan.

The crucial meeting at Trump's lavish Mar-a-Lago resort comes as some White House officials fear both Israel and Hamas are slow-walking the second phase of their ceasefire.

Trump, who said Netanyahu had asked for the talks, is reportedly keen to announce – as soon as January – a Palestinian technocratic government for Gaza and the deployment of an international stabilisation force.

The two leaders are to meet at 1pm (1800 GMT), the White House said.

Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian said Netanyahu would discuss the second phase, which involves making sure that "Hamas is disarmed, Gaza is demilitarised."

But Netanyahu will also try to shift the focus onto Iran during his fifth meeting in the United States with Trump this year, amid reports he will push for more US strikes on Tehran's nuclear program.

Netanyahu would also bring up the "danger Iran poses not only to the region of the Middle East , but the United States as well", Bedrosian said before flying out with the Israeli premier.

Netanyahu's visit caps a frantic few days of international diplomacy in Palm Beach, where Trump hosted Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday for talks on ending Russia's invasion.

The Gaza ceasefire in October is one of the major achievements of Trump's first year back in power, but his administration and regional mediators want to keep up the momentum.

Trump's global envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner hosted senior officials from mediators Qatar , Egypt and Turkey in Miami earlier this month.

The timing of the Netanyahu meeting is "very significant", said Gershon Baskin, the co-head of peacebuilding commission the Alliance for Two States, who has taken part in back-channel negotiations with Hamas.

"Phase two has to begin," he told AFP, adding that "I think the Americans realise that it's late because Hamas has had too much time to re-establish its presence."

The first phase of the truce deal saw Hamas release the remaining hostages, both dead and alive, from the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Hamas has returned all but the body of one hostage. Both sides allege frequent ceasefire violations.

Under the second stage, Israel is supposed to withdraw from its positions in Gaza, while Hamas is supposed to lay down its weapons – a major sticking point for the Islamist movement.

An interim authority is meanwhile meant to govern the Palestinian territory, and the international stabilisation force (ISF) is to be deployed.

The Axios news outlet reported on Friday that Trump wanted to convene the first meeting of a new Gaza "Board of Peace" that he will chair at the Davos forum in Switzerland in January.

But it said that senior White House officials were growing exasperated with what they viewed as efforts by Netanyahu to stall the peace process.

"There are more and more signs that the American administration is getting frustrated with Netanyahu," said Yossi Mekelberg, a Middle East expert at London-based think-tank Chatham House.

"The question is what it's going to do about it," he added, "because phase two is right now going nowhere".

For his part, Netanyahu is set to focus with Trump on Iran's nuclear programme, which the United States and Israel struck in June but which Israel fears Tehran is rebuilding.

Israel is also continuing to strike Hamas targets in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon despite a ceasefire there. Syria will also be on the agenda.

Mekelberg said Netanyahu could be attempting to shift attention from Gaza onto Iran as Israel enters an election year.

"Everything is connected to staying in power," he said of the long-time Israeli premier.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 08:36:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d74759c6-e48a-11f0-969c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25290000837382.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh’s Gen-Z party faces revolt over Islamist alliance, risking its future</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-gen-z-party-faces-revolt-over-islamist-alliance-risking-its-future-2025-12-29/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - A Bangladeshi youth-driven party born out of the country's 2024 uprising is facing an open revolt from within after sealing an election alliance with an Islamist group, a move analysts say could jeopardise its future and reinforce established parties.

At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami , announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest.

The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on February 12.

Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place.

"The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain," said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. "Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity."

The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the protests that ousted long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August, 2024, forcing her to flee to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina's Awami League and the BNP.

With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh's secular constitution.

An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus revoked , opens new tab all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024.

The NCP's struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said.

NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent killing of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi , a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence.

"The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat,” said Nahid, 27.

"This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions."

Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them.

Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time.

One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent.

"I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture," she said on Facebook. "Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise."

Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was "doomed".

"If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you," he said. "It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:31:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OIKRZJV43BO5DAIZHUTJNKJYCM.jpg?auth=132cc1b6e546b04f409d1cb80d882cfbc792b522bfc9bf471c11d5b0d2996049&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says 20-point peace plan should be put to referendum in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-20-point-peace-plan-should-be-put-referendum-ukraine-2025-12-29/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that a 20-point peace plan to end Russia's war should be put to a referendum in Ukraine.

"As a small, export-oriented country, we simply cannot afford to forgo such an opportunity," Kocher told Austrian news agency APA in an interview.

Austrian lawmakers in 2019 passed a resolution setting the country against a Mercosur trade deal, since when the government has repeatedly said it must uphold that position.

The EU and the bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay reached agreement last December to create the EU's largest ever trade accord, some 25 years after negotiations were launched. However, the bloc is struggling to win support from Italy and deal critics France, Poland and Hungary.

Approval of the accord requires a qualified majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population.

Kocher said plenty had changed since Austrian lawmakers voted to oppose a deal six years ago, and that the present agreement had significant safeguards for farmers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:33:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UOEEXK3FEROZZK2PVJWATQGGR4.jpg?auth=5424a46be2b26d427b76b5188279cccc8a760e91cf31aae353cdb2e692283b3c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesian authorities recover body during search for drowned Spanish soccer coach and his children</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesian-authorities-recover-body-during-search-drowned-spanish-soccer-coach-2025-12-29/</link><description>JAKARTA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Indonesian rescuers on Monday found a body during the search for Spanish soccer coach Fernando Martin and his children after their boat sank near the coast of a popular tourist spot on Friday, the country's rescue agency said.

Martin was a coach with the Spanish club Valencia CF, which said he and his three children died "in the tragic boat accident in Indonesia, as confirmed by local authorities."

The boat Martin and his family were on capsized on Friday after suffering engine failure during bad weather in the Padar Island Strait, close to the resort town of Labuan Bajo, authorities said. The location is near the Komodo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site where the rare Komodo dragons live.

Fathur Rahman, the chief of a local search and rescue agency, said they have recovered the body of a female "highly suspected of being a victim" of the accident. Authorities are currently trying to secure an identification, he added.

The search for the bodies of Martin and his children are ongoing despite strong currents and tall waves, Fathur said, adding it will also continue going into Tuesday.

Martin's wife and one daughter, as well as four crew members and a tour guide, survived the accident. The boat was carrying 11 people.

Indonesia has placed a temporary ban on tour boats sailing in the waters of Labuan Bajo and the Komodo Islands, its tourism ministry said on Sunday.

Separately, a speedboat carrying 21 people capsized in the waters near Indonesia's Papua, with 17 people missing and one dead, a local search and rescue agency official said on Monday.

Boats and ferries are a regular mode of transport in Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, with accidents caused by bad weather and lax safety standards that often allow vessels to be overloaded.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BGNSZUREVNKXFPWEDQO6XIZGVQ.jpg?auth=205f201e024fd6d70315ae6d305333c4af0529ceef3d3905c74a57920124700e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia raids several firms as part of anti-graft probe into army procurement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-raids-several-firms-part-anti-graft-probe-into-army-procurement-2025-12-29/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Malaysia's anti-graft agency said on Monday that it has raided several firms alleged to be involved in bribery linked to army procurement projects, days after the country's army chief was placed on leave pending an investigation into the matter.

Azam Baki, chief commissioner at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, said the agency had also frozen six bank accounts belonging to a suspect and their family members as part of the probe.

He did not provide details about the suspect or the companies involved, but said investigations were being carried out under an anti-corruption law related to corporate liability for bribery.

"MACC officers have conducted searches at several companies believed to be involved to obtain relevant documents and evidence," Azam said in a statement.

Malaysia's army chief Muhammad Hafizuddeain Jantan was put on immediate leave on Saturday to allow room for authorities to fully investigate allegations involving him "without any conflict of interest", defence minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said in a statement over the weekend, without providing specifics.

Citing sources, state news agency Bernama reported last week that MACC had recorded statements from three people as part of a probe into army procurement projects between 2023 and 2025.

A preliminary review found that several firms had repeatedly secured high-value contracts, Bernama quoted one of the sources as saying. Reuters was unable to independently verify the report.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OLJHUEBV7VOT5K25SKRCVCDFFI.jpg?auth=acd396a94c9b8d82e794d77754008fe6064b21badc7ef5210d19f6bbfc4e3995&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egyptian-British activist Abd el-Fattah apologises for past social media posts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egyptian-british-activist-abd-el-fattah-apologises-past-social-media-posts-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, freed from prison in Egypt and now in Britain, apologised on Monday for his "shocking and hurtful" social media posts made more than a decade ago, which have led to calls for his deportation from opposition British politicians.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, became Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending much of his adult life in and out of detention due to his activism and was a rare symbol of opposition during a far-reaching crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

He arrived in Britain last Friday after obtaining British citizenship in 2021 through his mother, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was "delighted" by the news.

In the following days, British newspapers ran stories about posts made by Fattah on the former Twitter platform between 2008 and 2014, seen by Reuters, which endorsed violence against "Zionists" and police.

In a statement, Abd el-Fattah said many of his tweets had been misunderstood but that others were unacceptable.

"Looking at the tweets now - the ones that were not completely twisted out of their meaning - I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise," Fattah said.

"They were mostly expressions of a young man's anger and frustrations in a time of regional crises - the wars on Iraq, on Lebanon and Gaza - and the rise of police brutality against Egyptian youth."

Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK party which currently tops opinion polls, called for Abd el-Fattah's deportation from Britain. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said the country should consider it.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said his posts were of "profound concern" and showed a lack of due diligence among British authorities.

Britain's foreign office said it condemned Abd el-Fattah's historic tweets and called them "abhorrent", in a statement published on Sunday.

Abd el-Fattah was most recently serving a five-year sentence in Egypt imposed in December 2021, after he shared a social media post about a prisoner's death.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zaporizhzhia power plant could restart in 18 months once the war ends, head says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/zaporizhzhia-power-plant-could-restart-18-months-once-war-ends-head-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The head of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine said on Monday the facility could restart power generation by the middle of 2027 if the war concludes in the near future.

"If this (the end of the conflict) happens tomorrow, we will be ready to start up in mid-2027," Ramil Galiyev was cited as saying by Russia's RIA state news agency.

The nuclear plant, Europe's largest, has been under Russian control since March 2022, when Russian forces overran much of southeastern Ukraine. It is not currently producing electricity but relies on external power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.

Power line repairs are currently underway at the plant under the watch of a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and are expected to last a few days.

Galiyev said "serious issues" at the plant would have to be addressed before it could go online, including replenishing the cooling pond and preparing railway tracks.

Both Russia and Ukraine regularly accuse one another of shelling the plant, risking a nuclear disaster.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4G3ZSP2FQJLVJCVJUTH77ISEZU.jpg?auth=d67762e0ceecda8e582464dbdb667325e0464e9babe76e6a28911c25a7900967&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's war games around Taiwan over the years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-war-games-around-taiwan-over-years-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - China launched its most extensive war games around Taiwan on Monday called "Justice Mission 2025" to showcase Beijing's ability to cut off the island from outside support in a conflict.

The People's Republic of China has claimed Taiwan through its "one China" policy since the Chinese civil war forced the defeated Republic of China government to flee to the island in 1949, and has vowed to bring Taiwan under Beijing's rule, by force if necessary.

The government in Taiwan strongly rejects the Chinese sovereignty claims, saying it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, and that only its people can decide their future.

Here are some facts on military tensions between China and Taiwan and previous Chinese military exercises.

- China and Taiwan have nearly gone to war several times since 1949. The two sides last joined battle on a large scale in 1958, when Chinese forces bombed the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu islands for more than a month, alongside naval and air combat.

- Ahead of Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996, China carried out missile tests in waters close to the island, hoping to prevent people voting for Lee Teng-hui, whom China suspected of harbouring pro-independence views. Lee won convincingly.

- In August 2022, furious at a visit to Taipei by then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, China held several days of war games around Taiwan, including launches of ballistic missiles, some of which flew over Taipei, and simulated sea and air attacks in surrounding skies and waters.

- In April 2023, China held three days of drills around Taiwan, saying they had tested integrated military capabilities under combat conditions, having practised precision strikes and blockading the island. Those drills came after Taiwan's then-President Tsai Ing-wen returned to Taipei following a meeting in Los Angeles with Kevin McCarthy, who at the time was U.S. House speaker.

- In August 2023, China launched military drills around Taiwan as a "serious warning" to "separatists" in an angry but widely expected response to then-Vice President Lai's visit to the United States.

- In May 2024, shortly after Lai's inauguration as president, China launched "punishment" drills dubbed "Joint Sword - 2024A" around Taiwan in what it said was a response to "separatist acts", sending up heavily armed warplanes and staging mock attacks.

- In October 2024, China held one day of "Joint Sword - 2024B" war games around Taiwan in response to a national day speech by Lai. Taiwan said China used a record number of military aircraft in those exercises.

- In December 2024, Taiwan reported a large rise in Chinese air force and navy activity around the island and in waters in the region, though China never officially confirmed it was holding exercises.

- In April 2025, China held " Strait Thunder-2025 ", saying it was a "stern warning" against separatism.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7NRXODZ2ZKO5IELAYZ7U6B4UU.jpg?auth=8696306dbe01c73d3bfb33e06a18d2f019c38a5b4fb941de61f27f4b3b802c80&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zaporizhzhia power plant could restart in 18 months once the war ends, head says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/zaporizhzhia-power-plant-could-restart-18-months-once-war-ends-head-says-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China's war games around Taiwan over the years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-war-games-around-taiwan-over-years-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand's army says Cambodia violated truce with more than 250 drones</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251229-thailand-s-army-says-cambodia-violated-truce-with-more-than-250-drones</link><description>Thailand 's army on Monday accused Cambodia of violating a newly signed ceasefire agreement, reached after weeks of deadly border clashes, by flying more than 250 drones over its territory.

The Thai army said "more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side, intruding into Thailand's sovereign territory" on Sunday night, according to a statement.

"Such actions constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing tensions, which are inconsistent with the Joint Statement agreed" during a bilateral border committee meeting on Saturday, it added.

Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn said in remarks aired on state television on Monday that the two sides had discussed the incident and agreed to investigate and "resolve it immediately".

Prak Sokhonn described it as "a small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border line".

Thailand and Cambodia agreed to the "immediate" ceasefire on Saturday, pledging to end renewed border clashes that killed dozens of people and displaced more than a million this month.

The reignited fighting spread to nearly every border province on both sides, shattering an earlier truce for which US President Donald Trump took credit.

Under the agreement signed on Saturday, the Southeast Asian neighbours agreed to cease fire, freeze troop movements and co-operate on demining efforts and combatting cybercrime.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e7a98c9a-e498-11f0-892e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360527101264.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Ukraine should withdraw troops from Donbas, and a Putin-Trump call expected soon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-ukraine-should-withdraw-troops-donbas-putin-trump-call-expected-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the part of Donbas that it still controls if it wanted peace, and that if Kyiv did not strike a deal then it would lose yet more territory.

Putin and Trump spoke on Sunday ahead of Trump's meeting in Miami with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said another call was planned very soon.

Peskov refused to comment on the idea of a free economic zone in Donbas or on the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is controlled by Russia, saying that the Kremlin felt it was inappropriate.

When asked about Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov's remarks about the decision that Kyiv needed to take on Donbas, Peskov said that Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the parts they still controlled.

"We are talking about the withdrawal of the regime's armed forces from the Donbas," Peskov said. When asked it that applied to the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions too, he refused to discuss details.

Russia currently controls a fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea which it annexed in 2014, about 90% of Donbas, 75% of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Russia claims Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson as part of Russia, though most countries consider the regions to be part of Ukraine.

Peskov said no call between Putin and Zelenskiy was being discussed.

Peskov paraphrased Trump's remarks that Ukraine could lose more territory to Russia over coming months unless Kyiv struck a deal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:49:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SB7XZLJKLNJZPDNPOEUMI72S4M.jpg?auth=fd16f403ab4d121951b0fd7dcead01ca67230583a5c242c573234435c2f84321&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq's newly elected parliament holds first session</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-newly-elected-parliament-holds-first-session-2025-12-29/</link><description>BAGHDAD, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Iraq's newly elected parliament convened on Monday for its first session since the November national election, opening the way for lawmakers to begin the process of forming a new government.

The programme is aiming to reach around 55 million recipients by early January, Zulkifli Hasan told reporters after a meeting with government bodies to discuss food reserves for 2026.

The scheme was President Prabowo Subianto's flagship campaign promise in 2024, with the aim of distributing food to as many as 83 million school children and pregnant women, but it has been controversial due to its high costs and mounting food safety concerns.

Since its launch in January, more than 11,000 children nationwide have been affected by food poisoning, according to data from the agency overseeing the programme.

Prabowo had originally targeted the programme's full roll-out by the end of 2025. However, in October the target was scaled back to around 70 million as a result of a kitchen shortage.

Zulkifli did not explain why the targets have been scaled back again.

Indonesia has earmarked 171 trillion rupiah ($10.19 billion) for the programme this year under the original target, and the allocation for 2026 is set to be doubled to 335 trillion rupiah.

Hundreds of people surrounded the site at Muan International Airport where the Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 crash-landed without wheels deployed, slammed into the barrier and exploded into a fireball on December 29, 2024.

Relatives - who have said they are outraged by the lack of progress in finding out what went wrong - sobbed on Monday as they lit candles on a cake and sang 'Happy Birthday' for the 16 victims who were born in December.

"We will not stop until the truth is finally revealed and those responsible are held accountable so that the lives of the 179 were not lost for nothing," Kim Yu-jin, representing the families, said at a memorial service in the airport.

Addressing mourners, government officials and the Parliament speaker, Kim accused the government of focusing its energies on clearing up the aftermath of the crash rather than carrying out a proper investigation.

Relatives laid flowers on a memorial altar and looked on as the names of the dead were read out and displayed on a screen, written on cards in the shape of boarding tickets.

"I hope the investigation will be conducted thoroughly, so that those who deserve to be punished ... are punished,” Ryu Kum-Ji, who lost both her parents in the crash, told Reuters.

President Lee Jae Myung - who came to office six months after the disaster - apologised to the families in a statement earlier on Monday and said it was his duty to make sure there was no repeat of the tragedy.

"The disaster clearly revealed the systematic problems and limitations of our society," Lee said.

"What's needed now is not perfunctory promises or empty words but rather real change and action."

The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board has failed to meet a one-year deadline to release a report into the accident.

It said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes in an earlier approach to the airport.

In July, investigators said the left engine, which sustained less damage than the right one following the bird strikes, was shut down before the crash landing.

Few other details have emerged since then , with questions remaining about the design of the runway including the heavy embankment, and what actions the pilots may have taken in the last few minutes of the flight.

Representatives of the families have raised questions about the board's independence and expertise and said investigators appear to be blaming the pilots rather than looking into other factors.

Parliament has been reviewing a plan to overhaul the board.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:19:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQUOPCLLYFP4RCWEKWRSJ2RX6U.jpg?auth=7ef5075ddedbc119cbf9caaae973a8044a166e47e1e5b3c2bd4638bc8301ed7e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US pledges $2 billion in humanitarian support to UN, State Department says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pledges-2-billion-humanitarian-support-un-state-department-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>GENEVA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The United States has made a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid, a U.S. State Department official said on Monday, following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration in 2025.

The U.S. slashed its aid spending this year, and leading Western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the United Nations.

The U.S. is pledging to commit $2 billion in funding to the U.N. for humanitarian aid, the U.S. State Department official said. No further details were provided on how the money would be allocated or if additional pledges would follow.

U.N. data shows total U.S. humanitarian contributions to the U.N. fell to about $3.38 billion in 2025, equating to about 14.8% of the global sum. This was down sharply from $14.1 billion the prior year, and a peak of $17.2 billion in 2022.

Earlier in December, the United Nations launched a 2026 aid appeal for $23 billion to reach 87 million people at risk - half the $47 billion sought for 2025, reflecting plunging donor support despite record global needs.

U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher has said the U.N.'s humanitarian response is overstretched and underfunded, meaning "brutal choices" had to be made to prioritise those most in need.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:19:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IJR273B4RBNXHGOCXUMHN5YYW4.jpg?auth=33f6e1048905cd59dabbb9bcb82195072afa8c0e9925ef7fad0b7dfab27a8754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Is peace in Ukraine any closer after Trump-Zelenskiy talks?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/is-peace-ukraine-any-closer-after-trump-zelenskiy-talks-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW/KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday and said the two were "maybe very close" to a deal to end the war with Russia.

But they gave few details on how the most contentious issues between the warring parties would be resolved, namely territorial concessions and security guarantees for Ukraine.

Here are some of the main sticking points after weeks of intense diplomacy:

Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, controls about 116,000 square km (44,800 square miles), or about 19.2%, of Ukrainian territory.

That is roughly 1.2% more than three years ago, according to pro-Ukrainian maps. Russia's forces have advanced in 2025 at the fastest pace since 2022.

Russia says Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - together known as Donbas - plus Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are now legally part of Russia. Most of the international community says they were annexed illegally.

But Russia has not achieved its main aim of taking the whole of Donbas and on Monday it repeated demands that Ukraine withdraw from the area of Donetsk it still holds - about 5,000 square km - if it wants peace.

The Kremlin added that if Kyiv did not strike a deal it would lose more territory.

Kyiv rejects the idea of ceding territory it has been defending for nearly four years, saying it wants the fighting to be halted along current front lines.

Both Trump and Zelenskiy said on Sunday the future of Donbas had not been settled, although the U.S. president said discussions were "moving in the right direction."

Under its initial 28-point peace plan , the United States, seeking compromise, proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine left the area, although it remains unclear how any such zone would function in practice.

Russia also does not control all of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, while it has taken small parts of Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported that Putin said he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine in exchange for all of Donbas.

Ukraine, wary of failed assurances from allies in the past, says it needs robust security guarantees to prevent another Russian attack.

Zelenskiy said on Monday a draft peace framework to end Russia's war envisages U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine for 15 years. He added he had asked Trump to provide guarantees of up to 50 years.

Trump wants Europe to take on the lion's share of providing any guarantees, albeit with U.S. backing, although what form they take remains unclear. Russia, for example, has stated that any foreign troop deployment in Ukraine would be unacceptable.

Russia has also demanded caps on the size of Ukraine's army and protection for Russian speakers and Orthodox believers in Ukraine, and says Ukraine should be neutral.

Kyiv says Russian speakers are protected and that Ukraine adheres to EU legislation. Under a Ukrainian 20-point peace proposal , Ukraine would maintain its armed forces at their present strength of 800,000 personnel.

One of Putin's central demands for ending the war is that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging the U.S.-led military alliance NATO eastwards.

The initial U.S. peace proposals included a clause that NATO would not expand further, that Ukraine would enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO and that NATO would include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.

Ukraine would get short-term preferential access to the European market while its bid to join the European Union was being considered.

Under Ukraine's framework peace proposal, the United States, NATO and European countries would provide Ukraine with security guarantees that mirror Article 5, the mutual-defence clause of NATO's founding treaty.

The initial U.S. proposals state that Russia, under Western sanctions over the war, would be reintegrated into the global economy and invited to be part of the G8.

The United States said in its initial proposals that it will strike a long-term agreement with Russia to develop "energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centres, rare-earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities."

European Union leaders decided in December to borrow cash to loan 90 billion euros ($105 billion) to Ukraine to fund its defence against Russia for the next two years.

They decided not to use frozen Russian assets, sidestepping divisions over an unprecedented plan to finance Kyiv with Russian sovereign cash.

Peace moves could possibly entail Russia and the United States agreeing to resume talks on strategic nuclear arms control.

The future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Ukrainian territory controlled by Russia, is unclear.

There has been media speculation that Russia might offer U.S. companies stakes in its vast natural resources sector.

Washington has floated the idea of holding elections in Ukraine. Putin says the Kyiv leadership lost legitimacy after refusing to hold elections when Zelenskiy's elected term expired. Kyiv says it cannot hold elections while under martial law and defending its territory against Russia.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:43:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HCPI5OLYDJJLNOSFEJJWP7GI5Q.jpg?auth=57c69ea45ff15746995f2d1e4c30125cc8b04f95a0698a58d09e7ed14238f555&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian shopkeepers protest, shut stores as currency hits record low</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-iranian-shopkeepers-protest-shut-shop-as-currency-hits-record-low</link><description>Iranian traders and shopkeepers staged a second day of protests Monday after the country’s currency plummeted to a new record low against the US dollar.

Videos on social media showed hundreds taking part in rallies in Saadi Street in downtown Tehran as well as in the Shush neighborhood near Tehran's main Grand Bazaar, which played a crucial role in the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the monarchy and brought Islamists to power.

Witnesses told The Associated Press that traders shut their shops and asked others to do the same. The semiofficial ILNA news agency said many businesses and merchants stopped trading even though some kept their shops open.

There was no reports of police raids though security was tight at the protests, according to witnesses.

On Sunday, protest gatherings were limited to two major mobile market in downtown Tehran, where the demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans.

Iran 's rial on Sunday plunged to 1.42 million to the dollar. On Monday, it traded at 1.38 million rials to the dollar.

The rapid depreciation is compounding inflationary pressure, pushing up prices of food and other daily necessities and further straining household budgets, a trend that could worsen by a gasoline price change introduced in recent days.

According to the state statistics center, inflation rate in December rose to 42.2% from the same period last year, and is 1.8% higher than in November. Foodstuff prices rose 72% and health and medical items were up 50% from December last year, according to the statistics centre. Many critics see the rate a sign of an approaching hyperinflation.

Reports in official Iranian media said that the government plans to increase taxes in the Iranian new year that begins March 21 have caused more concern.

Iran’s currency was trading at 32,000 rials to the dollar at the time of the 2015 nuclear accord that lifted international sanctions in exchange for tight controls on Iran’s nuclear programme. That deal unraveled after US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from it in 2018.

There is also uncertainty over the risk of renewed conflict following June’s 12-day war involving Iran and Israel . Many Iranians also fear the possibility of a broader confrontation that could draw in the United States, adding to market anxiety.

In September, the United Nations reimposed nuclear-related sanctions on Iran through what diplomats described as the “snapback” mechanism. Those measures once again froze Iranian assets abroad, halted arms transactions with Tehran and imposed penalties tied to Iran’s ballistic missile programme.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:46:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cd09a586-e4b2-11f0-9085-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP22357588236786.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump-Zelenskiy talks yield no progress on Ukraine-Russia territorial issues</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-zelenskiy-talks-yield-no-progress-ukraine-russia-territorial-issues-2025-12-29/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine on Monday remained far apart on territorial issues that are blocking a peace deal, despite progress on security guarantees for Kyiv at talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Trump said after his talks with the Ukrainian president on Sunday that they were "getting a lot closer, maybe very close" to an agreement to end Russia's war in Ukraine but that "thorny issues" were still there.

Zelenskiy said two main issues outlined in a 20-point peace proposal remained to be resolved - control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Russian hands, and the fate of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine.

"Two questions remain: the station - how will the station operate? - and the territory," Zelenskiy told reporters on Monday.

Underlining how far apart Kyiv and Moscow are on territory, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine must withdraw its troops from the small part of Donbas that it still controls, and that Kyiv would lose more land if it did not agree to a deal.

"We are talking about the withdrawal of the regime's armed forces from the Donbas," Peskov said.

He said a call was planned soon between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but did not say when.

Trump 's decision to hold talks with Zelenskiy in Florida on Sunday had widely raised hopes of at least some progress being made towards ending what has become Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014. It claims Donbas - comprising the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - as well as the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, although they are all internationally recognised as Ukraine's sovereign territory.

Russia wants Kyiv to withdraw troops from parts of the Donetsk region it has failed to occupy in four years of war since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Kyiv wants fighting halted along current front lines, and Washington has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine pulls troops back.

"There is no detailed concept for a free economic zone yet," Zelenskiy said.

Russia has rejected the idea of a ceasefire to allow a referendum to be held on any territorial concessions by Ukraine.

One sign of progress on Sunday came when Zelenskiy said a bilateral agreement had been reached on security guarantees for Kyiv although Trump said they were only 95% ready.

"I told (Trump) that we have been at war for almost 15 years, and would very much like the guarantees to be for longer," Zelenskiy said, adding that he had asked Trump to consider a security deal for up to 50 years.

Trump said on Sunday he expected European countries to "take over a big part" of that effort with U.S. backing. Agreement on such moves could be complicated as Russia has said any foreign troop deployment in Ukraine would be unacceptable.

French President Emmanuel Macron said progress was being made on security guarantees, and countries in the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" would meet in Paris in early January to "finalise concrete contributions".

Despite the recent peace overtures, and some exchanges of prisoners of war, mistrust runs deep between Ukraine and Russia.

Russia launched a heavy attack on Ukraine before the talks in Florida began, and has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy facilities as winter approached. Large parts of the capital Kyiv were without power on Monday after the strike as temperatures were below freezing.

Trump repeated on Sunday after his call with Putin that he believed the Russian leader wants the war to end.

"In my opinion, (Putin's) actions do not coincide with the seemingly peaceful rhetoric he uses in his dialogue with the U.S. president," Zelenskiy said, questioning Putin's commitment to peace.

Zelenskiy said he was open to any format of communication with Russia, and a meeting would be possible after Trump and European leaders agree on the framework for peace. Peskov said no call between Putin and Zelenskiy was being discussed.

Putin has said Russia will achieve its aims in Ukraine by force if Kyiv does not want to resolve the conflict diplomatically - making clear it must accept Moscow's demands.

Several Ukrainians who spoke to Reuters in Kyiv on Monday voiced scepticism about prospects for a lasting peace.

"Putin doesn't need territory; he doesn't need Donbas — he wants to destroy the Ukrainians. He destroys us as a nation," said Nadiia Yevtushenko, a 57-year-old Kyiv resident.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:37:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TIQQZVFAUZLC7AALHROSZIDXKY.jpg?auth=66d75f21ac9cddf8c0be51efbeb50922907b90bddc26584d1a68b7978fdcd493&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin amends law to let Russia ignore foreign criminal courts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-amends-law-let-russia-ignore-foreign-criminal-courts-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed into law changes that give Russia the right to ignore judgements in criminal cases issued by foreign and international courts amid Ukrainian and European attempts to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.

The move, which comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to broker a peace deal in Ukraine, appears to be a response to several initiatives to go after Russian officials and military officers for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, something Moscow denies its forces are guilty of.

Ukraine and the Council of Europe human rights body signed an agreement in June forming the basis for a special tribunal, and Europe this month launched an International Claims Commission for Ukraine in an effort to ensure Kyiv is compensated for hundreds of billions of dollars in damage from Russian attacks and alleged war crimes.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has also issued arrest warrants for Putin and five other Russians, accusing them of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine.

The Kremlin, which called the ICC move outrageous, says the allegation is false and that Moscow has only acted to remove children from a conflict zone for their own safety.

Under the changes to Russian law backed by Putin on Monday, Moscow will formally have the right under its own domestic legislation to disregard rulings in criminal cases taken by foreign courts on behalf of foreign governments without Russia's participation.

Rulings issued by international legal bodies whose authority is not based on an international agreement with Russia or a U.N. Security Council resolution can also be ignored under the changes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7BSDZTPBBKVTKVY2LY6FL77AI.jpg?auth=e83a7516e7fbcac2c3a4fe63a029031fd49270f21ee506d12950338fd6ed8bbc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo's 'political earthquake' election sees Kurti resurgent</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovos-political-earthquake-election-sees-kurti-resurgent-2025-12-29/</link><description>PRISTINA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - An emphatic election victory for Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti marks a resurgence for the nationalist leader, ending a political deadlock in Europe's youngest state and potentially determining its domestic and international agenda for years.

The win strengthens Kurti's mandate to push through domestic reforms, including welfare expansion and higher salaries for public workers, although he faces major problems including tensions with Serbia and health and education systems that lag Kosovo's Balkan neighbours.

With nearly all the votes counted, Kurti's Vetevendosje Party led with more than 49% of Sunday's vote, official results show, meaning he only requires some very small coalition partners to form a majority.

It signals a turnaround for Kurti, whose failure to win enough votes in the last poll in February or form a coalition with larger opposition parties meant that parliament did not function for most of 2025, an impasse that led to delays in the delivery of around 1 billion euros in international funding vital for one of Europe's poorest countries.

The exact outcome of another term for Kurti is unclear, but at stake is Kosovo's relations with its historic international allies, including the United States, and its attempts to join the European Union, which Kurti supports.

"It's a political earthquake that has shattered the opposition parties, and we are going to feel the consequences of this result for the next decade," said political commentator Ilir Deda.

"Kosovo has decided to replace this political pluralism with a model of very strong government and weak opposition, like other countries in the Western Balkans."

Sunday's poll took place over the holiday period when Kosovo's diaspora are typically at home in force, which may have aided Kurti, who was previously elected in 2021. According to an exit poll conducted by Ubo Consulting, 61.7% of people from the diaspora voted for the prime minister's party.

"We are tired of this nine-month blockade that has cost us our nerves, cost Kosovo millions of euros, and set back our development. With this result there is a solution, which is why we are happy," said Tahir Shabani, 58, who lives in Germany but returned to Pristina to vote.

Still, others wanted to see immediate changes after the impasse, especially in quality of life, healthcare, and education.

"Institutions must be established and the state must continue to function. We have a lot of work to do, just as the Prime Minister said. The budget must be approved, we must approve international agreements, and progress must be made," said Pristina voter, Skender Halimi, 52.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. backing, including a 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbian forces trying to crush an uprising by the 90% ethnic Albanian majority.

Despite international support, the country of 1.6 million has struggled with poverty, instability and organised crime. While over 100 countries recognise Kosovo's statehood, Serbia, Greece, Spain, Russia and many others do not.

Tensions with Serbia flared violently in 2023, prompting the EU to impose sanctions on Kosovo - in part due to Kurti's policies against the Serb minority that still live in northern Kosovo. The measures likely cost Kosovo .

While that hit Kurti's reputation at home and abroad, the EU said it would lift the sanctions just as campaigning began this month.

"I think the electorate interpreted it as a sign that there are no problems between the Kurti government and the West," Deda said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PPYKFGOLEJN2HDWAWGTCAOZ264.jpg?auth=dc342393df8f9eb949db09b8af8bf9250e4c5f47e0f2f2ff7d019c7011d173eb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>British boxer Joshua hurt in fatal car crash in Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/briton-joshua-hurt-fatal-car-crash-nigeria-local-paper-reports-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - British former heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua was involved in a car accident in Nigeria's Ogun State that killed two people, local police said on Monday.

The three eastern Mediterranean nations have drawn closer over the past decade through joint military drills, defence procurement and energy cooperation, developments closely watched by regional rival Turkey.

Greece’s armed forces general staff (GEETHA) said senior military officials from the three countries signed a joint action plan for defence cooperation last week in Cyprus. It gave no further details.

The deal follows a meeting in Jerusalem between Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at which they signed a deal to strengthen maritime security cooperation and advance energy interconnection projects.

A senior Greek official familiar with the matter said the military deal would encompass joint naval and air exercises and the transfer of know-how from Israel to Greece and Cyprus to address both “asymmetrical” and “symmetrical” threats.

“Greece and Israel will intensify joint exercises after the ceasefire in Gaza , with Cyprus participating,” the official said, adding that Greece plans to join Israel’s Noble Dina naval exercise in the coming months in the eastern Mediterranean.

There was no immediate comment from the Cypriot government, but a key opposition party, the Communist AKEL, expressed misgivings. "Mr Christodoulides proceeds to deepen military-political cooperation with Israel without considering the risks and consequences of this choice," it said in a statement.

Greece and Cyprus have already purchased missile systems from Israel worth billions of euros. Athens is also in talks to buy from Israel medium- and long-range anti-aircraft and anti-ballistic missile systems for a planned multi-layer air and drone defence system known as the “Achilles Shield”, estimated to cost about 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

This month, the Greek parliament approved the purchase of 36 PULS rocket artillery systems from Israel to bolster defences along Greece’s northeastern border with Turkey and on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.

"Tomorrow ... scheduled flights, including about 296 international departures, around 265 international arrivals and roughly 296 transit flights," will be affected, the administration said, adding it anticipated the hitches would snarl travel for "more than 100,000 passengers".

China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and rocket troops to conduct joint military drills around the island of Taiwan, a move Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing its forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace".

The first of two days of drills came after Beijing expressed anger at US arms sales to the territory and a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi , saying its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that the world’s second-biggest economy says must come under its rule. The Chinese military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday morning.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a post on X that rapid response exercises were under way, with forces on high alert to defend the island. In a separate statement, it said it had deployed appropriate forces in response, conducting combat readiness drills.

“The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” the ministry said.

Senior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/db87c414-e4b5-11f0-ae4e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24276120271264-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hamas confirms deaths this year of armed wing spokesperson Abu Ubaida and Gaza chief Sinwar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-confirms-deaths-this-year-armed-wing-spokesperson-abu-ubaida-gaza-chief-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Hamas confirmed on Monday that its armed wing spokesperson, Abu Ubaida, and then Gaza chief Mohammed Sinwar were killed in the Gaza war earlier this year.

The actress, who became a symbol of 1950s and 60s France, made her home in the resort where she said she found solace among animals and dedicated her life to their welfare.

"She was lovely, lovely, there's no other word. Yes, we will really miss her," Saint-Tropez resident Philippe Volmier told Reuters on Monday.

Volmier said he had known her for 30 years and used to see her walking her dogs on the beach. "One time, she fell into the water with her dog. I had to pick her out," he added. "She was a friend who helped people a lot."

President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday Bardot embodied "a life of freedom". "A French existence, a universal radiance. She moved us. We mourn a legend of the century," he added.

For much of the latter part of her life, she lived alone behind high walls in the resort, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses.

She told French weekly Paris Match in 2024 that she wanted to be buried in her garden.

The Var Prefecture told Reuters it had not received any request for a private burial, which would have been needed to bury her in her garden.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:49:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KRLTKBNT7VIFJOA24XKFQDILXY.jpg?auth=882a7b9e7e9c27d9e1769f8f619ca19b0ffb61d7fda831c5a03a7dad7bdefaa2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Aid workers find little life in Sudan's al-Fashir after paramilitary takeover</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/aid-workers-find-little-life-sudans-al-fashir-after-paramilitary-takeover-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 - International aid staff who accessed Sudan's al-Fashir for the first time since its takeover by a paramilitary force found the city largely deserted, with a few people sheltering in buildings or under plastic sheets, a senior U.N. official said on Monday.

More than 100,000 are estimated to have fled al-Fashir since late October after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces took control there following an 18-month siege that plunged the city into famine.

Survivors reported ethnically-motivated mass killings and widespread detentions during and after the takeover. Many people remain unaccounted for in al-Fashir and surrounding areas.

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Denise Brown, the U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, described al-Fashir as a "crime scene".

"The town was not teeming with people. There were very few people that (they) were able to see," she said, describing a visit to al-Fashir by U.N. staff on Friday that lasted several hours.

U.N. requirements of safe passage and free movement took weeks to negotiate, despite RSF attempts to portray the city as back to normal soon after its takeover.

Brown said it was not possible to give a precise number of those remaining in al-Fashir. Those who U.N. staff did see were living inside empty buildings or in rudimentary camps using basic plastic sheets.

There was a small market functioning, but with few items, mainly locally grown vegetables.

"We have photos of people, and you can see clearly on their faces the accumulation of fatigue, of stress, of anxiety, of loss," Brown said.

Other aid workers have previously said that those remaining are most likely those too old, sick, or injured to leave.

Satellite imagery from December 16 analysed by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab showed signs of the removal of bodies but few signs of life.

At the Saudi Hospital , which the World Health Organization says was the site of a massacre of 460 people, Brown said medical personnel were observed, but they had no supplies.

Brown said villages around the city appeared to be deserted.

The attack on al-Fashir was one of the most violent episodes of a war that has raged since April 2023 between the RSF and the Sudanese army. It allowed the RSF to consolidate control over the Darfur region in Sudan's west, a push that continued in the northwest of the state this month.

Brown said Friday's visit was aimed at assessing whether al-Fashir could be accessed safely as the U.N. looks into what basic supplies can go in. "But to be honest, we're still very concerned about those who are injured, who we didn't see, those who may be detained," she said.

Later visits will look at water and sanitation, she said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:50:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KMVVSRF2UJKBXCMM37GA4NAOOE.jpg?auth=3cc228b8c3dde4a0b324932542609aa81329f9a64a9a92bb786008b6990b5264&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>First UN visit to Sudan's El-Fasher finds traumatised civilians amid reports of mass atrocities</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251229-first-un-visit-to-sudan-el-fasher-finds-traumatised-civilians-amid-reports-mass-atrocities-rsf</link><description>A small UN humanitarian team was able to visit Sudan 's El-Fasher, a city that fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in October amid reports of mass atrocities. They found traumatised civilians living without water or sanitation in a city haunted by famine, according to UN aid coordinator Denise Brown.

El-Fasher fell to the paramilitary RSF in October after more than 500 days of siege, and last Friday a small UN humanitarian team was able to make its first short visit in almost two years.

The capture of the city was reportedly accompanied by mass atrocities, including massacres, torture and sexual violence. Satellite pictures reviewed by AFP show what appear to be mass graves.

Brown described the city as a "crime scene", but said investigations would be carried out by human rights experts while her office focuses on restoring aid to the survivors.

"We weren't able to see any of the detainees, and we believe there are detainees," she said.

From a humanitarian point of view, she said, El-Fasher remains Sudan's "epicentre of human suffering" and the city – which once held more than a million people – is still facing a famine.

"El-Fasher is a ghost of its former self," Brown said in an interview.

"We don't have enough information yet to conclude how many people remain there, but we know large parts of the city are destroyed. The people who remain, their homes have been destroyed."

"These people are living in very precarious situations," warned Brown, a Canadian diplomat and the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator in Sudan.

"Some of them in abandoned buildings. Some of them... in very rudimentary conditions, plastic sheeting, no sanitation, no water. So these are very undignified, unsafe conditions for people."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:51:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1964d254-e4c0-11f0-8e41-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25338411988211.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin tells army to press on with campaign to take southern Ukrainian region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/putin-tells-army-press-with-campaign-take-southern-ukrainian-region-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday told his army to press on with a campaign to take full control of the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine after a Russian commander said Moscow's forces were 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) from its biggest city.

Putin made the comments a day after speaking to U.S. President Donald Trump about the prospects for a peace deal in Ukraine and was speaking at a televised Kremlin meeting with top military commanders and Andrei Belousov, the defence minister.

Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky, commander of Russia's Dnieper military grouping, told Putin that Russian forces were getting closer to the city of Zaporizhzhia, which had a pre-war population of over 700,000 people.

The wider Zaporizhzhia region - which Moscow controls around 75% of - is one of four Ukrainian provinces which Putin claimed as part of Russia in 2022, a move denounced by Kyiv and many Western countries as an illegal land grab.

"Frontline (Russian) units are located about 15 kilometres from the southern outskirts of the city of Zaporizhzhia," Teplinsky told Putin who responded:

"We understand and are aware that the enemy directly opposite you has been preparing its defence for many years, and we know how difficult the situation is there. But nevertheless, you are managing to accomplish the tasks facing the grouping."

The Kremlin chief told Teplinsky that he wanted more of the same.

"In the near future, it is necessary to continue the offensive, together with the East grouping to liberate Zaporizhzhia," said Putin.

General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia's General Staff, had earlier told Putin that Moscow's forces were advancing along nearly the entire front line, while Kyiv's forces were focused on defence and attempting to counter attack.

Gerasimov reported that Russian forces in 2025 had captured 6,640 square kilometres (2,563 square miles) of territory in Ukraine, including 334 villages, and that advances notched up in December were the fastest this year.

Lavrov said that on Dec. 28-29, Ukraine had attacked the Russian president's state residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range drones which were all destroyed by Russian air defences.

"Such reckless actions will not go unanswered," Lavrov said, adding that the attack amounted to "state terrorism."

He said that targets had already been selected for retaliatory strikes by Russia's armed forces.

Lavrov noted that the attack took place during negotiations about a possible Ukrainian peace deal and that while Russia would not leave the negotiations, Moscow's position will be reviewed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the accusation was a lie, adding that Moscow was preparing the ground to strike government buildings in Kyiv.

Brian Cole, 30, of Virginia admitted to planting the devices , neither of which exploded, outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees following his arrest earlier this month , according to the filing, which was made public on Sunday.

Cole told FBI agents “something just snapped” and that he wanted to do something “to the parties” because of their influence in U.S. politics, adding “I really don’t like either party at this point,” according to excerpts of his interview cited in the filing.

Prosecutors revealed new details about the investigation as they argued that Cole should be detained while awaiting a trial. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in Washington federal court.

Cole is facing two explosives-related charges. He has not yet entered a plea.

Cole’s arrest nearly five years after the incident came after top officials at the FBI ordered a fresh look at a case that had long vexed investigators and became fodder for right-wing theories tied to the Capitol riot.

Cole denied in the FBI interview that the placement of the bombs on January 5, 2021 was connected to the certification of the election in Congress on the following day.

The pipe bombs were not discovered until about 1 p.m. on January 6, diverting police resources just as a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump surged into the Capitol.

He initially denied planting the devices, telling the FBI that he had been in Washington to attend a protest to support Trump's false claims that his defeat in the 2020 election was the result of rampant voter fraud.

Cole told the FBI that powerful people needed to speak out if “something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:27:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VAJWJVTBVNNW7A2LU2CNZ4444E.jpg?auth=4ef2a32979395681a8ac49221a00bf365b263e4d5ac0af92f76922db1948d8c1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egyptian-British activist apologises for past social media posts as police launch review</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/egyptian-british-activist-apologises-past-social-media-posts-police-launch-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, freed from prison in Egypt and now in Britain, apologised on Monday for his "shocking and hurtful" social media posts made more than a decade ago, which counter terrorism police said they are assessing.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, became Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending years in and out of detention and a rare symbol of opposition during a crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

He arrived in Britain last Friday after obtaining British citizenship in 2021 through his mother, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was "delighted" by the news.

In the following days, British newspapers ran stories about posts he made on the former Twitter platform between 2008 and 2014, seen by Reuters, which endorsed violence against "Zionists" and police.

In another he called British people "dogs and monkeys".

Counter Terrorism Policing said the posts were being assessed following referrals from the public.

In a statement, Abd el-Fattah said many of his tweets had been misunderstood but that others were unacceptable.

"Looking at the tweets now - the ones that were not completely twisted out of their meaning - I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise," he said.

He added they were mostly "expressions of a young man's anger and frustrations" at wars in Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza, and "the rise of police brutality against Egyptian youth."

Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK party which tops opinion polls, called for Abd el-Fattah's deportation. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said the country should consider it.

A spokesperson for Starmer said he was not aware of the tweets when he campaigned for Abd el-Fattah's release and called the comments "abhorrent".

But the spokesperson added the government has a record of helping its citizens overseas.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said his posts were of "profound concern."

Abd el-Fattah was most recently serving a five-year sentence in Egypt imposed in December 2021, after he shared a social media post about a prisoner's death.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:28:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egyptian-British activist apologises for past social media posts as police launch review</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/egyptian-british-activist-apologises-past-social-media-posts-police-launch-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:28:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>External power line to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been restored, management says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/external-power-line-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-has-been-restored-management-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - An external power link has been restored to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine after the completion of repairs, the plant's Russian management said on Monday.

A statement said the line had been put out of action by "fire from the Ukrainian armed forces". Repairs were carried out with monitors present from the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It said the situation at the plant was under control, with normal radiation levels.

The station is connected to the power grid by two lines -- the second had remained in operation through the repair work.

In September and October, the plant was without external power for 30 days, relying on backup diesel generators, until a damaged line was reconnected during a local ceasefire arranged with the IAEA's help.

Russian forces seized the nuclear plant, Europe's largest, in the early weeks of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and each side regularly accuses the other of actions endangering safety there.

The plant is not producing electricity but relies on external power to keep nuclear fuel cool and avoid a meltdown.

The future of the plant's operations is one of the sticking points in talks to resolve the nearly four-year-old conflict pitting Moscow against Kyiv.

Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in December that the U.S. had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:50:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TPR4EJB3NRP77ORUJE5FNMEOIM.jpg?auth=a0634d7c12f492c874fb792d5fe4458a35783a0f2b08ba7516bf8f6e698dba89&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin told Trump that Russia's position will change after Ukrainian drone attack on residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-told-trump-that-russias-position-will-change-after-ukrainian-drone-attack-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday that Russia would review its position in peace negotiations after what Moscow said was a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian presidential residence, the Kremlin said.

Ukraine has dismissed the Russian statements that 91 drones attacked Putin's residence in northern Russia as lies, and has accused Moscow of attempting to undermine the peace talks.

Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said that Putin and Trump spoke on Monday and that Putin was briefed by Trump and his senior advisers about the negotiations with Ukraine.

Putin informed Trump about the drone attack on the Russian presidential residence and told Trump that Russia was reviewing its position as a result.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:50:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PW5AWIDFMZN5ZOR3PTWEWWYF6A.jpg?auth=85375f54a0d5bf4dd2f6392668a69014a793937e5750cb25fff4216c7bf77e49&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S. could block asylum on public health grounds under Trump regulation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-could-block-asylum-public-health-grounds-under-trump-regulation-2025-12-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. could deny migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border access to asylum under a newly finalized regulation drafted during the COVID-19 pandemic in President Donald Trump's first term.

The regulation, which goes into effect on Wednesday, allows U.S. authorities to bar asylum based on "emergency public health concerns generated by a communicable disease," according to a copy posted in the Federal Register on Monday.

The restrictions would not have any immediate effect but would provide the Trump administration with another tool to turn away would-be asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of migrants caught crossing illegally dropped to the lowest levels in decades after Trump took office in January and implemented a sweeping asylum ban at the border.

When COVID-19 took root in 2020 during Trump's first term, his administration used a U.S. health authority known as Title 42 to rapidly expel migrants crossing the border back to Mexico, saying it was needed to limit the spread of the virus. Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat who followed Trump in 2021, kept the Title 42 restrictions in place until 2023 , partly due to legal challenges that stalled attempts to end it.

Advocates have criticized the use of health emergencies to broadly deny access to asylum, saying U.S. law has been twisted to fulfill Trump's goal of turning away migrants.

"Considering the large amount of discretion the regulation grants the administration, and the president’s hyperfixation on immigration enforcement, we can expect this new authority to be overused and abused," said Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way.

The Biden administration postponed the effective date of the regulation five times, but did not take steps to terminate it.

In addition to asylum, the measure also allows federal agencies to deny another form of protection known as "withholding of removal."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:50:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D36XCNWKNZIWXKBFJN57YSPP6Y.jpg?auth=9e52782b4c66d7612badbe21c4628c8da1a294ea8d47f7e9a8677b61fd6197c7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine bonds at post-restructuring highs as investors see some progress in peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-bonds-post-restructuring-highs-investors-see-some-progress-peace-talks-2025-12-29/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Ukraine's government bonds rallied on Monday as investors saw some positive signs in talks on a deal to end the war with Russia, with some bonds hitting their highest since emerging from last year's $20 billion sovereign debt restructuring.

There was progress on security guarantees for Kyiv at talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday but Russia and Ukraine on Monday remained far apart on the main territorial issues blocking a peace agreement.

Ukraine's bonds have surged in the last 1-1/2 months amid a renewed push to halt the near four-year-old war and most added another 1 cent on the dollar , , , on Monday, following a busy weekend of diplomacy.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were now "getting a lot closer, maybe very close " to an agreement to end the war.

Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a call on Monday with Moscow also saying Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's Dolgiye Borody, or Long Beards, residence in northern Russia, an accusation that Kyiv denied.

Hopes for peace have been repeatedly dashed over the last year, but the moves in Ukraine's bonds have signalled renewed optimism, among investors at least, that a truce might now be within reach.

Monday's gains notably left Ukraine's 4.5% coupon 2034 and 2035 bonds - two of its most widely-traded - almost exactly where they were in early February before Trump's branding of Zelenskiy as a "dictator" and then scolding of him in the Oval Office triggered a major collapse in prices.

The bonds have also been boosted over the last six weeks by plans for a new four-year, $8.2 billion International Monetary Fund programme and a 90 billion euro ($105.83 billion) European Union loan to shore up the government's finances.

Kyiv has also just struck a long-awaited deal to replace the so-called 'GDP warrants' that helped it clinch is 2015 post-Crimea annexation debt restructuring, but had risked draining its finances once the current war ends.

Despite their widespread gains, not all of Ukraine's bonds are above or back to their early February highs.

Two where the payments are linked to the country's future economic growth rather than via regular coupons, and that won't mature for at least another 10 years , , remain well below, at roughly 57 cents on the dollar, compared to almost 70 cents back in February.

The confirmation of the visit follows a report published on Monday by British newspaper The Telegraph that said Milei planned to visit Britain.

The president's office did not provide details on the purpose of the visit or who Milei would meet with.

The Telegraph said that Milei confirmed in an interview that talks had begun to lift a ban on weapons sales stemming from the conflict over the British-run Falkland Islands.

Milei has previously maintained that Argentina should try to take back the islands, known in Argentina as the Islas Malvinas, through diplomatic channels.

Argentina has long claimed sovereignty over the islands, which Britain and Argentina fought a war over in 1982.

The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades released a video statement on its Telegram channel, saying: "We pause in reverence before... the masked man loved by millions... the great martyred commander and spokesperson of the Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida."

Israel previously announced it had killed Abu Obeida in a strike on Gaza on August 30.

During the war, Abu Obeida, whose real name was Hudhayfa Samir al-Kahlout, emerged as a central figure eagerly awaited by Gazans, as well as by Arab and international media, for official statements from Hamas's military wing, particularly those related to prisoner-exchange operations.

Born on February 11, 1985, and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Abu Obeida joined Hamas at an early age before becoming a member of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.

He later became the group's sole spokesman, delivering video statements in military uniform with his face consistently concealed by a red keffiyeh.

He had been the target of multiple Israeli assassination attempts.

According to Hamas officials, Abu Obeida embodied what they describe as "resistance" and was known for fiery and impactful speeches, many of which included threats against Israel or announcements of military operations.

"For many years, only a very small circle of Hamas officials knew his true identity," a Hamas official told AFP.

Israel has decimated Hamas's leadership, saying it seeks to eradicate the group following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war.

The video announcing Abu Obeida's death was delivered by a masked man dressed in the former spokesperson's distinctive style, who said he would adopt his predecessor's name for future statements.

In the same video, he also announced the deaths of four other Hamas commanders in Israeli attacks during the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fded5282-e4d1-11f0-b132-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP100326133624.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What's next for Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251229-what-next-for-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-russia-peace-plan</link><description>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant , Europe's largest, is one of the main sticking points in the US peace plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. The issue is one of 20 points laid out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a framework peace plan that he discussed with his American counterpart Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday.

Here are some of the issues regarding the facility:

Russia took control of the plant, which lies close to the front ​lines, in March 2022 and announced plans to connect it to its power grid.

Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia ‍and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Zelensky stated in December that the US had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.

Zelensky said the Ukrainian proposal envisages Ukrainian-American use of the plant, with the US itself determining how ​to use 50% of the energy produced.

Russia has considered joint Russian-US use of the plant, according to the Kommersant newspaper.

After his talks with Zelenskiy on ​Sunday, Trump said negotiators had made progress on deciding the fate of the plant, which can "start up almost immediately". The US president said "it's a big step" that Russia had not bombed the facility.

The plant is located in Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnipro River and the Kakhovka Reservoir, 550 km (342 miles) southeast of the capital Kyiv.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed reactors with a total capacity of 5.7 gigawatts, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) database.

It is not currently producing electricity but relies on external power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.

The plant's equipment is powered by electricity supplied from Ukraine. Over the past four years these supplies have been interrupted at least 11 times due to breaks in power lines, forcing the plant to switch to emergency diesel generators.

Both Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of striking the nuclear plant and of severing power lines ‍leading to it.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi says fighting a war around a nuclear plant has put nuclear safety and security in constant jeopardy.

The Russian head of the station said on Monday the facility could restart power generation by mid-2027 if the war concluded soon.

Russia has been preparing to restart the station but says that doing so will depend on the situation in the area. Rosatom chief Alexei Likhachev has not ruled out the supply of electricity produced there to parts of Ukraine.

Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said Moscow intended to use the plant to cover a significant energy deficit in ‌Russia's south.

In December, Russia's Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision issued a license for the operation of reactor No. 1, a key step towards restarting the reactor.

Ukraine's energy ministry called the move illegal and irresponsible, risking a nuclear accident.

Russia has been pummelling Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the war. In ‍recent months, Russia has sharply increased the scale and intensity of its attacks, plunging entire regions into darkness.

Analysts say Ukraine's generation capacity deficit is about 4 gigawatts, or the equivalent of four Zaporizhzhia reactors.

Kharchenko says it would take Ukraine five to seven years to build the generating capacity to compensate for the loss of the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Kharchenko said that if Kyiv regained control of the plant, it would take at least two to three years to understand what condition it was in and another three years to restore the equipment and return it to full operation.

Both Ukrainian state nuclear operator Energoatom and Kharchenko said Ukraine did not know the real condition of the nuclear power plant today.

In the long term, there is the unresolved problem of the lack of water resources to cool the reactors after the vast Kakhovka hydro-electric dam was blown up in 2023, destroying the reservoir that supplied water ‍to the plant.

Besides reactors, there are spent fuel pools at each reactor site used to cool down used nuclear fuel. Without water supply to the pools, the water evaporates and temperatures increase, risking fire.

An emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel ‌pool caused an explosion in Japan's Fukushima ​nuclear disaster in 2011.

Energoatom said the level of the Zaporizhzhia power plant cooling pond had dropped by more than 15%, or 3 metres, since the destruction of the dam, and continued to fall.

Ukrainian officials previously said the available water reserves may be sufficient to operate one or, at most, two nuclear reactors.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:22:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75da110e-9ec8-11f0-91d6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-09-30T193638Z-1410058750-RC2GJ1AWM0PS-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZAPORIZHZHIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria: Construction of new tunnels in Raqqa sparks fears of renewed conflict</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-syria-construction-new-tunnels-raqqa-sparks-fears-renewed-conflict</link><description>Raqqa , located on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in northeast Syria , has experienced every stage of the war in Syria. It was the first large city to join the uprising against former president Bashar al-Assad in 2013. Then, it was taken over by the Islamic State group in 2014, becoming its de facto capital. In October 2017, after a destructive campaign led by an international coalition, the town was taken back by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

However, many of its residents now say that they are worried. Images and videos taken since spring 2025 show heavy machinery being used to dig the entrances to tunnels in a number of residential areas. So far, there has been no official explanation given by local authorities, who are affiliated with the SDF.

This construction is taking place as the December 31 expiration date approaches quickly for the deal signed on March 10, 2025, between the SDF and the Syrian government. The agreement was meant to establish the progressive integration of the Kurds’ civil and military institutions into the central government.

Analysts say that there are two possible outcomes. Either the deal will be extended in the hopes that the SDF can be integrated into the national government, or the new Syrian government may launch an offensive to recapture the areas under SDF control.

Several people died when clashes between the SDF and the Syrian government forces broke out on December 22 in Aleppo .

Salamah (not his real name) lives in Raqqa and has been observing the recent activity with trepidation.

“After the agreement was signed last March between the SDF and the new Syrian government, I noticed that I was seeing more and more tunnel entrances in the city’s streets. Wherever I go, I see workers coming out of these openings.

The sound of digging is audible even when you are inside your house because these tunnels go under civilian residences.

Back in May, there was a collapse on al-Wadi street . Dozens of families have left the al-Firdous neighbourhood because of the construction of tunnels. This neighbourhood is strategic because it sits above the rest of the city.”

Salamah says that there are at least 30 visible tunnel entrances in the city. Workers involved in the excavation work come and go from some of the tunnel entrances, in particular those near Raqqa’s National Hospital.

A video published on April 6 shows excavation work being carried out near the entrance to the National Hospital. You can see three workers gathering around a winch positioned on a metal frame. At a certain point in the video, one of the workers seems to disappear into a hole.

The mounds of earth visible in the image look like what is removed when a tunnel is dug out. The metal frame is what is known in Syria as a “raf‘a”: you affix a motor onto it and then use it to lower down a wheelbarrow then lift it back up filled with dug-out earth.

Aside from the building site near the National Hospital, people also observed other sites near Al-Mawasi Hospital , near the city’s municipal stadium and in residential neighbourhoods , as shown in the photos posted online. Local people were able to verify the authenticity of the images for us.

A photo published on Facebook on June 11, 2025, shows a truck carrying concrete supports . The caption explains that the blocks will be used to provide reinforcements for Raqqa’s tunnels. Another post, this one from November 9, 2025, shows the SDF opening a centre for making concrete blocks in Al-Aqtan Place, in the north of the city. Residents say that the centre is in constant operation.

Our team reached out to the SDF officials to ask them about the existence, the nature and the goals of the tunnels dug in the city of Raqqa. They had not responded to our questions by the time of publication.

According to an analyst specialised in the region, these building sites are part of an old strategy often used in zones under the control of the SDF. Back in 2014, it was adopted by the YPG, the Syrian Kurdish militia, whose full name is the People’s Protection Units.

“The People's Protection Units (YPG) started to dig tunnels beginning in mid-2014 in the region of Hassaké when the region was being bombarded with Turkish strikes. Initially, the aim was to protect themselves from the Turkish planes. [After the SDF was created in 2015], digging operations intensified in all the regions under their control, including Manbij, Afrin and Hassaké.”

According to another analyst, based in Raqqa, the building work began to accelerate after March 2025, despite the deal reached with Damascus . He said the building sites are being run by entrepreneurs – most of them Kurdish – who responded to a call for applications. He describes the creation of a giant, regional subterranean network.

“The tunnels have been dug in order to prepare for urban fighting, to fortify positions and to build secret passages that allow for mobility during military clashes. The tunnels are divided into three categories: there are galleries meant for the displacement of personnel, corridors that are large enough to allow vehicles to pass and still other tunnels are meant to be used as shelters and command centres.

Because the tunnels are connected, the collapse of just one could lead to the collapse of dozens of buildings and lead to mass civilian casualties.”

Locals say there is a palpable disquiet. Salamah explained this to us.

“I have the sense that the SDF is preparing the city for some kind of resistance. Like many other residents, I fear a new war.”

Another city resident, whom we are calling Qassem, says that he is worried about the structural integrity of the buildings with tunnels under them:

“The situation is frightening. A few months ago, the SDF kicked out a family living near Raqqa’s municipal stadium because they wanted to create a tunnel starting in a room in their house.

It’s catastrophic. The tunnels are everywhere – under mosques, hospitals, public gardens. All of that seems to indicate preparation for a military confrontation with the army.”

Raqqa’s predominantly sandy soil sits close to the groundwater table. It’s also an area prone to seismic activity. All of this frightens residents. Collapses are common.

Photos posted on November 15 show a collapse in a residential neighbourhood near Al-Furusiyah, located to the north of the city. Locals blamed the collapse on tunnels under the ground.

Trump made the comments on Friday, December 26 in an interview with John Catsimatidis, a billionaire talk show host, on the WABC radio station in New York. They were discussing Washington's campaign to target vessels in the Caribbean and off the coast of Venezuela suspected of trafficking drugs to the U.S.

"They have a big plant or a big facility where the ships come from,” Trump said on the radio show. “Two nights ago we knocked that out.”

If Trump's statement is accurate, it would mark the first known U.S. land attack related to the administration’s campaign against Venezuela.

Trump did not say which facility the U.S. had targeted, nor did he make clear if this operation was conducted by a branch of the military or some other entity. Trump has previously said that he has authorized the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela.

The Central Intelligence Agency, the White House and the Pentagon have not publicly elaborated on Trump’s comments and declined to comment on questions posed by Reuters. It is unusual for the administration to decline to address questions related to on-the-record statements made by Trump, especially about Venezuela.

The Venezuelan government has not commented on the incident Trump described and there have been no independent reports from Venezuela of it.

The administration has previously touted its success in taking out suspected drug trafficking vessels. The Pentagon has even posted footage of several of its strikes on social media.

The lack of response by U.S. national security agencies raises questions about whether the incident Trump mentioned was carried out covertly. Such an operation would likely limit the ability of U.S. officials to speak on the matter.

Last month Reuters reported that the U.S. was poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations, as the Trump administration escalates pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government.

At the time, two U.S. officials said covert operations would likely be the first part of the new action against Maduro.

The U.S. mission has primarily focused on military strikes against suspected drug trafficking vessels and has prompted intense oversight from Congress. More than 100 people have been killed in more than 20 strikes in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.

Earlier this month, U.S. military leaders briefed lawmakers on an incident in September in which an American strike killed 11 people but left several survivors. They were killed in a second strike ordered by Admiral Frank Bradley.

Democrats on Capitol Hill have questioned whether the second strike was conducted in accordance with international law.

Trump's comments come amid a massive U.S. military build up in the Caribbean, including more than 15,000 troops.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T2RMY6MV3ROH7OP5JMZP4ZZ4QA.jpg?auth=ee561b5215605a15c7d96a1828588a661b2043fe06f2736028986c35209d10ab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy backs Ukraine military aid through 2026 after coalition clash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-backs-ukraine-military-aid-through-2026-after-coalition-clash-2025-12-29/</link><description>ROME, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Italy's cabinet on Monday approved a decree to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine through 2026, sealing a coalition compromise after weeks of debate that exposed divisions over foreign policy within Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government.

The accord followed threats by the far-right League, which had close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin before Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine , to abstain on the measure and thereby exacerbate rifts over Italy's stance on the war.

League leader Matteo Salvini, who serves as deputy prime minister, had argued that dispatching additional military aid to Ukraine could fuel corruption in Kyiv and would not help end the war. Critics accused him of promoting Putin's agenda.

The new decree is similar to bills approved in the past three years, stating that the government will transfer military vehicles, materials and equipment to Ukraine.

However, the League said that in a change from the 2025 text, the new decree stated that priority would be given to logistical and medical items for civilian use, and for equipment needed to defend against missile, drone and cyber attacks.

Meloni's office did not immediately release the text.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who heads the coalition Forza Italia party, welcomed the new bill, which has to be approved by parliament within two months.

"It's an absolutely balanced decree, like the previous ones. Italy will continue to support Ukraine militarily, economically, financially, and politically," he was quoted as saying by Corriere della Sera daily.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Italy has sent 12 packages of military aid to Kyiv, although it has never revealed exactly what it has dispatched, saying this is classified information.

Defence Chief of Staff General Luciano Portolano told Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper on Sunday that Italy had so far sent supplies worth more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

While Italy has been a consistent contributor of aid to Ukraine, it has lagged behind other major European economies, notably Germany, which has sent more than 15 billion euros in military supplies to Ukraine, with billions more promised.

Trump made the comments as he greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. They load the boats up with drugs.

The publication, in France 's government gazette, confirms an ambition Clooney alluded to early in December when he hailed French privacy laws that keep his family shielded from paparazzi.

"I love the French culture , your language, even if I'm still bad at it after 400 days of courses," the 64-year-old actor told RTL radio at the time – in English.

"Here, they don't take photos of kids. There aren't any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That's number one for us," he said.

The now-dual US-French citizen has a long attachment to Europe, which even pre-dates his 2014 marriage to Amal, a British-Lebanese human rights lawyer who speaks fluent French.

Clooney owns an estate in Italy's picturesque Lake Como region, purchased in 2002, and he and Amal bought a historic manor in England.

Their property in southern France – a former wine estate called the Domaine du Canadel, near the village of Brignoles – was purchased in 2021.

They also own a New York apartment and a property in Kentucky, but reportedly sold homes in Los Angeles and Mexico over the past decade.

The glamorous couple are parents to eight-year-old twins.

Clooney told RTL that although the family jet-sets around, their French home "is where we're happiest".

Clooney is also a director and producer, and has two Oscars to put on whichever mantlepiece suits: one for best supporting actor in 2006's "Syriana" and as a producer on 2012's "Argo".

On top of his cinema pay cheques, he has raked in millions for celebrity endorsements, including for Nespresso, and got a windfall pay-out for selling his stake in a tequila brand.

Clooney is not the only Hollywood luminary to want to go French: US director Jim Jarmusch on Friday told France Inter radio that he plans to apply for French nationality.

"I would like a place that will allow me to escape from the United States," he said, also saying he was attracted to French culture.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:18:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fdc226ea-e4d9-11f0-9783-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-78E38F3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge grants release of redacted transcript of Charlie Kirk case hearing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-grants-release-redacted-transcript-charlie-kirk-case-hearing-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - A Utah judge overseeing the trial of the accused killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Monday ordered the release of most of the transcript and audio of a closed-door hearing on safety and security measures for the proceedings, but said media outlets who had asked for the records did not need special status to cover the proceedings.

Judge Tony Graf made his two rulings on media requests during a video hearing that suspect Tyler Robinson attended by audio link. Robinson spoke only once, replying "yes, your honor," when asked by Graf whether he was present.

Robinson is accused of firing a single round from a rooftop that killed Kirk as he debated students on a stop on a U.S. university tour.

Robinson is charged with seven criminal counts, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice for disposing of evidence, and witness tampering for asking his roommate to delete incriminating texts. Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty .

Media outlets covering the case had asked for records of a closed hearing on Oct. 24 that dealt with what safety restraints and clothing Robinson was required to wear in court. The judge on Monday ordered the redaction of about one page worth of text of the 80-page transcript and the corresponding audio.

Graf has ruled Robinson may appear in court in regular clothes but must be physically restrained, and prohibited media from filming or photographing Robinson's handcuffs and shackles after his lawyers said such images could prejudice potential jurors.

Media outlets had asked for status that would have ensured they received notice of attempts to close hearings or otherwise limit access to the proceedings to give them time to challenge restrictions. Graf denied that request, citing a prior order that lawyers for both sides must notify the media before attempting to have future hearings held behind closed doors.

At a February hearing, Graf will consider a defense request to ban cameras from the courtroom.

Kirk's death sparked denunciations of political violence across the ideological spectrum.

The doctors carried out a "phrenic nerve block procedure" on Bolsonaro to block his left phrenic nerve, after he had undergone a similar surgery on Saturday to treat the right one.

In medical literature, the phrenic nerve is described as a vital nerve originating in the neck that controls the diaphragm, the primary muscle for breathing.

The surgery at the DF Star hospital in capital Brasilia lasted for about an hour and was concluded near 3 p.m. local time (1800 GMT), according to information provided by his wife, former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro, on social media.

A medical note on the surgery is expected to be released later.

Bolsonaro, 70, had been hospitalized on Wednesday for hernia surgery on Christmas Day. His doctors then decided to also carry out procedures to treat his hiccups during his hospital stay.

The ex-president has faced health problems since a stabbing he suffered in September 2018, during a presidential campaign event in the town of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais state.

Bolsonaro was convicted and sentenced to over 27 years in prison by Brazil's Supreme Court in September for plotting a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss. He started to serve his sentence last month.

He was authorized by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to leave prison for the hernia surgery.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:38:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E32YRRPSUVIL3P75QNK75HRTRU.jpg?auth=8452fd8c86974026cf729b05231e8823c21841e42cb1011c587fdb4b9b7ad530&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says of alleged Ukraine attack on Putin: 'I was very angry about it'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-alleged-ukraine-attack-putin-i-was-very-angry-about-it-2025-12-29/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said Russian President Vladimir Putin told him Ukraine tried to attack Putin's residence in northern Russia, which Kyiv has denied.

"I don't like it. It's not good," Trump told reporters when asked if he was worried the allegation could affect his efforts to broker peace. "I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

"It's a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive, because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that," he said.

When asked if there was any evidence of such an attack, Trump said: "We'll find out."

He described his call with Putin earlier on Monday as a "very good talk."

"We have a few very thorny issues," Trump said about talks to end the war in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:38:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5E7PFYTYA5OP5HANBXUIJ42DEI.jpg?auth=38f6541c9ce2621f762e6908e721dc118076245a383f1c8e567fb3b47be42eb1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Netanyahu pardon 'on its way'; Herzog's office disputes it</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-netanyahu-pardon-on-its-way-herzogs-office-disputes-it-2025-12-29/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli President Isaac Herzog had told him a pardon for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “on its way,” an assertion Herzog’s office was quick to challenge.

"He's a wartime prime minister who's a hero. How do you not give a pardon?" Trump told reporters while standing beside Netanyahu before a meeting in Florida. "I spoke to the president ... he tells me it's on its way."

Asked about the U.S. president's remarks, Herzog's office said the Israeli president had not had any conversations with Trump since a pardon request was submitted several weeks ago.

Herzog's office said Herzog had spoken to a representative for Trump then and it was explained that any decision would be made in accordance with established procedures.

Netanyahu, Israel's first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime, denies bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges dating back to his 2019 indictment.

His own request for a pardon, submitted on November 30, argued that frequent court hearings impair his ability to govern and that clemency serves the national interest.

The appeal was lodged following the start of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, as his government sought to bring an end to Hamas' rule under Trump's plan to end two years of war and expand diplomatic ties across the region.

The request by the six-time prime minister had drawn fierce criticism from opponents, who said that pardoning him mid-trial would be a total breach of the rule of law.

According to Israeli law, the president has authority to pardon convicts. But there is no precedent for issuing a pardon mid-trial.

Netanyahu's pardon quest has been boosted by Trump, a close ally who wrote a formal letter to Herzog in November urging him to grant clemency and describing the case as "political, unjustified prosecution."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 20:25:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6EHQLLIIAVPJZIA4AGNAVAZFBU.jpg?auth=c131b08858f1b901247fe8b349dc633030dae904734e745b75b1055f707a3974&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Winter Storm Ezra snarls US travel as meteorologists warn of 'bomb cyclone'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/winter-storm-ezra-snarls-us-travel-meteorologists-warn-bomb-cyclone-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Winter Storm Ezra disrupted holiday travel across the U.S. Northeast, Midwest and Great Lakes for a third straight day on Monday, causing thousands of flight delays and hundreds of cancellations as airlines scrambled to recover and meteorologists warned of a brewing "bomb cyclone" that could further snarl trips ahead of the New Year's holiday.

Nearly 6,000 flights were delayed and 751 canceled as of 3:25 p.m. ET, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Since Friday, weather disruptions have canceled over 3,600 flights and delayed more than 30,000 others.

The storm hit during one of the year's busiest travel periods, when airlines operate near capacity with limited flexibility to rebook passengers. Holiday travelers faced long waits, rebooking difficulties and accommodation challenges as airlines coped with severe winter weather.

AccuWeather meteorologists warned the powerful storm would intensify into a "bomb cyclone" through Monday night, bringing blizzard conditions, dangerous ice, flooding rain and strong winds from Wisconsin to Maine.

A bomb cyclone occurs when rapidly dropping atmospheric pressure produces hurricane-force winds and heavy precipitation. The arctic cold front driving the storm brought with it wild swings in temperatures. In Philadelphia, temperatures, which soared close to 60 degrees on Monday, were expected to drop into the 20s overnight.

Major travel disruptions, regional power outages and hazardous conditions were expected through early Tuesday.

The harsh weather also disrupted road travel, with poor visibility, icy surfaces and blowing snow contributing to several multi-vehicle pileups and prompting authorities in parts of the region to urge drivers to avoid non-essential travel.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency warned travelers that driving could be dangerous as blizzard-like conditions, high winds and ice descend across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes.

The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop at Washington's Dulles International Airport until 4:15 p.m. ET due to high winds. Delays at airports in Boston and Newark, New Jersey, which serves New York City, were imposed due to low visibility and windy conditions.

Detroit-bound flights faced additional disruption after the FAA ordered a ground stop at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport through 8 a.m. ET on Monday. The halt, affecting only Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) , opens new tab flights, was imposed for undisclosed operational reasons, and delays were expected to continue until midnight.

Delta had the highest share of cancellations and delays on Monday, and its shares fell nearly 3% in afternoon trading.

Shares of United Airlines (UAL.O) , opens new tab , American Airlines (AAL.O) , opens new tab and Alaska Air Group (ALK.N) , opens new tab were each down about 2%.

The FAA also said departures from Albany, Bangor, Burlington and Minneapolis-St. Paul were delayed as ground crews cleared snow and ice from planes.

Airline operations are tightly interlinked, meaning canceled flights can leave aircraft and crews out of position, complicating efforts to restore normal schedules.

American Airlines, United Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Delta told Reuters they had waived change fees for passengers affected by weather-related disruptions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:19:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HE7D4GGTAVJCZDVEECIBX63CZU.jpg?auth=ab0e2969a8dfb5f889fba7031d628a6ca13de2e3a1b0e6b37ba7222004f69d32&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea leader Kim says multiple rocket launch system key to artillery, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-leader-kim-says-multiple-rocket-launch-system-key-artillery-kcna-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 30 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected a munitions factory and said the multiple rocket launcher system being produced there will be the mainstay of modernized long-range artillery for fast precision strikes and strategic attacks, KCNA news agency reported on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:41:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lavrov: the West must recognise that Russia holds strategic initiative in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/lavrov-west-must-recognise-that-russia-holds-strategic-initiative-ukraine-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in an interview published late on Monday, said the West must understand that Russia holds the strategic initiative in Ukraine as discussions move forward on a possible settlement.

Lavrov told RIA news agency that the West had to come to terms with the territorial realities on the ground nearly four years after the launch of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which it describes as a "Special Military Operation".

He said the United States now supported the notion, which had become clear to all, that with the expiry of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's mandate, a new election was needed.

Lavrov also again stressed that a settlement required an end to any notion of a NATO presence in Ukraine and that the country had to adopt a neutral, non-aligned status.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:21:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BU6HN5ZAA5JUBMGAJ7NDMOEXPU.jpg?auth=d344103e5e8e372d83a88fd0215888cb16929a93b6562d8d9b6fd4a98676cb74&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he and Netanyahu don't fully agree on West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-netanyahu-dont-fully-agree-west-bank-2025-12-29/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not agree fully on the issue of the Israeli-occupied West Bank but the Republican leader did not lay out what the disagreement was.

In a briefing after a meeting with Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump was asked if he had a message for Netanyahu about the West Bank and if he was concerned that settler violence in the West Bank could undermine peace.

"We have had a discussion, big discussion for a long time on the West Bank. And I wouldn't say we agree on the West Bank 100%, but we'll come to a conclusion on the West Bank," Trump said.

"I don't want to do that, it will be announced at an appropriate time," Trump said when asked what the disagreement between them was. Netanyahu "will do the right thing," Trump added.

Israel has been under mounting international pressure to curb attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank. Home to 2.7 million Palestinians, the West Bank has long been at the heart of plans for a future Palestinian state alongside Israel.

The United Nations, Palestinians and most countries regard settlements as illegal under international law. Israel disputes this, citing biblical ties to the land and security concerns. Around half a million Israeli settlers live in the West Bank.

The United Nations' highest court said last year Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there were illegal and should be dismantled.

Over a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 2023 and October 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, the U.N. has said. In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:44:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J6LGPNNTLZIH5LLYSE46AGZ6GA.jpg?auth=512ced44653cc6822ab889b363e156e762ff9ff7c1027fc24771318d680327f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Peru shamans foretell illness for Trump, Maduro's exile in 2026</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-shamans-foretell-illness-trump-maduros-exile-2026-2025-12-29/</link><description>LIMA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Shamans in Peru gathered for an annual New Year's ritual on Monday where they made predictions for the year to come, including illness for U.S. President Donald Trump and the downfall of Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro.

"The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill," Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, wearing colorful ponchos and sprinkling flowers on the sand.

The shamans carried large posters of world leaders, over which they crossed swords, burned incense and some of which they stomped on.

As well as Trump and Maduro, shamans waved posters of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

"We see Nicolas Maduro defeated," said Garcia. "Nicolas Maduro will flee Venezuela. He will not be captured."

Closer to home, Garcia predicted that Keiko Fujimori , the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, will emerge victorious in Peru's presidential election after three failed bids.

"The woman who dreams of ruling Peru, I have been able to see through the wachuma (ancestral plant) that Keiko Fujimori will be president in 2026," he said.

The shamans also foretold the end of Russia's war in Ukraine . "I see that the conflict will end, they will raise the flag of peace," Garcia predicted.

The ceremony is performed every year in late December. The shamans had previously predicted an end to the Ukraine war - in 2023.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/72QYNORCWBJZBJKTSVYIA62SZE.jpg?auth=aec74af66887c09c82050e1c0bd5b660175ef8322f50d44af52721ce9ce40a46&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel defends Somaliland move at UN amid concerns over Gaza motives</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-defends-somaliland-move-un-amid-concerns-over-gaza-motives-2025-12-29/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Israel defended on Monday its formal recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, but several countries at the United Nations questioned whether the move aimed to relocate Palestinians from Gaza or to establish military bases.

Israel became the first country to recognize Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday.

The 22-member Arab League, a regional organization of Arab states in the Middle East and parts of Africa, rejects "any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases," Arab League U.N. Ambassador Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz told the U.N. Security Council.

"Against the backdrop of Israel's previous references to Somaliland of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza, its unlawful recognition of Somaliland region of Somalia is deeply troubling," Pakistan's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon told the council.

Israel's U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks or address any of them in its statement at the council meeting. In March, the foreign ministers of Somalia and Somaliland said they had not received any proposal to resettle Palestinians from Gaza.

U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza states: "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return."

Israel's coalition government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in its history, includes far-right politicians who advocate the annexation of both Gaza and the West Bank and encouraging Palestinians to leave their homeland.

Somalia’s U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said council members Algeria, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Somalia "unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to the northwestern region of Somalia."

Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy - and relative peace and stability - since 1991 when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.

"It is not a hostile step toward Somalia, nor does it preclude future dialogue between the parties. Recognition is not an act of defiance. It is an opportunity,” Israel’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Miller told the council.

In September, several Western states, including France, Britain, Canada and Australia announced they would recognize a Palestinian state, joining more than three-quarters of the 193 U.N. members who already do so.

Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Tammy Bruce said: "This council’s persistent double standards and misdirection of focus distract from its mission of maintaining international peace and security."

Slovenia's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Zbogar disputed her argument, saying: "Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory ... Palestine is also an observer state in this organization."

He added: "Somaliland, on the other hand, is a part of a U.N. member state and recognizing it goes against ... the U.N. Charter."

Israel said last week that it would seek immediate cooperation with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. The former British protectorate hopes Israeli recognition will encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing its diplomatic heft and access to global markets.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 23:41:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXXSK76A4VPXDLWZF3RPF5QBCQ.jpg?auth=b98e2b50a883851882f8af976a00c317a9efd53194cb0af6f45987f407c7e58c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says two men killed in strike on suspected drug vessel in Pacific</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-says-two-men-killed-strike-suspected-drug-vessel-pacific-2025-12-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it killed two men in a strike on a boat suspected of carrying drugs in international waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Monday.

"This contract provides for the design, integration, instrumentation, test, production, and delivery of 25 new F-15IA aircraft for the Israeli Air Force with an option for an additional 25 F-15IA aircraft," the Pentagon said.

The Pentagon said the contract involved foreign military sales to Israel. The U.S. has long been by far the largest arms supplier to its closest Middle East ally.

Pro-Palestinian and anti-war protesters around the U.S. had demanded an end to Washington's military support for Israel due to its devastating assault on Gaza but those demands have not been met in the administrations of President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden .

Contract work will be performed in St. Louis, and was expected to be complete by Dec. 31, 2035, the Pentagon said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 23:42:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6NFGAGOGNBPBLFCWB7R67HHIWM.jpg?auth=fde69e2929e327957ef43a7057ee56c03ffc0de49e0de6503965db79e38797df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-80-2025-12-30/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party said on Tuesday.

The Eastern Theatre Command said the drills would take place until 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) in the sea and airspace of five locations surrounding the island, demonstrating the Chinese military's resolve to "combat separatism and promote unification without hesitation."

China's Maritime Safety Administration on Monday designated two further zones within which live-firing would take place, making the "Justice Mission 2025" drills the largest to date by total coverage and in areas closer to Taiwan than previous exercises.

The war games began 11 days after the U.S. announced a record $11.1 billion arms package to Taiwan, drawing the Chinese defence ministry's ire and warnings that the military would "take forceful measures" in response.

The exercises - China's sixth major round of war games since 2022, when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically governed island - are intended to rehearse a rapid encirclement of the island to destroy its weapons stockpile and obstruct efforts to resupply Taiwan from Japan or nearby U.S. bases, analysts say.

"This constitutes a blatant provocation of the international situation," said a senior Taiwan security official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. "As one of the world's most critical shipping lanes, they seek to reshape the international order according to their own agenda."

The official said Taipei is closely monitoring whether China would seek "further provocation" in the drills on Tuesday, including flying missiles over Taiwan, similar to the Chinese drills in 2022.

"China is trying to make progress in asserting dominance over the entire island chain through extreme pressure tactics in various ways," the official said.

The Chinese military said it had deployed destroyers, bombers and other units to drill sea-based assaults, air defence and anti-submarine operations on Tuesday, to "test sea and air forces' ability to coordinate for integrated containment and control."

Taiwan rejects China's claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island's future.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:44:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EJAH5A42ZVN35GDPA6TTVRMAZM.jpg?auth=5b127bd16b75cce009ebd974404fd085526e5f10ced4433b19733844d5b4db25&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainians withstand days-long power cuts in crowded 'resilience' shelters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainians-withstand-days-long-power-cuts-crowded-resilence-shelters-2025-12-30/</link><description>VYSHHOROD, Ukraine, Dec 30 (Reuters) - For three days, after the latest Russian air attacks on Ukraine, Olena Pazhydaieva has had no power or heat in her apartment in Vyshhorod, a satellite town 20 km (12 miles) north of Kyiv.

With night-time temperatures dipping to -3 C (27 Fahrenheit), she now spends much of the day with her six-year-old son in a shelter the size of a small shack, but with heating and power to connect the devices she needs to work.

About 20 people crowd into the building - dubbed "islet of warmth and power" on the sign outside - with mobile phones and laptops charging in order to keep working and connected.

"After the last attack, we haven't had electricity for the third day, power hasn't appeared at all, and now we're forced to work here in a shelter, where we can charge our stations, charge our laptops," Pazhydaieva said.

"It's good that there's internet. We can work. I’m not the only person here, there are many people."

Russian drone and missile attacks have long targeted energy facilities throughout Ukraine, triggering blackouts.

The latest massive attack knocked out power to 19,000 customers in Kyiv region surrounding the capital, according to Ukraine's Energy Ministry.

The shack is one of a large network of "resilience points" set up by authorities to keep people warm and able to function.

But family life without power can be complicated.

"We go to an after-school group and they usually take the kids in on holidays, too," Pazhydaieva said. "But when we went there today, we went inside, it was super cold and all the kids were wearing jackets...At least it's warm here."

Each family finds new ways to cope.

For Pazhydaieva, that means spending time at the "islet" to recharge devices and then trying to connect the water heater at home to a portable power station to keep everyone warm.

She has little faith in the U.S.-backed talks on resolving the conflict, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump's remark at a meeting on Sunday in Florida that Russian President Vladimir Putin "wants Ukraine to succeed".

"When Trump says that Putin wants prosperity for Ukraine as missiles are flying at us, somehow these two statements don't really match up," she said.

"Right now we're just observing and not much depends on us. We're doing the best we can here where we are now."

"If it were up to me, I would stay for 10 more years," Bukele said in a video interview published by Spanish YouTuber TheGrefg on Monday. He noted that he had initially agreed with his wife that he would leave politics in 2029.

El Salvador is expected to hold its next presidential election in 2027, to decide who will run the country through to 2033.

Bukele will be eligible to run for a third term, after the ruling party-controlled Congress pushed through a constitutional reform in July to abolish term limits, bring forward the next election and extend presidential terms from five to six years.

Legal experts at home and abroad have questioned the legality of Bukele's attempts to extend his term. The country's constitution prohibits presidents' consecutive reelection in at least six of its articles.

Early in 2024, Bukele won his second term with a landslide victory despite a constitutional ban.

The wildly popular 44-year-old publicist enjoys some of the world's highest approval ratings thanks to a hardline approach to crime which has helped drastically reduce murder rates.

Critics say this has come at the expense of civil rights and people have been arbitrarily detained, tortured and even killed in custody.

Bukele, who once described himself on his Twitter account as "the world's coolest dictator," said he did not plan to establish a dictatorship in El Salvador and it would be up to Salvadorans to decide whether he should continue in power.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:44:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPN432ZXFVMHJODMOTYD7TBFY4.jpg?auth=0fc740cd9c27241c3ae578df52e71800f18b21caeef78e3c5d6d1bde5bd63564&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: What is 'Taiwan independence' and is Taiwan already independent?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-taiwan-independence-is-taiwan-already-independent-2025-12-30/</link><description>TAIPEI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it would "never hesitate to combat separatism" as it held a second day of war games around Taiwan, describing the drills it calls "Justice Mission 2025" as a warning against independence and foreign interference.

Below are some questions and answers about what is meant by the term "Taiwan independence".

Previously known as Formosa, the island has been home to indigenous people for thousands of years, before the Dutch and Spanish briefly ruled parts of it in the 1600s.

The Qing dynasty incorporated Taiwan as part of Fujian province in 1684 and only declared it a separate Chinese province in 1885.

Following the Qing's defeat in a war with Japan, it became a Japanese colony in 1895. In 1945, it was handed over to the Republic of China government at the end of World War Two.

In 1949 after being defeated by Mao Zedong's communist forces, the Republic of China government fled and moved its capital to Taiwan, and Republic of China remains the island's formal name.

Mao set up the People's Republic of China, and claimed it was the only legitimate Chinese government for the whole of China, including Taiwan, as the Republic of China's successor state.

For decades, the Republic of China in Taipei also claimed to be the legitimate Chinese government, but in 1971 Beijing took over the China seat at the United Nations from Taipei.

Currently only 12 countries maintain formal ties with Taipei, mostly small and poorer developing nations such as Belize and Tuvalu.

Most major Western countries and U.S. allies maintain close unofficial ties with Taiwan by recognising the Republic of China passport and having de facto embassies in each other's capitals. Taiwanese citizens can freely travel to most countries using their Taiwanese passports.

The U.S. severed official ties with Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The U.S. officially takes no position on Taiwan's sovereignty under Washington's "One China" policy.

China says it will not renounce the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Beijing has offered Taiwan a "one country, two systems" model similar to Hong Kong, which promised the city a high degree of autonomy, though no major political party in Taiwan supports that.

Opinion polls in Taiwan have repeatedly shown most Taiwanese wish to maintain the current status quo in relations with China.

China also says that United Nations resolution 2758, passed in 1971, means the world legally recognises Taiwan belongs to China. The resolution states that the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and resulted in Taipei losing China's U.N. seat to Beijing,

The government in Taipei says that is nonsense given the resolution made no mention of Taiwan or its status.

Taiwan, whose people elect their own leaders and whose government controls a defined area of territory with its own military, passport and currency, enjoys de facto independence even if that is not formally recognised by most countries.

Taiwan's government says the Republic of China is a sovereign state and that Beijing has no right to speak for or represent it given the People's Republic of China has no say in how it chooses its leaders and has never ruled Taiwan.

It would be very difficult and require parliamentary approval of a constitutional amendment and then a referendum, rather than a simple declaration by President Lai Ching-te.

At least 75% of lawmakers would need to pass that amendment, and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT) currently have an equal number of seats.

The DPP, which has been in power since 2016, has not made an attempt to change the constitution. The KMT strongly opposes any attempts to change the name of Republic of China.

China detests Lai and calls him a "separatist". Before Lai was elected president he made comments about being a "practical worker for Taiwan independence". Lai maintains he simply meant Taiwan is already an independent country.

Since taking office in 2024, Lai has said on several occasions that the Republic of China and People's Republic of China are "not subordinate to each other", which Beijing says means he believes the two are separate countries and so he is therefore pushing an independence narrative.

In 2005, China's largely rubber-stamp parliament passed the Anti-Secession Law that gives the country the legal basis for military action against Taiwan if it secedes or if the "possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted", but the law is vague and does not give details.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7NRXODZ2ZKO5IELAYZ7U6B4UU.jpg?auth=8696306dbe01c73d3bfb33e06a18d2f019c38a5b4fb941de61f27f4b3b802c80&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US destroyed dock used by Venezuelan drug traffickers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251230-trump-says-us-destroyed-dock-used-by-venezuela-drug-traffickers</link><description>The United States has hit and destroyed a docking area for alleged Venezuela drug boats, President Donald Trump said Monday, in what could amount to the first land strike of the military campaign against trafficking from Latin America.

The US leader's confirmation of the incident comes as he ramps up a pressure campaign against Venezuela's leftist President Nicolas Maduro , who has accused Trump of seeking regime change.

"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs," he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

"So we hit all the boats and now we hit the area, it's the implementation area, that's where they implement. And that is no longer around."

The US leader would not say if it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, saying only that it was "along the shore."

Asked if he had spoken to Maduro recently, following an earlier phone call in November, Trump said they had talked "pretty recently" but said that "nothing much comes out of it."

Trump had been asked to elaborate on apparent throwaway comments he made in a radio interview broadcast Friday that seemed to mention a land strike for the first time.

"They have a big plant or a big facility where they send, you know, where the ships come from," Trump told billionaire supporter John Catsimatidis on the WABC radio station in New York.

"Two nights ago we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard."

Trump did not say in the interview where the facility was located or give any other details.

There has been no official comment from the Venezuelan government.

The Pentagon earlier referred questions to the White House. The White House did not respond to requests for comment from AFP.

Trump has been threatening for weeks that ground strikes on drug cartels in the region would start "soon," but this is the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes in both the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug-smuggling boats.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings, a charge that Washington denies.

After Trump spoke Monday, the US military announced on X that it had carried out another deadly strike on a boat in the Eastern Pacific, killing two and bringing the total killed in the maritime campaign to at least 107.

It did not specify where exactly the strike took place.

The Trump administration has been ramping up pressure on Maduro, accusing the Venezuelan leader of running a drug cartel himself and imposing an oil tanker blockade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:45:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/58a4b490-e518-11f0-8bab-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362800912978.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bondi gunmen acted alone, no evidence they were part of militant cell, Australian police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bondi-gunmen-acted-alone-no-evidence-they-were-part-militant-cell-australian-2025-12-30/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Two gunmen who allegedly opened fire on a Jewish celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach earlier this month acted alone and there was "no evidence" they were part of a militant cell, police said on Tuesday.

Naveed Akram and his father Sajid Akram are alleged to have killed 15 people at a Hanukkah event on December 14, Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades that shocked the nation and led to immediate reforms of already strict gun laws.

Police have previously said the men were inspired by Islamic State, with home made flags of the militant group found in their car after the attack, and a month-long trip by the pair to a Philippines island previously plagued by militancy a major focus of investigation.

But on Tuesday, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said there was no indication the men had received formal training on the November trip to Mindanao in the Philippines.

"There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out an attack," Barrett told a news conference.

She added the findings were an initial assessment, and authorities in Australia and the Philippines were continuing their investigation.

"I am not suggesting that they were there for tourism," she said, referring to the Philippines trip.

Sajid Akram was shot dead by police during the attack, while his son Naveed, who was also shot by police, was charged with 59 offences after waking from a days-long coma earlier this month. Naveed Akram faces charges ranging from 15 counts of murder to terror and explosives offences.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EATWMSVCXBJ7JCLVEZC3CHYNHM.jpg?auth=a5bf430308c2f8106c9b3157ba572471636cfb071b39d8c663b76727cd2247d4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's first female prime minister, dies at 80</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/obituary-khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-dies-80-2025-12-30/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Khaleda Zia, who became Bangladesh's first female prime minister in 1991 and went on to develop a bitter rivalry with Sheikh Hasina as they spent decades trading power, died on Tuesday after a long illness. She was 80.

Her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said that she died after a prolonged illness. She had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, and chest and heart problems, her doctors said.

She went to London for medical treatment in early 2025, staying for four months before returning home.

Though Khaleda had been out of power since 2006 and had spent several years in jail or under house arrest, she and her centre-right BNP continued to command much support.

The BNP is seen as the frontrunner to win the parliamentary election slated to take place in February. Her son and acting chairman of the party, Tarique Rahman, 60, returned to the country last week from nearly 17 years in self-exile and is widely seen as a strong candidate to become prime minister.

Since August 2024, after a student-led uprising led to the ouster of Hasina, Bangladesh has been run by an interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel peace laureate and microfinance pioneer.

In November, Hasina was sentenced to death in absentia for her deadly crackdown on the student protests.

Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.

Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of "liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness".

She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh's founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.

But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed "the battling Begums" - a phrase that uses an Urdu honorific for prominent women.

Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.

Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.

In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the country's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami.

In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh's first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, elected to lead Pakistan three years earlier.

Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.

She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.

Her second term was marred by the rise of Islamist militants and allegations of corruption.

In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. Khaleda's government and its Islamic allies were widely blamed.

In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh's highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.

Although Khaleda later clamped down on Islamist radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.

The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.

Khaleda never regained power. With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.

Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.

In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister - charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.

She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.

Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina's ouster.

In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh's Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:28:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LTFVWONNVROGJPEP2PMVMMUXOY.jpg?auth=3fbc932da9cb22772b802d36bb4ad7ab1ecdacca442d5bb4fd3d6016cfd19635&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN ambassadors condemn Israel's recognition of Somaliland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251230-un-security-council-members-condemn-israel-recognition-of-somaliland-somalia-international-law</link><description>Israel defended on Monday its formal recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland , but several countries at the United Nations questioned whether the move aimed to relocate Palestinians from Gaza or to establish military bases.

Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday.

The 22-member Arab League, a regional organisation of Arab states in the Middle East and parts of Africa, rejects "any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases," Arab League UN Ambassador Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz told the UN Security Council.

"Against the backdrop of Israel's previous references to Somaliland of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza , its unlawful recognition of Somaliland region of Somalia is deeply troubling," Pakistan's Deputy UN Ambassador Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon told the council.

Israel's UN mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks or address any of them in its statement at the council meeting. In March, the foreign ministers of Somalia and Somaliland said they had not received any proposal to resettle Palestinians from Gaza.

US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza states: "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return."

Israel's coalition government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in its history, includes far-right politicians who advocate the annexation of both Gaza and the West Bank and encouraging Palestinians to leave their homeland.

Somalia’s UN Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said council members Algeria, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Somalia "unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to the northwestern region of Somalia."

Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy - and relative peace and stability - since 1991 when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.

"It is not a hostile step toward Somalia, nor does it preclude future dialogue between the parties. Recognition is not an act of defiance. It is an opportunity,” Israel’s Deputy UN Ambassador Jonathan Miller told the council.

In September, several Western states, including France, Britain, Canada and Australia announced they would recognise a Palestinian state, joining more than three-quarters of the 193 UN members who already do so.

Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Tammy Bruce said: "This council’s persistent double standards and misdirection of focus distract from its mission of maintaining international peace and security."

Slovenia's UN Ambassador Samuel Zbogar disputed her argument, saying: "Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory ... Palestine is also an observer state in this organisation."

He added: "Somaliland, on the other hand, is a part of a UN member state and recognising it goes against ... the UN Charter."

Israel said last week that it would seek immediate cooperation with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. The former British protectorate hopes Israeli recognition will encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing its diplomatic heft and access to global markets.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:29:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/06921c66-e521-11f0-b452-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Somali-Ambassador.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi-led coalition launches air strike at Yemen's Mukalla port</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-led-coalition-yemen-calls-civilians-mukalla-port-evacuate-saudi-state-news-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen launched a limited air strike targeting what it called foreign military support at Mukalla port, days after it warned the main southern separatist group against making military moves in the eastern province of Hadramout.

An offensive by Yemen's southern separatists earlier this month pitted the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) against Saudi-supported Yemeni government troops, bringing the two nations closer than they have ever been to an all-out conflict. Yemen has been mired in a civil war since 2014.

A coalition spokesperson said two ships arriving from the UAE port of Fujairah entered Mukalla port on Saturday and Sunday without authorisation from the coalition, disabled their tracking systems and unloaded large quantities of weapons and combat vehicles "to support the (STC)."

The coalition said there were no casualties or collateral damage from the strike at Mukalla port, Saudi state media reported.

The UAE's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Acting on a request from the head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, to protect civilians in Hadramout and al-Mahra, coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation early on Tuesday targeting the unloaded weapons and vehicles, Saudi state media said citing Turki al-Malki, the coalition spokesperson.

Two sources told Reuters that the strike targeted the dock where the cargo of the two ships was unloaded.

The STC separatists were initially part of the Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis. But they subsequently decided to seek self-rule in the south.

Since 2022, they have been part of an alliance that controls southern areas outside Houthi control under a Saudi-backed power-sharing initiative.

At present, UAE-backed forces control large swathes of land in the south including the strategically important Hadramout province.

Hadramout is on the border with Saudi Arabia and they have cultural and historical ties; many prominent Saudis trace their origins to the area.

The Houthis control the northern part of the country, including the capital Sanaa, after forcing the Saudi-backed government to flee south.

"We will continue to prevent any military support from any country to any Yemeni faction without coordination with the legitimate government," the coalition added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 04:24:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia's jailed ex-PM Najib files appeal against 1MDB conviction</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-najib-files-appeal-against-1mdb-conviction-2025-12-30/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has filed an appeal against his conviction last week on corruption charges related to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, which saw him sentenced to an additional 15 years in prison, his lawyer said on Tuesday.

Najib, 72, has been in jail since 2022 on graft offences linked to allegations that about $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) , a state fund he co-founded while serving as premier in 2009.

U.S. and Malaysian investigators have said more than $1 billion of the misappropriated funds made their way into accounts linked to Najib, who has consistently denied wrongdoing.

On December 26, Najib was found guilty of four charges of abuse of power and 21 counts of money laundering for illegally receiving about 2.3 billion ringgit ($567.90 million) originating from 1MDB, in the biggest trial he has faced.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and slapped with a record fine of nearly $3 billion. The court ordered Najib to begin serving the additional sentence after his current six-year jail term ends in 2028, though the term may be reduced by one-third for good behaviour.

Najib's lawyer Muhammad Farhan Shafee confirmed in a brief text message that an appeal had been filed on Monday night against both the verdict and the sentence.

Najib has also filed an appeal against a separate court ruling this month denying his bid to serve the remainder of his current prison term under house arrest, media reports said.

Both court decisions have stoked tensions within Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's ruling alliance, with some members of Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), expressing disappointment with the verdicts.

UMNO campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll resulted in a hung parliament. Anwar last week urged calm, calling on parties to accept the court's decisions with "full patience and wisdom".

As Zelensky faced a verbal lashing from his hosts for not “thanking” Trump enough, heads of state, multinational corporations and international institutions across the world took note – and many responded by adopting baroque levels of “flattery diplomacy” to deal with the US president.

Pomp, splendour and courtesy have long greased diplomatic wheels. But with Trump this year, it was taken to personal – often incredible – levels that critics say crossed the line into servility and vassalage.

Here are some of 2025's top moments of Trump praise:

The prize never existed before, but after Trump waged a war of words against the Democrat-led US cities chosen to host next year’s World Cup , FIFA President Gianni Infantino decided to act. And how.

Infantino, a Trump ally, tapped into the US president’s disappointment over being skipped for the Nobel Peace Prize and cooked up a new, made-to-order award. On a plinth emblazoned with an all-cap “Donald J. Trump”, a metal globe perched atop five gnarled hands: the FIFA Peace Prize.

“This is your prize – this is your prize, your peace prize,” Infantino gushed as Trump beamed on the John F. Kennedy Center stage.

It didn’t end there. “There is also a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go,” Infantino continued as Trump plucked the shiny object up and promptly put it on, like a modern-day Napoleon crowning himself.

In a year that saw world leaders tripping over themselves to sign deals with the US, Qatar went the furthest, gifting Trump a luxury Boeing valued at $400 million to update Air Force One; his presidential aircraft.

The offer was first reported by US media on the eve of Trump’s Middle East visit in May to Saudi Arabia , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The gift, the most expensive – and controversial – ever received by a US president in the country’s nearly 250-year history, kicked up a storm, with Democrats warning about ethical implications and legality and security concerns.

Trump however scoffed away the dismay, noting that Qatar's offer was a nice gesture that would be "stupid" to turn down.

With the Trump administration threatening to disengage from NATO , it was essential to keep the US president on board at the bloc’s 2025 summit in The Hague.

But NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte went overboard.

In a private message to Trump before the summit, Rutte noted, “You are flying into another big success in The Hague ... Europe is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it will be your win.”

Trump promptly posted Rutte’s message on his Truth Social platform, sparking cringes in many quarters.

But there was more. At a June 25 joint press conference during the NATO summit, Trump was asked about the Israel-Iran war , which was then raging.

The US president responded by likening the two countries to "kids in a schoolyard".

Rutte, in obsequious overdrive, couldn’t leave it at that. "Daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop," said the head of the world’s most powerful military alliance.

As the “Daddy” quote grabbed headlines, Trump was asked if he views NATO allies as children. "No, [Rutte] likes me,” the US president replied. “I think he likes me. If he doesn't, I'll let you know. I'll come back and I'll hit him hard, OK? He did it very affectionately, 'Daddy, you're my Daddy.'"

Trump’s obsession with winning a Nobel Peace Prize saw a number of world leaders trip over themselves to nominate the US president for the prize his predecessor, former president Barack Obama , won back in 2009.

None did it with as much flourish as Israeli Prime Benjamin Netanyahu . Before a dinner at the White House Blue Room in July, Netanyahu kicked off the proceedings with a monologue as the cameras rolled.

“I want to express the appreciation and admiration not only of all Israelis, but of the Jewish people,” began Netanyahu. As US and Israeli teams beamed, the Israeli prime minister held up a letter. “I want to present to you, Mr. President, the letter I sent to the Nobel prize committee,” said Netanyahu.

“Oh,” said Trump as he took the letter from Netanyahu.

“It’s nominating you for the Nobel Peace Prize, which is well-deserved,” explained Netanyahu. “I think you should get it.”

The Nobel committee didn’t think so. The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado .

Handing letters to the king became a thing this year. In February, “King Donald” – as some critics have dubbed Trump – received one from the real McCoy. In a desperate bid to maintain the US-UK “special relationship”, Britain’s Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer ceremoniously handed Trump a state visit invitation from his sovereign, King Charles III .

At an Oval Office meeting, the cameras rolled with the praises. Reaching into his jacket breast pocket, Starmer extricated an envelope proclaiming, “It is my pleasure to bring from his majesty, the king, a letter.”

“Thank you very much,” said Trump as he took the letter. And held it. As the agonising seconds stretched, the court held its breath. The future of Ukraine , Europe, the transatlantic alliance, world order hung in the balance.

“Am I supposed to read it now?” asked Trump, uncharacteristically deferential when handed an authentic royal object.

“Yes, please do,” Starmer replied.

The seconds stretched again as Trump silently read the letter. It was left to Starmer to explain that it was a “really special” invitation to an “unprecedented” second state visit.

Having admired the British monarch’s “beautiful” signature, Trump accepted the invitation, sparking months of excruciating “Royal Household prepares for state visit” coverage. A nine-minute royal family video even featured the elaborate prep work by livery officers, chefs, gardeners, military musicians and other staff.

They did their jobs. The visit in September took place without a royal hitch.

It was left to the British newspapers to examine if it was all worth the glitz. In its editorial, The Guardian concluded that, “there was an inverse relationship between the pomp and ceremony of this trip and its real import”.

The editorial however acknowledged that, “in the world of President Trump, a diplomatic interaction that avoids the outright disaster of a public dressing down, or doubling of tariffs , is now regarded as a triumph by US allies”.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:35:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0c94f066-da8b-11f0-87e2-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-EN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump 'very angry' about alleged Ukrainian attack on Putin's home</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251230-live-trump-very-angry-about-alleged-ukrainian-attack-on-putin-s-home</link><description>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence in the Novgorod region west of Moscow on December 28-29 with 91 long-range drones which were all destroyed by Russian air defences.

"Such reckless actions will not go unanswered," Lavrov said in a statement, describing the attack as "state terrorism" and adding that targets had already been selected for retaliatory strikes by Russia's armed forces.

US President Donald Trump said Putin had told him about the alleged attack targetting one of his residences in a phone call on Monday morning, which had angered him.

"It's one thing to be offensive," Trump told reporters. "It's another thing ​to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

On Sunday, Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Florida ‍and the U.S. president said they were "getting a lot closer, maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:35:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/df54e002-e543-11f0-9f9d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362811343246.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey detains 110 suspects in operation targeting Islamic State after deadly clash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-detains-110-suspects-operation-targeting-islamic-state-after-deadly-clash-2025-12-30/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Turkish police detained 110 suspects in an operation against Islamic State on Tuesday, a day after three police officers and six militants were killed in a gunfight in northwest Turkey, the Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said.

Police conducted an eight-hour siege at a house in the town of Yalova, on the Sea of Marmara coast south of Istanbul, a week after more than 100 suspected IS members were detained in connection with alleged plans to carry out Christmas and New Year attacks.

Eight police officers and another security force member were wounded in the raid on the property, which was one of more than 100 addresses targeted by authorities on Monday.

In Tuesday's operation, police carried out raids on 114 addresses in Istanbul and two other provinces, arresting 110 of the total 115 suspects that they sought, the prosecutor's statement said. It said various digital materials and documents were seized.

Turkey has stepped up operations against suspected IS militants this year, as the group returns to prominence globally.

The U.S. carried out a strike against the militants in northwest Nigeria last week, while two gunmen who attacked a Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach this month appeared to be inspired by IS , Australian police have said. On December 19, the U.S. military launched strikes against dozens of IS targets in Syria in retaliation for an attack on American personnel.

Almost a decade ago, the jihadist group was blamed for a series of attacks on civilian targets in Turkey, including gun attacks on an Istanbul nightclub and the city's main airport, killing dozens of people. Turkey was a key transit point for foreign fighters, including those of IS, entering and leaving Syria during the war there.

Police have carried out regular operations against the group in subsequent years and there have been few attacks since the wave of violence between 2015-2017.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 07:25:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7ZWI7FCWMNOE5BHQ376UM3YURI.jpg?auth=d0478b0a65f25f74709106c87ebbfb78bb672236d285c49d33d0a98ac8419edd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: Facing Alawite backlash, Syria’s new leaders take controversial steps to win loyalty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/facing-alawite-backlash-syrias-new-leaders-take-controversial-steps-win-loyalty-2025-12-30/</link><description>QARDAHA, Syria, Dec 30 (Reuters) - He carried no weapons and helped keep government security forces alive, but Khairallah Dib still needed a promise of amnesty to come out of hiding.

He had been lying low for weeks after Alawite fighters staged a March insurrection against Syria’s new Islamist-led rulers. The uprising by loyalists of ousted President Bashar al-Assad killed more than 200 Syrian security forces and triggered days of vengeance .

The killings by government-affiliated forces left nearly 1,500 Alawites dead and led tens of thousands to flee out of fear for their lives. It broke the fragile relationship between Alawites, the sect from which Assad hailed, and the new government.

Syria’s new rulers have since tried to undo the damage by providing amnesty to people like Dib and others swept into the March violence, and offering limited economic aid to the wider community.

Reuters accompanied 
 people working with 
 the 
 government 
 committee 
 created 
 to oversee that process in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous, speaking to dozens of Alawite
 s who have received 
 its support and 15 Alawite former security officials now working with 
 Syria’s government. 
 The body is formally known as the Supreme Committee for the Preservation of Civil Peace.

Both the committee and its beneficiaries 
 described a fledgling and controversial attempt to win the loyalty of Syria’s Alawites,
 
 many of whom also suffered 
 poverty
 under Assad despite
 privileged access to state jobs given 
 their shared sect. Securing their allegiance could help the 
 new 
 government exert control over the region and 
 show progress on
 President Ahmed al-Sharaa
 ’s promise
 to govern for all Syrians.

Run by ex-militant leaders on opposing sides during Syria’s brutal 14-year war, the initiative offers financial help, jobs and medical services to hundreds of Alawites, including dozens of men who received amnesties in exchange for promising not to fight again or to help demobilize other fighters.

In response to questions for this story, civil peace committee member Hassan Soufan told Reuters the government was calibrating its efforts for Alawites with the vast needs of the wider Syrian population, including Sunnis harmed by Assad’s government.

“There is a balance we must strike” 
 to ensure everyone feels treated fairly
 , he said in an interview.

Soufan acknowledged some public anger that new authorities were cooperating with members of the fallen dictator’s security establishment. But he said Syria’s leadership took a longer view.

“The Syrian people should go forward. That doesn’t mean accepting the big crimes that took place. Those who committed serious crimes should be held accountable. But the vast majority of Syrians are innocent,” he said.

Dib has been one beneficiary of that forgiving approach.

He denied taking part in any violence during the March insurrection. He said h
 is only role was communication and that he additionally helped keep scores of security forces taken hostage by insurgents in Qardaha alive 
 and mediated their return.
 His account was confirmed by a government official familiar with his settlement.

“I decided to do something for the future,” Dib said from the cafe he set up in Assad’s hometown of Qardaha with money from the initiative.

A Reuters visit arranged by the committee found the cafe 
 frequented 
 by students, the unemployed and local elders.

The cafe helped Dib scrape together enough money to get engaged, which he had never been able to afford under Assad. He’s planning for kids.

“I want girls though. They're sweeter and cuter,” he said. “The boys always want to carry guns.”

THE UNLIKELY PEACEMAKERS

Those steering the committee have their own history of warfare.

Soufan, 
 a Sunni from Latakia, 
 is a former rebel commander.

Another is Khaled al-Ahmad, who helped Assad recapture territory during the war through surrender deals, then fell out with the dictator and eventually switched sides to back Sharaa, his childhood friend.

Ahmad’s man on the ground is Fadi Saqr, an Alawite who commanded an infamous pro-Assad militia known as the National Defense Forces, which was accused by rights groups of committing massacres, looting and extortion. Saqr is blacklisted by the U.S. , opens new tab and European Union for his role in wartime massacres.

Saqr denied any role in massacres in comments to Reuters but declined to answer further questions. Soufan has acknowledged Syria’s government is working 
 with Saqr
 , saying he helped prevent bloodshed when Assad fell.

Saqr’s involvement has led to criticism of the initiative as a skin-deep effort by the new government to cement its rule while allowing notorious regime figures to walk free.

“Who are you to forgive those who killed our people in the ugliest ways? And even more, you elevate them to become symbols of civil peace,” said Osama Othman, who more than a decade ago helped smuggle out thousands of pictures of dead detainees in Assad’s prisons, known as the “Caesar files.”

The government says amnesty candidates are vetted to ensure no one who committed serious crimes during the civil war is pardoned. But the process itself is opaque.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights says the committee’s power to grant amnesties and free detainees undermines transparency, accountability and an independent judiciary.

“Fadi Saqr’s efforts have done a lot to maintain literal peace but not much to ease fears and build trust in communities compared to other grassroots initiatives working with local officials,” said Gregory Waters, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Syria Program.

The work of the committee is also opposed by many in the Alawite community, including hardliners who see cooperation with Syria’s Islamist-led authorities as tantamount to treason. Individuals linked to the committee told Reuters they know they could be targeted by Alawite militants. An Alawite candidate in state-organized parliamentary elections was shot dead in September.

While Reuters was reporting on the committee’s work in Dalieh, 
 a remote and picturesque mountain village
 where the March insurrection began, an anti-government Alawite Facebook page alleged Saqr had brought the reporters there as part of “disgusting plans.” The journalists were followed out of the town by a car with tinted windows, which was ultimately warned off by a government security patrol.

Saqr was not present during the reporting trip, but members of his civil peace team were nearby during interviews with residents. Reuters later followed up with those residents by phone.

Some Alawites initially saw Assad's ouster last year as a potential opening for their broadly destitute community. Tens of thousands of former soldiers signed temporary settlements with the new government and relinquished their weapons.

But mass layoffs and killings of Alawites in the ensuing months left them feeling increasingly sidelined and fearful. Then, the March killings hardened distrust of Sharaa, who led Al Qaeda’s Syrian branch before disavowing the organization.

In a goodwill gesture, the committee has granted amnesty to at least 50 Alawite men linked to the March violence, Tartous governor Ahmed al-Shami told Reuters.

“We told them: ‘you were deceived ... were hasty and implicated yourself, we will be merciful with you and give you a second chance,’” Shami said.

The committee has also freed hundreds of Assad-era soldiers detained after his ouster and arranged more than 90 family visits to some of the thousands of others still imprisoned, a committee official said.

A mother of three former soldiers who are in prison said she was able to visit one of them in September, with the small but still unaffordable cost of travel covered by the committee.

The mother, who asked not to be named, said it was painful to observe her son through a pane of glass and she was only allowed to provide him with underwear.

“They haven't seen the new Syria yet,” she said, tears rolling down her cheeks. “They don’t know anything. They just know that they are in prison.”

Forgiven fighters provide information on people who might still be plotting attacks and help authorities find hidden caches of light arms and ammunition, according to Shami and a statement by the security chiefs of Latakia and Tartous. They also convince others not to fight.

After striking a settlement in April, one of Saqr’s former militiamen was given a job in carpentry. While he said he still wanted revenge for the Alawite blood spilled, the fighter, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, said no one wanted to fight anymore.

“People are tired. They just want security and to feed their kids,” he told Reuters.

Alawite residents on the coast said the efforts are too small to address vast damage from the March violence as well as entrenched poverty and persistent insecurity in the coastal areas. Soufan acknowledged the financial constraints.

“We are doing something symbolic that clears the air and gets us moving forward,” he told Reuters.

More than nine months after the violence, the committee says it has refurbished less than 10% of roughly 1,000 damaged homes.

Osama Twayyer, a 32-year-old Alawite in the Jableh countryside, said his extended family had 13 houses torched and livestock stolen in March. The committee has been unable to locate two of his relatives who have been missing since then, he said.

The committee began basic repairs in some of his relatives’ homes. But after Reuters visited in September, Twayyer said repairs ground to a halt.

He said fears of renewed violence were keeping people away from his garage, slashing his income.

“After 6 p.m., my own brother could knock on the door and I wouldn’t open it,” Twayyer said.

Alawite rallies in recent days and last month showed the challenges the committee faces.

On December 28, thousands of Alawites chanted for decentralized rule and the release of detainees. Their demonstration barely lasted an hour before they were confronted by a pro-government protest. Gunfire from security forces broke up that gathering
 
 and one last month with similar demands.

Authorities have launched public trials over the March violence. Their results remain a litmus test for accountability in the new Syria.

Wael Hasan, a 59-year-old farmer whose charred home the committee has promised to repair, told Reuters there was a long way to go before Syria’s communities could live together without fear.

“Deep inside, we’re ready for it. But right now it feels far away because justice and law must come first,” he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 07:25:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LU5K6IVSTRMHDMH5P6WVCZMJXY.jpg?auth=8e3e97c8b315cb59cbc4b891cee741d8f0805debcd46fface0cbfbea746f14d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's president urges government to listen to protesters 'legitimate demands'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251230-iran-s-president-urges-government-to-listen-to-protesters-legitimate-demands</link><description>Iran 's president urged his government to listen to the "legitimate demands" of protesters, state media reported Tuesday, after several days of demonstrations by shopkeepers in Tehran over economic hardships.

Shopkeepers in the capital had shut their stores for the second day in a row on Monday, after Iran's embattled currency hit new lows on the unofficial market.

The US dollar was trading at around 1.42 million rials on Sunday – compared to 820,000 rials a year ago – and the euro nearing 1.7 million rials, according to price monitoring websites.

"I have asked the Interior Minister to listen to the legitimate demands of the protesters by engaging in dialogue with their representatives so that the government can do everything in its power to resolve the problems and act responsibly," President Masoud Pezeshkian said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.

Protesters "are demanding immediate government intervention to rein in exchange-rate fluctuations and set out a clear economic strategy", the pro-labour news agency ILNA reported Monday.

Price fluctuations are paralysing the sales of some imported goods, with both sellers and buyers preferring to postpone transactions until the outlook becomes clearer, AFP correspondents noted.

"Continuing to do business under these conditions has become impossible," ILNA quoted protesters as saying.

The conservative-aligned Fars news agency released images showing a crowd of demonstrators occupying a major thoroughfare in central Tehran, known for its many shops.

Another photograph appeared to show tear gas being used to disperse protesters.

"Minor physical clashes were reported ... between some protesters and the security forces," Fars said, warning that such gatherings could lead to instability.

Iranian Chief Justice Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei called for "the swift punishment of those responsible for currency fluctuations", the justice ministry's Mizan agency reported Monday.

The government has also announced the replacement of the central bank governor.

"By decision of the president, Abdolnasser Hemmati will be appointed governor of the Central Bank," presidency communications official Mehdi Tabatabaei posted on X.

Hemmati is a former economy and finance minister who was dismissed by parliament in March because of the sharp depreciation of the rial.

Pezeshkian delivered on Sunday the budget for the next Persian year to parliament, vowing to fight inflation and the high cost of living.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics. But this figure still falls far short of many price increases, especially for basic necessities.

The country's economy, already battered by decades of Western sanctions, was further strained after the United Nations in late September reinstated international sanctions linked to the country's nuclear programme that were lifted 10 years ago.

The retired retail worker was learning how to use her new metal detector when it started bleeping by the moss-covered ruins of a building. After Plumridge dug the nugget out of the shallow dirt with a plastic trowel, a guide estimated it was around 0.2 of a gram of gold, worth about A$40 ($26.58).

“But to me, it’s worth a million dollars,” said the 63-year-old, who had bought the detector only a few days before. “My heart is singing.”

Plumridge's story is becoming more common, as hobbyists flock to Australia's 9,600 sq km "golden triangle" in the heart of Victoria state, known as one of the world's most prospective regions for gold nuggets.

Prospectors have been spurred on by record gold prices, social media, the success of TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, and a love for the outdoors, according to Reuters interviews with a dozen gold hunters.

Plumridge's detector, Minelab's Gold Monster 2000, which she bought for A$2,999, sold out across the country within weeks of its October 20 launch, according to Leanne Kamp, joint owner of Lucky Strike Gold, a prospecting shop in Geelong.

"It’s a great price point and we have seen a big jump in sales this year, partly because the gold price has got everyone’s interest," said Kamp, who has led prospecting tours since 2007.

"We get a lot of internationals. Next week we have some Germans coming. Germans love the gold. The Swiss seem to love the gold too. And we have some coming over from the U.S.,” she said.

The chance of finding nuggets on historic sites improves with each iteration of detectors, which is why there is a rush for new models as soon as they are released, she added.

Hobbyists have flocked to 19th-century gold rush towns like Ballarat, which laid the foundation for Melbourne's early wealth and helped make Australia one of the world's top three gold producers.

The region has yielded the world's biggest nugget, the Welcome Stranger at 72 kg, found in the 1860s, as well as the Hand of Faith, the largest nugget found with a metal detector at 27.2 kg in 1980. As recently as February 2023, an amateur prospector unearthed a 4.6 kg nugget in the region with a detector, according to the state government.

The lure of large nuggets is one of the draws for Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction. Duke used to go prospecting with his father who died three years ago. Now he takes his own son, Ethan.

The 11-year-old inherited his grandfather’s detector, and Duke has recently upgraded his machine, he told Reuters.

“Where prices are now, you do have the chance of striking a life-changing piece of gold," he said.

Gold has chalked up successive records this year, surging above $4,500 a troy ounce on Friday. Goldman Sachs expects prices will reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, with further gains likely if private investors continue diversifying their portfolios amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty.

In Victoria, fossickers must buy a permit from the state government. The permit allows them to fossick using only hand tools and to keep any gold they find.

Demand for the miner's right permits, which cost A$28.60 each and last for a decade, has hit all-time highs, at almost 16,000 by November, from nearly 11,000 last year, according to figures from Victoria's Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, supplied exclusively to Reuters.

In total, there are more than 100,000 active miner’s right permits in Victoria.

A dream of riches may drive people to get out, but they stay out because of the psychological benefits that come from the focus on the hunt, being outside in nature, and connecting with others, prospectors said.

"It's really good for your mental health, being out here. You take it all in, you can't think about anything else - I love looking at all the wildflowers," said Kelly Smith, a 50-year-old from the country town of Koondrook, who was prospecting with her partner on a training session organised by The Gold Centre in Maryborough.

"You're not guaranteed to find anything. But you're not going to find anything at all if you don't look."

Victoria's latest gold rush is part of a broader phenomenon, said Ben Harvey, executive general manager of Minelab at Adelaide-headquartered Codan (CDA.AX) , opens new tab , which is the world's largest maker of hand-held metal detectors.

Alongside Codan's communications division, strong detector sales in its home market of Australia as well as in Africa and the Americas have helped double the firm's share price this year.

In Africa, demand may be led by artisanal miners working in cooperatives to improve their standard of living, Harvey said. In Latin America, there is also recreational interest from hobbyists searching for coins and other treasure, he told Reuters in an interview.

Behind the success is a push by Codan's team of engineers to improve technology to cut down on background noise so detectorists can focus on the gold, he said.

"What a prospector is looking for is, when they go out, they want to find gold, and they want to find more gold than they found last time," he said.

The downgrade comes at a delicate time for Budapest, which is run by the liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, as nationalist Prime Minister Orban will likely face parliamentary elections in April. The centre-right opposition Tisza party is leading most polls.

"The action follows the disclosure of Budapest's liquidity position highlighting concerns about the city's capacity to repay all of its obligations as required by 31 December 2025," Moody's said late on Monday.

"Uncertainty around the timing and receipt of ordinary transfers, together with very weak liquidity to absorb unexpected cash flow gaps, materially increases the city's near-term credit risk."

Moody's put Budapest's rating on review for a further downgrade "to reflect the increased risk of default and the potential acceleration of repayment of the city's long-term debt due to liquidity concerns."

On Facebook, Karacsony said the downgrade was the result of "the government's irrational and narrow-minded tax policy."

Budapest's leadership has been in conflict with Orban's government over the "solidarity tax," a levy the city has to pay to the state. Moody's said the tax rose 31% from a year earlier to 76 billion forints ($231.50 million) in 2024 and is expected to be 89 billion forints in 2025, or 21% of projected revenues.

"Ongoing legal disputes over the tax amount, which exceeds the funding received from the central government, add system instability and jeopardize the budgeting process and cash balances," Moody's said, adding the ratings also reflected the partial freezing of European Union funds to Hungary.

The EU has suspended billions of euros in funds to Hungary over the government's erosion of democratic rights, allegations that Orban denies.

Orban has said the government was ready to throw a financial lifeline to Budapest.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a staunch ally of President Vladimir Putin who has also embarked on talks with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, announced the deployment of the intermediate-range ballistic earlier this month.

Some Western experts have said that the deployment, which would make it slightly faster for Russian nuclear missiles to reach European targets in the event of a war, underscores the Kremlin’s growing reliance on the threat of nuclear weapons as it seeks to deter NATO members from supplying Kyiv with weapons that can strike deep inside Russia.

Two U.S. researchers have said that, according to their study of satellite images, Moscow is likely stationing the missiles and their mobile launchers at a former airbase in eastern Belarus.

Video released by the Belarusian Defence Ministry on Tuesday did not disclose the location of the missile systems, but showed mobile launchers and their crews driving along forest roads and specialist troops camouflaging the systems with netting.

A senior officer was shown telling troops that the systems had officially been placed on combat duty and, as light snow fell in the background, speaking of regular training and reconnaissance routines for the missile crews.

Moscow tested a conventionally armed Oreshnik – Russian for Hazel tree - against a target in Ukraine in November 2024.

The investigation looked into an alleged payment of 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) for security at two homes in the Bavarian lakeside community of Rottach-Egern between April and September 2022.

Prosecutors also claimed that Usmanov failed to declare jewellery, paintings and wines to Germany's export control office, BAFA, in accordance with European Union sanctions rules. Usmanov has denied any wrongdoing.

Usmanov, who has a net worth of $18.8 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is subject to EU and U.S. sanctions and a travel ban, which were imposed after the start of the war in Ukraine.

Usmanov's lawyers said he had no links to the companies involved in the alleged payments nor did he own or control the properties in question, adding that the EU sanctions were not directly applicable to the probe. Prosecutors were expected to release a statement on the matter later on Tuesday.

His lawyers said it was agreed to close the case to save time and resources. They added that their statement had been coordinated with the prosecutors.

They said Usmanov had agreed to pay 10 million euros split between the German state budget and German charity groups as part of an arrangement to close the probe. They said that the payment was neither a fine nor a form of punishment.

In November 2024, German prosecutors dropped a money laundering investigation against Usmanov on similar terms.

The Southeast Asian neighbours agreed on a ceasefire that took effect at noon (0500 GMT) on Saturday, halting 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides, and included fighter-jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages.

The border clashes reignited early this month, following the breakdown in a ceasefire deal that U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker to halt a previous round of conflict in July.

Under the agreement signed by the defence ministers of both countries on Saturday, Thailand said that after the ceasefire held for 72 hours it would release 18 Cambodian soldiers who have been in detention since July. By mid-afternoon on Tuesday there was no news on the status of the soldiers.

Earlier in the day, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said the ceasefire was fragile and needed both sides to ensure that it was sustained and that bilateral relations were gradually repaired.

"The ceasefire has only just been agreed so there is fragility," Sihasak told reporters. "We should avoid instigation or things that could diminish the ceasefire," he said.

On Monday, the Thai army said Cambodia had breached the ceasefire by flying more than 250 drones over Thailand on Sunday night, and threatened to reconsider the decision to hand over the detained Cambodian soldiers.

Cambodian authorities strongly rejected the accusation, and issued an order prohibiting the use of drones across the country.

The Thai Foreign Ministry also sent a formal protest to Cambodia after a Thai soldier lost a limb on Monday in a landmine blast at a border area.

Landmine incidents were a catalyst for the renewed clashes.

China's Foreign Minister hosted two days of talks with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts, reaching an agreement on Monday that the two countries would work to rebuild mutual trust and gradually consolidate the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 08:55:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BHVGJP6QLNMRLHFJOW3TUDRSUE.jpg?auth=6f0652db4ee00b2625ebfb2d205b0862764680589960204c349ebdca6ae03148&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ASEAN to assess post-election developments in Myanmar, Malaysia PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/asean-assess-post-election-developments-myanmar-malaysia-pm-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Tuesday that leaders from the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN will consider developments in Myanmar following the first phase of its election over the weekend.

The polls are being held in several phases amid an ongoing civil war that has ravaged parts of Myanmar and led to one of Asia's worst humanitarian crises .

The election has been widely derided by the United Nations, Western governments and human rights groups as a sham and an attempt by the ruling junta to entrench military rule through political proxies.

The junta has denied the charge, saying the election was not being conducted through coercion or force and has public support.

Anwar, the current chair of the 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said the bloc's leaders will monitor the situation in Myanmar with care, including steps underway that relate to the political process.

"Any assessment will proceed in a sequenced manner, guided by the need to reduce violence, avoid actions that could deepen divisions or confer premature legitimacy, and preserve the possibility of an inclusive and credible pathway forward," he said in a televised press conference.

Malaysia's foreign minister has previously said that ASEAN wants the election to be fair and inclusive, and also urged the Myanmar junta to adhere to a peace agreement it agreed with the bloc in 2021.

The "Five-Point Consensus" peace plan has been largely seen as a failure, with Myanmar's military rulers refusing to meet with opponents it deemed to be terrorists.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew a civilian democratic government in a 2021 coup, triggering an armed rebellion that has captured large swathes of territory across the country.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 09:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQNX7VTE4ZN5FPPQPSGSZBCDYA.jpg?auth=47d280b0eb7fa0754212d15f8cdfd3dc2334bd252cb0c7a9f903eabd9d758ad6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: China mandates 50% domestic equipment rule for chipmakers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-mandates-50-domestic-equipment-rule-chipmakers-sources-say-2025-12-30/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.

The rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.

The mandate is one of the most significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.

While those U.S. export restrictions blocked the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.

Applications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.

"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%," one source told Reuters. "Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment."

China's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish to be identified as the measure is not public.

China's President Xi Jinping has been calling for a "whole nation" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.

The effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.

"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance," a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology (002371.SZ) , opens new tab said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) , opens new tab .

"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers."

State-affiliated entities placed a record 421 orders for domestic lithography machines and parts this year worth around 850 million yuan, according to publicly available procurement data, signaling a surge in demand for locally developed technologies.

To support the local chip supply chain, Beijing has also poured hundreds of billions of yuan into its semiconductor sector through the "Big Fund ", which established a third phase in 2024 with 344 billion yuan ($49 billion) in capital.

The policy is already yielding results, including in areas such as etching, a critical chip manufacturing step that involves removing materials from silicon wafers to carve out intricate transistor patterns, sources said.

China's largest chip equipment group, Naura, is testing its etching tools on a cutting-edge 7nm (nanometre) production line of SMIC, two sources said. The early-stage milestone, which comes after Naura recently deployed etching tools on 14nm successfully, demonstrates how quickly domestic suppliers are advancing.

"Naura's etching results have been accelerated by the government requiring fabs to use at least 50% domestic equipment," one of the people told Reuters, adding that it was forcing the company to rapidly improve.

Advanced etching tools had been predominantly supplied in China by foreign firms such as Lam Research (LRCX.O) , opens new tab and Tokyo Electron (8035.T) , opens new tab , but are now being partially replaced by Naura and smaller rival Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC) (688012.SS) , opens new tab , sources say.

Naura has also proven a key partner for Chinese memory chipmakers, supplying etching tools for advanced chips with more than 300 layers. It developed electrostatic chucks — devices that hold wafers during processing — to replace worn parts in Lam Research equipment that the company could no longer service after the 2023 restrictions, sources said.

Naura, AMEC, YTMC, SMIC, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron did not respond to requests for comment.

China's progress is being viewed with concern by global competitors, as foreign suppliers are squeezed out of the China market.

Naura filed a record 779 patents in 2025, more than double what it filed in 2020 and 2021, while AMEC filed 259, according to Anaqua's AcclaimIP database, and verified by Reuters.

That's also translating into strong financial results. Naura's revenue for the first half of 2025 jumped 30% to 16 billion yuan. AMEC reported a 44% jump in first-half revenue to 5 billion yuan.

Analysts estimate that China has now reached roughly 50% self-sufficiency in photoresist-removal and cleaning equipment, a market previously dominated by Japanese firms, but now locally led by Naura.

"The domestic equipment market will be dominated by two to three major manufacturers, and Naura is definitely one of them," said a separate source.

Once the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

Here is a timeline of how the relationship has evolved:

2011: As the Arab Spring spreads, the two form a unified front against Islamist movements, deploying joint forces to Bahrain to quell an uprising and coordinating support for Egypt’s 2013 military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government.

March, 2015: They launch a military intervention in Yemen to restore the government ousted by the Iran-aligned Houthis. UAE troops lead ground operations, while Saudi air power controls the skies.

June, 2017: The allies lead a boycott of Qatar , accusing Doha of supporting terrorism, charges it denies. The move cements the alignment between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MBS) and UAE leader Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed (MBZ).

2019: The UAE draws down troops in Yemen , shifting strategy but retaining influence through the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), leaving Riyadh to shoulder the war against the Houthis.

September, 2020: The UAE normalizes ties with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords. Saudi Arabia, the custodian of Islam's two holiest sites, declines to follow suit , insisting on Palestinian statehood first, giving Abu Dhabi a unique diplomatic channel to Washington.

January, 2021: Saudi Arabia leads the Al-Ula summit to end the Qatar dispute . The UAE signs reluctantly, maintaining a cooler stance toward Doha.

February, 2021: Riyadh challenges Dubai's commercial dominance, telling foreign firms to move regional HQs to the kingdom by 2024 or lose state contracts.

July, 2021: Economic rivalry spikes. Riyadh removes tariff concessions for goods from free zones, undercutting the UAE’s trade model. Simultaneously, a rare dispute erupts at OPEC as the UAE blocks a Saudi-led deal, demanding a higher crude oil production baseline.

April, 2023: In Sudan's war , Riyadh hosts ceasefire talks supporting the army, while UN experts accuse the UAE of arming the rival Rapid Support Forces, which Abu Dhabi denies.

December 8, 2025: Tensions peak in Yemen as the UAE-backed STC seizes oilfields in Hadramout, crossing a Saudi "red line."

December 30, 2025: Saudi jets strike a vessel in Mukalla. The coalition says the ship was delivering heavy weapons to separatists, marking the first direct engagement between the partners' interests.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:24:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PVGTQMDLPZIFTJ5RUZWZ6N6I7M.jpg?auth=78fff262d6359146e45043485648c5ffd5bd306337ff28128d1b4e528cf2ef05&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Russia is toughening its stance on Ukraine after drone attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-russia-is-toughening-its-stance-ukraine-after-drone-attack-2025-12-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday that a Ukrainian drone attack on a presidential residence in the Novgorod region would toughen Russia's position on a possible peace deal to end the fighting.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed the Russian accusations as "another round of lies" aimed to justify additional attacks against Ukraine and to prolong the war.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted Ukraine's denial of the drone attack - and said that many Western media were playing along with Kyiv's denial.

"This terrorist action is aimed at collapsing the negotiation process," Peskov told reporters. "The diplomatic consequence will be to toughen the negotiating position of the Russian Federation."

The Russian military, he said, knew how and when to respond.

"We see that Zelenskiy himself is trying to deny this, and many Western media outlets, playing along with the Kyiv regime, are starting to spread the theme that this did not happen," Peskov said. "This is a completely insane assertion."

Peskov declined to say where Putin was at the time of the attack, saying that in light of recent events such details should not be in the public domain.

When asked if Russia had physical evidence of the drone attack, he said air defences shot the drones down but that the question of wreckage was for the defence ministry.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:24:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4VEKYATHCNKTZBIGCDOQ6ODCGA.jpg?auth=f4b6179aaf0154ca9c834db678db97623c1d79457f510815d663d578507fdf72&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Russia is toughening its stance on Ukraine after drone attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-russia-is-toughening-its-stance-ukraine-after-drone-attack-2025-12-30/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:24:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>George Clooney, his wife Amal and their children obtain French citizenship</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/george-clooney-his-wife-amal-their-children-obtain-french-citizenship-2025-12-30/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Hollywood star George Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, have obtained French citizenship, along with their two children, official French government documents show.

Clooney told broadcaster RTL earlier this month that it was essential for him and his wife that their eight-year-old twins Alexander and Ella could live in a place where they had a chance to live a normal life.

“Here, they don’t take photos of kids. There aren’t any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That’s number one for us,” he told RTL on December 2.

The couple purchased a house on a vineyard, with an estimated value of around 9 million euros ($10.59 million), in the southern French town of Brignoles in 2021.

The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court, according to French media.

"We also have a house in the United States, but our happiest place is on this farm where the kids can have fun," he said.

U.S. film director Jim Jarmusch on Friday told France Inter radio that he would also make an application to obtain French citizenship.

"I would like to have another place to escape from America if necessary," he told France Inter.

"And France, and Paris, and French culture are very deep in me. So I think I would be very honored if I could have a French passport," he said.

"It is essential for Turkey to play a role of facilitator, constructively and aimed at dialogue ... This is crucial for both regional peace and to strengthen its own internal peace," Ocalan, founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party ( PKK ) militant group, said in a message relayed by Turkey's pro-Kurdish DEM party.

Earlier this year, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) ended its four-decade armed struggle against Turkey at the urging of its jailed founder Abdullah Ocalan, shifting its focus to a democratic political struggle for the rights of Turkey's Kurdish minority.

The ongoing process has raised hopes among Kurds across the region, notably in Syria where the Kurds control swathes of territory in the north and northeast.

Turkey has long been hostile to the Kurdish SDF force that controls swathes of northeastern Syria, seeing it as an extension of PKK, and pushing for the US-backed force to integrate into the Syrian military and security apparatus.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:51:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/43654ba8-e55e-11f0-bad3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25328691950897.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's government offers dialogue to protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-government-offers-dialogue-protesters-2025-12-30/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Iran's government said on Tuesday it would seek dialogue with protest leaders after demonstrations in Tehran and other cities over a plunge in the currency's value that has accelerated inflation, with the central bank chief resigning.

Protests, which included shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, were held on Sunday and Monday according to Iranian state media, the latest demonstrations in the Islamic Republic where bouts of unrest have repeatedly erupted in recent years.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a social media post late on Monday that he had asked the interior minister to listen to "legitimate demands" of protesters. Government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said a dialogue mechanism would be set up and include talks with protest leaders.

"We officially recognise the protests ... We hear their voices and we know that this originates from natural pressure arising from the pressure on people's livelihoods," she said on Tuesday in comments carried by state media.

The Iranian rial has been falling as the economy has suffered from the impact of Western sanctions, sinking to a record low on Monday at around 1,390,000 to the U.S. dollar, according to websites monitoring open market rates.

"We have fundamental measures on the agenda to reform the monetary and banking system and maintain the purchasing power of the people," Pezeshkian posted on X.

Iranian media have said the government's recent economic liberalisation policies have put pressure on the open-rate rial market, where ordinary Iranians buy foreign currency.

In 2022, Iran was buffeted by protests across the country over price hikes, including for bread, a major staple .

Over the same period and into 2023, the country's clerical rulers faced the boldest unrest in years touched off by the death of a young Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of the morality police, who enforce strict dress codes.

Iranian security services suppressed previous rounds of protests with violent crackdowns and widespread arrests rather than dialogue.

Iran remains under intense international pressure, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying on Monday that he might back another round of Israeli airstrikes if Tehran resumed work on ballistic missiles or any nuclear weapons programme.

The U.S. and Israel carried out 12 days of airstrikes on Iran's military and its nuclear installations in June aimed at stopping what they believe were efforts to develop the means to build an atomic weapon.

Iran says its nuclear energy programme is entirely peaceful and that it has not tried to build a nuclear bomb.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:19:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/46ZYRWDPDNNVHOCZ3AMQSHRKOE.jpg?auth=203722e36d4bb544c44b0b6cca9f5449a1115ae6282b84a6b8a1dc53669da1e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ivory Coast's ruling party increases its majority in weekend vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ivory-coasts-ruling-party-increases-its-majority-weekend-vote-2025-12-30/</link><description>ABIDJAN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's ruling party increased its majority in parliament in elections held at the weekend, while the main opposition party, led by former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam, lost half of its seats, provisional results showed.

The strong showing for the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace, or RHDP, should make it easier for President Alassane Ouattara to implement his agenda that includes luring private investment to French-speaking West Africa's largest economy, the world's biggest cocoa grower.

Ouattara, an 83-year-old former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund who secured a fourth term in October, has also said he would use his mandate to prepare the way for a new generation of political leaders.

The RHDP took 197 of 255 seats in the National Assembly in Saturday's elections, according to provisional results announced on Monday by the electoral commission, up from 163.

Thiam's Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, or PDCI, won 32 seats, down from 65, while independent candidates won 23 seats.

Voter turnout was 35.04%, down from 37.88% during the last legislative elections in 2021.

Ouattara first came to power in 2011 after a four-month war.

He was re-elected with more than 89% of the vote in the presidential contest on October 25 in which Thiam and former President Laurent Gbagbo were barred from running.

Gbagbo's party boycotted this year's legislative elections, saying they would not be credible.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:21:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X63UQXNYKBPEPEGTVPU4DRLZWU.jpg?auth=2951cab850ee3f67df798c16db92b6b8cc87e1fd4a956795a3811d5a5a1125ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia attacks Ukraine's Black Sea ports, damages civilian ship, Kyiv says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-attacks-ukraines-black-sea-ports-damages-civilian-ship-kyiv-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Russia attacked infrastructure in Ukraine's Odesa region on Tuesday, damaging a civilian ship and facilities in the Black Sea ports of Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.

Kuleba said a civilian Panama-flagged ship loaded with grains was damaged, and that oil storage tanks were also hit. One person was wounded, he said on the Telegram app.

"This is yet another targeted attack by Russia on civilian port infrastructure. The enemy is trying to disrupt logistics and complicate shipping," Kuleba said.

Despite the attacks, both ports continued to operate, he said.

Odesa and the wider nearby region are home to the Black Sea ports that are crucial for Ukraine's foreign trade and the survival of its wartime economy.

Ukraine is a major global producer and exporter of agricultural products. During nearly four years of the war, the role of Odesa and its two other ports - Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk - as major trading hubs grew as other Ukrainian ports were destroyed, occupied, or disrupted by Russia's forces.

In the past several months, maritime warfare between Ukraine and Russia has intensified. Both sides have attacked naval and commercial assets in the Black Sea and beyond.

Ukraine is increasingly using its sea drones for attacks on ships connected to Russia’s shadow fleet.

At the same time, Russia has stepped up its attacks on the city of Odesa and its port infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria imposes curfew in Latakia days after protests turn violent, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-imposes-curfew-latakia-days-after-protests-turn-violent-state-media-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - Syrian security forces imposed a curfew on Latakia city, a bastion of the country's Alawite minority, state media reported on Tuesday, days after four people were killed in protests that spiralled into violence.

Syria has been rocked by several episodes of sectarian bloodshed since longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who hails from the Muslim Alawite community, was ousted by a rebel offensive last year and replaced by a Sunni-led government.

State media said the curfew was set to last from 5 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Tuesday until 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday.

Security forces reinforced their deployment in a number of neighborhoods in Latakia city on the Mediterranean coast, which witnessed riots on Monday that injured about a dozen people.

Thousands of Alawite protesters gathered on Sunday in Azhari Square in Latakia city to demand a decentralized political system in Syria and the release of thousands of Alawite prisoners.

A similar protest in November lasted barely an hour before being confronted by a rival protest in support of Syria's new government.

He made his remarks despite the Kremlin saying its negotiating position would toughen after accusing Kyiv of attacking a Russian presidential residence, an allegation that Kyiv said was baseless and intended to prolong the conflict.

"Peace is on the horizon, there is no doubt that things have happened that give grounds for hope that this war can end, and quite quickly, but it is still a hope, far from 100% certain," Tusk told a government meeting.

"When I say peace is on the horizon, I'm talking about the coming weeks, not the coming months or years. By January, we'll all have to come together... to make decisions about the future of Ukraine, the future of this part of the world."

Tusk said security guarantees offered to Kyiv by the United States were a reason to hope the conflict could end soon, but that Kyiv would need to compromise on territorial issues.

U.S. President Donald Trump said after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday that they were "getting a lot closer, maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although "thorny issues" remained.

Zelenskiy said control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Russian hands, and the fate of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine were still unresolved.

Russia wants Kyiv to withdraw troops from parts of the Donetsk region it has failed to occupy in almost four years of war since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Kyiv wants fighting halted along current front lines, and Washington has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine pulls troops back.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7HXPSKOM55MPDPWRBBUIMRKGKA.jpg?auth=53aefb95827b48a5d74a1a924343f46da8f6a356587af3234183e0ba43a9af95&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What do we know about Russian accusations that Ukraine attacked Putin residence?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/what-do-we-know-about-russian-accusations-that-ukraine-attacked-putin-residence-2025-12-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Moscow has accused Kyiv of trying to strike a presidential residence in northern Russia, an allegation that Ukrainian leaders have dismissed as a lie aimed at allowing Moscow to continue the war in Ukraine.

WHAT IS RUSSIA'S ACCUSATION?

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday accused Ukraine of attacking a presidential residence in the Novgorod region overnight with 91 long-range attack drones and said Russia would retaliate.

He said no one was injured and that although Moscow was not quitting talks on ending the war in Ukraine, its negotiating position was being reviewed following the attack, which he described as "state terrorism".

Lavrov did not provide any evidence for the accusation. He said Russia had already identified targets in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed the Russian accusations as "another round of lies" aimed at justifying additional attacks on Ukraine and to prolong the war under way since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

"This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies," he said.

Russia has often launched hundreds of drones as well as firing missiles in almost daily attacks on Ukraine.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged world leaders on Monday to condemn Russia over its allegations, and added on Tuesday: "Almost a day passed and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine’s alleged 'attack on Putin’s residence'. And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened."

The Valdai residence, also known as "Uzhin" or "Dolgiye Borody", is a heavily guarded complex on the shores of Lake Valdai about 360 km (225 miles) north of Moscow.

It was unclear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack but he held meetings on Saturday and Monday in the Kremlin. Putin has yet to comment in public on the situation and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that in light of recent events such details should not be in the public domain.

Shortly before Lavrov released his statement, Putin held a meeting in the Kremlin with Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov and top generals about the war in Ukraine. He did not mention any Ukrainian drone attack on the residence.

Putin informed Trump of the attack on Monday.

"I don't like it. It's not good," Trump told reporters.

"It's one thing to be offensive," Trump said. "It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

After Lavrov's statement, Russia's defence ministry said 91 drones had been downed on their way to the presidential residence, including 49 shot down over the Bryansk region which is 450 km from Valdai, one over the Smolensk region and 41 over the heavily forested Novgorod region.

The defence ministry had not mentioned any attack on the residence in its earlier reports of military action. The governor of Novgorod, Alexander Dronov, had said air defence and fighter jets were shooting down Ukrainian drones.

Asked if Russia had physical evidence of the drone attack, Peskov said on Tuesday the question of wreckage was for the defence ministry.

Russia accused Ukraine in 2023 of attacking the Kremlin with drones in what it said was an attempt to assassinate Putin. Ukraine denied any involvement in the incident and accused Russia of manufacturing a pretext for an escalation of the war.

The New York Times later reported that U.S. intelligence agencies believed Ukraine's security services were behind the attack but that it was unclear whether Zelenskiy or his top officials were aware of the operation. Some officials believed Zelenskiy was not aware, it reported.

Russia said on Monday it would retaliate and that it will review its position in peace talks although it said it was not quitting the negotiations.

"The diplomatic consequence will be to toughen the negotiating position of the Russian Federation," Peskov said on Tuesday. He did not say what targets Russia might strike but that the military knew when and how to respond.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TDKA4EZPEVKUVLOEWMUCEBIMYY.jpg?auth=1ec45a9063500ee0520858e67785f5289bdfae66734a7d2700d6a6d19fd9571a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain exempts Airbus from Israeli tech ban</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spain-exempts-airbus-israeli-tech-ban-2025-12-30/</link><description>MADRID, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Spain has granted Airbus (AIR.PA) , opens new tab exceptional permission to produce aircraft and drones using Israeli technology at its Spanish plants even though it banned military and dual-use products from Israel two months ago over its war in Gaza .

Approved last Tuesday by the cabinet and defended by several ministers this week, the exemption reflects the pressure from companies and domestic interests that some of Europe's toughest critics of Israel's recent war have faced as they attempt to impose trade sanctions.

It also risks increasing tensions within the ruling coalition between the Socialists and their hard-left partner Sumar when the government is already weakened by internal disputes and scandals over corruption and accusations of sexual harassment.

Neither Airbus nor the defence ministry was immediately available for comment.

Spain in September passed a law to take "urgent measures to stop the genocide in Gaza", banning trade in defence material and dual-use products from Israel, as well as imports and advertising of products originating from illegal Israeli settlements.

Its consumer ministry on Tuesday ordered seven tourist accommodation websites to remove 138 advertisements for holiday homes in occupied Palestinian territories or face the threat of sanctions in Spain.

Spain has already blocked 200 attempts to buy material linked to Israel, its digital transformation minister Oscar Lopez told national broadcaster TVE on Tuesday.

Airbus, which employs about 14,000 people in Spain and accounts for 60% of its air and defence exports, was granted the first exception in a cabinet meeting last week, written minutes showed, citing the "great industrial and export potential" of its aircraft "considered essential ... for preserving thousands of highly skilled jobs in Spain".

The European aerospace company produces its A400M and C295 transport planes, an A330 MRTT refuelling aircraft and SIRTAP surveillance drones at its sites in Madrid and Seville, all using Israeli technology.

The company is working with Spain's Ministry of Defence on a "plan to disconnect from Israeli technology", according to the minutes published last Tuesday, which did not provide further details.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:22:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NZV6T6A56FP5ZNXBF6Z3WRAV4Q.jpg?auth=2e742ec4ca5152205ad0be6bd51ae11432199dd1ade5cca1d2b3a95df5fc821b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, partner forces killed or captured nearly 25 Islamic State operatives since strikes in Syria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-partner-forces-killed-or-captured-nearly-25-islamic-state-operatives-since-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The United States and its partner forces killed or captured nearly 25 Islamic State operatives since it launched retaliatory strikes in Syria earlier this month, the U.S. military said on Tuesday.

U.S. District Judge Angel Kelley in Boston granted , opens new tab an emergency request by several South Sudanese nationals and an immigrant rights group to prevent the temporary protected status they had been granted from expiring as planned after January 5.

Kelley, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued the order after four migrants from South Sudan along with African Communities Together, a non-profit group, sued . The lawsuit alleged that action by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was unlawful and exposed them to being deported to a country facing a series of humanitarian crises.

South Sudan has been ravaged by conflict since winning independence from Sudan in 2011. Fighting has persisted in much of the country since the end in 2018 of a five-year civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people, and the U.S. State Department advises citizens not to travel there.

The United States began designating South Sudan for temporary protected status, or TPS, in 2011.

That status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications for that same protection, according to the lawsuit.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem published a notice on November 5 terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.

Her department has moved to similarly end temporary protections to foreign nationals from countries including Syria , Venezuela , Haiti , Cuba and Nicaragua, prompting several court challenges.

"With the renewed peace in South Sudan, their demonstrated commitment to ensuring the safe reintegration of returning nationals, and improved diplomatic relations, now is the right time to conclude what was always intended to be a temporary designation," a Homeland Security Department spokesperson said in a statement ahead of the court ruling.

The lawsuit argues the agency's action violated the statute governing the TPS program, ignored the dire humanitarian conditions that remain in South Sudan, and was motivated by discrimination against migrants who are not white in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:49:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IIVEYADSFFPBTPSINDLSK3DXEU.jpg?auth=4624682c77119d5b92492184ef8774bacd7d92318f0c58d3c8b1a92b26d9d7a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Power failure halts Channel Tunnel rail traffic, causing travel mayhem</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eurostar-flags-severe-delays-cancellations-due-power-supply-issues-channel-2025-12-30/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Train services through the Channel Tunnel linking Britain and continental Europe were suspended on Tuesday following a power supply failure, disrupting peak winter holiday travel.

"Due to a problem with the overhead power supply in the Channel Tunnel and a subsequent failed Le Shuttle train, we strongly advise all our passengers to postpone their journey to a different date," Eurostar said in a statement.

The disruption affects one of Europe’s busiest international rail corridors at the height of the New Year travel season.

Several hundred Le Shuttle passengers were stuck in their vehicles after passing through passport checks and security at the terminal in Folkestone.

Officials said that for the time being they could neither go forward - there were no trains - nor backwards, because they had already crossed into the French control zone.

Alison Raby said she had booked a day trip to a theme park in Belgium, but the four-hour delay made the excursion pointless.

"We’re stuck, basically,” she told Reuters.

Fellow passenger Phil Groves, who works for Britain's National Health Service and was en route to Paris for New Year's Eve, said he and his family had been stuck at Folkestone for six hours and were held in a "mammoth queue".

"We've received no information other than the services are suspended," he said.

Britain's Port of Dover said it was operating a 'turn up and go' system for passengers affected by the tunnel disruption and that ferry operators currently had capacity to take extra travellers.

Le Shuttle carried 2.2 million passenger vehicles and 1.2 million trucks through the tunnel in 2024. Eurostar carried 19.5 million customers in the same year, its most successful to date.

Stranded passengers crowded the concourse at London's St Pancras station. One was led away by police, shouting "I just want to know if I'll see my family" after an exchange with a Eurostar worker.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:50:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X4FXH77Z55OJZHKBXVBTU5FMQM.jpg?auth=128228a3fde54085106dc8db738fdd128042d7f40634df0d8b1ea482ee1eb635&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland acts to improve status of same-sex couples with cohabitation bill</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-acts-improve-status-same-sex-couples-with-cohabitation-bill-2025-12-30/</link><description>WARSAW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Poland's government approved a bill on Tuesday introducing "cohabitation contracts" for couples living together, a measure of recognition for same-sex unions in one of the few European Union countries with few rights for LGBT people.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who took office in 2023 pledging to reverse arch-conservative party policies criticised by Brussels for undermining democracy and minority rights, has struggled to deliver reforms on abortion and LGBT rights.

Those have faced resistance from his conservative junior coalition partner PSL and veto threats from two successive presidents aligned with the right-wing nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party that lost power in the 2023 election.

"We are going to the parliament with a conciliation project for which we believe there is a majority in the lower and upper House," Katarzyna Kotula, the government official overseeing equality issues, told reporters after a cabinet session.

The bill would allow two people, regardless of gender, to sign a cohabitation contract at a notary’s office. It covers housing rights, alimony, access to health information and health insurance, care leave, joint tax returns and tax exemptions.

The measure stops short of legalising same-sex marriage, which remains banned.

Tusk's pro-European government hopes the limited scope of the bill will secure approval from nationalist President Karol Nawrocki. LGBT groups voiced frustration but said the measure might be the only one with any chance to pass in parliament.

"This is not a moment of triumph. After two years of Donald Tusk's government, the ruling coalition has finally developed a joint proposal," the Campaign Against Homophobia said in a statement after the initial publication of the bill.

"This is not the bill we've been fighting for over the years. It's a meagre response to great expectations – and the only one that, in the current situation, can offer any sense of security."

Mostly Catholic Poland remains among the most restrictive EU states on LGBT rights, despite growing public support for legal recognition of same-sex couples.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:50:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3C2VZQBKX5IVBL6YAQYP3E3IAU.jpg?auth=223d7c9ed2b3d60fa561d796128d43df7b4a7a0c61c14fd12d0d584a367f7ffd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Shootings in Sweden halved in 2025 as police tackle gang crime</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/shootings-sweden-halved-2025-police-tackle-gang-crime-2025-12-30/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The number of shootings in Sweden has more than halved since hitting a peak in 2022, reflecting new policing approaches introduced by the right-wing government, which is readying for parliamentary elections next year.

Shooting incidents fell to 147 so far this year, a 63% decrease compared to 2022 when there were 390 shootings and a 49% decrease compared to 2024, according to a Reuters analysis of official figures.

The number of fatalities, however, was unchanged from last year at 43, though lower than the 62 killed in 2022.

The government won the 2022 election on a pledge to stop gang crime and drastically reduce immigration. It trails the opposition in opinion polls ahead of the next election in September, but the gap has narrowed.

Gang-related crime has been high in Sweden for more than two decades and, over that period, the amount of gun violence has risen to among the highest in Europe from among the lowest.

Among those killed this year, 11 died in a school shooting in February, which was not gang-related.

"New tools, resources and methods are starting to hit the criminal networks," Sweden's Minister of Justice Gunnar Strommer told Reuters, but said more needed to be done. "I want to remain humble. This is complicated and we still have levels of violence no decent society can accept."

Legislation that has drawn criticism from lawyers and some politicians has introduced changes such as anonymity for some court witnesses, increased electronic surveillance, tougher sentences and what are known as safety zones, where police can search people even if they are not suspected of any crime.

Johan Olsson, head of the Police National Operations Department, said the measures had allowed police to seize gangs' assets and become more efficient in preventing shootings.

"Where we don't see much success is stopping the recruitment to the gangs," he told Reuters, adding that much of the recruitment happened online.

Sweden has around 17,500 active gang members, according to police figures.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:44:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KB7AMZVGBRIVVNYTU5SRCPVTWI.jpg?auth=75626b9c8863368fb3f22f0d2dd9851629b096150f2b900b978952dc94de0f68&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, 'Coalition of the Willing' to meet early January, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-coalition-willing-meet-early-january-zelenskiy-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 30 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Ukraine and the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' group of nations backing Kyiv plan to hold their next meetings at the start of January.

The move followed a Saudi-led coalition airstrike on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla.

UAE-backed separatists in Yemen dismissed the calls to withdraw and vowed to hold and reinforce their territory.

"There is no thinking about withdrawal. It is unreasonable for the landowner to be asked to leave his own land. The situation requires staying and reinforcing," said Anwar Al-Tamimi, the spokesman for the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), in comments to AFP.

The attack on ‍what Riyadh said was a UAE-linked weapons shipment marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date in a widening rift between the two Gulf powers.

Once ​the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on ​everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

Declaring its national security a red line, Saudi Arabia earlier on Tuesday alleged the UAE had pressured Yemen's southern separatists to conduct military operations that had reached the kingdom's borders .

It was Riyadh's strongest language yet in the falling-out between the neighbours, who once cooperated in a coalition against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis but whose interests in Yemen have steadily grown apart in recent years.

Frictions grew inside the coalition as Abu Dhabi backed southern separatists seeking self-rule while Riyadh kept supporting Yemen's internationally recognised government, eventually creating an open rift ‍between the Gulf allies.

On Tuesday the coalition struck what it said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the UAE-backed separatists. The head of Yemen's Saudi-backed ​presidential council gave Emirati forces an ultimatum of 24 hours to leave.

The UAE said in a statement that it had been surprised by the airstrike, and that the shipment that had been attacked did not contain weapons and was ‌destined for Emirati forces.

Yemen's presidential council head, Rashad al-Alimi, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, the Yemeni state news agency said, and accused the UAE in a televised speech of fuelling strife in ‍Yemen with its support for the separatist Southern Transitional Council.

"Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation," he said.

The UAE earlier stressed that "dealing with recent developments must be done responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation, based on reliable facts and existing coordination between the concerned parties".

Major stock indexes in the Gulf fell. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both major players in the OPEC+ oil exporters' group, and any disagreements between ‍the two could hamper consensus on oil output decisions.

They and six other OPEC+ members are meeting online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates say they will ‌continue their current policy for ​no change in first-quarter production.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:46:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1284f68c-e590-11f0-962b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Yemen-new-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US issues sanctions related to Iran and Venezuela weapons trade</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-issues-sanctions-related-iran-venezuela-weapons-trade-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday it has added 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela to its sanctions list, citing their aggressive weapons program.

The U.S. Treasury has designated Venezuela-based Empresa Aeronautica Nacional SA and its chair, Jose Jesus Urdaneta Gonzalez, who it said have contributed to Iran's trade of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drones, with Venezuela.

"Urdaneta, on behalf of EANSA, has coordinated with members and representatives of the Venezuelan and Iranian armed forces on the production of UAVs in Venezuela," Treasury said in a statement.

"We will continue to take swift action to deprive those who enable Iran’s military-industrial complex access to the U.S. financial system," said John Hurley, the department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

The U.S. has ramped up pressure on Venezuela in recent months, executing a large-scale military buildup in the southern Caribbean.

The statement, published online by the British Foreign Office, said Israel should allow non-governmental organisations to work in Israel in a sustained and predictable way, and ensure the U.N. could continue its work in the Palestinian enclave.

"(We) express serious concerns about the renewed deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza which remains catastrophic," read the statement from the foreign ministers of Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

It also said Israel should lift what it called "unreasonable restrictions" on certain imports including medical and shelter equipment, and open border crossings to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of intense Israeli bombardment and military operations in Gaza that followed a deadly attack by Hamas-led fighters on Israeli communities in October 2023.

A global hunger monitor said on December 19 that there was no longer famine in Gaza after access for humanitarian and commercial food deliveries improved following the ceasefire.

But humanitarian agencies say far more aid needs to get into the small, crowded territory and that Israel is blocking needed items from entering. Israel says more than enough food gets in and that the problems are with distribution within Gaza.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:29:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J3TUJE2K6RNWXLBR67XGE6HVFE.jpg?auth=537314f481a89b38d0ea7a8684cdeefb5f43afdd3eefb3aa88ca70dd1351af35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan says Israeli decision to recognise Somaliland unacceptable, illegal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-israeli-decision-recognise-somaliland-unacceptable-illegal-2025-12-30/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Israel's decision to formally recognise of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland was an illegal and unacceptable step, adding that it was trying to drag the horn of Africa into destabilisation.

Nasralla finished second to conservative candidate Nasry Asfura, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and was declared the winner on Christmas Eve, more than three weeks after the November 30 election.

Less than 1% of votes separated the two candidates, according to the CNE, Honduras' electoral authority.

Nasralla's legal team filed an appeal with Honduras' Electoral Justice Tribunal (TJE) on Monday, prompting the tribunal to issue a resolution late on Monday evening calling for additional documentation before it decides whether to admit the challenge.

"There have been too many inconsistencies in this electoral process," Nasralla's lawyer Karla Romero said on Monday night, asserting that in many departments of the country, votes for Asfura had been "inflated."

Nasralla's lawyers have not made evidence of fraud presented in the appeal publicly available.

Asfura's party has denied Nasralla's accusations of fraud.

Nasralla, a centrist who has unsuccessfully run for president twice before, is seeking a comprehensive review and recount of presidential ballots in at least 12 of Honduras' 18 departments.

The TJE has set a 48-hour deadline for the CNE to submit paperwork pertaining to the recount requests.

The challenge unfolds amid heightened political tension and public mistrust in the electoral process.

Nasralla, who also disputed his loss in the 2017 general election, rejected the CNE's declaration of Asfura's victory last week, saying the electoral authority had excluded ballots that should have been counted.

The head of the Honduran Congress, from the ruling Libre party, has also rejected the results. Libre supporters demonstrated outside the CNE headquarters in Tegucigalpa on Monday.

Asfura is due to take office on January 27 for the 2026-2030 term.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:22:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/44N6V3BKIVP6RI47F4XWMBSRZA.jpg?auth=573923b6834399a0cebb9b6ed1abf1bead6cb326789989f2e8f678954a6fc04f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why China is bringing out the big guns for military drills around Taiwan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251230-why-china-is-bringing-out-the-big-guns-for-military-drills-around-taiwan</link><description>On the first day of a massive military exercise around the island of Taiwan on Monday, menacing, AI-generated scenes frame the narrative in a propaganda video released by China : An eagle transforms into an attack drone, fish become frigates and destroyers and wolves running through a forest turn into robot soldiers storming a ravaged city.

The clip, which was shared by the China Daily English-language newspaper and other platforms, presents a dehumanised, victimless vision of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its sovereign territory.

“I suppose the animals represent the natural, almost instinctive, nature of the military operation, while the machines and weapons symbolise the controlled and precise aspect of the invasion. The message is that this is not a political choice, but a natural, inevitable and bloodless process,” said Simona Grano, head of research on China-Taiwan relations at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies.

China ended the year with two days of war games, code-named "Justice Mission 2025" and involving a massive show of force with the deployment of frigates, destroyers, fighter jets, bombers, drones and missiles as well as heavy artillery.

They were accompanied by bellicose official statements, including a “stern warning” by the Chinese military to “separatist” and “external interference” forces that might be “plotting” Taiwan’s independence.

In one post on the Chinese social media site Weibo, the military's Eastern Theatre Command, which is responsible for the Taiwan Strait, thundered that, “All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield of justice!”

Watch more Chinese military releases footage of drills around Taiwan

On the second day of its most extensive war games to date, China fired rockets that fell into Taiwan’s contiguous zone, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry, referring to the waters off the democratically self-governed island.

“Justice Mission 2025” also featured live-fire exercises, which have not been conducted since April.

“These manoeuvres are all the more significant because they are a joint operation involving land, naval, air and rocket forces,” noted Jonathan Sullivan, a China specialist at the University of Nottingham. But overall, “the Chinese military is not demonstrating anything it has not demonstrated before”, he said.

Beijing has stepped up its military drills since the summer of 2022, when Nancy Pelosi , then speaker of the US House of Representatives, visited Taiwan, an act Beijing viewed as a provocation.

Since then, the Chinese military has been keen to demonstrate “its ability to quickly organise a complete air and sea blockade of the island in preparation for a [land] invasion”, explained Zeno Leoni, a specialist in Chinese security issues at King's College London.

Grano notes that over the past few years, “the Chinese armed forces are moving a little closer to Taiwan's territorial waters, which is in line with Beijing’s gradual strangulation tactic”.

Beyond the impressive military mobilisation, the latest exercises are significant because they come at a crucial moment for Chinese President Xi Jinping . “The geopolitical context has changed a lot since the last exercises nine months ago,” noted Grano.

“Relations between China and the United States, which were particularly poor in April due to the tariff war, improved slightly after the meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit at the end of October,” Sullivan said.

The easing of ties after the Trump-Xi meeting didn’t last very long. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced a huge arms sale worth around $11 billion to Taiwan, which includes advanced rocket-launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles. It was the second package of arms sales to Taipei since Trump returned to the White House in January.

The Chinese authorities “felt betrayed by Washington's approval of one of the largest arms sales to Taiwan last week”, Sullivan explained.

Beijing felt compelled to set the record straight and reiterate its determination to eventually integrate Taiwan into its territory.

For more US arms package to Taiwan seen as a 'move to use Taiwan to contain China'

The US was not the only major player to offend Chinese nationalist sensibilities in recent weeks. Beijing also took issue with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi 's statement in November that any conflict in Taiwan would be a matter of national security for Japan .

“China perceived this statement as a threat of Japanese intervention on Taiwan's side in the event of a conflict, which it considers unacceptable,” said Leoni. “It is true that, given its proximity to the Japanese islands, the fate of this territory is important to Japan. But in the current context, Sanae Takaichi's statements may appear diplomatically clumsy,” he added.

For Beijing, the Japanese leader’s statement along with the US arms sales announcement was viewed as “external interferences”, representing “a setback for the Chinese diplomatic narrative, which insists on the internal nature of the Taiwan issue”, Grano explained.

But China’s latest show of force near Taiwanese ports is not just a signal to foreign powers tempted to strongly support Taipei. It is also a way of hitting Taiwan where it hurts.

“These military exercises are intended to further weaken [Taiwan’s] President Lai Ching-te , who is already under strong internal pressure from opposition parties,” said Grano.

“He faces impeachment proceedings next May. Opposing him, the Kuomintang party has been given a boost by public opinion, which is clearly wary of Lai Ching-te's hardline anti-China stance. This Beijing-friendly party also recently appointed a new chairwoman, Cheng Li-wun, who is more openly pro-China than her predecessor,” explained Sullivan.

“It's a message to the Taiwanese people saying, ‘Look what's in store for you if you continue to support someone like Lai Ching-te,’” said Grano.

Practically speaking, the Chinese army also needs to reassure itself and others. These exercises are the first major test for Yang Zhibin, who was appointed commander-in-chief of the Eastern Theatre Command in September. “It is one of the most sensitive and important positions in the Chinese army,” said Leoni.

His predecessor, Lin Xiangyang, was accused of corruption and dismissed from the army, while the political commissar for the Eastern Theatre Command, Liu Qingsong, has simply disappeared for several months. A large-scale military exercise “allows the Chinese public to see that the military command is strong and that the page has been turned on the scandals”, said Grano.

And this messaging is not just catering to domestic audiences. “The purges of military personnel have led to speculation in the West that Xi Jinping was losing control of his army,” Sullivan noted. Organising highly ambitious manoeuvres just two months after the arrival of a new commander-in-chief of the Eastern Theatre Command is Beijing's way of saying, ‘Move along, there's nothing to see here.’”

Zelenskiy told the media in a WhatsApp chat that Kyiv was committed to continuing talks on how to end the war triggered by Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion and he was ready to meet Putin in any format.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he and Zelenskiy were "maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although "thorny" territorial issues lingered. He was more cautious than Zelenskiy on security guarantees, but said they were 95% of the way to such an agreement and that he expected European countries to "take over a big part" of that effort with U.S. backing.

On Tuesday, Russia said its negotiating stance would toughen after it accused Kyiv of attacking one of Putin's Russian presidential residences - an allegation that Kyiv said was baseless and intended to scuttle arduous peace talks.

Zelenskiy said in his WhatsApp chat that a U.S. troop presence in Ukraine would be a major security boost for Kyiv.

"Of course, we are discussing this with President Trump and with representatives of the (Western) coalition (supporting Kyiv). We want this. We would like this. This would be a strong position of the security guarantees," he said.

The White House had no comment on the issue of dispatching U.S. troops to Ukraine under any peace settlement with Russia.

Zelenskiy said he was willing to meet Putin despite the deep lack of mutual trust he underlined on Monday.

"I told President Trump, European leaders I am ready for any format of meeting with Putin. I am not afraid of any format ... The main thing is for Russians not to be afraid."

Russia said on Monday Kyiv had targeted a presidential residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones, all of which it said it had intercepted.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the alleged attack as "state terrorism" and said Moscow had already identified targets for retaliatory strikes in Ukraine.

The Kremlin provided no physical evidence of the alleged incident, saying it would retaliate and review its negotiating stance but would not quit talks on a possible peace deal.

Zelenskiy said earlier on Tuesday: "This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies."

In Paris, a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said there was no substance to corroborate Moscow's accusation of an attack on Putin’s residence.

"Ukraine and its partners are committed to a path of peace, while Russia has chosen to continue and intensify its war against Ukraine. This is in itself an act of defiance against President Trump's peace agenda," the source said.

The White House declined further comment on the reported attack on Putin's residence after Zelenskiy said he brought it up with Trump, who on Monday said he was informed of the matter by Putin and was angry about it. Asked if there was evidence of such an attack, Trump said, "We'll find out."

In Warsaw, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday peace could be achieved in Ukraine within weeks thanks to U.S. security guarantees although success remained "far from 100% certain".

Tusk also hinted at the possibility of U.S. troops being sent to the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia, but he gave no details of such a proposal and the White House did not immediately comment on his remarks.

Tusk, whose country is one of Kyiv's closest Western allies, underlined the need for movement on territorial issues. Russia had demanded Ukrainian forces withdraw from the last part of the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine that they still hold nearly four years after Russia's invasion. Kyiv wants fighting halted along current front lines.

Amid the intensifying peace diplomacy, Russia launched more waves of drones against port infrastructure and civilian ships in Ukraine's Odesa region on Tuesday, Ukrainian navy and government officials said.

Odesa and the wider region nearby are home to the Black Sea ports that are crucial for Ukraine's foreign trade and the survival of its wartime economy.

In the past several months, maritime warfare between Ukraine and Russia has intensified. Both sides have attacked naval and commercial assets in the Black Sea and beyond.

Ukraine is increasingly using its sea drones for attacks on ships connected to Russia’s sanctions-busting shadow fleet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CYSOHZ7XKZPWNK3TUM77ZDUMJI.jpg?auth=41a3d03035d4c141280cc48ebb2b52a67f924bccc5e3af030ce6d74b5e2ee3f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thieves drill into German bank vault and make off with millions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/thieves-drill-into-german-bank-vault-make-off-with-millions-2025-12-30/</link><description>BERLIN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Thieves used the quiet Christmas period to drill their way into the vault of a German retail bank and make off with at least 10 million euros' worth of money and valuables from customers' deposit boxes, police said on Tuesday.

The perpetrators drilled through a thick concrete wall at a branch of Sparkasse bank in the western city of Gelsenkirchen and then broke into several thousand safe deposit boxes and stole a sum estimated in the double-digit millions of euros, the police said in a statement.

Most shops and banks close in Germany over the Christmas period starting from the evening of December 24, and police only discovered the hole after a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday, December 29.

Dozens of angry customers gathered in front of the bank on Tuesday loudly chanting "Let us in!".

"I couldn't sleep last night. We're getting no information," one man told the Welt broadcaster as he waited outside the branch, adding that he had been using the safe for 25 years and that it contained his savings for old age.

Another man said he used his deposit box to store cash and jewellery for his family.

A spokesperson for the Sparkasse bank in Gelsenkirchen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Police said witnesses have reported that they saw several men on Saturday night carrying large bags in the stairwell of an adjacent parking garage.

There were also reports of a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage early on Monday morning with masked men inside. The vehicle's licence plate was that of a car stolen in Hanover, more than 200 kilometres to the northeast of Gelsenkirchen, police said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FNHIFKWLSNOS5NM5MU4NXYTEFM.jpg?auth=931def1bf922e267777e1c57e72e6aca860e437a5bcf9f75e02a16530c760a8c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico train derailment piles pressure on Sheinbaum over safety of megaprojects</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-train-derailment-piles-pressure-sheinbaum-over-safety-megaprojects-2025-12-30/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum deferred questions on Tuesday about the record of a passenger train that derailed over the weekend, killing 13 people and injuring 98 others, the latest in a series of accidents that have put pressure on her government to improve the safety of flagship projects.

The conductor of the train, who survived, has been taken in for questioning, and opposition lawmakers have called for an investigation.

"The prosecutor's office has already interviewed the operator and several other people - they will have to report what happens next," Sheinbaum said at her regular press conference on Tuesday.

The crash in the southern state of Oaxaca marks the third train accident this year in Mexico. The new tourist-focused Mayan Train in the Yucatan Peninsula has suffered two derailments. No one was killed in those accidents.

Mexico's military operates both the Mayan Train and the Interoceanic Train that derailed on Sunday, which has led some to question both its role and what the Sheinbaum government is doing to deliver safety on flagship infrastructure projects.

"The government should be very concerned with the safety record and go to great lengths to determine the cause of the derailment," said Gustavo Flores-Macias, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.

Survivors told local news outlets that Sunday's crash happened as the train rounded a curve. It occurred on the Interoceanic Railway of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a narrow stretch of land connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

The railway forms part of a trade and transit project known as the Interoceanic Corridor, which was launched in 2023 by Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, with the aim of creating an alternative to the Panama Canal.

But the project has faced multiple allegations of corruption, weak oversight and potential conflicts of interest.

Mexico's federal audit office reported irregularities in four Interoceanic Train construction contracts, including overpayment for materials, in a 2020 report.

Following Sunday's crash, local media outlets also reported that companies linked to associates of Lopez Obrador's sons may have benefited from government contracts tied to major infrastructure projects, including the Interoceanic Train.

Lopez Obrador has denied the accusations, calling them politically motivated.

Opposition lawmakers called for an independent investigation into the accident. Alejandro Moreno, leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), urged the government to suspend all projects linked to the former president's sons and their business partners.

Senator Mario Vazquez of the opposition National Action Party (PAN) called the derailment "criminal negligence."

The accident risks denting confidence in Sheinbaum's broader infrastructure agenda, said Antonio Ocaranza, a Mexican political consultant.

"The discussion surrounding this accident could trigger a broader and more damaging conversation about other projects," Ocaranza said, highlighting the Mayan Train and the Olmeca refinery , both megaprojects with ballooning budgets.

"If these accidents become more frequent and the causes are deemed unreliable, there will be increased public scrutiny and a higher cost to the government," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MLPUUCUJFRM25KHBLMQNHLSAKM.jpg?auth=a67911477701fdd1172c819aced4cf706d55af68a5d4fba88a1205161dcf7032&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro undergoes new procedure to treat hiccups</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-undergoes-new-procedure-treat-hiccups-2025-12-30/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was undergoing an unscheduled procedure on Tuesday to treat persistent hiccups, his wife Michelle said on social media.

Monday's lawsuit , opens new tab marked the latest in a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to challenge state laws that extend tuition and financial aid benefits to non-citizens living in their states regardless of their immigration status.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges if they can establish they reside in the state.

Supporters of the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 by then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, argued it would remove financial barriers that had limited the ability of immigrant students in the state to pursue higher education like other Virginia residents.

The Justice Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.

The lawsuit cites the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which restricts states' ability to grant immigrants in the country illegally certain postsecondary education benefits.

"This is a simple matter of federal law: in Virginia and nationwide, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens," U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. "This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country."

The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar "tuition equity" laws and policies that allow certain students who graduated from high schools in their states to pay in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.

Texas and Oklahoma, both led by Republican governors, quickly settled by agreeing to consent decrees blocking enforcement of their state laws.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CECJ53VF3FOLPAD36EQ2BS36C4.jpg?auth=ccbbf6a01a72c88cb50f4453d481a6397e2ae6949aaaa95e24f715e33dd3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen strike shows depth of distrust between Saudi Arabia and UAE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemen-strike-shows-depth-distrust-between-saudi-arabia-uae-2025-12-30/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The withdrawal of Emirati forces from Yemen following a Saudi airstrike may help defuse a confrontation between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, but the incident has exposed simmering distrust between two Gulf oil powers with long-running differences.

The airstrike by a Saudi-led coalition early on Tuesday on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla was followed by calls on all UAE forces to leave Yemen, and a statement from Riyadh that its national security was a red line.

The UAE said it was surprised by the strike, shortly before announcing that it was pulling its remaining forces from Yemen for their safety.

The crisis, precipitated by the surprise advance of UAE-backed separatists through southern Yemen in early December, brings to the surface years of divisions between the two Gulf heavyweights on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

A Gulf source familiar with Saudi thinking told Reuters that the escalation had been triggered by a misperception resulting from talks in Washington in November between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and U.S. President Donald Trump about the war in Sudan.

High-level talks including phone calls between Saudi Arabia and the UAE had taken place since December though they had not yet yielded results on the ground, the source said.

Any further conflagration between Saudi Arabia and the UAE would bode ill for the financially powerful Gulf, which prides itself on being an island of stability in a turbulent Middle East. Disagreements between Saudi Arabia and the UAE could hamper consensus on oil output decisions. The two are preparing for a virtual meeting with other OPEC+ members on Sunday.

"Relations between the two states are never easy, but the friction does appear to be at its most intense for years," said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow at think tank Chatham House.

Following their sudden advance in early December, the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces now hold large swathes of land in Yemen, including in the strategically important Hadramout province.

The STC had previously been an important part of the coalition fighting alongside the Saudi-backed, internationally-recognized government against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which holds Yemen's capital Sanaa and the heavily populated northwest.

Their sweep through the south brought the STC within reach of Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia, in an area to which many prominent Saudis trace their origins, lending it cultural and historical significance for them.

It also put Saudi Arabia and the UAE on opposing sides of a smouldering civil war that erupted in Yemen in 2014.

Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have publicly said they are in talks with Yemeni groups to try and bring the situation under control, but the coalition has now carried out airstrikes in the province twice in the last few days.

The STC has been rejecting calls by the Saudi coalition for its forces to withdraw from the areas it seized, saying it will continue securing Hadramout and Mahra province to its east.

In a statement on the strike in Mukalla, the UAE said it had tried to de-escalate since the STC's advance and denied being behind any operations that would undermine Saudi security or target its borders.

"Both countries like to play down friction in the relationship and argue that competition amongst states is a normal state of affairs," said Quilliam. "But the intensity of the competition has certainly sharpened in the past year and is playing out in multiple theatres."

One such place is Sudan, a country engulfed in civil war and one of the world's worst humanitarian crises since April 2023.

The Quad, which groups Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the U.S. and the UAE, has led diplomacy on the conflict, but the war has raged on.

Sudan is a sensitive issue for the UAE. U.N. experts and members of the U.S. Congress have accused the country of sponsoring Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are fighting the Sudanese army. The UAE denies backing either side.

Trump and the Saudi Crown Prince discussed Sudan at the November meeting in Washington.

The Gulf source said the UAE leadership was angered as they had been "misinformed" that during the November meeting the Saudi Crown Prince had not just asked for further sanctions against the RSF, but also for more direct sanctions against the UAE for its alleged support to the group.

The misperception led to the escalation in Yemen, the source said.

The UAE foreign ministry did not confirm or deny this account and referred Reuters to an earlier statement issued on Friday in which the UAE had welcomed Saudi Arabia's efforts to support security and stability in Yemen and said it also remained committed to backing stability in the country.

Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the UAE president, said on Saturday in a post on X that dialogue and political solutions that preserve friendships and alliances were essential in what he called a "critical stage". He did not clearly reference Yemen or Saudi Arabia in his remarks.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked about the issue.

The Gulf has witnessed instability in the past.

In 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Oman and Egypt choked off Qatar's economy with a boycott, accusing it of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denied.

The latest flare-up appears unlikely to spur a repeat of the Qatar crisis.

"We do have differences over Yemen 100%, and the difference has gone to a higher level with current escalation," said Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, an Emirati academic.

"Allies clash ... But they mend their differences and build on what they have in common."</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:17:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/37CKWWVHZBOFPF5VX7GUF4SIEM.jpg?auth=f7889bd00b17bf6a03761c06ea2a974f89edb5add0113916b36c965b8dda8677&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Oil tankers still arriving in Venezuela despite US blockade, data shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-tankers-still-arriving-venezuela-despite-us-blockade-data-shows-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - At least two oil tankers have made their way to Venezuela in recent days and others are navigating towards the country, a sign of state-run PDVSA's effort to expand floating storage and keep selling crude even as a U.S. blockade has reduced exports to a minimum.

U.S. President Donald Trump this month announced a blockade of all sanctioned vessels going in or out of Venezuelan waters as part of a strategy to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The U.S. move has cut oil exports this month to about half of their November level.

The U.S. has seized two fully loaded cargoes of Venezuelan oil and its ships are patrolling the Caribbean Sea. The pressure has scared many vessel owners, prompting re-routings and u-turns. Only a fraction of ships have kept on course to the OPEC country.

Some tanker owners have insisted. At least two ships under sanctions have arrived in Venezuela over the last few days and two more that are not under sanctions are approaching its coast, according to monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.

As part of swaps and arrangements made since the country was first placed under U.S. energy sanctions in 2019, Maduro's administration pays for a long list of purchases and services with oil, including debt service to China.

The two vessels approaching Venezuela are part of a fleet used by China and Venezuela to pay debt service with crude bound for Chinese ports. It was unclear whether China will press for a U.S. waiver to secure delivery of those cargoes.

PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment. Venezuela's oil ministry and Maduro have said oil exports will continue.

PDVSA has been negotiating price discounts and contract changes with customers this month to avoid cargo returns or crude production cut-backs. But many buyers are growing impatient as there are no real alternatives to get oil cargoes out of the country, even in non-sanctioned tankers, company sources said.

A cyberattack forced PDVSA to shut down its centralized administrative system this month. The company is now delivering cargoes at its ports at a slower pace, both to fulfill loading windows for export and to store crude and fuel in ships, expanding its storage capacity.

The only loaded vessels departing are Chevron's tankers, which continue setting sail for the U.S. under Washington's authorization, and small ships carrying oil byproducts and petrochemicals, shipping data and PDVSA documents showed.

A similar situation in 2020, when Washington ramped up pressure on Maduro by imposing sanctions on PDVSA's main trading partners, forced the country to switch to little-known intermediaries to keep selling its oil to Chinese buyers.

Those U.S. measures triggered oil output cuts, oilfield shutdowns and severe scarcity of motor fuel. It took Venezuela years to reach 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of output again, recover some refining capacity and stabilize exports.

As of this week, almost two dozen tankers were visible from shore near the Jose port waiting for loading windows or for departure instructions. The volume of oil stuck in undeparted tankers increased to some 16 million barrels, from 11 million barrels in mid-December, according to the data and documents.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:17:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L4THJSUB6FKTTBTJME3URXEE3U.jpg?auth=a7bb3d87f6ad4126d219cc50b274ef4207b6a175f442fedaf79ff55eab3da616&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US NATO envoy casts doubt on Russian claim that Ukraine attacked Putin’s residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-nato-envoy-casts-doubt-russian-claim-that-ukraine-attacked-putins-residence-2025-12-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - U.S. ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker cast doubt on Tuesday on Russia’s accusation that Ukraine attacked President Vladimir Putin’s residence, saying he wants to see U.S. intelligence on the incident.

"It is unclear whether it actually happened," Whitaker told Fox Business "Varney &amp; Co." in an interview about an alleged incident which Ukraine has denied.

"It seems to me a little indelicate to be this close at a peace deal, Ukraine really wanting to get a peace deal done, and then to do something that would be viewed as reckless or not helpful," he said.

Russia said on Monday that Ukraine had attacked a presidential residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones. It said it would retaliate and that its negotiating stance would toughen in the talks.

Ukraine called Russia's accusations "lies" aimed at justifying more attacks on Ukraine, and its foreign minister said on Tuesday that Russia had not provided any evidence "because there's none."

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Putin told him in a phone call that Ukraine tried to attack the residence. Trump said he was "very angry" about it. Asked if there was evidence of such an attack, Trump said, "We'll find out."

The White House declined further comment on the alleged incident, while officials from the U.S. intelligence community have been close-lipped about the incident. The CIA declined to comment.

"We're going to get to the bottom of the intelligence. And for me, the most important thing is what the United States and our allies' intelligence services say about whether or not this attack actually happened," Whitaker said.

After a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Florida on Sunday, Trump said he and Zelenskiy were "maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although the most contentious territorial issues lingered.

Zelenskiy said earlier on Tuesday : "This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies."

A three-judge panel of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at the administration's request put on hold , opens new tab an injunction issued by a lower-court judge who barred the law from being enforced in 22 states and the District of Columbia.

It marked the latest instance of the appeals court lifting an order by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani preventing the law from being implemented, after the 1st Circuit on December 12 overturned a ruling she issued in another case brought by Planned Parenthood declaring the law unconstitutional.

A provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by the Republican-led Congress, bars Medicaid funding for tax-exempt organizations that provide family planning and reproductive health services if they perform abortions and received more than $800,000 in Medicaid funds during the 2023 fiscal year.

Planned Parenthood says the law was passed with it in mind and is already having devastating effects, resulting in at least 20 of its health centers closing since Trump signed the measure into law in July.

After the 1st Circuit earlier this year paused Talwani's initial injunction in Planned Parenthood's favor, a group of Democratic state attorneys general asked her to block the law's enforcement again but on different grounds.

The judge, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, agreed to do so on December 2 , saying the states were likely to succeed in establishing that the law constitutes an unconstitutional retroactive condition on their participation in the Medicaid healthcare program.

But Tuesday's 1st Circuit panel, comprised only of judges appointed by Democratic presidents, said the Trump administration had demonstrated it was likely to prevail on the merits when its appeal is ultimately heard.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 22:21:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBJACYTI5BL5XEPY5ZGCFPXBJQ.jpg?auth=883bda5d4dbea185bac2804f20f2edeb1cac5556e56978f87b2d46abce2fdead&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz tells Europe to assert itself to safeguard peace, prosperity</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/germanys-merz-tells-europe-assert-itself-safeguard-peace-prosperity-2025-12-30/</link><description>BERLIN, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Europe must assert its interests more strongly to ensure peace and prosperity in 2026 amid challenges from Russian aggression, global protectionism and changing ties with the U.S., German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in his annual address.

Since taking office in May, Merz has helped spearhead European efforts to support Ukraine against Russia's invasion. Berlin has also ramped up defence spending since 2023 in a bid to show it is ready to assume more responsibility.

In his New Year's speech, Merz pulled no punches, saying the "terrible" war raging on Europe's doorstep posed a direct threat to continental freedom and security.

"We are seeing more and more clearly that Russia’s aggression was and is part of a plan targeted against the whole of Europe," said Merz, adding that Germany faced sabotage, espionage and cyberattacks on a daily basis.

He said a further challenge came from protectionism in the global economy, and that Europe's dependence on imported raw materials was increasingly being wielded as a political lever against it.

Struggling to revive its export-oriented economy , Germany is trying to reduce reliance on China as it also grapples with global trade tensions and the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump 's trade tariff policies.

Europe's biggest economy has also been hit by what many economists say has been a lack of domestic reform and investment in recent years, and is expected to grow only modestly this year after two years of contraction.

Merz also addressed a more difficult partnership with the United States, long the reliable guarantor of German and European security, since Trump returned to the White House in January 2025.

"For us Europeans, this means that we must defend and assert our interests much more strongly by ourselves," said Merz.

However, he said Europe must be guided by confidence, not fear, and must take matters into its own hands.

"This can be a decisive year for our country and for Europe. It can be a year in which Germany and Europe, with new strength, reconnect with decades of peace, freedom and prosperity."</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:20:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BWQBPRB7WZKUJE6GUTOFZXASCU.jpg?auth=be98dcf0a7c92b5b3418ad2e086b6a52b8f94ce2459da49933d3ea9c52024155&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea coup leader Doumbouya wins presidential election, results show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-coup-leader-doumbouya-wins-presidential-election-provisional-results-show-2025-12-30/</link><description>CONAKRY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Guinea coup leader Mamady Doumbouya has been elected president, according to provisional results announced on Tuesday, completing the return to civilian rule in the bauxite- and iron ore-rich West African nation.

The former special forces commander , thought to be in his early 40s, seized power in 2021, toppling then-President Alpha Conde, who had been in office since 2010. It was one in a series of nine coups that have reshaped politics in West and Central Africa since 2020.

The provisional results announced on Tuesday showed Doumbouya winning 86.72% of the December 28 vote, an absolute majority that allows him to avoid a runoff.

The Supreme Court has eight days to validate the results in the event of any challenge.

Doumbouya's victory, which gives him a seven-year mandate, was widely expected. Conde and Cellou Dalein Diallo, Guinea's longtime opposition leader, are in exile, which left Doumbouya to face a fragmented field of eight challengers .

The original post-coup charter in Guinea barred junta members from running in elections, but a constitution dropping those restrictions was passed in a September referendum.

Djenabou Toure, the country's top election official who announced the results on Tuesday night, said turnout was 80,95%. However voter participation appeared tepid in the capital Conakry, and opposition politicians rejected a similarly high turnout figure for the September referendum.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou, officially launched last month after years of delay.

Doumbouya has claimed credit for pushing the project forward and ensuring Guinea benefits from its output.

His government this year also revoked the licence of Emirates Global Aluminium's subsidiary Guinea Alumina Corporation following a refinery dispute, transferring the unit's assets to a state-owned firm.

The turn toward resource nationalism - echoed in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger - has boosted his popularity, as has his relative youth in a country where the median age is about 19.

Political debate has been muted under Doumbouya. Civil society groups accuse his government of banning protests, curbing press freedom and restricting opposition activity.

The campaign period was "severely restricted, marked by intimidation of opposition actors, apparently politically motivated enforced disappearances, and constraints on media freedom," U.N. rights chief Volker Turk said last week.

On Monday, opposition candidate Faya Lansana Millimono told a press conference the election was marred by "systematic fraudulent practices" and that observers were prevented from monitoring the voting and counting processes.

The government did not respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/73B43QSNTNJSTP3WAUASZ5YNYE.jpg?auth=b730cc1cbdef69831b2dc9802ba055fab4d732c7141c0b1fc4a5916571625b94&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria arrests suspects in Latakia after sectarian violence, curfew imposed</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251230-syria-arrests-latakia-sectarian-violence-curfew-imposed</link><description>Authorities in Syria ’s Latakia province arrested 21 people allegedly linked to former president Bashar al-Assad ’s rule on Tuesday, state media said, as a curfew blanketed the provincial capital following sectarian violence the previous night.

Monday’s attacks in predominantly Alawite neighbourhoods of Latakia city came after three people, including a member of the security forces, were killed a day earlier, as thousands protested in the minority community’s coastal heartland over a deadly mosque bombing .

State television said security forces in coastal Latakia province arrested 21 “former regime remnants who are involved in criminal acts , sectarian incitement and targeting internal security forces”.

The report followed the imposition of an overnight curfew until 6:00 am (0300 GMT) on Wednesday in Latakia, a mixed city in Syria’s Alawite coastal heartland that also includes several Sunni -majority neighbourhoods.

AFP correspondents saw residents cleaning up on Tuesday after the previous night’s attacks, during which cars were damaged and shops vandalised.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a young Alawite man was shot dead during the unrest “after being chased” by several men.

Syrian authorities said on Monday that security forces had reinforced their deployment in Latakia.

Interior ministry spokesman Noureddine al-Baba said on Tuesday that Syria rejected “any acts of sabotage or attacks that affect the dignity of citizens or their property”, adding that the necessary legal measures would be taken against those responsible.

Since the ousting of Assad, himself an Alawite, in December last year, the minority group has been the target of repeated attacks.

A bombing at a mosque in a predominantly Alawite area of the central Syrian city of Homs on Friday killed eight people.

The Saraya Ansar al-Sunna Islamist militant group, which analysts say acts as a front for Islamic State (IS) jihadists, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Hundreds of Alawites were killed in sectarian massacres in the community’s coastal heartland in March.

Despite assurances from Damascus that all of Syria’s communities will be protected, the country’s minorities remain wary about their future under the new authorities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:41:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8cf8e87a-e5d0-11f0-b377-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362549274415.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine drone attack damages port, gas pipeline in Tuapse, Russia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-drone-attack-damages-port-gas-pipeline-tuapse-russia-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian drone attack damaged port infrastructure and a gas pipeline in a residential area in Russia's Black Sea port of Tuapse, the regional administration said on Wednesday, adding no injuries were reported.

Emergency crews were dispatched to repair the damage, the operational headquarters of the Krasnodar region said on the Telegram messaging app. The port's berth had been damaged, it added.

SHOT, a Telegram news channel with sources in Russia's security services, said a series of explosions was heard over Tuapse late on Tuesday and that residents in one district reported a fire.

Several Ukrainian media, including the RBC-Ukraine media outlet, posted photos on Telegram appearing to show a large fire burning in the distance at night, with a communications mast silhouetted in the foreground.

There was no immediate official comment from Ukraine about the attack. Reuters could not independently verify the report or the extent of the damage.

Tuapse is one of Russia’s key Black Sea outlets for oil products, anchored by Rosneft’s (ROSN.MM) , opens new tab export-oriented Tuapse refinery, which has capacity to process about 240,000 barrels per day and supplies products such as naphtha, fuel oil and diesel.

The port and the refinery have been hit repeatedly by Ukrainian drone attacks during the war that Russia launched nearly four years ago, with past strikes reported to have sparked fires and at times disrupted operations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US government audits cases of Somali US citizens for potential denaturalization</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-government-audits-cases-somali-us-citizens-potential-denaturalization-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration said on Tuesday it was auditing immigration cases involving U.S. citizens of Somali origin to detect fraud that could lead to denaturalization, or revocation of citizenship.

"Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization," Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that was first reported by Fox News and reposted by the White House on social media.
Denaturalization cases are rare and can take years. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, about 11 cases were pursued per year between 1990 and 2017.

Since taking office in January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy , opens new tab involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards , and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups widely condemn Trump's policies, saying they curb rights like due process and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies aim to improve domestic security.

Federal officials in recent weeks have portrayed Minnesota's Somali community as a hotspot for fraud involving millions of federal dollars intended for social services. Immigrant-rights advocates say the administration is using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target Somali immigrants more broadly.

FBI Director Kash Patel said on Sunday the bureau has "surged" investigative resources and personnel to Minnesota in the latest instance of the Trump administration's fraud investigations that have targeted the state's Somali immigrants.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services separately said on Tuesday it has frozen all child care payments to Minnesota. It said that going forward all payments from the department's Administration for Children and Families nationwide "will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state."

In response, Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz said his state government has "spent years cracking down on fraudsters" and that Trump was "politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXQ3ZA2UJZPXVLYDCQFMO47H2Q.jpg?auth=c5d259f2c3df010d40e4f97e347ca2c14c49c235b67462124e598f28e8531a69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Head-on train crash near Peru's Machu Picchu kills driver, injures dozens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/head-on-train-crash-near-perus-machu-picchu-kills-driver-injures-dozens-2025-12-30/</link><description>LIMA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - A train driver was killed and 40 more people were injured on Tuesday after two trains collided head-on on the railway leading to the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, the Andean nation's top tourist site that draws well over 1 million visitors each year.

Police are investigating the collision between trains operated by Inca Rail S.A. and PeruRail S.A., which mainly transport tourists to the iconic site. A health official said about 20 people were in relatively serious condition.

A police officer added that foreign tourists were among the injured.

"China's military exercises around Taiwan this week increase cross-strait tensions and the risk of escalation," a foreign office spokesperson said in a statement.

"We consider the Taiwan issue one to be settled peacefully by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion. We do not support any unilateral attempts to change the status quo or any activity that risks destabilising it."

"We continue to call for restraint and the avoidance of any further actions that risk undermining peace and stability."

Russia's air defence units destroyed a total of 27 Ukrainian drones in the three-hour period starting at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT), including three over the Moscow region, the Russian defence ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.

Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, said on Telegram that 21 Ukrainian drones were downed during the day over the region. One civilian person was injured as a result of the attack.

The reported attacks came a day after Russia accused Ukraine, without providing evidence, of trying to attack President Vladimir Putin’s residence .

Kyiv dismissed the allegations as baseless and aimed at derailing peace talks in the war that Russia launched against Ukraine nearly four years ago.

There were no immediate reports of damage from the strikes. Russia rarely discloses the full extent of damage from Ukrainian attacks unless civilians or civilian infrastructure are affected.

Separately, a power outage hit a town outside Moscow after a technical fault at a regional power facility, RIA reported, citing power authorities.

The SHOT Telegram news channel, which has sources among Russia's security services, said about 100,000 residents were affected.

There was no immediate evidence the outage was linked to Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine targets Moscow with drones, Russia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-moscow-with-drones-russia-says-2025-12-30/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Guinea coup leader Doumbouya elected president in provisional results</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251231-guinea-coup-leader-doumbouya-elected-president</link><description>Guinea coup leader Mamady Doumbouya has been elected president, according to provisional results announced on Tuesday, completing the return to civilian rule in the bauxite- and iron ore-rich West African nation.

Sassou Nguesso led the small, oil-rich country under a one-party system from 1979 to 1992, before Pascal Lissouba defeated him in the country’s first democratic election . He returned to power in 1997 after a civil war that ousted Lissouba and has ruled ever since.

The Congolese Labour Party (PCT) said it had endorsed Sassou Nguesso as its candidate following a three-day congress, according to congress rapporteur Antoinette Kebi.

“The president is being elevated to the rank of the ‘very great comrade’ of the party,” Kebi said.

More than 3,000 people attended the PCT conference, although the president himself was not present.

The election is due to take place on March 22, 2026. Members of the military will vote five days earlier so that soldiers can maintain public order on polling day — a measure used in previous elections.

After winning elections in 2002 and 2009, Sassou Nguesso secured further terms in 2016 and 2021 following a constitutional change in 2015 that removed the original age limit of 70 and increased the number of five-year terms to three.

In April 2023, three opposition parties joined forces to form the “Alliance for Democratic Change in 2026”, aiming to overhaul the country’s electoral oversight bodies.

The alliance brings together the Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD), founded by former Marxist-Leninist president Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, the Republicans’ Movement (MR) and the People’s Party (PAPE).</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:46:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/191997e0-e5d7-11f0-b64f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25267812730611.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>MH370 search resumes in Indian Ocean nearly 12 years after plane's disappearance</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251230-mh370-search-resumes-in-indian-ocean-years-after-plane-disappearance</link><description>Nearly 12 years after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished with 239 people on board, the search for answers to one of aviation ’s most haunting riddles resumed on Tuesday in the remote southern Indian Ocean.

Armed with cutting-edge deep-sea robots and refined data analysis, US investigators are scouring the seabed for clues that have eluded governments, experts and grieving families for more than a decade.

MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur just after midnight on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing on what should have been an uneventful six-hour flight.

Less than an hour later, its transponder went dark, wiping the Boeing 777 from civilian radar. Military screens later showed the aircraft veering sharply west, crossing back over Malaysia before heading south over the vast Indian Ocean .

What followed was the most ambitious and costly search in aviation history, as multinational teams combed more than 46,000 square miles (120,000 square kilometres) of seabed off Western Australia with ships, aircraft and sonar.

They found nothing.

The hunt was called off in 2017, leaving families with heartbreak and a mystery that spawned theories ranging from hijacking to deliberate pilot action.

Now, the Malaysian government has given the green light for a fresh attempt led by Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity under a “no find, no fee” contract, according to a statement from Malaysia’s transport ministry.

“The latest development underscores the government of Malaysia’s commitment in providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,” it said.

The company will pocket $70 million only if it locates the wreck, reports said.

This new phase, expected to last up to 55 days, targets a tighter search zone of about 5,800 square miles — far smaller than earlier efforts and pinpointed using updated satellite data, drift modelling and expert analysis.

Ocean Infinity is deploying autonomous underwater vehicles that can dive nearly 19,700 feet (6,000 metres) and remain submerged for days at a time.

The drones use high-resolution side-scan sonar, ultrasound imaging and magnetometers to map the seabed in 3D, detect buried debris and pick up traces of metal. If something promising appears, remotely operated vehicles can descend for close inspection.

Ocean Infinity, which also has a control centre in Britain, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018 before agreeing to launch a new search this year. AFP contacted the company for comment, but there was no immediate response.

Only fragments of MH370 have ever been recovered. Since 2015, fewer than 30 pieces believed to be from the aircraft — including parts of the wing, landing gear and fuselage — have washed ashore thousands of kilometres apart, from Réunion to Mozambique .

No bodies have ever been found.

Malaysia’s official probe concluded in 2018 that the plane was likely deliberately diverted from its course, but stopped short of assigning responsibility.

Relatives from China, Australia, Europe and beyond have fought for years to keep the hunt alive, arguing that closure matters not only for the dead but for global aviation safety.

Governments in Beijing and Canberra have welcomed Malaysia’s decision, pledging support for any practical effort to crack the case.

Chinese national Jiang Hui, who lost his 72-year-old mother Jiang Cuiyun in the disaster, told AFP earlier this month that he remains determined to find answers, despite frustration with the authorities.

“Finding the plane, finding my loved one, and finding the truth — I believe this is something I must do in my life,” he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:46:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fa9c533e-e572-11f0-9695-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-6077310146953b7e3bc5a47-37745953.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan stays on high alert as Chinese ships pull back after massive drills</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-stays-high-alert-chinese-ships-pull-back-after-massive-drills-2025-12-31/</link><description>TAIPEI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan stayed on high alert on Wednesday after China staged massive military drills around the island the previous day, keeping its emergency maritime response centre running, the head of the island's coast guard said.

The exercises named "Justice Mission 2025" saw China fire dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deploy a large number of warships and aircraft near the island, in a show of force that drew concern from Western allies including the European Commission and Britain .

Taipei condemned the drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation.

Chinese ships were moving away from Taiwan but Beijing had yet to formally declare the end of the exercises, according to Kuan Bi-ling, head of Taiwan's Ocean Affairs Council.

"The maritime situation has calmed down, with ships and vessels gradually departing. As China has not announced the conclusion of the military exercises, the emergency response centre remains operational," she said in a post on Facebook late on Tuesday.

A Taiwan coast guard official told Reuters all 11 Chinese coast guard ships had left waters near Taiwan and were continuing to move away. A Taiwan security official said emergency response centres for the military and coast guard stayed active.

Taiwan's defence ministry on Wednesday said 77 Chinese military aircraft and 25 navy and coast guard vessels had been operating around the island in the past 24 hours.

Among them, 35 military planes had crossed the Taiwan Strait median line that separates the two sides, it added.

The drills, China's most extensive war games by coverage area to date, forced Taiwan to cancel dozens of domestic flights and dispatch jets and warships to monitor. Soldiers were seen running rapid-response drills including putting up barricades at various locations.

China's state news agency Xinhua published an article summarising "three key takeaways" from the drills, which began 11 days after the United States announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan.

The simulated "encirclement" demonstrated the People's Liberation Army's ability to "press and contain separatist forces while denying access to external interference – an approach summarised as 'sealing internally and blocking externally'," the article said, citing Zhang Chi, a professor at the PLA National Defence University.

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out using force to take it under Chinese control.

"A woman's IQ is zero when in love," it states on its second page. "As long as the emotions are in place, the client's money will naturally follow."

A second handbook, seized during another law enforcement operation in the country and reviewed by Reuters, gives tips in English and Chinese about how to conduct romance scams.

Together, they provide a window into the psychological techniques criminal gangs use to beguile a victim into believing they are in a romantic relationship, before duping them into fraudulent investments.

This kind of fraud is known as "pig-butchering" because the gangs say targets are led like hapless pigs to slaughter. It is among the most prevalent scams today, according to the FBI.

In a series of stories this year, Reuters documented how these "pig-butchering" scams are often carried out by victims of human trafficking , opens new tab , who are forced to work in industrial-scale scam compounds in Southeast Asia run by Chinese-led gangs. Such cyberfraud has been supercharged by artificial intelligence , opens new tab , which allows scammers to deploy sophisticated tools to make their fraudulent appeals for money more deceptive, the series revealed.

The two manuals, the contents of which Reuters is reporting exclusively, show that gangs have developed detailed guidance for creating fake personas to lure their targets, as well as strategies to handle a victim if they suspect a ruse.

The authenticity of both handbooks was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission in the Philippines, who said they were recovered from two compounds raided last year in the north of the capital, Manila.

The Chinese manual outlines a seven-day plan to defraud women in China by convincing them to invest in crude oil via a fake platform. It refers to targets as "clients" and the theft as a "sale."

The bilingual handbook targets men. It does not explicitly say how money will be extracted from victims, but suggests the fraudster discuss cryptocurrency with the target.

The first handbook, which is nine pages long, was found in a compound built on land partially owned by a Chinese-born woman named Alice Guo, the PAOCC said.

Authorities also found mobile phones allegedly used for pig-butchering fraud, as well as several hundred people "involved in scams" at the compound. Many of them were trafficking victims, PAOCC said.

Guo is serving a life sentence after being convicted in November of human trafficking. Her lawyer did not respond to questions about the manual and the activities carried out in the compound.

Reuters could not establish if either manual was ever used in a scam. However, the methods they outline are consistent with those described to the news agency by two former workers in scamming compounds. One of the workers, who operated out of Myanmar, said he had used a similar manual to carry out a "pig-butchering" scam.

Such scripts were found in at least two other police raids conducted in 2023 and 2024 in the Philippines and Thailand, according to a 2024 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which shares expertise with national law enforcement agencies.

Two experts who reviewed the Chinese-language manual at Reuters' request said it demonstrated complex manipulation techniques. These include isolating and overwhelming with affection a prospective target, who then becomes hooked on the conversations.

The first step of a "pig-butchering" scam involves creating a fake identity.

An elaborate facade can open the door to an emotional connection with a prospective victim, the Chinese manual says on its first page.

Martina Dove, a U.S.-based psychologist who studies scams and reviewed that manual for Reuters, said her research found that romance scammers often impersonated authority figures when targeting female victims, and then used control against them.

That can translate into a scammer pretending to be a skilled professional like a doctor or lawyer, or a senior uniformed figure like a general, she said.

Britain's Barclays Bank has found that men are slightly more likely than women to fall victim to love scams, though women on average lose more than twice as much money. Its conclusion was based on a review of an unspecified number of scams perpetrated on its customers between January 2023 and May 2024.

The fake persona is grounded in foundational details that the Chinese manual recommends remain constant.

Birthday : Taurus Zodiac is recommended as it is considered most compatible with other signs.

Hometown : Match it to the regional accent of the scammer.

Family : Pretend to have been divorced for six years, with a daughter who lives with the ex-wife.

Job : Say you have a managerial position at Chinese state oil company Sinopec but are currently stationed outside the country.

Sinopec did not return a request for comment about whether it was aware of being identified in any scam manuals or if it had received any complaints.

The Chinese-language playbook suggests altering some details to create common ground with the prospective target.

Age: The scammer should pretend to be one or two years older than the victim.

His mother should live near the target, but not so close that they may have overlapping communities.

The final layer brings the fake persona to life. The Chinese manual prompts the scammer to go beyond basic biographical information. Specifics sell the story, it says.

Examples of suggested hobbies and interests in the handbook include swimming, climbing, cooking, reading and traveling.

Lifestyle details that should be memorized include owning a three-bedroom residence and an upmarket sedan.

Once all the details are in place, the scammer is ready to reach out to a target.

The first day's instructions contain a word-for-word script.

"Hello! My name is XXX, nice to meet you!"

The scammer asks questions to gauge whether the target has been previously defrauded and to assess their interest in investments.

Then it's time for the first phone call, which is an opportunity to start building the relationship by sharing "emotional experiences", the manual says.

The Chinese handbook instructs its reader to adapt their approach to the target's personality.

It states: "Middle‑aged women are, in fact, the group carrying the heaviest burden. Husbands often don't listen patiently, and children are too young to understand the intricacies and difficulties within. So, if you want to build a relationship with middle-aged women, chat with them about the trivial matters in life!"

It shows how scammers probe for circumstances – divorce, or an interest in making money quickly – that may make the target more approachable, said Dove.

"Everybody's vulnerable. You just need to meet the right scam at the right time."

There are many paths the scammer could take to grow the connection.

The handbook untangles the possible routes by sorting victims into distinct personalities.

The path forward with a victim who is:

Cold-hearted: The target has a personality that tends to keep others at a distance.

The scammer responds by teasing to push the victim to drop her aloof facade.

Undermine them slightly and then sweet-talk them afterward.

Career-oriented: Independent and satisfied with how far they've come.

Scammer aims to reflect a glowing attitude towards life. Radiates positivity and competence to appear reliable.

Conservative: The victim presents as having more traditional values.

Scammer pushes an alternative path of excitement. Gives the victim an escape from the daily norm.

The way forward can be plotted based on a victim’s upbringing:

Pampered: Spoiled by parents. Intermittent attention teases the victim into seeking out connection.

Rough: Insecure, lacks confidence. Scammer gives clear and structured directions. Scammer also provides daily encouragement and guidance that the victim may have lacked growing up.

Romantic experience

A lot: Mature and independent. Mirrors victim's actions to avoid seeming needy. Lets the victim come to them.

Very little: Fantasize about future relationship. Uses flirty language and compliments the victim daily to draw them in.

For every personality type, the end goal is the same.

Bring the victim closer to the scammer to grow the relationship, the Chinese manual says.

A key part of the con as described in both manuals involves mimicking the target's interests and language, while showering them with attention.

The script in the Chinese manual instructs its reader to send "daily greetings" to show care, and "make the client fall in love" with the persona.

Give the target small tasks to do, so that they begin to take instructions, the manual says.

The bilingual manual has similar prompts:

"How are you this afternoon?"

"Remember to eat on time when you are busy at work."

"I've always loved playing basketball. I’ve always been a Lakers fan but since Kobe left, I've been afraid to watch Lakers games."

Beth Hyland, who was targeted by a love scam in late 2023, said some of the techniques in the manuals, which were shared with her by a reporter, echoed the tactics she fell victim to.

Reuters couldn't independently ascertain if the individual she was scammed by was familiar with either handbook.

The then-52-year-old was online dating for the first time after a divorce when she met "Richard" on Tinder.

A Tinder spokesperson told Reuters it has a zero-tolerance policy for fraud and is "constantly monitoring our platform to detect and remove any suspicious profiles". The spokesperson added that the company uses AI tools to help warn users of potential scams.

Hyland said "Richard" described himself as a French construction project manager and drew her in with compliments and chats about spirituality.

"He knew how to move fast without suffocating me, without coming on too strong," said Hyland.

Within weeks, they were engaged.

Speed is key: the Chinese handbook is intended to enable a scam in as little as seven days. The two former workers in scam compounds told Reuters that they also worked off scripts for seven-day scams.

By the second day, the scammer should be talking about his interest in investments, that manual says. By Day 5, he should try to establish a romantic relationship. And by the seventh, he should have introduced a fake investment platform for the target to put money into.

The bilingual handbook similarly emphasizes that the scammer should quickly enmesh themselves in the target's life.

The reader should drop a target by the end of the third day if the victim is slow to respond, says the 13-page manual, whose title was partially obscured by a waterstain.

"... In short, don't chat awkwardly. Our mission is to share life and work happily with customers."

That manual, which instructs the scammer to pose as a woman, references contacting male targets at certain times of the day in Brazil.

Brazilian Federal Police declined to comment when asked if they were aware of an instruction manual being used to conduct scams on its citizens, citing ongoing investigations.

A lawyer for Cassandra Ong, the registered representative of the compound where the bilingual handbook was found, said he was not aware of the manual's existence. Ong, who is a fugitive from charges of human trafficking, denies the allegations, he said.

The Chinese manual features answers to common questions that may be raised by wary targets, including "why do you like me?"

The answer: “Because I feel good chatting with you, I really cherish this connection.”

Q: Why can't I withdraw the money?

A: Because the platform has a "detection mechanism," frequent withdrawals might attract the attention of customer service.

So, darling, you must listen to me and follow my lead. When the time comes, we'll withdraw the money together.

Q: Why is the account frozen?

A: Why don't you listen to me? Didn't I tell you whether to withdraw or not? Your random operations led to the account being frozen. Quickly contact customer service to see how to resolve it.

The schemes sometimes involve multiple scammers talking to the same target according to the bilingual manual and interviews with the two former scam workers.

That manual directs the scammer to hand over to a senior Chinese worker when the victim starts talking about their finances. The document does not state what role the Chinese national plays, but one of the scam workers said a team leader often took over when a victim was about to transfer funds. He did not specify why.

After about six weeks of conversation, "Richard" duped Hyland into sending him $26,000 via cryptocurrency to pay an emergency travel fee.

As she was on the verge of sending another $50,000 for what she was told was an activation fee to unlock millions of dollars in funds, her financial advisor warned her she was in the depths of a "classic romance fraud".

Once the fraudster moves to extract money, the facade they have built inevitably collapses.

Sometimes the wake-up call comes in the form of a fraud alert from the bank or a warning from a financial advisor.

Sometimes it does not come as a dramatic revelation but a slow and painful recognition, said Rebecca Cole, a social worker and academic specializing in online victimization and romance scams.

"I just remember my heart dropping," Hyland said. "I couldn't wrap my head around it."

Hyland never got her $26,000 back. And to date, she does not know what "Richard’s" real identity was.

Many victims find themselves trapped in a cycle of shame. Some are isolated by their families, said Monica Whitty, a professor at Monash University in Australia who researches cybercrime.

Meanwhile, the scammer moves on.

"Remember not to hang yourself on one tree," the Chinese manual advises its reader, urging them to constantly send messages and look for new targets.

Even as one victim reels from the theft, the scammer leaves a light on for new connections.

The pilot issued multiple radio challenges to the CRV Tan Suo Er Hao seeking to confirm whether it was conducting marine research without Manila's consent, which would violate Philippine and international law, but received no response, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said in a statement.

The 87.25‑metre deep‑sea research vessel, which left China's Hainan province earlier this month and entered the western part of the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone, was then monitored heading east about 55.8 nautical miles off Santa Ana, Cagayan, the PCG said.

Cagayan, the northernmost province of Luzon near Taiwan, hosts one of nine military bases accessible to U.S. forces under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).

On Tuesday, China staged war games around Taiwan, firing rockets into surrounding waters and simulating strikes and blockades in drills dubbed “Justice Mission 2025,” launched days after Washington announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taipei.

The PCG said the Chinese research vessel was detected through Canada's satellite-based Dark Vessel Detection system.

The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 03:28:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Honduras AG warns of legal action over fraught election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-ag-warns-legal-action-over-fraught-election-2025-12-31/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Honduras' Attorney General Johel Zelaya said on Tuesday that legal action would soon be taken to clarify and expose the truth of the events that happened during the Central American nation's fraught electoral process.

She was shocked by what she found.

Her student debt had been double-counted, making it look as though she owed a quarter of a million dollars and putting home ownership out of reach. Jones disputed the items with Experian, one of the major credit reporting agencies, multiple times in writing and over the phone, but got nowhere.

"They kept saying it's been verified, it's been verified…They never investigated. They never tried to remove it," Jones said in an interview.

Eventually, Jones complained to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog created by Congress in 2010 to protect consumers in their financial dealings, helping her lawyers show a judge the lengths she'd gone to mitigate damage to her credit, according to her attorneys, legal papers and a copy of the complaint. That paper trail eventually helped Jones successfully sue Experian to correct her record.

Jones closed on a house purchase in the Memphis suburb of Millington for $300,000 in January.

"If I didn't have this agency to go to, I don't think I'd be in the house right now," said Jones. "It actually changed my life."

Experian and the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment on Jones' case.

In interviews, consumers who had fallen on hard times or known difficulty, lawyers who work with the poor and credit counselors told Reuters the CFPB had been a lifeline for people facing hardship and they feared that, without it, many consumers would be left unprotected from financial predators.

Conceived by Senator Elizabeth Warren to police the type of lending that fueled the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has long been a target of conservatives and industry. Congress created the agency as part of post-crash reforms in 2010 as the sole federal body primarily charged with protecting consumers' rights in the financial marketplace.

The CFPB now faces extinction under President Donald Trump's second administration, which says the agency is a political weapon for Democrats and a burden on free enterprise.

Speaking to reporters at the White House in February, Trump said it was "very important to get rid of the agency," claiming, without spelling out evidence, that Warren had "used that as her little personal agency to go around and destroy people."

In an interview, Warren dismissed the criticism as a sign the CFPB was doing its job. "This is not about vendettas. This is about enforcing the law as it is written, so that billionaires and billionaire corporations don't cheat American families. I think that's a pretty good thing," she said.

White House Budget Director Russell Vought, a staunch CFPB critic and the agency's acting head, told "The Charlie Kirk Show" podcast in October he plans to shutter the CFPB. The administration is fighting in court to fire up to 90% of its workers, while planning to move pending investigations and litigation to the Justice Department.

The agency says it is due to run out of money in early 2026 and Vought says he cannot legally seek more until the Federal Reserve returns to what the administration deems "profitability ," a position a federal judge flatly rejected on Tuesday , finding it without legal merit. Congressional Republicans also slashed the CFPB's maximum allowable funding in July.

Together, the administration, congressional Republicans and industry-backed lawsuits have undone a decade's worth of CFPB rules on matters ranging from medical debt and student loans to credit card late fees , overdraft charges and mortgage lending.

The agency has also dropped or paused its probes and enforcement actions , and stopped supervising the consumer finance industries, leading to a string of resignations .

The CFPB and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Warren said that as a law professor studying bankruptcy she saw that consumer protections were weak and fragmented, and that America needed a single federal agency dedicated to protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.

"I was stunned by the number of people in financial trouble who had lost a job or got sick but who had also been cheated by one or more of their creditors," she told Reuters. "For no agency was consumer protection a first priority, it was somewhere between fifth and tenth, which meant there was just no cop on the beat. If the CFPB is not there, people have nowhere to turn when they get cheated."

Republicans said the agency was redundant, with federal bank watchdogs, like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators already looking out for consumers, and that its funding and leadership structure were unconstitutional. Like other banking regulators, the CFPB's funding is not set annually by Congress and does not come directly from taxpayers. Rather, the agency draws on the Federal Reserve and its director was until recently protected from removal at will by the president.

Republicans accused the CFPB's first director Richard Cordray, a Democrat, of using those powers to crush small banks and businesses via overzealous enforcement and complex regulations, and of overstepping the agency's legal authority by trying to regulate companies Congress had exempted from its oversight, such as auto dealerships.

Conservative and industry groups tried several times to curb its powers or extinguish it altogether via the courts. In 2020 the Supreme Court handed the president the power to fire the director, which he has since used . Critics on the political right accused former director Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, of exceeding his authority, flouting the federal rule-making process, and harming consumers with an ill-conceived crackdown on financial firm fees.

Thomas Hoenig, who served as vice chair of the FDIC from 2012 to 2018, said he was skeptical of some of the CFPB's work under prior administrations, but that it still served an important purpose.

"If you take them out of the picture altogether, you're going to get more abuse, not less," he said. "I'm disappointed to see the CFPB just go away."

For some, though, the agency has been a lifeline. Millions of Americans like Jones who are struggling with credit reporting errors, predatory lenders, debt collectors, fraud, discrimination or other challenges, are now filing complaints every year with the agency, which prompts companies to fix the issues, sometimes by paying the complainants, or explain themselves.

When companies repeatedly break the rules, the CFPB punishes them and tries to make their customers whole. To date, it has returned $21 billion to consumers, according to CFPB data.

Morgan Smith, a 31-year-old single mother and social services worker in Issaquah, Washington, turned to those resources when she realized she had been a victim of identity theft.

After her wallet and ID were stolen from her car, she learned that someone had opened up a string of accounts in her name, she said: a rental car that ended up in a crash, an unpaid storage unit and a hotel room at an amusement park. Reuters was unable to confirm Smith's account independently.

"I went straight to the CFPB and I was navigated there to their consumer education tab where I was able to find out how to deal with fraud and scams. It gave me all the information I needed to know...my rights," she said.

"That was very important for me to have this resource."

Without the CFPB, borrowers would once again rely on a hodgepodge of federal, state and other local agencies which lack the CFPB's resources, expertise and legal powers , say consumer groups.

"Prior to the CFPB coming around, we'd have to say, 'write your attorney general, write to the FTC,' whoever it was, and it became this sort of letter-writing campaign," said Sam Hohman, who runs the Nebraska nonprofit Credit Advisors Foundation, which helps people get out of debt and offers consumer education services.

As a result, people like Virginia resident Michael Johnson, 49, may have fewer options in future when they fall into trouble.

After a kidney transplant and leg amputation several years ago left Johnson unable to work, he racked up credit card debt paying for basic expenses, he said. This summer he received court summonses from creditors seeking to collect on that old debt, according to court records.

"I got in over my head unintentionally," Johnson said in an interview.

Using a CFPB database of credit card , opens new tab terms and conditions, Johnson learned that his creditors were required to use arbitration rather than sue in court, which could cost more than the underlying debts. Johnson represented himself in court and says so far one creditor has dropped its complaint while the other is considering its options.

"It adds credibility to your defense that you understand your rights," Johnson said. "Life happens to everybody."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:23:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UDQ2E7LFF5OCJAWUBM76QUIU2M.jpg?auth=e91e7546fce2797bb96fc8767291be6e19a218814a09e4d2fbf491b256b78033&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand frees 18 Cambodian soldiers as ceasefire holds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-frees-18-cambodian-soldiers-ceasefire-holds-2025-12-31/</link><description>BANGKOK/PHNOM PENH, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Thailand on Wednesday released 18 Cambodian soldiers it had detained since July under the renewed ceasefire the two countries agreed on the weekend to end a border conflict, Cambodian and Thai authorities said.

The Southeast Asian neighbours agreed on a ceasefire that took effect at noon (0500 GMT) on Saturday, halting 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides, and included fighter-jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages.

The soldiers were due to be returned on Tuesday, but Thailand delayed the process over alleged breaches of the ceasefire deal, which Cambodia denied.

Cambodian Defence Ministry spokesperson Maly Socheata said the soldiers were handed over at a border checkpoint at 10 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday after 155 days in Thai custody.

Thailand's Foreign Ministry said the soldiers had been treated "in accordance with international humanitarian law and principles" during their time in detention.

The border clashes reignited early this month, following the breakdown in a ceasefire deal that U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker to halt a previous round of conflict in July.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:24:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZOLLUO4ZSNIW5CC2CGKUTVI5KE.jpg?auth=ceab230d5706c839677594d0f120dd855ac930907ccc06bff354728d0a4f322a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four injured, including three children in Russian attack on Odesa, Ukraine says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/four-injured-including-three-children-russian-attack-odesa-ukraine-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Ukraine’s Odesa region, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure and injuring four people, including three children, regional authorities said on Wednesday.

Odesa, a major Black Sea port, has been repeatedly targeted by Russian missiles and drones during nearly four years of war , with strikes frequently hitting energy, transport and port infrastructure as well as residential areas.

"Strike drones attacked residential, logistics and energy infrastructure in our region," Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, said on the Telegram messaging app.

In Odesa city, which is the administrative centre of the broader Odesa region, four people were injured, including a seven-month-old infant, two other children, and a 42-year-old man, Serhiy Lisak, the head of Odesa's military administration, said on Telegram.

He said that drone debris and direct hits damaged facades and windows of several high-rise apartment buildings.

Lisak posted images showing smoke billowing from a multi-storey apartment building at night, with flames visible in several windows and what appears to be a firefighter’s water jet aimed at the facade.

Reuters could not independently verify the reports.

Najib, 72, already serving a six-year jail sentence for graft in an earlier case linked to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), was found guilty on December 26 of abuse of power and money laundering in the biggest trial he faced over the fund he co-founded while in office.

The High Court sentenced him to an additional 15 years in prison and a record fine of nearly $3 billion. Najib, who has been in prison since 2022, is appealing the ruling. He denies wrongdoing.

While civil society groups welcomed the verdict, many said it raised fresh questions over the independence of Malaysia's institutions and exposed deep structural problems that have not been addressed since the 1MDB scandal was exposed more than a decade ago.

Transparency International Malaysia President Raymon Ram said the verdict represented a chance for the government to implement long-promised institutional reforms.

These include plans to separate the attorney-general's role as the government's top legal adviser and function as public prosecutor, which has often led to conflicts of interest in politically sensitive cases, he said.

"If parliament and the government deliver on core reforms in 2026, Malaysians can begin to believe that integrity is no longer episodic, but embedded. If not, the risk is clear, accountability will remain selective, reforms will stagnate, and public trust will continue to erode," he said.

Malaysia scored 50 out of 100 in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in 2024, ranking 57th out of 180 countries, with the score stagnating in the last decade.

The CPI results indicate that while reform language has improved, perceptions of accountability and integrity have not shifted decisively, Ram said.

The court verdict has stoked tensions within Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's ruling alliance over the treatment of Najib, who remains a popular figure within some factions in his party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). UMNO has long campaigned against Anwar, but joined his coalition to form a government after the 2022 elections resulted in a hung parliament.

Anwar, who came to power on an anti-graft platform, has also faced a backlash over the slow pace of reforms with some critics accusing him of betraying allies after prosecutors dropped some graft charges against Najib and key UMNO figures.

Anwar said on Tuesday the government was working hard to address governance issues and eliminate graft, though he acknowledged the challenge of stamping out systemic corruption.

"There are still remnants who are trapped in the framework and patterns of the old corrupt culture," he told a press conference, without going into detail.

He rejected accusations of biased prosecutions, highlighting recent anti-graft investigations into senior government officials, including his own political secretary and the country's army chief .

Malaysia's Centre to Combat Corruption and Cronyism (C4), however, said the case of 1MDB highlighted persistent risks, with the prime minister empowered to appoint key officials, including the attorney-general, its anti-corruption agency chief, and the heads of government-linked companies.

C4 founder Cynthia Gabriel urged the government to pass a proposed law regulating political financing, and raised concerns over Anwar's continued alliance with UMNO, ahead of regional polls due in coming months and a national election that must be held by early 2028.

"As the next general election looms... the government is hard-pressed to regain the confidence of its voters and the big question remains of UMNO's future with the current coalition," Gabriel said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:24:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YDEE56EZ2VNVDIA67FI4GSVZJE.jpg?auth=b88b85f20fe5a3c6de365bdd4f971aa25d97b8814f3deb004d6cae455c0f02dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Gerasimov says Putin ordered buffer zone expansion in Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv in 2026</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-gerasimov-says-putin-ordered-buffer-zone-expansion-ukraines-sumy-kharkiv-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov said Russian forces were advancing into Ukrainian defences and that President Vladimir Putin ordered expansion of a buffer zone in Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv in 2026, Russian news agencies reported on Wednesday.

The election is the first since a 2021 coup and is taking place during a civil war . Analysts expect the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party, led by retired generals, to be returned to power.

The United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups have said the vote is not free, fair or credible, given that anti-junta political parties are out of the running and it is illegal to criticise the polls.

Zaw Min Tun, a junta spokesperson, told state media that more than six million people, or 52.13% of enrolled voters, had voted on Sunday across 102 townships.

"Even in developed democratic nations, there are situations where voter turnout does not exceed 50%," Zaw Min Tun said, saying the turnout was a "source of pride".

Turnout was about 70% in Myanmar's 2020 and 2015 general elections, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit International Foundation for Electoral Systems.

Further rounds of voting will be held on January 11 and January 25 , covering 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, although the junta does not have complete control of all those areas.

The junta's legal framework for the election has no minimum voter turnout requirement, said the Asian Network for Free Elections poll monitoring group.

This is likely to extend the final release of the documents to much later than expected after a December 19 deadline set by Congress, the document said.

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The Trump administration ordered the Justice Department to release the files tied to criminal probes of Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender, who was friends with U.S. President Donald Trump in the 1990s, in compliance with a transparency law passed by Congress last month.

Collectively, the Criminal Division, the National Security Division, the FBI and the US Attorney's office in Manhattan are providing 400 attorneys to review the files, the document said, a more precise, and potentially much larger, figure than previous estimates from the department.

The review will occur between January 5-23, the document added.

Department leaders are offering telework options and time off awards as incentives for volunteers, the document said, adding that lawyers who assist will be expected to devote three to five hours a day to review about 1,000 documents a day.

The DOJ said last week it had uncovered more than a million additional documents potentially linked to Epstein.

So far, the disclosures have been heavily redacted, frustrating some Republicans and doing little to quell a scandal that threatens the party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The law, approved by Congress with broad bipartisan support, requires all Epstein-related files to be made public, despite Trump’s months-long effort to keep them sealed. Under the statute, all documents were to be released by December 19, with redactions to protect victims.

Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. He has said their association ended in the mid-2000s and that he was never aware of the financier's sexual abuse.

Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. The Justice Department charged him with sex trafficking in 2019. Epstein was found dead in 2019 in a New York jail and his death was ruled a suicide.

In a message shared on X last week, the Justice Department said , opens new tab , "We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:34:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ADACEQV3SFPNRL2URHSUWZJZ3I.jpg?auth=4ce8ae2ea1edaaadc4e324e1369c5b6739a1c3331a5c798cad3c3172edf314b0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda detains prominent rights campaigner and government critic ahead of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-detains-prominent-rights-campaigner-government-critic-ahead-polls-2025-12-31/</link><description>KAMPALA, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Police in Uganda said they have detained a prominent human rights activist as long-serving President Yoweri Museveni's government widens its crackdown on dissent and political opposition ahead of the January 15 general election.

The detention of Sarah Bireete, head of a rights organisation and a frequent anti-government commentator on local TV and radio, was confirmed by police in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday.

"She is in police custody. She will be arraigned before court in due course," the post said, without specifying when she would appear in court or what charges she faces.

Bireete, a lawyer and executive director of the Centre for Constitutional Governance (CCG), has been critical of a range of government actions including what the opposition says are illegal detentions and torture of its supporters.

The CCG could not be immediately reached for comment.

The January election pits incumbent Museveni, 81, who has been in power since 1986, against pop-star-turned-politician Bobi Wine.

Wine, 43, and his National Unity Platform party say hundreds of their members have been detained this year including during the campaigns in a move meant to intimidate his supporters and sap party morale.

Last month, U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Türk also decried what he described as an "intensifying crackdown" on the opposition in Uganda and said at least 550 NUP supporters had been detained this year.

Another major opposition figure , Kizza Besigye, remains in prison more than a year after he was detained on treason charges.

Wine himself was beaten by security forces as he campaigned in the country's north and while police promised to probe the alleged beating, no report has been produced.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:36:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: At least four wounded in Russian drone strikes on Odesa, including three children</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251231-live-at-least-four-wounded-in-russian-drone-strikes-on-odesa-including-three-children</link><description>Russia’s ​top general said its forces were pressing forward in northeastern ⁠Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin had ordered expansion of territory Moscow calls a buffer zone there in 2026, Russian news agencies.

Chief of the General Staff Valery ‍Gerasimov said Putin ordered expansion in 2026 of the buffer zone in Ukraine’s regions ​of Sumy and Kharkiv near the Russian border, ​RIA said, adding that he inspected the “North” troop grouping.

The grouping, formed in early 2024, has operated in northeastern Ukraine, seeking to create a buffer along the border and trying to push back Ukrainian forces there for further advances.

Putin has repeatedly portrayed the buffer zone ‍as a way to push Ukrainian forces and weapons farther from Russia’s border, citing cross-border shelling and drone attacks on regions such as Belgorod and Kursk.

Kyiv has rejected Moscow’s buffer zone calling it an idea Russia is using to justify deeper incursions into ‍Ukrainian territory.

Russia launched an ⁠overnight drone attack on Ukraine’s Odesa region, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure and wounding four people, including three children, regional ​authorities said.

Odesa, a major ‍Black Sea port, has been repeatedly targeted by Russian missiles and ​drones during nearly four years of war, with strikes ​frequently hitting energy, transport and port infrastructure as well as residential areas.

"Strike drones attacked residential, logistics and energy infrastructure in our region," Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, said on the Telegram messaging app.

In Odesa city, which ‍is the administrative centre of the broader Odesa region, four people ​were injured, including a seven-month-old infant, two other children, and a 42-year-old man, Serhiy Lisak, the head of ‌Odesa's military administration, said on Telegram.

He said that drone debris and direct hits damaged ‍facades and windows of several high-rise apartment buildings.

A Ukrainian drone attack wounded two people and sparked a fire that ⁠was quickly extinguished at the Tuapse oil refinery, the operational headquarters of Russia's Krasnodar region said.

The strike damaged refinery equipment, one port berth ​and five homes – windows were broken in four apartment blocks and ‍a private house – the Krasnodar operational headquarters said on the Telegram messaging app.

Tuapse in the Krasnodar region ​lies in southwest Russia on the Black Sea and about 350km to the nearest parts of Ukraine’s mainland across the Sea of Azov.

The refinery blaze was put out after burning about 300 square metres, it said, but the authorities did not provide details on the extent of the damage to the oil refinery's equipment or whether operations were halted.

Tuapse is one of Russia's ‍key Black Sea outlets for oil products, anchored by Rosneft’s export-oriented Tuapse refinery, which has capacity to ​process about 240,000 barrels of crude oil per day and supplies products such as naphtha, fuel oil and diesel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:38:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0daf5ff0-e5fc-11f0-9303-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25357373740395-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>From science to sport: These are the stories that lifted spirits in 2025</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251231-from-science-to-sport-these-are-the-stories-that-lifted-spirits-in-2025</link><description>Welcome to 2026! As the new year begins, FRANCE 24 takes a final look back at the stories that lifted spirits in recent months. From scientific breakthroughs to signs of hope for the planet, there was enough to end 2025 on a high note.

Scientists had awaited the moment since the 1950s. In July, NASA released the closest images ever taken of the Sun, captured by the Parker Solar Probe.

In the black-and-white images, untrained eyes may see wisps resembling smoke. Experts, however, identify overlapping plasma eruptions and solar wind captured in unprecedented detail, providing valuable data to better understand space weather and the workings of the star.

There was also cause for optimism in the medical field. In January, a team of US researchers made a major breakthrough on multiple sclerosis, demonstrating a link between the autoimmune disease – which affects more than 2.8 million people worldwide – and the Epstein-Barr virus.

The discovery raised hope that vaccination against the virus could one day eliminate one of the disease’s triggers.

Another positive development concerned HIV prevention. Generic versions of injectable lenacapavir, a preventive treatment against the virus that causes AIDS , are expected to become available at a lower cost in around 100 countries from 2027.

The development is expected to greatly expand access to a treatment considered far more practical than a daily pill, particularly in low-income countries.

"Tobacco is taboo, we’ll beat it", said a French slogan that might just become reality. Last year, the number of smokers in the country declined , especially among young people, according to the French public health agency Santé publique France .

Specialists attributed the trend to anti-smoking policies implemented since 2014.

In 2025, the campaign intensified further , with smoking banned on beaches, in parks and in public gardens. The government’s stated aim is to achieve a tobacco-free generation by 2032.

It was a strong year for marine life. In June, world leaders met to reinforce the protection of the oceans.

Measures discussed included safeguarding the high seas, strengthening efforts against illegal fishing and expanding marine protected areas.

One commitment has already been fulfilled. After decades of negotiations, states (finally) ratified a treaty on protecting the high seas, providing tools to preserve ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction.

The Iberian lynx, recognisable by its pointed ears and spotted coat, recorded a significant recovery. After narrowly avoiding extinction, the species was removed this year from the "endangered" category on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.

This year, there were 2,021 Iberian lynxes worldwide, a significant jump from just 94 recorded in 2001.

The green sea turtle also showed signs of recovery. Long hunted for its eggs and shell, it is no longer classified as endangered, highlighting the effectiveness of conservation measures when properly enforced.

Reproductive rights in Europe also advanced in 2025. On December 17, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging EU institutions to facilitate access to safe abortions across the bloc.

The move followed a petition signed by more than one million EU citizens. It called for a mechanism enabling people living in countries without access to safe and legal abortion to travel at reduced cost to another EU member state where the procedure is permitted.

The European Commission said it would review the petition before March 2026.

After a century and the Paris Olympic Games , a long-held ambition became reality. This summer, thousands of people swam in specially designed areas of the River Seine in the heart of the French capital.

FRANCE 24's journalists also took part in the experience.

Few observers expected it. Curacao, a Caribbean island with 156,000 inhabitants and an autonomous state within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, qualified for the 2026 Football World Cup .

Another unexpected qualifier was Haiti . One of the world’s poorest countries and plagued by gang violence, Haiti also secured a place at the tournament, marking only the second international competition in its history.

Egypt inaugurated the Grand Egyptian Museum in November, marking a major moment for history enthusiasts.

The museum, dedicated to the Pharaonic civilisation, houses colossal statues, sarcophagi, tools and jewellery. Nearly 100,000 artefacts are displayed across more than 50,000 square metres of exhibition space.

It was the masterpiece no one saw coming. "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33", the debut title from French studio Sandfall Interactive, won multiple awards at the Game Awards ceremony.

It marked a first for a French game and a notable achievement for a fantasy universe inspired by Paris in the 1900s, developed by around 30 people on a modest budget.

The 345-page code was passed in 2022 and replaces a set of laws established during Dutch colonial rule. Its broad definitions drew condemnation from democracy activists concerned it might harm civil liberties and free speech, and put government critics at risk of arrest.

Law Minister Supratman Andi Agtas said the overhaul of the law was timely, but acknowledged there was a risk of the new powers being abused by authorities.

"There will be that," he said over the phone on Tuesday, referring to potential abuses of the code. "We're not blind. But what's important is public control. Anything that's new will not be immediately perfect."

Decades in the making, the revisions to the criminal code were passed in then-President Joko Widodo's final term. At the time, then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Widodo to reconsider some of the provisions .

The code was updated to reflect Indonesia's current legal and cultural norms, citing new policies such as a restorative justice system, Agtas said. "It's our own legal system ... different from other countries," he added.

The law criminalises sex outside marriage with a punishment of up to one year in jail, but only if a spouse, parent, or child of the alleged offender makes a complaint. Currently, only adultery is a crime in Indonesia.

The reporting requirement has eased tourism industry concerns that foreigners could be caught by the law, said Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of the Confederation of Indonesia Tourism Association.

Insulting the president or state agencies may result in a prison term of as many as three years under the new law, while people disseminating communism or other ideologies "that are against" Indonesia's state ideology face up to four years in jail.

The new code's definition of "attacking honour or dignity", which it says is where a reputation or self-worth is damaged, includes actions such as libel or defamation.

Asfinawati, a legal expert who goes by one name, said this week that the definition of insults was among the broad provisions that raised concerns for free speech and activist groups.

"This is a new colonial set of laws, made by our own," she said, adding the expansive nature of the code did not guarantee that officials would properly apply it.

Agtas said law officers had been briefed about the new code, and along with a separate criminal procedure code set to take effect on Friday, there were guardrails intended to prevent power abuses.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 07:25:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HHERALX4URNEBEIVRNVKY6CNEA.jpg?auth=4cb754656afd1dd7e1cec7d2681d250d39cbe37d783ae4dc2e1503ebe57f548f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: How Israel’s multi-ton truck bombs ripped through Gaza City</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-multi-ton-truck-bombs-ripped-through-gaza-city-2025-12-31/</link><description>GAZA CITY, Dec 31 (Reuters) - In the weeks before the Gaza ceasefire on October 10, Israel widely deployed a new weapon: M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers repurposed to carry between 1 and 3 tons of explosives, Reuters found.

As Israeli troops pushed toward the centre of Gaza City, these powerful bombs, along with airstrikes and armour-plated bulldozers, leveled swathes of buildings, drone footage and satellite images show.

In most cases, but not all, the inhabitants fled ahead of demolitions after Israeli warnings, residents, Israeli security sources and Gaza authorities said.

Hesham Mohammad Badawi’s five-storey home on Dawla Street in the affluent Tel-al-Hawa suburb, damaged by an airstrike earlier in the war, was completely destroyed by an APC explosion on September 14, he and a relative said, leaving him and 41 family members homeless.

Badawi, who was a few hundred meters away, said he heard at least five APCs detonate in roughly five-minute intervals. He said he received no evacuation warning before the demolition and family members escaped “by a miracle” amid explosions and heavy gunfire.

Several buildings in the same block were demolished around that time, satellite images show.

The family is now staying with relatives in different parts of the city, Badawi said, while he lives in a tent by his former home. Israel’s military did not respond to Reuters questions about the incident. Reuters could not establish what Israel targeted in the attack or independently verify all the details of Badawi’s account of the events.

When Reuters visited in November, remains of at least one of the vehicles were strewn among large piles of rubble.

"We could not believe this was our neighbourhood, this was our street,” Badawi said.

To compile a detailed account of the role of APC-based bombs by the Israeli military in Tel-al-Hawa and the neighbouring Sabra district in the six weeks before the ceasefire, Reuters spoke to three Israeli security sources, a retired Israeli military brigadier, an Israeli reservist, Gazan authorities and three military experts.

Seven Gaza City residents said their homes or those of neighbours were levelled or severely damaged by the explosions, which several likened to an earthquake. Analysis of Reuters footage by two of the military experts confirmed wreckage of at least two exploded APCs among the rubble at sites in Gaza City.

Israel packed 1 to 3 tons of ordnance in APCs, three military experts estimated, based on cabin space and wreckage of vehicle armour. Some of the ordnance was likely non–military ammonium nitrate or emulsion, though without chemical testing that conclusion is not certain, they said.

Such a multi-ton explosion could approach an equivalent power to Israel’s largest airborne bombs, the 2,000-pound U.S.-made Mark 84, said two experts, who examined Reuters footage of the blast area and vehicle remains.

It could scatter vehicle fragments hundreds of meters, and break close-by exterior walls and building columns. The blast wave would be strong enough to potentially collapse a multi-storey building, they said.

APCs generally transport troops and equipment on the battlefield. The three military experts consulted by Reuters said use of the vehicles as bombs was highly unusual and risked excessive damage to civilian dwellings.

In response to detailed Reuters questions for this story, Israel’s military said it was committed to the rules of war. Regarding allegations of destruction of civilian infrastructure, it said it used what it called engineering equipment only for “essential operational purposes,” without disclosing further details.

Decisions are guided by military necessity, distinction, and proportionality, it said.

In an interview with Reuters in Gaza for this story, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said Israel’s demolitions with armoured vehicles were aimed at the large-scale displacement of the city's residents, which Israel has denied.

The reporting provides new evidence of the power of these low-tech weapons and how they came to be widely used.

Retired reservist Brigadier-General Amir Avivi, founder of the Israel Defense and Security Forum (IDSF), a think tank, called the weapon an “innovation of the Gaza War.” One of the security sources said its increasing use partly responded to U.S. restrictions on transfers of heavy Mark-84 airborne bombs and Caterpillar bulldozers.

Israel’s military and Prime Minister’s Office also did not respond to questions about the reasons for the shift in tactics. The U.S. State Department, White House and Department of War did not respond to Reuters questions for this story.

Before the war, Tel-al-Hawa and Sabra, a historic area of modest houses in south-central Gaza City, bustled with bakeries, shopping malls, mosques, banks and universities.

Now, large parts lie in ruins.

Satellite imagery analysis by Reuters showed that about 650 buildings in Sabra, Tel-al-Hawa and surrounding areas were destroyed in the six weeks between September 1 and October 11.

Two international law scholars, the U.N. human rights office and two of the military experts who reviewed Reuters findings said use of such large explosives in dense residential urban areas may have failed one or more principles of humanitarian law that prohibit attacking civilian infrastructure and using disproportionate force.

“The basis that some of it may be booby-trapped" or once used by Hamas snipers is not enough to justify mass destruction, Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. Human Rights Office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told Reuters, referring to Israel’s allegation that Hamas placed improvised explosive devices in houses, which Hamas denies.

In some circumstances, buildings could lose legal protection and become targets if Israel had evidence Hamas used them for military advantage, said Afonso Seixas Nunes, Associate Professor in the School of Law at Saint Louis University.

Israel’s military did not respond to Reuters requests to provide such evidence.

If not the result of military necessity, the demolition of civilian infrastructure could amount to wanton destruction of property, which is a war crime, Sunghay said.

The level of ruin reflects a broader trend: 81% of Gaza’s buildings suffered damage or destruction during the war, according to the U.N. Satellite Center. The area including Gaza City experienced most damage since July, with approximately 5,600 newly affected structures, it said in October.

In August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters Israel was packing tons of explosives into APCs because Hamas had placed explosive devices in “just about every single building” in evacuated areas.

“We detonate them, and they set off all the booby traps. That's why you see the destruction," Netanyahu said.

In response to questions for this story, Qassem, the Hamas spokesman, denied booby trapping buildings, and said Hamas did not have the capacity to set devices at the scale Israel claimed.

Later in August, Israeli forces entered Gaza City with the declared aim of eliminating Hamas and freeing hostages held by militants since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war.

Israel ordered a full evacuation of the city in September.

As troops advanced, backed by tanks and airstrikes, they extensively damaged eastern suburbs before approaching central areas of the city, where most displaced people were sheltering.

Hundreds of thousands fled south. The U.N. estimated 600,000-700,000 people remained in the city.

Israel’s defense minister has said soldiers demolished 25 towers that Israel said had Hamas tunnels underneath or were used as lookout points. The U.N. human rights office says Israel has provided no evidence the buildings were military targets.

Among the destruction visible in Sabra, Tel-al-Hawa and South Rimal between September 1 and October 11, Reuters identified al-Roya tower, which housed the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, a prominent human rights office that worked with charity Christian Aid, and al-Roya 2, a mixture of business and flats, brought down by airstrikes on September 7 and 8.

Two wings of the Islamic University of Gaza and a mosque on the campus were destroyed. In one six-block corner of Tel-al-Hawa almost every building was demolished - more than 60 in total.

Beyond the two cases of APC explosions analysed in detail for this story, and airstrikes on towers caught on video, Reuters could not establish what weapons Israel deployed to demolish buildings, or the total number of APCs detonated from August until the ceasefire.

Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said the army detonated hundreds of APCs in that period, as many as 20 daily. Israel’s military did not reply to a question on numbers.

Among the buildings destroyed was Badawi’s family home of four decades, along with more than 20 neighbouring buildings in the same period.

“We didn’t recognize this as our house," he said.

Two military experts said Reuters footage of the area showed remains of at least one detonated APC.

The explosion had torn one APC caterpillar track from its running gear and “physically thrown it onto the roof” of a multi-storey building, a retired senior British military bomb disposal officer said, noting that M113 tracks each weigh hundreds of kilograms.

A thick, ripped piece of metal and a wheel torn in half, both scattered at the property, were consistent with a detonation from within the APC, said Gareth Collett, a retired British Brigadier General and leading authority on explosives and bomb disposal. He said the large size of the fragments was indicative of a commercial low energy explosive.

Bought from the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War in the 1970s, thousands of M113s were deemed to insufficiently protect soldiers and were mothballed, military historian Yagil Henkin said.

FMC Corp, originally the M113’s primary manufacturer, did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment about its use as a weapon and potential associated human rights concerns.

BAE Systems, which currently provides maintenance for the vehicle globally, did not reply to Reuters questions about Israel's new use of the M113 other than to say it currently had no direct military sales to the country. It said equipment it sold to the U.S. government could reach other countries indirectly.

In May, Israel posted a public tender seeking to sell an unspecified number of M113s internationally, public documents show.

The tender was later cancelled, according to an undated posting on the Ministry of Defence website. The cancellation allowed Israel to scale up repurposing M113s, one of the security sources told Reuters. The military did not respond to Reuters’ questions about the tender.

The first media reports of an APC detonating in Gaza date to mid-2024.

Use accelerated this year when Israel rationed stocks after the U.S. paused deliveries of Mark-84 bombs over concerns about the bombs use in residential areas, the source said.

The increased role of APC-based bombs also coincided with shortages in Israel of U.S. company Caterpillar's giant D9 bulldozer, long used by Israel’s military for demolition, one of the security sources said.

Hamas heavily targeted D9s earlier in the war, killing or injuring soldiers and damaging the vehicles, the source said. Alarmed by their use to demolish homes, the U.S. paused D9 sales to Israel in November 2024, adding to the shortage. Under President Donald Trump, D9 transfers resumed.

Caterpillar did not respond to questions from Reuters about the military use of its machines in Gaza demolitions and has not publicly commented on the matter.

Amid the shortages, the military began using other methods of demolition, including APCs, another of the security sources said.

Danny Orbach, an Israeli military historian, told Reuters demolitions were normal in war, made necessary in Gaza due to tunnels and booby traps. He said Israel’s military was underprepared for the complex fighting, leading to the conclusion there was “no other way to fight such a war except destroying all buildings above ground.”

Israel's military told Reuters targets were reviewed prior to attack and the munition selected “to achieve the military objective while minimizing collateral damage” to civilians and civilian infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 08:31:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OZTJPO6M5VM7TALMTY6XMXB4UQ.jpg?auth=760e740bb798aaaf397ee91568137db2f125aadeb07e6a82330e4e504f274a03&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mali and Burkina Faso announce reciprocal travel ban on US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/mali-burkina-faso-announce-reciprocal-travel-ban-us-2025-12-31/</link><description>BAMAKO, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Mali and Burkina Faso have said they are imposing a travel ban on U.S. citizens in response to an equivalent measure announced by the Trump administration earlier this month .

In separate statements issued by their foreign ministries late on Tuesday, the two West African countries said they were acting in the name of "reciprocity" after the White House announced on December 16 that U.S. President Donald Trump was adding them and five other countries to a list of those subject to a full travel ban.

The White House said the expanded ban, set to take effect on January 1, applied to "countries with demonstrated, persistent, and severe deficiencies in screening, vetting, and information-sharing to protect the Nation from national security and public safety threats".

Mali said on Tuesday that Washington's decision to add it to the travel ban list had been taken without prior consultation and that the stated rationale was not justified by "actual developments on the ground".

Mali and Burkina Faso are not the first countries to take such measures affecting U.S. citizens after being targeted by Trump's travel restrictions.

On December 25 neighbouring Niger announced it would stop issuing visas to U.S. citizens, the country's state media agency reported, citing a Nigerien diplomatic source.

In June, Chad announced it was suspending visa issuance to U.S. citizens after it was included on an earlier list of 12 countries affected by a travel ban.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 08:56:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's Islamist party open to unity government after February vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-islamist-party-open-unity-government-after-february-vote-2025-12-31/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 09:46:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J72VEBLDTJOF5D5SZJDKKNPNKA.jpg?auth=82afdaa896f041b6209e1cd0d5382f2ba9dd0901d9cefef6ebbc17d0a893b5cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran to unleash 'decisive' response if economic protests destabilise country, prosecutor says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251231-iran-unleash-decisive-response-economic-protests-destabilise-country-prosecutor</link><description>Iran 's prosecutor general said on Wednesday that economic protests that had gripped the country were legitimate, but any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a "decisive response".

"Peaceful livelihood protests are part of social and understandable realities," Mohammad Movahedi-Azad told state media.

"Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response."

Protesters including shopkeepers and university students have been rallying against economic hardship in Iran since Sunday.

The Iranian rial has dropped against the dollar and other world currencies, forcing up import prices and hurting retail traders.

When the protests erupted on Sunday, the US dollar was trading at around 1.42 million rials, compared to 820,000 rials a year ago.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics. But this figure still falls far short of many price increases, especially for basic necessities.

The country's economy, already battered by decades of severe Western sanctions, was further strained after the United Nations in late September reinstated international sanctions linked to the country's nuclear programme that were lifted 10 years ago.

President Masoud Pezeshkian – who has less authority under Iran's system of government than supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – met Tuesday with labour leaders and made proposals to tackle the economic crisis, according to press agency Mehr.

"I have asked the interior minister to listen to the legitimate demands of the protesters by engaging in dialogue with their representatives so that the government can do everything in its power to resolve the problems and act responsibly," he said in a social media post.

According to state television, parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, also called for "necessary measures focused on increasing people's purchasing power" but warned against foreign agents and government opponents attempting to exploit the protests.

On Monday, the government announced the replacement of the central bank governor with former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati.

Israel 's Mossad spy agency on Wednesday issued a direct call urging Iranians to press on with protests, saying it was supporting them "on the ground" as demonstrations spread in capital Tehran and other Iranian cities.

"Go out into the streets together. The time has come. We are with you," Mossad wrote in a post on its Farsi-language X account, Israel's army radio reported on Wednesday.

"Not just from a distance or through words.

While the situation left hundreds of people trapped in their cars in freezing conditions, by the early hours of Wednesday morning traffic was moving again, according to police.

"The difficult situation began yesterday after 4 p.m., when the first trucks on the S7 route... began having trouble approaching the slopes," said Tomasz Markowski, a spokesperson for police in the northern city of Olsztyn.

"This led to a traffic jam stretching approximately 20 kilometres overnight."

Deputy Infrastructure Minister Stanislaw Bukowiec told a press conference that nobody had been hurt as a result of the difficult situation on the roads.

Anna Karczewska, a spokesperson for police in Ostroda, said officers had tried to help drivers who found themselves stuck. Ostroda lies on the highway about 40 km west of Olsztyn.

"We helped as much as we could, and we had coffee and hot tea for the drivers, which the Ostroda City Hall had prepared for us," she said.

State news agency PAP reported that there had also been some disruption to railways and airports, but that services were returning to normal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Queen Camilla describes being assaulted by man as a teenager</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queen-camilla-describes-being-assaulted-by-man-teenager-2025-12-31/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Britain's Queen Camilla has described for the first time fighting off an attack by a man on a train when she was a teenager, speaking in an interview with the BBC in which she recounted how furious the assault had left her.

"When I was a teenager, I was attacked on a train … I remember at the time being so angry," she said during a discussion broadcast on Wednesday about violence against women.

"I was reading my book and you know this boy - man - attacked me, and I did fight back."

She said she did not know the man who attacked her.

Camilla, 78, has for many years championed charities and causes that seek to end sexual and domestic violence and to support victims.

The assault was first reported in September when a book about the royal family was serialised in the Times newspaper, but had not previously been confirmed by Buckingham Palace.

"I remember getting off the train and my mother looking at me and saying 'Why is your hair standing on end and why is the button missing from your coat?'" she told the BBC.

"I was so furious about it and it's sort of lurked for many years."

The book said the incident happened on a train to Paddington Station in London when Camilla was about 16 or 17 years old, and she responded by taking off her shoe and using it to hit him in the genitals.

When she arrived at Paddington, she pointed the attacker out to an official and he was arrested, the book said.

Camilla did not confirm those details in the interview.

The democratic socialist's plans for his first day in office on Thursday nod to his politics and priorities, without straying far from his predecessors with a sober official midnight oath-taking followed by a more celebratory ceremony in the afternoon.

New York law spells out that four-year mayoral terms start on the January 1 after elections. To avoid any ambiguity about who's in charge of America's most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small midnight swearing-in.

Mamdani has chosen as the site of his midnight oath the Old City Hall subway stop, which was decommissioned in the middle of the previous century and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours.

The subway site, according to Mamdani’s transition team, reflects his "commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day."

Mamdani, a 34-year-old former state lawmaker, promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party around the country ahead of midterm elections.

Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50 percent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who was among Mamdani's earliest prominent backers, was to administer the midnight oath to Mamdani. During the first administration of President Donald Trump, James began investigating his business practices in New York, resulting in a judge finding in 2024 that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to dupe lenders. The Trump administration has targeted James during his second term, accusing her of mortgage fraud .

Grant Reeher, a Syracuse University political science professor, said the role James was to play in the inauguration sent a message to core supporters that Mamdani is "going to be independent of the president.”

INAUGURATION OF A NEW ERA

The Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City's first Muslim mayor, has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting .

But being sworn in by the state attorney general may say more about Mamdani's political alliances than rivalries. In 2014 Bill de Blasio, whom Mamdani regards as the best New York City mayor of his lifetime, was sworn in privately by then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman at the start of the first of his two terms.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive, Brooklyn-born Vermont senator whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, presided over de Blasio's public inauguration ceremony in 2018 and will play a similar role for Mamdani. Liberal Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also on the inauguration ceremony agenda.

Plans for Mamdani's public inauguration include a ceremony on City Hall's steps and a program of music and speeches in front of 4,000 guests gathered in City Hall Plaza. In addition, tens of thousands of people will be able to watch a livestream of what Mamdani's team has dubbed the “Inauguration of a New Era” in free viewing areas set up along Broadway.

Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record in this century, both by the total and single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg's first term in 2001.

Sami Zaman, the owner of Astoria's low-key Afghan restaurant Sami's Kabab House, where Astoria resident Mamdani filmed a campaign video with Sanders, was on the inaugural committee alongside filmmakers, writers and activists.

After becoming mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilization program, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side.

Bankers and others in New York, the nation's financial capital , had expressed concern about Mamdani but since his election they have explored how to work with him. The city has had another mayor associated with democratic socialism, David Dinkins. Dinkins did not make much of his association with the Democratic Socialists of America. During his 1990-1993 term he overcame budget deficits and persuaded private businesses to remain in New York, according to city archivists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 11:21:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3D5WPQ2ML5JLPLN7WA3UPGQHQI.jpg?auth=dada6cdeb348eb6fa5a8fa906bb7c38d32c6d780405c8a1f1c2cc5ff8b2b9ad9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy's Tajani calls for electoral reform with majority bonus before next national vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italys-tajani-calls-electoral-reform-with-majority-bonus-before-next-national-2025-12-31/</link><description>ROME, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Wednesday the country's electoral law should be reformed to adopt a more proportional system as the ruling bloc seeks to safeguard its majority ahead of a general election due in 2027.

Tajani, who leads the conservative Forza Italia party and is a key ally in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition, said the reform should include a majority premium to guarantee governability.

"We will discuss it. No one wants to exclude the centre-left, but the reform must be done," Tajani was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper Il Messaggero.

Key wins for Italy's opposition in southern regional elections show cracks in the ruling conservative bloc's dominance, raising doubts over Meloni's ability to secure a second term in the next national vote.

Under the current system, 36% of lawmakers are elected in first-past-the-post constituencies.

Meloni and her allies swept to power in 2022 after the centre-left failed to form a pre-election alliance, splitting votes in key first-past-the-post races.

Italy has since enjoyed a rare period of political stability.

However, analysts say a centre-left alliance could threaten Meloni's grip on power.

Tajani said that proportional representation would better reflect local interests, especially after the recent cut in the number of lawmakers.

Italy reduced the size of its parliament in 2020, cutting the number of deputies from 630 to 400 and senators from 315 to 200.

The change has intensified debate over how to ensure fair representation under the current mixed electoral system, which combines proportional and first-past-the-post elements.

"With proportional representation, territories would be represented more," Tajani said.

Electoral law has long been a contentious issue in Italy, where frequent changes to voting rules have shaped political dynamics. The current system, introduced in 2017, was designed to balance stability with representation but has faced criticism for producing fragmented parliaments again.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:45:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SQED77NV6ZNR7C4CSUO42A3YHY.jpg?auth=72eadcf8cf069a45a749ddfa61cde2753feb5c81577dd222fa5787e211efb6f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia releases video footage to challenge Kyiv over alleged attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russia-releases-video-footage-challenge-kyiv-over-alleged-attack-2025-12-31/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry released video footage on Wednesday of what it said was a downed drone at a briefing intended to show Ukraine tried this week to attack a presidential residence and challenge Kyiv's denials that such an attack took place.

Kyiv says Moscow has produced no evidence to support its allegations and that Russia invented the alleged attack to block progress at talks on ending the war in Ukraine . Officials in several Western countries have cast doubt on Russia's version of events and questioned whether there was any attack.

Video footage released by Russia's defence ministry showed a senior officer, Major-General Alexander Romanenkov, setting out details of how Moscow says it believes Ukraine attacked one of President Vladimir Putin's residences in the Novgorod region.

Romanenkov said 91 drones had been launched from Ukraine's Sumy and Chernihiv regions in a "thoroughly planned" attack that he said was thwarted by Russian air defences, caused no damage and injured no one.

The video released by the ministry included footage of a Russian serviceman standing next to fragments of a device which he said was a downed Ukrainian Chaklun-V drone carrying a 6-kg explosive device which had not detonated.

The ministry did not explain how it knew what the device's target was.

Reuters could not confirm the location and the date of the footage showing fragments of a destroyed device. The model of the destroyed device could not be immediately verified.

Other footage featured a man, identified as Igor Bolshakov from a village in the Novgorod region, saying he had heard air defence rockets in action.

Ukraine did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Russian defence ministry's footage.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:33:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T74NYN25NJNXTMFNKK4L7GJGCE.jpg?auth=302ee1d252e142b5655f3386c56ad9284a25dd1be2803d420361e592552df2d5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sydney brings in New Year with nod to victims of Bondi attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sydney-brings-new-year-with-nod-victims-bondi-attack-2025-12-31/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Australia's Sydney began 2026 with a fireworks display held under an enhanced police presence, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city.

Sydney's annual New Year's Eve celebrations are known globally for their spectacular fireworks, with 40,000 pyrotechnic effects stretching seven km (four miles) across buildings and barges along its harbour, including the city's iconic Harbour Bridge and Opera House.

Organisers held a minute's silence for the victims of the attack at 11:00 p.m. local time (1200 GMT), with the Harbour Bridge lit up in white and a menorah - a symbol long used to symbolise Judaism - projected onto its pylons.

"After a tragic end to the year for our city, we hope that New Year’s Eve will provide an opportunity to come together and look with hope for a peaceful and happy 2026," Sydney's Lord Mayor Clover Moore said ahead of the event.

The father and son gunmen are alleged to have killed 15 people at a Hanukkah event on December 14, Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades that shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country.

Traditional Christmas celebrations at Bondi were muted this year, and several New Year events planned there were cancelled.

Around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during the main New Year celebrations, that typically attract over a million revellers.

As president in his second term, he is merging his personal brand with national institutions and government programs, an unusual assertion of power by a sitting U.S. president.

Since returning to office in January, the Republican president has affixed his name to prominent Washington buildings, a planned class of Navy warships, a visa program for wealthy foreigners, a government-run prescription drug website, and federal savings accounts for children.

Some historians see it as a superficial legacy-building effort by the president that may not stand the test of time. A backlash has already begun against the renaming of Washington's premier performance venue as the Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, with several acts canceling in protest.

"I don't think the naming or renaming guarantees that Trump's name will be affixed to those things until time immemorial," said Austin Sarat, a professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, who questioned whether Trump's name would remain if Democrats regain power.

Elizabeth Huston, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was not focused on "smart branding, but delivering on President Trump’s goal of Making America Great Again.”

"Drug pricing agreements, overdue upgrades of national landmarks, lasting peace deals, and wealth-creation accounts for children are historic initiatives that would not have been possible without President Trump’s bold leadership," she said in an emailed statement.

The first year of Trump's second White House term has seen a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power, remade some parts of the federal bureaucracy and economy, and reshaped America's relations with the world.

But one of the most striking features of the past 11 months has been the energy and attention Trump has given to placing his name on buildings and government programs.

Trump's populist moves have alarmed Democrats and civil society watchdogs who worry they create the impression that Trump, rather than the state, is the provider of essential services. Defenders say what Trump is doing is simply an extension of his decades as a savvy marketer.

The biggest outcry came this December when his name was added to the Kennedy Center, named for the late Democratic president in 1964 by an act of Congress to honor him after his assassination.

The center was renamed by its board of trustees, a majority of whom were appointed by Trump.

Just up the Potomac River sits the U.S. Institute of Peace, a government-funded think tank established by Congress and focused on conflict avoidance.

On December 3 the U.S. State Department renamed it the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, based on Trump's assertion he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots. Trump's name has been affixed to the building's exterior.

Washington has many buildings and monuments named after presidents, but that has traditionally occurred well after they have left office and are normally national tributes to them, often established by Congress.

Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, said while previous presidents were not shy in reminding voters they were responsible for popular policies, including stimulus money or infrastructure programs, "that's very different to what you're seeing today."

"It's a lot easier to get your name on a building or a ship than to pass legislation that's enduring," Zelizer said. In terms of a lasting legacy, however, "it's very thin."

Trump has announced a plan for a new generation of U.S. Navy warships, which he called "Trump-class" battleships and said he will be personally involved in the designs.

If Trump's name appears on any of the ships, or "Trump-class" becomes an official Navy designation for the new battleships, a later name change would be a first, Zelizer said.

But Trump's announcement does not guarantee the ships will be built. The Navy has canceled shipbuilding programs in the past, and the Trump-class ships are still in the design phase of a process that typically takes many years.

Trump's tax and spending cut bill passed in July created a new type of tax-advantageous savings accounts for children, which are now called on the Internal Revenue Service's website "Trump Accounts." , opens new tab

As the accounts were created by an act of Congress, changing their name will likely need congressional approval.

In October, the U.S. Treasury shared draft designs for $1 coins featuring images of Trump to commemorate the 250th anniversary of America's declaration of independence from Great Britain. It has not been confirmed if the Trump coin will be issued next year.

The Trump administration also launched the "Trump Gold Card" , a new immigrant visa program allowing wealthy foreign investors an expedited path to permission to live in the U.S., and TrumpRx.gov , opens new tab , a website offering reduced prices for prescription drugs that will likely launch in 2026.

Even plans for the U.S. Air Force's new fighter jet, the F-47 - while not bearing Trump's name - partly refer to the 47th president, the Air Force said.

The meeting came a day after a Saudi-led strike on Yemen's southern port of Mukalla, which raised tensions between Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates.

In recent weeks, a Saudi-led coalition has clashed with UAE-backed southern separatists in Yemen. The UAE has said it is ending its remaining military mission there, highlighting a widening rift between the Gulf allies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:21:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MV34WNWASVMNDEWA67HVXPBYVM.jpg?auth=8ed5abcfea348477cb1ddb08ca46de85cd60c102d93e8c9a4b7fd6ec0fbdc768&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE foreign policy in spotlight after Yemen escalation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-foreign-policy-spotlight-after-yemen-escalation-2025-12-31/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 31 - The United Arab Emirates has pursued an assertive foreign policy and carved its own sphere of influence across the Middle East and Africa, a strategy in the spotlight after a rare military escalation with Saudi Arabia in Yemen this week.

Abu Dhabi has used alliances with states or proxies, military intervention and financial support mainly to counter what it views as the destabilising threat of political Islam, specifically from groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Senior Emirati officials have described the strategy as strengthening nation-states against extremists, though U.N. experts and Western officials have asserted that the approach has at times fuelled conflict, a charge the UAE denies, and critics say it bolsters authoritarian leaders.

Here are details of the UAE's involvement in key countries:

The UAE announced a withdrawal of its troops from Yemen in 2019, but has maintained influence through the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group it trained and equipped.

It views the STC as a bulwark against the Islah party, a key faction in the Saudi-backed government of Yemen that the UAE regards as a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot, and as a partner in securing maritime access.

Abu Dhabi has been Cairo's most important financial backer since Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government in 2013, viewing a secular Egypt as a firewall against an Islamist resurgence.

In 2024, Emirati sovereign wealth fund ADQ signed a $35 billion deal to develop a prime stretch of Egypt's Mediterranean coast - a vital injection of hard currency while Cairo was strapped for cash.

Their shared distrust of the Muslim Brotherhood anchors their political alliance, which has seen them coordinate the 2017 boycott of Qatar and oppose Turkey's influence in Libya.

Turkey's ruling AK Party has close ties to the Brotherhood.

U.N. sanctions monitors have described what they deemed credible allegations that the UAE provided military support to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, in the civil war against the Sudanese army.

Analysts have said the UAE distrusts the Sudanese Armed Forces chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, due to the presence within his ranks of Islamists from the regime of longtime former Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir, viewing Hemedti - a former partner in Yemen - as a counterweight.

The RSF has been accused, including by the U.S. and rights groups, of committing crimes against humanity and ethnically motivated mass killings in Darfur.

The UAE has strongly denied supplying arms to the RSF, stating in letters to the U.N. that the allegations lack evidence, and emphasizing that its role is strictly humanitarian.

The UAE has strengthened security and economic ties with Chad's transitional President Mahamat Idriss Deby, signing a military cooperation agreement in 2023 and supplying armoured vehicles to the Sahelian state, which it views as a buffer against Islamist insurgents.

Attention has focused on the remote Amdjarass airport near the Sudanese border, where Reuters reported a surge in cargo flights .

While the UAE says it operates a field hospital and delivers aid for Sudanese refugees there, U.N. sanctions monitors and Western officials have alleged that the airstrip serves as a key logistics hub for supplying weapons to the RSF.

The UAE denies the charges, maintaining its operations are purely humanitarian.

The UAE was the primary foreign backer of the east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar, providing air support and equipment to his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) during a 2019 offensive on Tripoli, according to U.N. experts.

The intervention aimed to topple the Tripoli-based, internationally recognised Government of National Accord, which included Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated factions and was supported militarily by Turkey.

While the civil war has been in a fragile stalemate, the UAE remains a key power broker , maintaining close ties to eastern factions and the Haftar family while engaging in diplomatic efforts to shape a government free of what it terms "extremist militias." However, Haftar’s own coalition includes hardline Salafist factions.

In 2020, the UAE broke with decades of Arab consensus by normalising relations with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, a move Saudi Arabia has declined to follow without a path to Palestinian statehood.

The pact formalised a strategic alignment against shared adversaries, specifically Iran and Islamist groups like Hamas.

While the Gaza war has cooled public engagement, with Emirati officials frequently criticising Israeli military conduct, Abu Dhabi has maintained its diplomatic ties, viewing the relationship as a critical lever for regional influence and a unique channel to Washington.

The UAE has cultivated deep economic and security ties with the self-declared republic of Somaliland, as Abu Dhabi has frequently viewed the federal Somali government in Mogadishu as being too close to Qatar and Turkey.

The centrepiece of this strategy is DP World's $442 million investment to develop and operate the Port of Berbera, creating a strategic alternative to Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden.

In 2017, Somaliland's parliament voted to allow the UAE to build a military base in Berbera. While the base was later designated for civilian use, the UAE continues to train Somaliland's security forces while maintaining a consulate-level presence in Hargeisa.

Last week, Israel became the first nation to officially recognise Somaliland's independence , a diplomatic breakthrough that was facilitated by Abu Dhabi, according to an Axios report that cited Israeli officials.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:44:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/37CKWWVHZBOFPF5VX7GUF4SIEM.jpg?auth=f7889bd00b17bf6a03761c06ea2a974f89edb5add0113916b36c965b8dda8677&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians try to access local government building on fourth day of protests, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranians-try-access-local-government-building-fourth-day-protests-state-media-2025-12-31/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Iranian protesters tried to break into a local government building in the southern Fars Province on Wednesday, state media said, on a fourth day of demonstrations over the cost of living that have prompted an unusual government offer of dialogue .

Protests over high inflation and a slump in the value of the local rial currency began among shopkeepers in Tehran on Sunday and by Tuesday had spread to several universities in Tehran, with the reported break-in attempt on Wednesday.

"A few hours ago an organised group tried to get into the governorate building in the city of Fasa, their attack failed with the intervention of security forces," state media said. "The leader of these rioters, a 28-year-old woman, was arrested".

Iran's Tasnim news agency cited a local official as saying four "attackers" were detained and three members of the security forces had been wounded during the incident.

A video carried by state media showed a group of people trying to break open the gate of the building. Reuters verified the location of the footage but was not able to independently verify the timing.

The governor of Fasa told state media that "the protests were caused by inflation and economic conditions. Individuals influenced by hostile channels and media participated in them... the situation is back to normal".

Iranian authorities have responded to previous protests over issues ranging from prices, drought, women's rights and political freedoms with forceful security measures and extensive arrests.

This time the government said it would set up a "dialogue mechanism" with leaders of the demonstrations, the first major protests since Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran in June, which prompted widespread expressions of patriotic solidarity. It has not said how the mechanism would work.

Iran's economy has faced significant challenges for years following the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew from an international agreement concerning Iran's nuclear program during his first term.

Iran's rial currency has lost nearly half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December in a country where unrest has repeatedly flared in recent years.

In September, United Nations sanctions were reinstated, and Reuters reported in October that Iranian authorities held multiple high-level meetings to address economic instability, find ways to bypass sanctions, and handle public discontent.

In 2022, Iran faced protests across the country over price hikes, including for bread, a major staple.

Over the same period and into 2023, the country's clerical rulers faced the boldest unrest in years triggered by the death of a young Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of the morality police, who enforce a strict female dress code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:46:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Sydney helps kick off celebrations as world ushers in 2026</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251231-in-pictures-spectacular-fireworks-light-up-skies-as-world-ushers-in-2026</link><description>The world is welcoming 2026 with a bang as revellers enjoy fireworks and parties to bring in the New Year .

It suggests prohibiting online platforms from providing any "social networking service to a minor under fifteen years of age" from September 1, 2026.

It also seeks to extend an existing ban on mobile phones from preschool through middle school (which France introduced in 2018) to high schools as well.

The draft legislation says "numerous studies and reports now attest to the various risks associated with excessive use of digital screens by teenagers", and lists particular risks as "exposure to inappropriate content", "cyberbullying" and "sleep disturbances".

MPs, mostly from President Emmanuel Macron’s Ensemble pour la République (EPR) party, put forward the bill on November 18.

Macron, who has voiced support for a ban on social media for under-15s, previously said that the bill could be debated by parliament "as early as January".

A French mother whose 15-year-old son died by suicide launched a legal fight in December against some of the world’s biggest social media platforms, alleging their algorithms were flooded with content that drove him into a “downward spiral”.

Clement had only just started his second year of secondary school when he jumped off a bridge in the northwestern region of Brittany in 2024. His family are now seeking to reopen the investigation into his death and hold social media platforms to account.

They filed a complaint against TikTok and Meta , among other social media companies, in September on charges including incitement to suicide .

The vast majority of the videos on his TikTok "For You" page – where the platform's algorithm recommends content – were "inciting him to death, telling him he didn't matter to anyone", Clement's mother told AFP.

A social media ban for teens took effect earlier this month in Australia , making it the first country to institute such a law.

Children under 16 years old are now banned from using social media platforms, including X, TikTok, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat.

New accounts for this age group are prohibited and profiles that existed before the ban are being deactivated.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the new law aimed to support young Australians and ease the mental health pressures that can come from endless scrolling.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:34:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d874de3c-e65f-11f0-9809-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-10T065319Z-170299555-RC2HDIAFJUCF-RTRMADP-3-AUSTRALIA-SOCIALMEDIA-TEENMORE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Aid to Gaza under threat: Dozens of NGOs to be barred under new Israeli rules</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251231-access-to-gaza-under-threat-msf-among-dozens-of-ngos-to-be-barred-under-new-israeli-rules</link><description>Medical charity Doctors Without Borders ( Médecins ⁠Sans Frontières or MSF ) urged Israel to allow it to operate in Gaza and the occupied West Bank in 2026 amid fears that it – and dozens of other NGOS – could be barred from operating in the Palestinian territories because of new Israeli rules set to come into force on January 1.

The organisation has provided care to nearly half a million people in more than two years of war in Gaza , where it currently supports around 20 percent of the hospital beds and a third of births.

"If MSF is prevented from working in Gaza, it will deprive hundreds of thousands of people from accessing medical care," the group said, highlighting the life and death stakes for civilians already struggling to access health services.

Israel’s said that 37 aid organisations – about 15 percent of the organisations operating in Gaza – have failed to comply with its new framework by a deadline that expires at midnight on Wednesday.

The new rules, announced in March, require aid organisations to “submit a list of their Palestinian employees in order to rule out any links to terrorism” and provide details about funding and operations to continue working in Gaza.

Organisations that refused to comply received notice on Tuesday that their licences would be revoked on January 1, with an obligation to cease all activities by March 1, 2026.

Along with MSF, organisations that will have their licenses revoked include the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), World Vision International, CARE and Oxfam, according to a list provided by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.

The EU warned on Wednesday that Israel 's threat to suspend the aid groups would block "life-saving" assistance from reaching Gaza's population.

"The NGO registration law cannot be implemented in its current form," EU humanitarian chief Hadja Lahbib wrote on social media. "IHL (international humanitarian law) leaves no room for doubt: aid must reach those in need."

The United Nations rights chief on Wednesday said Israel's proposed ban was "outrageous", calling on states to urgently insist Israel shift course.

"Such arbitrary suspensions make an already intolerable situation even worse for the people of Gaza," Volker Turk said in a statement.

Israel said the ban would have a limited impact on the ground in Gaza, but the affected organisations say the timing – less than three months into a fragile ceasefire – is devastating.

NGOs currently ensure a large proportion of essential services in Gaza, such as the provision of healthcare, water , food and waste collection.

“There are almost no public systems working,” Claire Nicolet, emergency coordinator for MSF in Gaza, told FRANCE 24. “The majority of basic needs are covered by international organisations.”

The NRC said that being deregulated would mean it would likely be forced to shutter its East Jerusalem office and would not be able to bring foreign aid workers into the Palestinian enclave.

It has around 200 local staff as well as 35 international ‍staff across Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

“The needs in Gaza are enormous and yet we and dozens of other organisations are and will continue to be blocked from bringing in essential life-saving assistance,” said Shaina Low, the NRC's communications adviser.

“Not being able to send staff into Gaza means all of the workload falls on our exhausted local staff,” she added.

Israel said its new framework for aid organisations would prevent "hostile actors or supporters of terrorism" operating in the Palestinian territories, specifically Hamas which it has accused of using aid organisations as a cover for militant activities.

In January, Israel banned the UN Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA , from operating on its territory after repeatedly accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas, using the militant group’s facilities and taking aid – accusations UNRWA denied.

Israel this week accused MSF of employing two individuals with links to Hamas and Islamic Jihad .

"They refuse to provide lists of their Palestinian employees because they know, just as we know, that some of them are involved in terrorism or linked to Hamas," spokesman for the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Gilad Zwick, told AFP.

MSF denied the claim. “MSF would never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity,” it said.

Some aid groups said they didn’t submit the list of Palestinian staff for fear they’d be targeted by Israel, and because of data protection laws in Europe.

“It comes from a legal and safety perspective. In Gaza, we saw hundreds of aid workers get killed,” added Low.

Since October 2023, more than 500 aid workers have been killed in the Palestinian enclave.

“Agreeing for a party to the conflict to vet our staff, especially under the conditions of occupation, is a violation of humanitarian principles, specifically neutrality and independence,” added Athena Rayburn, the executive director of AIDA, an umbrella organisation representing over 100 organisations that operate in the Palestinian territories.

Rayburn said offered alternatives to submitting staff lists, such as third-party vetting, but that Israel refused to engage in any dialogue and did not confirm that the data collected from the new regulations wouldn't be used for military or intelligence purposes.

The Israeli framework also includes ideological requirements, including disqualifying organisations that have called for boycotts against Israel, denied the October 7 attack or expressed support for any of the international court cases against Israeli soldiers or leaders.

The ban on major aid providers comes as Gaza’s war-torn population is living through harsh winter conditions and bracing for rains and flooding that peak in January and February.

“We are entering the third winter in a row that is really complicated for the population in Gaza. Most of the population is living inside tents, makeshift shelters and destroyed buildings,” Nicolet said, noting that some shelters were so unstable that they had been lost in strong winds.

At the same time, NGOs and the UN say that the amount of aid entering Gaza is already inadequate , with only 100 to 300 trucks allowed in per day.

The October 10 ceasefire agreement stipulated that 600 aid trucks should be allowed into the Palestinian territory every day.

But provision is “not at scale”, and humanitarian organisations are already “not able to respond to the needs” on the ground, said Nicolet.

While MSF continues to provide health services, “we are not able to do what we could do with better materials or better quantities … we are really not able to provide for the population,” she added.

“And maybe now we will do even less in the coming weeks and months.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:34:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4b015840-e65b-11f0-9cce-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25115623438822.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France aims to ban under-15s from social media from September 2026, Le Monde reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-aims-ban-under-15s-social-media-september-2026-le-monde-reports-2025-12-31/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - France plans to ban children under 15 from social media sites and to prohibit mobile phones in high schools from September 2026, local media reported on Wednesday, moves that underscore rising public angst over the impact of online harms on minors.

President Emmanuel Macron has often pointed to social media as one of the factors to blame for violence among young people and has signalled he wants France to follow Australia, whose world-first ban for under-16s on social media platforms including Facebook (META.O) , opens new tab , Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab came into force in December.

Le Monde newspaper said Macron could announce the measures in his New Year's Eve national address, due to be broadcast at 1900 GMT. His government will submit draft legislation for legal checks in early January, Le Monde and France Info reported.

The Elysee and the prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports.

Mobile phones have been banned in French primary and middle schools since 2018 and the reported new changes would extend that ban to high schools. Pupils aged 11 to 15 attend middle schools in the French educational system.

France also passed a law in 2023 requiring social platforms to obtain parental consent for under-15s to create accounts, though technical challenges have impeded its enforcement.

Macron said in June he would push for regulation at the level of the European Union to ban access to social media for all under-15s after a fatal stabbing at a school in eastern France shocked the nation.

The European Parliament in November urged the EU to set minimum ages for children to access social media to combat a rise in mental health problems among adolescents from excessive exposure, although it is member states which impose age limits.

Various other countries have also taken steps to regulate children's access to social media.

Macron heads into the New Year with his domestic legacy in tatters after his gamble on parliamentary elections in 2024 led to a hung parliament, triggering France's worst political crisis in decades that has seen a succession of weak governments.

However, cracking down further on minors' access to social media could prove popular, according to opinion polls. A Harris Interactive survey in 2024 showed 73% of those canvassed supporting a ban on social media access for under-15s.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LD7CYDK2YFNI5JAHSBKT3DGF2U.jpg?auth=e8e4f4cdea1fd9b8de3fef932a8e378cf83cdd8d109a53a7ee919920e43c02d5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland seizes ship sailing from Russia after suspected undersea cable sabotage</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251231-finland-seizes-ship-sailing-from-russia-after-suspected-undersea-cable-sabotage</link><description>Finnish police seized on Wednesday a ship sailing from Russia suspected of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland , an area hit by a string of similar incidents in recent years.

The seized cargo vessel "Fitburg" was en route ​from the Russian port of St Petersburg to Israel at the time of the incident, Finland's Border Guard authority told a press conference ‍in Helsinki.

"At the moment we suspect aggravated disruption of telecommunications and also aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage," Helsinki Chief of Police Jari Liukku told reporters.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as ​an increase in hybrid threats from Russia since it launched its war in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

Earlier this month, NATO 's ​top military commander said the alliance must be ready to respond to these types of threats to defend its territory.

Hybrid threats refer to both military and non-military tactics designed to undermine an adversary's security. They can include cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, sabotage of key infrastructure and use of drones or irregular armed groups.

The Fitburg's 14 crew members were from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and were all held by Finnish police, investigators said. The ship sailed under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.

According to LSEG data, the owner of the vessel is Fitburg Shipping Company Ltd and the manager is Albros Shipping and Trading Ltd. Reuters was ‍not able to reach either of those companies via telephone.

Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, ​telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years.

"We remain in contact with the Finnish authorities, through exchange of information, via the NATO ‌shipping centre located at our Allied Maritime Command in Northwood, UK," an official at the military alliance said.

The Fitburg was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard said. The cable ‍belongs to Finnish telecoms group Elisa.

Estonia's justice ministry said a second telecoms cable connecting the country to Finland had also suffered an outage on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the cable, belonging to Sweden's Arelion, was running parallel to Elisa's.

An Arelion spokesperson confirmed that the company had suffered an outage.

"I'm concerned about the reported damage ... Hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify," Estonia's President Alar Karis said on X.

The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen wrote on X.

Finland in December 2024 boarded the Russian-linked oil tanker Eagle S which investigators said had damaged a ‍power cable and several telecoms links in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.

A Finnish court in October dismissed a criminal case against the Eagle S captain and other crew members, ‌ruling prosecutors failed to prove intent ​and that any alleged negligence must be pursued by the ship's flag state or the crew's home countries.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:51:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e7a5fb0-e660-11f0-9e36-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89CT2Q3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin, in New Year address, voices confidence in victory in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-putin-new-year-address-voices-confidence-victory-ukraine-2025-12-31/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual televised New Year's address to rally his troops fighting in Ukraine, saying he believed in them and in victory in a war that he has framed as part of an existential struggle with the West.

U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to broker an end to the nearly four-year-old conflict, Europe's bloodiest conflagration since World War Two, with both sides' negotiating stances still far apart.

Dressed in a black coat, Putin - whose forces are advancing slowly but steadily in Ukraine - spoke about Russia's destiny and the unity of its people, which he said guaranteed the sovereignty and security of the "Fatherland".

He paid tribute in particular to his forces fighting in Ukraine, calling them heroes.

"Millions of people across Russia — I assure you — are with you on this New Year's Eve," said Putin.

"They are thinking of you, empathising with you, hoping for you. I wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy coming New Year! We believe in you and our Victory!"

His speech, which was first broadcast in Russia's far east, came as Russia released video footage of what it said was a downed drone, presenting it as evidence that Ukraine had tried this week to attack a presidential residence. Kyiv has dismissed Russia's allegation as a lie designed to derail peace talks.

In another video released on Wednesday, Russia's top general told troops to keep carving out buffer zones in Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv regions and said Moscow's forces had advanced faster in December than in any other month in 2025.

Reuters could not verify his battlefield assertion.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:19:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IFCZ5KFZLNLVZBKNBIASZ4TYQI.jpg?auth=ad337853fcbac45e7afceea2f7625b2742eb7cd987e04feea6f90db11670773a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What we know about the Saudi-led air strikes on ships in Yemen</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251231-strike-ships-yemen-saudi-arabia-uae</link><description>Images of the air strike on Yemen’s port of Mukalla on Tuesday, December 30, 2025, have circulated widely across global media, including flames burning along the shoreline and a column of black smoke rising over the port.

The Saudi-led military coalition that carried out the strike claimed the bombardment targeted “weapons and combat vehicles” unloaded from two ships arriving from the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates . According to the coalition, these arms were intended “to support the Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces”, a separatist group that has been waging an offensive for several weeks against the forces of Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

Saudi Arabia backs the government, which also faces opposition from Houthi rebels , a Shia Islamist movement that controls Yemen’s capital, Sanaa . While officially backing the internationally recognised government, the UAE has faced accusations from both Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government of supporting STC separatists.

According to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), the bombardment of the Mukalla port resulted in no casualties, a claim that available footage can neither confirm nor deny.

Regarding physical damage, however, a video released by AFP shows one of the targeted areas within the port. The footage clearly depicts dozens of white and beige vehicles parked near an industrial terminal. While some have been burned and completely destroyed, others appear untouched. Firefighters can be seen working among the charred remains of the vehicles to extinguish the blaze.

The scene can be geolocated to the port of Mukalla. It is one of the primary coastal cities in Hadramaut, the region currently targeted by the STC separatist offensive.

The vehicles appearing in this video are also identifiable as troop carriers manufactured by the UAE-based Streit Group. Specifically, the Spartan and Cougar models from their vehicle lineup can be recognised.

In a statement , the United Arab Emirates denied that the vehicles were bound for STC separatists, asserting that “they were not intended for any Yemeni party, but were shipped for use by UAE forces operating in Yemen ”.

This would not be the first time Streit Group vehicles have been identified in the hands of STC fighters. Several journalists and analysts documented their presence on the ground during the group's recent offensive in Hadramaut.

While the Saudi-led coalition’s statement claimed that cargo from "two ships" was targeted, the footage provided by the coalition to the media only shows one vessel in detail.

The letters "SAMC" are visible on a vessel's hull. According to the caption, the ship is the Greenland, which reportedly departed from the port of Fujairah in the UAE.

Data from maritime traffic-tracking sites confirm that the vessel departed from the United Arab Emirates. The ship called at the ports of Jebel Ali in Dubai and Fujairah. Its last known position was recorded off the coast of Yemen on December 26. Since then, the vessel appears to have disabled its tracking system – a common practice for vessels engaged in illicit economic activities or navigating high-risk waters.

According to MarineTraffic, which utilises a wider range of data sources, the vessel arrived at the port of Mukalla on December 28. It reportedly departed on December 30 for the Emirati port of Fujairah, suggesting the ship was not destroyed in the attack.

The "SAMC" logo on the hull refers to the vessel's owner: the Emirati-based Salem Al-Makrani Cargo Company. The Greenland is listed as part of the fleet on the company’s official website .

A second vessel from the same company followed the same path as the Greenland: the Socotra 3. It also transited through the ports of Jebel Ali and Fujairah before arriving at Mukalla on December 26, a few days before the bombing. This may be the second ship from Fujairah that the coalition mentioned.

As evidenced by footage captured following the attack, it appears that not all vehicles delivered by the two Emirati vessels were destroyed. Video released by the coalition shows several of the vehicles travelling in convoys away from the port.

Additional footage released throughout the day on December 30 shows a convoy of Streit Group-manufactured vehicles. Their models and colours match those delivered by Emirati vessels, with the white Cougar variants being identifiable.

These images were captured in the town of Buwaysh, east of Mukalla, where a local bank branch is visible in the background. While the filming date remains unverified, we could not find any record of the video prior to December 30. This suggests that the delivery of these vehicles to Mukalla was, at least in part, successful.

Following the bombardment of the port of Mukalla, Yemen’s internationally recognised government has cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, ordering its forces to leave the country within 24 hours. This demand, backed by Saudi Arabia, has prompted the UAE to announce the withdrawal of its troops from Yemen.

Some 63 percent of French people did not intend to watch the annual New Year 's address, according to the latest Toluna/Harris Interactive poll for LCI news channel, while the president's approval rating is at its lowest since 2017 at 25 percent.

Macron will attempt to regain some momentum and launch the final projects of his second five-year term during his New Year's address.

Macron "will be keen to show that he will do everything to ensure that 2026 is a year of action, a year of purpose", those close to him said ahead of his speech.

The framework of his address is already in place, with the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine – which will enter its fifth year in February – to figure prominently.

Other topics that will be addressed include social media regulation, the return of a voluntary conscription service in France and legislation on end-of-life care.

Macron wants to ensure that 2026 will be characterised by action and progress on a number of fronts, his entourage said.

Without "falling into blind optimism", Macron will also seek to combat the trend of " French bashing " – denigrating France – which is so often pushed by the "self-proclaimed patriots" on the far right .</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:43:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/12b9f8da-e5f6-11f0-965b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/b0074072e43547de4ba9d58ce152e4051df35bfe.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US held talks with Ukraine, European countries on next steps in ending Ukraine war, Witkoff says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-held-talks-with-ukraine-european-countries-next-steps-ending-ukraine-war-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's advisers held talks on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany to discuss the next steps in ending Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said.

"We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of @POTUS' peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart," Witkoff said in a social media post.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov also participated.

Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that national security advisers from Kyiv's "Coalition of the Willing" backers would meet in Ukraine on Saturday, and then country leaders would gather in France on January 6.

The Coalition grouping led by Britain and France includes more than 30 nations, though it was not immediately clear which would be taking part in the meetings.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GKPFOWTLX5LJ3FVAODKEEGMQYE.jpg?auth=f315347f4e9a676528d58b9eb282a8b5d04fb77977eaffec4a8a37edfe62eb9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge blocks Trump move to end protected status for thousands from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-move-end-protected-status-thousands-honduras-nepal-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua after opponents argued the terminations were motivated by racial hostility.

The administration's decisions to end Temporary Protected Status for some 89,000 migrants failed to adequately consider conditions in the three countries that would prevent them from returning, San Francisco-based District Judge Trina Thompson wrote.

Thompson cited statements by Republican President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem portraying immigrants as criminals and a drain on U.S. society.

"These statements reflect a stereotyping of the immigrants protected under the TPS program as criminal invaders and perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population," wrote Thompson, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.

TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to people already in the U.S. if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. Under the program, Noem has the authority to grant, extend or terminate TPS designations for specific countries.

Trump has sought to end most TPS enrollment as part of a broader effort to restrict both legal and illegal immigration. In TPS termination notices, the administration has said that allowing the migrants to remain in the U.S. is contrary to the country's interests.

The Supreme Court in October allowed the Trump administration to proceed with ending TPS for some 300,000 Venezuelans, but lower courts have continued to rule against other terminations. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston blocked a move to end protections for hundreds of migrants from South Sudan.

In her ruling, Thompson found that the National TPS Alliance, a group representing the TPS enrollees, had plausibly alleged the terminations were motivated by racial animus.

The program covers some 72,000 Hondurans, 13,000 Nepalese and 4,000 Nicaraguans, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:17:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PCQU2YOBCRMC7L5CQCSPNEMGRE.jpg?auth=99ca905ba7bf78f96a8aff1e3b3986bbe5af1837910ab40c664bef63636bfb02&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US targets crude oil tankers, firms in new Venezuela-related sanctions, Treasury website shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-targets-crude-oil-tankers-firms-new-venezuela-related-sanctions-treasury-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four companies it said were operating in Venezuela’s oil sector as well as associated oil tankers, as President Donald Trump's administration increases pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on oil traders engaged in sanctions evasion for Maduro's government. Among the targets were four vessels, some of which the Treasury accused of being part of the so-called "shadow fleet".

"Today’s action further signals that those involved in the Venezuelan oil trade continue to face significant sanctions risks," the Treasury said in the statement.

The sanctions mark the latest action in Trump's pressure campaign on Maduro, which has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels allegedly trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation.

This month, Trump announced a blockade of all sanctioned vessels going in or out of Venezuelan waters as part of a strategy to pressure Maduro. The U.S. move has cut oil exports this month to about half of their November level.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:37:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AJ54ICZPQFJCTDXBXK2WCMZRIY.jpg?auth=46b83184753bbcca3f47722594826764d364341a43b7a2651a3629bebd246afa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron: allies will make commitments on protecting Ukraine at Jan 6 meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-allies-will-make-commitments-protecting-ukraine-jan-6-meeting-2025-12-31/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - European leaders meeting in Paris on January 6 will make firm commitments towards protecting Ukraine after any peace deal with Russia is brokered, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday during his New Year Eve's speech.

Macron has convened a meeting of the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' next Tuesday. The Coalition grouping led by Britain and France includes more than 30 nations.

"On January 6 in Paris, many European states and allies will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent," Macron said.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff earlier said that ways to strength security guarantees for Ukraine were discussed during Wednesday talks between U.S. officials, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany.

In mid December, the leaders of several European countries including Germany, France and Britain, said there had been "strong convergence" with the U.S. after talks in Berlin and stated a list of goals for both sides to work towards.

These included commitments to supporting Ukraine's armed forces, a European-led peacekeeping force and guarantees to use force if Ukraine came under attack again.

Kyiv has come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to make concessions to Russia to enable a deal. Ukraine's European allies say any peace accord must ensure robust security guarantees backed by U.S. support.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:23:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLJLF76EJVNJ3JAQXFGZYHG52M.jpg?auth=28e69e052636da73b8808b159bd856aca94ab02f420ef3b4a09028b98c57049e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One killed, several security forces wounded in Syria's Aleppo after suicide attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-heard-syrias-aleppo-ekhbariya-tv-reports-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber targeted a police patrol in Aleppo in Syria, killing one person and wounding several members of the security forces, Syria's state news agency said on Wednesday.

On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov alleged that Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence in the northern Novgorod region with dozens of drones, adding that Moscow would review its negotiating position as a result.

U.S. national security officials have found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

The paper reported the conclusion was supported by a CIA assessment that found no attempt to target Putin or one of his residences. A CIA spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for the Russian charge, telling reporters on Monday that Putin had informed him of the alleged incident and that he was "very angry" about it.

By Wednesday, he appeared more skeptical, sharing on social media a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

Ukraine has denied it carried out such an attack, describing the allegation as a Russian disinformation campaign meant to drive a wedge between Kyiv and Washington after a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that both sides described as cordial and productive.

In a detailed briefing paper that Ukraine distributed to European Union delegations on Tuesday and seen by Reuters, Kyiv alleged the Russian allegations were designed to "sabotage" agreements made during the South Florida meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy.

On Wednesday, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, called Russia's claims "a deliberate distraction."

"No one should accept unfounded claims from the aggressor who has indiscriminately targeted Ukraine's infrastructure and civilians since the start of the war," she wrote on X.

As of Wednesday, there was no independent confirmation of the attack. But Russia's charges - and the European and Ukrainian reaction - underscored how both sides have sought to shape Trump's view of the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old.

“There is no evidence” that Putin seeks peace and wants Ukraine to be successful, as Trump asserted last weekend after speaking to the Russian leader, said Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served as special representative for Ukraine negotiations during Trump’s first term.

"All evidence is to the contrary,” he added.

The Russian and Ukrainian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The White House also did not immediately respond.

On Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry released video footage showing a senior officer, Major General Alexander Romanenkov, setting out details of how Moscow says it believes Ukraine attacked Putin's Novgorod residence.

The video included footage of a Russian serviceman standing next to fragments of a device that he said was a downed Ukrainian Chaklun-V drone carrying a 6-kg explosive device, which had not detonated.

Ukraine's foreign ministry dismissed the footage, saying it was "absolutely confident" no attack took place.

Before Lavrov made his accusation on Monday, Novgorod Governor Alexander Dronov said air defense and fighter jets were shooting down Ukrainian drones.

While Trump said on Monday the attack could have been a Russian false flag operation, he has at times appeared willing to accept controversial statements by Putin at face value.

Earlier this year, Trump repeated Putin’s assertions that Russian forces had encircled Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, even as U.S. intelligence indicated that was not true.

The debate over the alleged Ukrainian attack also comes as some Western intelligence officials have quietly argued Russia has sought to delay additional punitive moves by Washington designed to force Moscow into a peace deal.

Reuters was unable to determine if the U.S. intelligence community has already made an assessment of the alleged attack or presented any relevant findings to Congress.

In the Ukrainian briefing paper seen by Reuters, Kyiv noted that in the hours after the alleged attack, various Russian officials made extremely similar comments in public that - in Ukraine's view - suggested pre-coordination among officials in Moscow.

The paper also noted that residents of a town near Putin's Novgorod residence told local media they heard no sounds of air defenses on the night of the alleged attack.

The Russian defense ministry published inconsistent accounts of the alleged Ukrainian drone attacks.

In a statement posted late on Sunday on its channel on the Telegram messaging platform, the ministry said 89 long-range Ukrainian attack drones were intercepted around the country between 7 a.m. the day before and 11 p.m. that evening.

They included 18 that were hit over the Novgorod region, it said, without alleging that any were involved in an attack on Putin’s residence there.

On Monday afternoon, the ministry issued a second statement that its air defenses had intercepted 91 drones, all of them bound for Putin’s residence, including 41 that were hit over Novgorod, between Saturday and Sunday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:20:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NIDEVIWJZJJLTLIUNUX663GJOA.jpg?auth=283b3ae32e71d18ebb64467e7ad56a44ba0f6171242922cd75fa7198da1cedc5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he won’t sign weak deal that will only prolong war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-he-wont-sign-weak-deal-that-will-only-prolong-war-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his New Year address to the nation, said late on Wednesday that Ukraine wanted the war to end, but not at any cost, adding he would not sign a "weak" peace agreement that would only prolong the war.

"What does Ukraine want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to the war but not the end of Ukraine," Zelenskiy said in the address from his office, issued just before midnight. "Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken."

Zelenskiy said any signature "placed on weak agreements only fuel the war. My signature will be placed on a strong agreement.

The Trump administration has carried out more than 30 strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September in a campaign that has killed at least 110 people.

In a statement, the U.S. military's Southern Command said the military had carried out a strike against three vessels.

"Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels," Southern Command wrote on X.

A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said eight people had abandoned their vessels and were being searched for.

The Coast Guard told Reuters it had deployed a C-130 aircraft to look for survivors and was working with vessels in the area.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:21:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU warns Yemen developments risk Gulf stability</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-warns-yemen-developments-risk-gulf-stability-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - The European Union said on Wednesday that recent developments in the Yemeni provinces of Hadramout and Al Mahra threaten to bring new risks to the Gulf region.

Trump said in a social media post on Wednesday that he was removing the Guard troops for the time being. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again — only a question of time!” he wrote.

Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration. They had been sent to Chicago and Portland but were never on the streets as legal challenges played out.

The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centrepiece of his second term and has floated invoking the Insurrection Act to prevent opponents from using the courts to block his plans.

He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year’s midterm elections .

In November, US Northern Command said it was “shifting and/or rightsizing” operations in Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles, but that there would be a “constant, enduring and long-term presence in each city”.

Trump’s push to deploy troops in Democrat -led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.

The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area as part of its crackdown on immigration. The order was not a final ruling, but it marked a significant and rare setback from the high court for the president’s efforts.

In the nation’s capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to halt the deployment of more than 2,000 guardsmen.

Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.

California National Guard troops were removed from the streets of Los Angeles by December 15 after a court ruling. An appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Governor Gavin Newsom .

In a court filing on Tuesday, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order, paving the way for the California National Guard to fully return to state control after Trump federalised the force in June.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the development a “major litigation victory” in a press release on Wednesday.

“For six months, California National Guard troops have been used as political pawns by a president desperate to be king,” Bonta said. “There is a reason our founders decided military and civilian affairs must be kept separate; a reason that our military is, by design, apolitical.”

Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September to combat crime, a move supported by the state’s Republican Governor Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/684d59d2-e0f5-11f0-9372-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T210932Z-1726505758-RC2D8HA495UL-RTRMADP-3-USA-COURT-TRUMP-ILLINOIS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jong Un attends New Year's celebrations, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-attends-new-years-celebrations-kcna-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended New Year's celebrations in Pyongyang including fireworks, patriotic songs and dances and a taekwondo demonstration, state media KCNA said on Thursday.

In a speech, Kim lauded the North Korean people's efforts which led to "successes and phenomenal changes" in 2025, and called for their unity as a key party congress expected to be held in early 2026 will lay out the future direction for the country.

North Korea is expected to hold the 9th Congress of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea soon, which will lay out the country's plans for the next five years in various fields such as nuclear and weapons development, as well as the economy.

Kim also sent a New Year's message to North Korean troops fighting on Russia's side in the war in Ukraine, calling them the "greatest strength and pride and a strong pillar" of the country and saying he looks forward to their reunion back home.

"Be brave. Behind you are Pyongyang and Moscow," Kim said in the message, according to KCNA.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:20:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6UQPVRDUZPRLNHB2ZMT32RGF4.jpg?auth=0c0f0b4ddc0bf522471b6fd32b61801b249cb68c8eb6678f409885f4e8a8c98a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pentagon says Lockheed Martin gets $328.5 million Taiwan military sale contract</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/pentagon-says-lockheed-martin-gets-3285-million-taiwan-military-sale-contract-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Wednesday that Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab was given a contract involving foreign military sales to Taiwan to meet what Washington calls "an urgent operational need" of the Taiwan Air Force.

The contract has a ceiling value of $328.5 million, with $157.3 million in foreign military sales funds obligated at the time of award, the Pentagon said in a statement , opens new tab .

Washington has formal diplomatic ties with China , but maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island's most important arms supplier . The U.S. is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, though such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China.

Taiwan remained on high alert on Wednesday after China staged massive military drills around the island the previous day, keeping its emergency maritime response centre running as it monitored Chinese naval maneuvers, the coast guard said.

"This contract provides for the procurement and delivery of fifty-five Infrared Search and Track Legion Enhanced Sensor pods, processors, pod containers, and processor containers required to meet the urgent operational need of the Taiwan Air Force," the Pentagon said.

It added that the contract's work will be performed in Orlando, Florida, and is expected to be completed by June 2031.

In mid-December, the administration of President Donald Trump announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever U.S. weapons package for the island which is under increasing military pressure from China.

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, and it has not ruled out using force to take it under Chinese control. Taiwan, which rejects China's claims, condemned the latest drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:20:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B5GS2RJH3JLONEW5ZFI4CHONVU.jpg?auth=223593a14afc23271413a041dd22d190379cb24bac6af393d712a2df3f0c64d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says three killed in strikes on alleged drug boats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251231-us-military-says-three-killed-in-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats</link><description>The US military announced on Wednesday that three people were killed in strikes on three alleged drug boats in international waters, bringing the death toll in Washington’s campaign against what it says are narcotics traffickers to at least 110.

US Southern Command, which is responsible for American forces operating in Central and South America, said the strikes targeted “three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy”. All three people killed were on one boat.

The exact location of the strikes was not immediately made clear. Previous strikes have taken place in the Caribbean or the eastern Pacific.

The military said that the targeted vessels were operated by “designated terrorist organisations” that it did not identify.

Accompanying the statement, posted on X, was a video showing three boats travelling together at sea and then hit by a series of explosions.

“Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels,” it said.

The military said it had notified the Coast Guard to “activate the search and rescue system”, without offering more details about the fate of those aboard the other boats.

Since September, the US military has carried out more than 30 such strikes on what it says are boats used to smuggle drugs to the United States, without providing any concrete evidence that the targeted boats are involved in trafficking.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States.

In recent months, US President Donald Trump has waged a pressure campaign against Venezuela ’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro , accusing him of running a drug cartel.

Maduro denies the allegation and has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain access to the Latin American country’s massive oil reserves.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:42:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/800dbe28-c20e-11f0-9bdd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-74UP2KE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan vows to defend sovereignty after China's military drill</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-vows-defend-sovereignty-after-chinas-military-drill-2026-01-01/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday the island is determined to defend its sovereignty and boost defence in the face of China's rising ambition for expansion, after Beijing fired rockets towards the island in a military drill.

Palestinian refugee agency, a U.N. spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said the move would "further impede" the agency's ability to operate and carry out activities.

"The Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations remains applicable to UNRWA ( United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ), its property and assets, and to its officials and other personnel. Property used by UNRWA is inviolable," Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general, said while adding that UNRWA is an "integral" part of the world body.

UNRWA Commissioner General Phillipe Lazzarini also condemned the move, saying that it was part of an ongoing " systematic campaign to discredit  UNRWA and thereby obstruct" the role it plays in providing assistance to Palestinian refugees.

In 2024, the Israeli parliament passed a law banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the agency.

As a result, UNRWA operates in East Jerusalem, which the U.N. considers territory occupied by Israel. Israel considers all Jerusalem to be part of the country.

The agency provides education, health and aid to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It has long had tense relations with Israel but ties have deteriorated sharply since the start of the war in Gaza and Israel has called repeatedly for UNRWA to be disbanded, with its responsibilities transferred to other U.N. agencies.

The prohibition of basic utilities to the U.N. agency came as Israel also suspended of dozens of international non-governmental organizations working in Gaza due to a failure to meet new rules to vet those groups.

In a joint statement, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom said on Tuesday such a move would have a severe impact on the access of essential services, including healthcare. They said one in three healthcare facilities in Gaza would close if international NGO operations stopped.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 01:55:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CGHA6UP6LVNR5BHSCXNXV45BR4.jpg?auth=cd29fc083ea6cf5343277ed24d44c51f9ff06d68713b8d2e62ede9fafe00ad2c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan vows to defend sovereignty amid Chinese military drills</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260101-taiwan-vows-to-defend-sovereignty-amid-chinese-military-drills</link><description>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday that the island is determined to defend its sovereignty and bolster its defence in the face of China’s growing assertiveness, after Beijing fired rockets towards Taiwan during military drills .

“The international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people possess the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in a New Year’s speech broadcast live from the presidential office in Taipei.

He urged opposition parties to support his proposal to increase Taiwan’s defence spending by $40 billion, a plan currently stalled amid a political deadlock in the opposition-controlled parliament.

“Whether China can achieve its goals on schedule is one thing,” Lai said when asked about a US report suggesting China could have the capability to win a conflict over Taiwan by 2027.

“The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” he added, saying the island must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best.”

“We are willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China on an equal and dignified basis, promoting a peaceful and shared environment across the strait,” Lai said. “As long as China acknowledges the existence of the Republic of China and respects the Taiwanese people’s desire for a democratic and free way of life.”

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under Chinese control. Taiwan rejects these claims.

Lai’s speech came just two days after Chinese exercises named “Justice Mission 2025”. China fired dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deployed a large number of warships and aircraft near the island, a show of force that drew concern from Western allies including the European Commission and the United Kingdom.

Taipei condemned the drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation. Beijing announced late on Wednesday that it had completed the exercises, stating its military would continue to strengthen combat readiness.

China’s President Xi Jinping struck a familiar tone on Taiwan in his New Year’s address on Wednesday, repeating last year’s warning to what Beijing considers separatist forces that China’s “reunification” with Taiwan cannot be stopped.

The drills, China’s largest by area and the closest yet to Taiwan, forced the island to cancel dozens of domestic commercial flights and dispatch military jets and warships to monitor the exercises.

The Chinese manoeuvres began 11 days after the United States announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan. China’s military said for the first time that the drills were aimed at deterring outside intervention.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 03:52:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4a647a80-e510-11f0-b7a1-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25336133707524.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland seizes ship sailing from Russia after suspected cable sabotage in Baltic Sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/finland-suspects-ship-causing-undersea-cable-damage-president-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>HELSINKI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Finnish police on Wednesday seized a ship sailing from Russia on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland, an area hit by a string of similar incidents in recent years.

The seized cargo vessel "Fitburg" was en route from the Russian port of St Petersburg to Israel at the time of the incident, Finland's Border Guard authority told a press conference in Helsinki.

"At the moment we suspect aggravated disruption of telecommunications and also aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage," Helsinki Chief of Police Jari Liukku told reporters.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as an increase in hybrid threats from Russia since it launched its war in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

Earlier this month, NATO's top military commander said the alliance must be ready to respond to these type of threats to defend its territory.

Hybrid threats refer to both military and non-military tactics designed to undermine an adversary's security. They can include cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, sabotage of key infrastructure and use of drones or irregular armed groups.

The Fitburg's 14 crew members were from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and were all held by Finnish police, investigators said. The ship sailed under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.

According to LSEG data, the owner of the vessel is Fitburg Shipping Company Ltd and the manager is Albros Shipping and Trading Ltd. Reuters was not able to reach either of those companies via telephone.

Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years.

"We remain in contact with the Finnish authorities, through exchange of information, via the NATO shipping centre located at our Allied Maritime Command in Northwood, UK," an official at the military alliance said.

The Fitburg was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard said. The cable belongs to Finnish telecoms group Elisa.

Estonia's justice ministry said a second telecoms cable connecting the country to Finland had also suffered an outage on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the cable, belonging to Sweden's Arelion, was running parallel to Elisa's.

An Arelion spokesperson confirmed that the company had suffered an outage.

"I'm concerned about the reported damage... Hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify," Estonia's President Alar Karis said on X.

The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen wrote on X.

Finland in December 2024 boarded the Russian-linked oil tanker Eagle S which investigators said had damaged a power cable and several telecoms links in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.

A Finnish court in October dismissed a criminal case against the Eagle S captain and other crew members, ruling prosecutors failed to prove intent and that any alleged negligence must be pursued by the ship's flag state or the crew's home countries.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:51:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z3F6EU7ZYROO5LXWRMIMRGVTHQ.jpg?auth=574d16f439f8dc019ef7217a81e10fb3809e39c926c6a361be0da9bf916e8165&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed after explosion in Swiss ski resort bar, BBC reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/several-killed-after-explosion-swiss-ski-resort-bar-bbc-reports-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - Several people were killed and others injured after an explosion in a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, BBC reported on Thursday, citing police.

Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to support Russia's nearly four-year invasion of Ukraine, according to South Korean and Western intelligence agencies.

At least 600 have died and thousands more have sustained injuries, according to South Korean estimates that could not be independently confirmed.

On Thursday Kim praised his men fighting in an "alien land", congratulating their "heroic" defence of the nation's honour and instructing them to "be brave", the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

"As the whole country is enveloped in a festive atmosphere of greeting the new year, I all the more miss you, who are fighting bravely on the battlefields in the alien land even at this moment," he said.

Kim hinted that more overseas action could take place this year, highlighting "remarkable feats you will perform on the overseas battlefields".

Russian air defence units downed five Ukrainian drones headed ​for Moscow ‍on New Year's Eve, Mayor Sergei ​Sobyanin said.

Sobyanin, in a ​series of posts on Telegram over a little more than three hours into early on Thursday morning, said specialist ‍crews were examining fragments from ​the drones at the sites where they had hit the ‌ground.

Sobyanin made no mention of ‍casualties or damage.

Restrictions were placed on Moscow's Domodedovo airport for a time. Other airports in southern and ‍central Russia were also subject to ‌temporary ​restrictions.

Speaking in his New Year address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine ⁠wanted the war to end, but not at any cost. He added that he would not sign a "weak" peace agreement that would only prolong the war.

Zelensky said Ukrainians were exhausted from nearly four years of war.

"What does Ukraine ​want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to ​the war but not the end of Ukraine," Zelensky, wearing a dark green embroidered Ukrainian shirt, said in the 21-minute address issued just before midnight.

"Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken."

Zelensky said any signature "placed on weak agreements only fuel the war".

"My signature will be placed on a strong agreement. And that is exactly what every meeting, every phone call, ‍every decision is about now," he said. "To secure a strong peace for everyone, not for a day, a week or two months, ​but peace for years."

Zelensky said weeks of US-led diplomacy, including his talks last weekend with US President Donald Trump in Florida, had produced a peace deal that was nearly ready.

"A ‌peace agreement is 90 percent ready, 10 percent remains," he said. "That 10 percent contains everything, it is the 10 percent that will determine the fate of peace, the ‍fate of Ukraine and Europe and how people will live."

Mamdani, a Democrat , was sworn in as the first Muslim leader of America’s biggest city, placing his hand on a Quran as he took his oath.

“This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,” Mamdani said in a brief speech.

The ceremony, administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political ally, took place at the old City Hall station, one of the city’s original subway stops, known for its stunning arched ceilings.

In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani said the old subway station was a “testament to the importance of public transport to the vitality, the health and the legacy of our city”, as he announced the appointment of his new Department of Transportation commissioner, Mike Flynn.

The new mayor then closed with a smile. “Thank you all so much, now I will see you later,” he said, before heading up a flight of stairs.

Mamdani will be sworn in again, in grander style, at a public ceremony at City Hall at 1 p.m., to be administered by US Senator Bernie Sanders , one of the mayor’s political heroes. That will be followed by what the new administration is billing as a public block party on a stretch of Broadway known as the “Canyon of Heroes”, famous for its ticker-tape parades.

Mamdani now begins one of the most unrelenting jobs in American politics as one of the country’s most closely watched politicians.

In addition to being the city’s first Muslim mayor, Mamdani is also its first leader of South Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. At 34, he is also the youngest mayor New York City has had in generations.

In a campaign that helped make “affordability” a buzzword across the political spectrum, the democratic socialist promised transformative change, with policies intended to lower the cost of living in one of the world’s most expensive cities. His platform included free childcare, free buses, a rent freeze for about one million households, and a pilot programme of city-run grocery stores.

But he will also have to contend with the less glamorous responsibilities of City Hall: dealing with rubbish, snow and rats, while being blamed for subway delays and potholes.

Mamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and academic and author Mahmood Mamdani. His family moved to New York City when he was seven, and he grew up in a post-9/11 city where Muslims did not always feel welcome. He became an American citizen in 2018.

He worked on political campaigns for Democratic candidates in the city before seeking public office himself, winning a state Assembly seat in 2020 to represent part of Queens.

Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, will leave their one-bedroom, rent-stabilised apartment in the outer boroughs to take up residence in the stately mayoral home in Manhattan.

He inherits a city on the upswing after years of slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime has fallen back to pre-pandemic lows, tourists have returned, and unemployment, which surged during the pandemic years, has also dropped to pre-COVID levels.

Yet deep concerns remain about high prices and rising rents.

Mamdani will also have to deal with Republican President Donald Trump .

During the mayoral race, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won and mused about sending National Guard troops to New York.

But Trump later surprised supporters and critics alike by inviting the Democrat to the White House for what turned out to be a cordial meeting in November.

“I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said.

Still, tensions between the two leaders are almost certain to resurface, given their deep policy disagreements, particularly over immigration.

Mamdani also faces scepticism and opposition from some members of the city’s Jewish community over his criticisms of Israel’s government.

Since his election victory, the new mayor and his team have spent weeks preparing for the transition, surrounding Mamdani with seasoned figures who have worked inside or alongside city government.

That included persuading the city’s police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, to remain in her post — a move that helped calm fears in the business community that the new administration might pursue radical changes to policing strategy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 06:38:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4ec0958-bc8a-11f0-bb0d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25309163715647.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police say several people have died in fire at bar in ski resort</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-say-several-people-have-died-fire-bar-ski-resort-2026-01-01/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Swiss police said on Thursday that several people had died and others were injured due to a fire of unknown causes at a bar called "Le Constellation" in the ski resort of Crans-Montana in southwestern Switzerland.

The governor, Vladimir Saldo, made the allegation in a statement on the Telegram messaging service.

Ukraine's military did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment, and Saldo did not provide visuals or other evidence that would enable Reuters to immediately verify the allegation.

Saldo alleged in his post that three Ukrainian drones had struck the site of new New Year celebrations in Khorly, a coastal village, in what he said was a "deliberate strike".

Russian state news agencies reported that at least 24 people had been killed and 29 more injured, citing the local branch of Russia's emergencies ministry.

Kherson is one of four regions in Ukraine which Russia claimed as its own in 2022, a move Kyiv and most Western countries condemned as an illegal land grab.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 08:30:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran Revolutionary Guard member reportedly killed during widening cost-of-living protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260101-iran-revolutionary-guard-member-reportedly-killed-during-widening-cost-of-living-protests</link><description>A volunteer member of Iran 's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard was killed in a western province during widening demonstrations sparked by the Islamic Republic's ailing economy , authorities said Thursday, marking the first fatality among security forces during the protests .

Spontaneous protests, driven by dissatisfaction at Iran's economic stagnation, began on Sunday in Tehran's largest mobile phone market, where shopkeepers shuttered their businesses, and have since drawn in students across the country.

The death Wednesday night of the 21-year-old volunteer in the Guard's Basij force may mark the start of a heavier-handed response by Iran's theocracy over the demonstrations, which have slowed in the capital, Tehran, but expanded to other provinces.

The state-run IRNA news agency reported on the Guard member’s death but did not elaborate. An Iranian news agency called the Student News Network, believed to be close to the Basij, directly blamed demonstrators for the Guard member's death, citing comments from Saeed Pourali, a deputy governor in Iran's Lorestan province.

The Guard member “was martyred ... at the hands of rioters during protests in this city in defence of public order”, he reportedly said. Another 13 Basij members and police officers suffered injuries, he added.

“The protests that have occurred are due to economic pressures, inflation and currency fluctuations, and are an expression of livelihood concerns," Pourali said. "The voices of citizens must be heard carefully and tactfully, but people must not allow their demands to be strained by profit-seeking individuals.”

The protests took place in the city of Kouhdasht, more than 400 kilometres southwest of Tehran.

A government building in southern Iran was also attacked on Wednesday, authorities said.

"A portion of the provincial governors' office door and its glass were destroyed in an attack by a number of people," said Hamed Ostovar, the head of the judiciary in the city of Fasa, as quoted by the justice ministry's Mizan agency, without specifying how the attack was carried out.

Iran's civilian government under reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has been trying to signal it wants to negotiate with protesters . However, Pezeshkian has acknowledged there is not much he can do as Iran's rial currency has rapidly depreciated, with $1 now costing some 1.4 million rials.

Meanwhile, state television separately reported on the arrests of seven people, including five it described as monarchists and two others it said had linked to European-based groups. State TV also said another operation saw security forces confiscate 100 smuggled pistols, without elaborating.

The protests have yet to reach the scale of the 2022 nationwide protests triggered by the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in police custody.

Iran's theocracy had declared Wednesday a public holiday across much of the country, citing cold weather, likely as a bid to get people out of the capital for a long weekend. The Iranian weekend is Thursday and Friday, while Saturday marks Imam Ali's birthday, another holiday for many.

Iran's economy has been in the doldrums for years, with heavy US and international sanctions over Tehran's nuclear programme weighing heavily on it.

The currency, the rial, has also plunged in recent months, losing more than a third of its value against the US dollar since last year.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics.

Some basic necessities are becoming unaffordable for a portion of the population, which has been suffering from severe international sanctions against Iran for decades.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 08:31:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/722cac02-e6e3-11f0-8a30-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-30T123528Z-941861327-RC20RIAYGVT9-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel says forces open fire on West Bank stone-throwers, one dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-forces-open-fire-west-bank-stone-throwers-one-dead-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - The Israeli military said its forces killed a Palestinian in the occupied West Bank in the early hours on Thursday as they opened fire on people who were throwing stones at soldiers.

Two other people were hit on a main road near the village of Luban al-Sharqiya in Nablus, the military statement added. It described the people as militants and said the stone-throwing was part of an ambush.

Palestinian authorities in the West Bank said a 26-year-old man they named as Khattab Al Sarhan was killed and another person wounded.

Israeli forces had closed the main entrance to the village of Luban al-Sharqiya, in Nablus, and blocked several secondary roads on Wednesday, the Palestinian Authority's official news agency WAFA reported.

More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 2023 and October 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, the U.N. has said.

Over the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:27:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel says it will 'enforce' ban on 37 NGOs in Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260101-israel-says-will-enforce-ban-37-ngos-gaza-humanitarian-crisis-deepens</link><description>Israel said on Thursday that 37 international NGOs operating in Gaza had not complied with a deadline to meet "security and transparency standards," in particular disclosing information on their Palestinian staff, and that it "will enforce" a ban on their activities.

More than 500 aid workers have been killed in the Palestinian territory since October, 2023.

"Organisations that have failed to meet required security and transparency standards will have their licenses suspended," said spokesman for the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Gilad Zwick.

Organisations that have had their license revoked will be forced to cease all activities by March 1, 2026.

Organisations that will have their licenses revoked include Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ), the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), World Vision International, CARE and Oxfam, according to a list provided by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.

In March, Israel gave a ten-month deadline to NGOs to comply with the new rules, which expired on Wednesday night. The UN has warned that the ban will exacerbate the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

The foreign ministers of 10 nations on Tuesday expressed "serious concerns" about a "renewed deterioration of the humanitarian situation" in Gaza, describing the situation "catastrophic" .

"As winter draws in, civilians in Gaza are facing appalling conditions with heavy rainfall and temperatures dropping," the ministers of Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland said in a joint statement released by the UK's Foreign Office.

"1.3 million people still require urgent shelter support. More than half of health facilities are only partially functional and face shortages of essential medical equipment and supplies. The total collapse of sanitation infrastructure has left 740,000 people vulnerable to toxic flooding," the statement added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 09:49:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1d2b48d0-e6f2-11f0-87b2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25364625314103.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police believe around 40 died at Swiss bar explosion, Italy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-believe-around-40-died-swiss-bar-explosion-italy-says-2026-01-01/</link><description>ROME, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Swiss police believe around 40 people died and 100 were injured in a fire during a New Year's Eve party in the resort town of Crans-Montana, the Italian Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

State media said on Thursday the person killed was 21-year-old Amirhossam Khodayari Fard, a member of the paramilitary Basij militia which is regularly deployed to suppress unrest, though Reuters was unable to verify this.

The incident in Kuhdasht in Iran's western Lorestan province marks an escalation in the unrest that has spread across the country since shopkeepers began protests on Sunday over inflation and the falling currency.

It comes at a critical moment for Iran's clerical rulers as Western sanctions hammer an economy hit by 40% inflation and after Israeli and U.S. airstrikes in June targeted the country's nuclear infrastructure and military leadership.

Tehran has responded to the unrest with an offer of dialogue , a more conciliatory approach than it has taken during most previous bouts of unrest, though activists have also reported police flooding the streets.

Government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Thursday that the authorities would hold a direct dialogue with representatives of trades unions and merchants, but without giving details.

The activist HRANA news agency said late on Wednesday there was a heavy presence of security forces in cities with arrests, shootings and clashes in some areas. State media said students were detained then released during the demonstrations.

The Basij is a volunteer paramilitary force fiercely loyal to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, which said in a statement that 13 of the militia members had been injured.

Many Iranian social media users disputed the authorities' account of the incident and a video widely shared online that Reuters could not immediately verify appeared to show protesters trying to get an injured person into an ambulance.

The Revolutionary Guards statement accused those involved in the unrest in Kuhdasht of "taking advantage of the atmosphere of popular protests".

Merchants, shop owners and students in different Iranian universities have been demonstrating for days and closing major bazaar markets. The government shut down much of the country on Wednesday by declaring a holiday due to cold weather.

Authorities have in recent years quashed protests over issues ranging from high prices, droughts, women's rights and political freedoms, often with tough security measures and extensive arrests.

However, in an unusual response to the latest protests, President Masoud Pezeshkian said he had asked the interior minister to listen to "legitimate demands" of the demonstrators.

Iran's economy has been struggling for years as a result of U.S. and Western sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program. Regional tensions led to a 12-day air war with Israel in June, further straining the country's finances.

The Iranian rial has lost around half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December in a country where unrest has repeatedly flared in recent years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:19:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Argentine soccer body in turmoil ahead of World Cup over mystery villa and dirty money claims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/argentine-soccer-body-turmoil-ahead-world-cup-over-mystery-villa-dirty-money-2026-01-01/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 1 (Reuters) - In March 2024, retired Argentine soccer star Carlos Tevez published a tweet , opens new tab hinting at something suspicious going on in a Buenos Aires suburb. The treasurer of the Argentine Football Association, Tevez claimed, was making many trips to Pilar, where he implied the soccer official had buried bags of money and kept a collection of antique cars.

Coalicion Civica, a progressive political party, began investigating after Tevez's post and filed a criminal complaint centered on a mystery villa in Pilar.

As the World Cup approaches, allegations that the villa may have been used for money-laundering have become one of a series of scandals gripping the soccer association that is in charge of the game in Argentina, the current world champions.

In early December, police raided the AFA headquarters and more than a dozen soccer clubs as part of a money-laundering probe that looked at transfers of money tied to clubs and a financial services company.

Three days later, authorities raided the Pilar villa, finding a heliport, stables and 54 vehicles, including luxury cars and collectible cars. In its criminal complaint, Coalicion Civica alleges the property is a front for a money-laundering scheme connected to Chiqui Tapia, the president of the AFA, and its treasurer, Pablo Toviggino.

Last week, in another case, a prosecutor charged Tapia, Toviggino and other AFA leaders for unlawful retention of taxes totaling $13 million following a complaint from Argentina’s tax agency, according to news outlet La Nacion.

The AFA did not respond to an inquiry from Reuters requesting an interview with both Tapia and Toviggino and for comment on the various judicial investigations that have been opened.

In a public statement, the association has said it is being attacked by the government of President Javier Milei, referring to how Milei has pushed for Argentina’s soccer clubs, which have long functioned as nonprofit entities run by their members, to become for-profit companies under private owners.

“We are on the right path,” the AFA said, listing competitions Argentina has won since Tapia became president in 2017, including the World Cup itself in 2022.

A representative for Tevez did not respond to an interview request. Toviggino did not respond to a request for comment.

Despite plaudits for Argentina’s performance on the field, the AFA is going through its biggest crisis in years.

“There are two AFAs,” said Nestor Centra, an Argentine sports journalist, referring to its international success and the instability at home.

Several months after Tevez’s tweet, Matias Yofe, president of Coalicion Civica's branch in Pilar, told Reuters that he and his colleagues talked to about 10 employees who had worked at the Pilar property and presumed that Toviggino or Tapia were the owners.

One person, Yofe said, described Tapia once arriving by helicopter and then gifting employees soccer jerseys.

“What they described was they moved as owners of the place, they got in the pool, used the facilities,” Yofe said. “Everyone indicated that this belongs to people of the AFA.”

Coalicion Civica’s complaint alleged that the property had been purchased in 2024 by a company owned by Ana Lucia Conte and Luciano Nicolas Pantano, a mother and son that it claimed could not afford the purchase. An attorney who has represented Pantano did not respond to a request for comment.

Records viewed by Reuters indicate that the property, several city blocks long, was bought for $1.8 million, although experts suspect it's worth much more. The complaint points to Pantano's connections with the soccer world, such as serving as the head of the Argentine Civil Association of Futsal and Beach Soccer.

According to court documents, officials during the raid found a black imitation leather bag branded with the AFA logo and Toviggino’s name, several books on soccer and a plaque honoring Toviggino. The 54 vehicles included a Ferrari and several Porsches, registered under the company the complaint attributed to Pantano and Conte.

An official with knowledge of the case said that Toviggino’s relatives had authorization to drive at least several of the cars, confirming a report by local television station TN. Authorities have requested information on the pilots who used the heliport in the hopes of learning about the passengers.

The justice ministry has demanded that the AFA and the Superliga, an association that handles transmission rights of matches, give explanations for accounting entries of nearly half a billion dollars going back to 2017. Daniel Vitolo, the head of the ministry’s Inspector General’s office, told Reuters that those amounts fall into categories on balance reports with generic names such as “others." The Superliga declined a request from Reuters for comment.

“If the AFA really has its papers in order, why doesn’t it explain something that’s very easy to explain?” he said.

Experts said it’s unlikely that the judicial cases will affect Argentina’s participation in the World Cup.

“No one can pay the political cost of doing that,” said Alan Wilder, a sports law attorney in Buenos Aires. “No one would approve of the mere idea of taking (Lionel) Messi out of the World Cup, with this possibly being his last World Cup. He’s the sacred cow.”

Soccer worldwide is no stranger to financial scandals, and in recent years top FIFA officials have been charged with corruption. Tapia’s predecessor resigned amid an investigation into irregularities involving management of match broadcasting funds. Those charged in the case were absolved this month.

Prior to the current scandals, AFA had already faced criticism by fans for favoritism. Many were angered when the AFA recently awarded Rosario Central, home team of national star player Angel Di Maria, a new and controversial trophy.

"I think the lid has been blown off the pot," said Enzo Gutierrez, 30, a Buenos Aires resident who roots for the team San Martin from his native province of San Juan. "It has grabbed my attention a lot but if you're a soccer fan you live knowing that these things happen in Argentine soccer."</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 11:19:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C3VZHMAU3VMPNPB4LLXP3B5B7I.jpg?auth=c72f6f706277eff8e12d45181b85108a54c2d943f0b7177f92fb6dd3bda84dee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drones strike Russian energy targets in Krasnodar, Tatarstan regions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drones-strike-russian-energy-targets-krasnodar-tatarstan-regions-2026-01-01/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Ukrainian drones struck an oil refinery in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, as well as an energy storage facility in the oil-rich Volga river region of Tatarstan, Russian authorities and Ukraine's military said on Thursday.

Debris from a drone had hit the Ilskiy oil refinery in Krasnodar, causing no casualties but igniting a fire that was later extinguished, local authorities said.

In Tatarstan, Russian media cited the local governor's press service as saying that an energy storage facility in the city of Almetyevsk had been hit, causing a blaze that was later put out.

Almetyevsk is located around 1,400 km (869 miles) from Ukraine.

The Ukrainian military said in a statement it had struck both facilities. Kyiv has been intensifying strikes against Russian energy infrastructure in recent months, aiming to cut off Moscow's sources of financing for its military campaign in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 12:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine condemns Russian new year drone attack on power infrastructure</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-condemns-russian-new-year-drone-attack-power-infrastructure-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - A Russian drone attack damaged power infrastructure in several Ukrainian regions overnight, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday, while Moscow accused Ukraine of carrying out a deadly new year attack in a Russian-controlled part of Ukraine.

"On New Year, Russia deliberately brings war. Over 200 attack drones were launched onto Ukraine in the night," Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram.

Zelenskiy said energy infrastructure in seven regions across Ukraine had been targeted.

Russia accused Ukraine of killing at least 24 people, including a child, in a drone strike on a hotel and cafe where civilians were seeing in the New Year in a Russian-controlled part of Ukraine's southern Kherson region.

Ukraine's military, which has accused Russia of killing thousands of civilians in its own attacks on Ukrainian cities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Moscow's accusation.

Zelenskiy said that Russia's holiday season attacks showed Ukraine could not afford delays in air defence supplies.

"(Our) allies have the names of equipment which we are lacking. We expect that everything agreed with the United States at the end of December for our defence will arrive on time," he said, without clarifying further.

Zelenskiy met with U.S. President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday to negotiate a peace framework to end the nearly four-year war. Both leaders have said they are close to an agreement, but thorny issues around post-war control of territories remain.

The Ukrainian energy ministry said a "significant number" of households in the Volyn and Odesa regions - in northwestern and southwestern Ukraine, respectively - were disconnected from power supplies by the overnight strikes, as well as some in the Chernihiv region north of the capital Kyiv.

The governor of Volant said more than 103,000 households in that region had lost power as a result of the attack. Volyn region is several hundred kilometres from the front line and borders NATO member Poland.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:34:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IMLOOZ7PH5KMFKKXKOXIYTXLKM.jpg?auth=117d345c066122527292812e7493b5a7fd49da72abbe1989cf7d3a0261bb6a3b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says it will give U.S. proof of attempted Ukrainian strike on Putin residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-it-will-give-us-proof-attempted-ukrainian-strike-putin-residence-2026-01-01/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it had extracted and decoded a file from a Ukrainian drone downed earlier this week that it said shows it had been targeting a Russian presidential residence and that it would hand over the relevant information to the United States.

Moscow accused Kyiv on Monday of trying to strike a residence of President Vladimir Putin in Russia's northern Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones. It said Russia would review its negotiating position in ongoing talks with the U.S. on ending the Ukraine war.

Ukraine and Western countries have disputed Russia's account of the alleged attempted strike.

In a statement posted on Telegram on Thursday, Russia's Defence Ministry said: "Decryption of routing data revealed that the final target of the Ukrainian drone attack on December 29, 2025, was a facility at the Russian Presidential Residence in the Novgorod region."

"These materials will be transferred to the American side through the established channels," it added.

The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday that U.S. national security officials had found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for the Russian charge, telling reporters on Monday that Putin had informed him of the alleged incident and that he was "very angry" about it.

By Wednesday, Trump appeared more sceptical, sharing on social media a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

Ukraine has denied carrying out such an attack and described the accusation as part of a Russian disinformation campaign meant to drive a wedge between Kyiv and Washington after a weekend meeting between Trump and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:35:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SFD6Y6BWAFNEHLTRAK5PCTQ7IQ.jpg?auth=3eac6b4dfc2c835c3f936b8764a66233ccb1c4214a6de2c52c73b5dc833bc9fa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Somalia says it killed 29 al-Shabaab militants with international support</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/somalia-says-it-killed-29-al-shabaab-militants-with-international-support-2026-01-01/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Somalia's armed forces have eliminated 29 al-Shabaab militants in the town of Jabad Godane in southeastern Somalia, in coordination with international partners, the Defence Ministry said in a statement on Thursday.

Al-Shabaab has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2007 in a bid to topple the internationally-backed central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of sharia law.

The ministry said in a statement on X that it also destroyed vehicles and weapons "that were intended for use in terrorist attacks against civilians," through airstrike operations in the Middle Shabelle region conducted overnight.

"The Ministry of Defence extends its appreciation to international partners for their continued support in security cooperation, intelligence sharing, and operational enablement in the fight against terrorism," it said but did not specify which partners it was referring to.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 13:35:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgaria celebrates entry into euro zone, lev currency banished into history</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/bulgaria-celebrates-entry-into-euro-zone-lev-currency-banished-into-history-2026-01-01/</link><description>SOFIA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - EU member Bulgaria marked its entry into the euro zone on Thursday with a display of euro coins on the facade of the central bank in Sofia and fireworks to celebrate a long-awaited milestone.

As of midnight the euro became the country's currency and the lev was banished into history.

Bulgaria's entry into the euro zone will take the number of Europeans using the currency to more than 350 million. The last country to join the single currency group was Croatia in January 2023.

"Our money will be in a different currency - if I have 10,000 leva, now I will have 5,100 euros. It's all the same. And I think it will be better." Stefan Bisterkov, a driving instructor, said.

Aside from changing currency, becoming the euro zone's 21st member means Bulgaria gets a seat at the European Central Bank's rate-setting Governing Council.

Successive Bulgarian governments have tried to make the step since the Balkan country of 6.7 million people joined the EU in 2007. Bulgarians are split on the issue, opinion polls show, although businesses are largely in favour.

"My expectations from (adopting) the euro are positive, I don't think there will be anything to worry about, quite the opposite. We will only benefit from this, and it will only be more useful for us," said Antonia Tsvetkova, a jeweller.

"Anyone who goes on a trip will not have problems exchanging currency, now everything will be normal."

Some Bulgarians worry that using the euro will push up prices, or are suspicious of a domestic political establishment that is in crisis.

The tally comes as Brexit firebrand Nigel Farage 's anti-immigration party Reform UK surges in popularity ahead of bellwether local elections in May.

With Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer increasingly under pressure over the thorny issue, his interior minister Shabana Mahmood has proposed a drastic reduction in protections for refugees and the ending of automatic benefits for asylum seekers.

Home Office data showed that no small boats were detected on December 31, meaning a total of 41,472 migrants landed on England 's southern coast in 2025 after making the perilous Channel crossing from northern France .

The record of 45,774 arrivals was recorded in 2022 under the last Conservative government.

Former Tory prime minister Rishi Sunak vowed to "stop the boats" when he was in power.

Ousted by Starmer in July 2024, he later said he regretted the slogan because it was too "stark" and "binary" and lacked sufficient context "for exactly how challenging" the goal was.

Adopting his own "smash the gangs" slogan, Starmer pledged to tackle the problem by dismantling the people smuggling networks running the crossings, but has so far had no more success than his predecessor.

Reform has led Starmer's Labour Party by double-digit margins in opinion polls for most of 2025.

In a New Year message, Farage predicted that if Reform got things "right" at the forthcoming local elections "we will go on and win the general election" due in 2029 at the latest.

Without addressing the migrant issue directly, he added: "We will then absolutely have a chance of fundamentally changing the whole system of government in Britain."

In his own New Year message, Starmer insisted his government would "defeat the decline and division offered by others".

Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch, meanwhile, urged people not to let "politics of grievance tell you that we're destined to stay the same".

The small boat figures come after Home Secretary Mahmood in November said irregular migration was "tearing our country apart".

In early December, an interior ministry spokesperson called the number of small boat crossings "shameful" and said Mahmood's "sweeping reforms" would remove the incentives driving the arrivals.

A returns deal with France had so far resulted in 153 people being removed from the UK to France and 134 being brought to the UK from France, border security and asylum minister Alex Norris said.

"Our landmark one-in one-out scheme means we can now send those who arrive on small boats back to France," he said.

The past year has seen multiple protests in UK towns over the housing of migrants in hotels.

Amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment, in September up to 150,000 massed in central London for one of the largest-ever far-right protests in Britain, organised by activist Tommy Robinson.

Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with around 111,000 applications made in the year to June 2025, according to official figures as of mid-November.

Labour is currently taking inspiration from Denmark 's coalition government – led by the centre-left Social Democrats – which has implemented some of the strictest migration policies in Europe.

Senior British officials recently visited the Scandinavian country, where successful asylum claims are at a 40-year low.

But the government's plans will likely face opposition from Labour's more left-wing lawmakers, fearing that the party is losing voters to progressive alternatives such as the Greens.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 14:21:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54ace03c-8d71-11f0-ad9a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/878996b3e56b816308cf78bfe216bec9e121b485.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More about the Crans-Montana resort</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/crans-montana-swiss-resort-centre-deadly-bar-fire-2026-01-01/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Following are some key facts about the Swiss resort of Crans-Montana where officials said dozens of people were killed and 100 injured, most of them seriously, after a fire tore through a crowded bar during a New Year's Eve party.

Crans-Montana is in the Swiss Alps in the French-speaking part of the canton of Valais. It lies on a plateau above the city of Sierre, around 1,500 metres (4,920 feet) above sea level, with views of the Valais Alps and the Weisshorn mountain.

The resort has attracted a long line-up of celebrities, including James Bond star Roger Moore who lived there until his death in 2017. Model Claudia Schiffer, actor Hugh Grant and former French President Nicolas Sarkozy have all passed through.

It hosts major events including the Omega European Masters golf tournament, which drew more than 48,000 spectators in 2024, and the Alpine Ski World Cup, attended by 37,000 people.

Around three million people visit Crans-Montana every year, far more than its local population of 10,500.

From November 2023 to October 2024, Swiss travellers accounted for 66% of hotel stays, according to Crans-Montana Tourism &amp; Congress Committee data.

This was followed by tourists from France (7.3%), Italy (3.7%), Britain (3.5%), the United States (2.8%), the Gulf states (2.4%), Belgium (2.1%) and Germany (2.0%).

Crans-Montana's ski operations are part of the international Epic Pass network operated by U.S.-listed Vail Resorts (MTN.N) , opens new tab , which acquired the resort's ski lift company in 2024.

Vail Resorts manages 42 mountain sites, including Crans-Montana and Andermatt-Sedrun in Switzerland.

In its December 2025 capital plan, Vail highlighted the rising importance of its Swiss resorts in attracting U.S. visitors and boosting revenue in Europe.

The resort has 140 km (87 miles) of ski slopes, mountain biking trails, hiking routes and championship golf courses, according to its annual report.

It also has 2,678 hotel beds and many holiday apartments. In 2024, 1.45 million Swiss francs ($1.83 million) of central reservation sales and 283,515 Swiss francs from activity bookings were recorded.

The Saudi-backed, internationally recognized Yemeni government ordered new restrictions on flights to and from the UAE, aiming to curb escalating tensions in Yemen, a Saudi source told Reuters.

But the move triggered a defiant response: Yemen’s transport minister, aligned with Yemen's southern separatists, ordered a full shutdown of air traffic rather than comply.

The Southern Transitional Council, the UAE-backed Yemeni separatist force that seized most of southern Yemen last month, blamed the closure on “sudden new regulations” Saudi Arabia sought to impose.

The UAE Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the airport closure.

The tussle is the latest in a deepening crisis in Yemen that has exposed a deep rift between the two Gulf oil powers.

Saudi Arabia this week accused the UAE of pressuring Yemen's STC to push towards the kingdom's borders and declared its national security a "red line," prompting the UAE to say it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen.

That followed an airstrike by Saudi-led coalition forces on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla that the coalition said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the separatists.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y22AAQLLSRNSXEMBDYEV743ZM4.jpg?auth=f349ecb75dd6350610bdd401ca6e34de729636cf9e68a68382499773ae24d38b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells WSJ he is taking more aspirin than doctors recommend</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-tells-wsj-he-is-taking-more-aspirin-than-doctors-recommend-2026-01-01/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal that he is taking a larger daily dose of aspirin than his doctors recommend.

"They say aspirin is good for thinning out the blood, and I don’t want thick blood pouring through my heart," Trump told the paper in an interview published on Thursday. "I want nice, thin blood pouring through my heart. Does that make sense?"

Trump, 79, is the second-oldest person to ever hold the presidency, following his Democratic predecessor President Joe Biden, who dropped his 2024 reelection bid amid questions about his fitness for the job and was aged 82 when he left office a year ago.

Trump's health has been in the spotlight in recent months due to bruises that have been spotted on his hands and an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) exam that he was reported to have undergone in October, as well as instances where the Republican president closed his eyes during public events.

Daily use of aspirin can lower the chances of heart attack or stroke for people over the age of 60, according to the Mayo Clinic, which says a low dose of aspirin is most commonly 81 milligrams.

The president's doctor, Sean Barbabella, told the Journal that Trump takes 325 milligrams of aspirin daily for cardiac prevention.

The bruising is the result of him shaking so many hands , according to the White House, which said last month the MRI was preventative .

When asked about the MRI, Trump and Barbabella told the Journal that the president actually got a CT scan.

Barbabella said Trump's doctors had initially said they would perform either an MRI or a CT scan but decided to do the latter "to definitively rule out any cardiovascular issues."

It revealed no abnormalities, according to Barbabella.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JS5MXIV3E5PB5CUZYEADUV6E74.jpg?auth=4d58f51f63bb61e229460ed5f58c7d805aca29e57ddd523ea8aad88c450d4d5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Togo releases Frenchman detained since June over anti-government protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260101-togo-releases-frenchman-detained-since-june-over-anti-government-protests</link><description>A Frenchman detained last year in Togo over alleged involvement in anti-government protests arrived back in France on Thursday after his release, the French foreign ministry said.

Steeve Rouyar, a 44-year-old father of two originally from Guadeloupe , had been living in the west African nation since late 2024 when he was arrested in June.

The prosecutor's office in the capital Lome said he was one of around 50 protesters arrested on June 6 during a rare anti-government demonstration in Togo, led with an iron fist by Faure Gnassingbe for the past two decades.

"A decision by the Togolese judiciary" allowed his release, the French foreign ministry said, without providing further details.

The demonstrations began in response to calls for civil disobedience sent out on social media by the June 6 Movement (M66), whose name refers to the longtime Togolese leader's birthday and the day the protests began.

A source following the case, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not allowed to speak to the press, told AFP in September that Rouyar had been accused of "undermining state security", a charge that can be punished with two to three decades in jail.

He was also accused of helping make flyers, the source said.

The Togolese government said on Wednesday that Gnassingbe has pardoned 1,511 prisoners, but there was no immediate list of the names of those released. Such pardons are common at the end of the year.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 15:24:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/91512e5e-e71b-11f0-b3dd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-73QT363.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Year party at Swiss ski resort turned into a disaster zone</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/new-year-party-swiss-ski-resort-turned-into-disaster-zone-2026-01-01/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 1 (Reuters) - As he approached Le Constellation bar to celebrate the New Year in a snowy Swiss ski resort bright with Christmas lights, Dominic Dubois saw flames engulfing the building.

"You could see the orange, the orange, yellow, red," Dubois told Reuters, describing chaotic scenes as bystanders and emergency crews worked together to pull victims clear.

He described how people who had managed to escape the burning building were plunged into the cold outside. "So one of the priorities was to get everyone warm ... the curtains of the restaurant were used," he said.

Dozens of people were killed and around 100 injured when fire tore through the crowded bar during a New Year's Eve party in the Crans-Montana resort , officials said on Thursday.

Nearby, local resident Samuel Rapp, 21, was dining at a Mexican restaurant when he heard of the blaze, and rushed with his girlfriend to Le Constellation, a bar popular with young locals.

"Police and paramedics ... had already set up a protective perimeter," he told Reuters. "There were people screaming, and then people lying on the ground, probably dead. They had jackets over their faces."

Fire broke out in the bar at 1.30 a.m. (0030 GMT). The cause of the blaze, which was initially reported as an explosion, was not yet clear but authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.

Rapp said he had seen videos showing desperate partygoers trampling each other to escape. "People were shouting, 'help me, please help us.'"

The local branch of UBS bank opened up to give refuge to survivors, said Dubois, standing at the police cordon on Thursday in a green knitted hat.

"All the tables were pushed aside and people entered and it was warm in there, there was more light as well, so the triage was down there," he said.

"Paramedics, police - not the firemen, the firemen were out here. And then it was just ambulances coming back and forth as much as possible."

Video footage showed lines of ambulances queuing and helicopters landing to take victims of the blast to nearby hospitals and specialist burns units in other Swiss cities.

A waiter in a restaurant near the bar, who declined to be named, said first responders approached staff to ask for tablecloths to cover the bodies to conceal them from onlookers.

In daylight on Thursday, the bar was covered in white sheeting with a tent set up outside and a grey hearse parked in front.

In this retrospective featuring more than 180 photographs, Parr turns his eye on subjects related to environmental destruction, including mass tourism, over-consumption and the omnipresence of plastic in daily life.

The exhibition is also a chance to look back on 50 years of work from the beloved artist, who died in December .

Global Warning at the Jeu de Paume Paris runs from January 30 to May 24.

Pierre-Auguste Renior’s reputation as a “painter of happiness” sometimes saw him derided as a lightweight by his peers, but will no doubt make for an exhibition to lift the spirits.

The theme of love will be explored through around 50 of the impressionist’s paintings, focusing on scenes from everyday life. In these, Renoir represented luminous and vibrant moments of human connection during shared meals, conversations and dancing.

Renoir et l’amour at the Musée d’Orsay runs from March 17 to July 19.

This blockbuster show features more than 230 paintings, drawings, books and Cut Outs documenting the final years of Henri Matisse’s career. The modern master is known for his vivid and innovative use of colour, particularly in his Cut Outs in which he used brightly coloured paper shapes to represent nature , animals and the human form.

Visitors will get a chance to see works borrowed from Paris’ Pompidou centre (which is currently closed for renovation until 2030) and international collections, including Sorrows of the King, Danseuse Créole (“Creole Danser”) and Matisse’s famous Blue Nudes.

Matisse 1941-1954 at the Grand Palais runs from March 24 to July 26.

For billions of gamers around the world, music is an essential and evocative component of successful worldbuilding. With 20 installations investigating the relationship between artistry, storytelling and technology, this interactive exhibition explores the history of video game music, from early sound chips to modern audio landscapes.

Alongside the exhibition, concert-goers can buy tickets for orchestral performances of scores from popular games, including Final Fantasy and Assassin’s Creed.

Video games et music at the Philharmonie de Paris runs from April 3 to January 10, 2027.

Hollywood icon Marilyn Monroe would have celebrated her 100th birthday in 2026 and French film museum the Cinématheque is marking the occasion with an exhibition in her honour.

Monroe was a talented comedic actress who starred in more than 30 films, but her technical skill was often eclipsed by her megawatt fame, looks and personal life. This exhibition commemorates her greatest film performances and investigates what the enduring fascination with the star says about the public’s relationship with Hollywood and celebrity .

Marilyn Monroe: 100 ans at the Cinémathèque Française runs from April 8 to July 26.

For two weeks in June, Paris’s oldest bridge will be transformed into a giant cave by the French street artist known as JR. The ambitious installation was inspired by the rocks used to create Pont Neuf’s stone bricks and aims to create a rugged juxtaposition to the capital’s traditional architecture . It is also an homage to artists Christo et Jeanne-Claude, who famously wrapped the bridge in 41,800 square metres of fabric in 1985.

Originally planned for 2025, the JR project was postponed by a year to allow for complicated logistics. It will be freely accessible to visitors who will be able to walk across the bridge and pass underneath on boats while the artwork is in place.

La Caverne du Pont Neuf will be open to the public from June 6-28.

The Netherlands traditionally rings in the New Year with people setting off their own fireworks, which causes hundreds of injuries and millions of euros in damage every year. This year, some 250 people were arrested on New Year's Eve and in several towns riot police were deployed, police said.

"The impact of heavy fireworks and arson this New Year's Eve in some areas was utterly devastating. The targeted violence against emergency services and police was intense again," police said in a statement on Thursday.

The fireworks accidents killed a 38-year-old man in Aalsmeer, close to Amsterdam, and a boy from Nijmegen, a town in the east of the country, police said.

In Amsterdam, the neo-Gothic Vondelkerk, near the city's central Vondelpark, was destroyed by a fire that started shortly after midnight.

The Amsterdam police and fire department said they were investigating and had no comment yet on what caused the blaze in the church, which was built in 1872.

New Year's Eve 2025 marked the last year before a nationwide ban on the sale of fireworks to consumers will come into effect.

Emergency room doctors, police, firefighters and local and national politicians have campaigned for the ban for years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:53:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5KCOVJXVANI27B2O3EOLREY7U4.jpg?auth=4b6bc800a2707775280efaa5fdd7844c9ba9eae6036591c06026c1533414c6de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia and Ukraine trade allegations of civilian attacks on New Year's day</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-trade-allegations-civilian-attacks-new-years-day-2026-01-01/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine accused each other of targeting civilians over the New Year, with Moscow reporting a deadly strike on a hotel in territory it occupies in southern Ukraine while Kyiv said there had been another broad attack on its power supplies.

The reports coincide with intensive talks aimed at bringing an end to the nearly four-year-old war , overseen by U.S. President Donald Trump. Both countries have said the other is doing all it can to influence his views and shape the outcome.

"On New Year, Russia deliberately brings war. Over 200 attack drones were launched onto Ukraine in the night," Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram, saying energy infrastructure in seven regions across Ukraine had been targeted.

Russia accused Ukraine of killing at least 24 people, including a child, in a drone strike on a hotel and cafe where civilians were seeing in the New Year in a Russian-controlled part of the Kherson region in southern Ukraine.

Ukraine's military, which has accused Russia of killing many civilians in its own attacks on Ukrainian cities, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Zelenskiy said that Russia's holiday season attacks showed Ukraine could not afford delays in air defence supplies.

"(Our) allies have the names of equipment which we are lacking. We expect that everything agreed with the United States at the end of December for our defence will arrive on time," he said, without clarifying further.

Vladimir Saldo, the Russian-installed governor of the region, said three Ukrainian drones had hit the celebrations in Khorly, a coastal village, in what he said was a "deliberate strike" against civilians. He said that many people had been burnt alive.

Russia's Foreign Ministry said that as well as the 24 dead, 50 people had been injured, including six minors who were being treated in hospital.

"There is no doubt that the attack was planned in advance, with drones deliberately targeting areas where civilians had gathered to celebrate New Year's Eve," the ministry said in a statement, calling the attack a "war crime".

On Monday, Moscow accused Kyiv of trying to strike a residence of President Vladimir Putin . Ukrainian and European officials have said the incident did not happen and U.S. security officials were also reported to have found that Ukraine did not target the residence. Russia said on Thursday it would send Washington proof.

Reuters was not able to immediately verify the reported Kherson region attack or photographs of what Saldo's press service said was the aftermath on Thursday.

The images showed at least one dead body was visible beneath a white sheet. The building showed signs that a fire had raged and there were what looked like blood stains on the ground. Russia's TASS news agency published video showing drone fragments, some with Ukrainian writing on them.

Ukrainian officials regularly report civilian deaths from Russian air attacks, including in the Ukrainian-held city of Kherson, which lies near the front line.

The Ukrainian governor of Kherson region, Oleksandr Prokudin, said that one man had been killed and an 87-year-old woman injured in attacks on the city on Thursday, posting a video showing the woman's badly damaged apartment.

Ukraine's deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba said rail facilities had been attacked in three regions, including a locomotive depot and a station in the frontline region of Sumy.

The Russian defence ministry said on Thursday its strikes had hit military targets, as well as energy infrastructure which it claimed was being used to support Ukraine's military.

In a separate report, Russia-appointed Saldo said later that a five-year-old child had been killed and three more people injured in a Ukrainian drone strike on a car near Tarasivka, another coastal village, close to Khorly. He did not provide evidence.

Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, told TASS that those who carried out the hotel attack and their commanders should be targeted.

Kherson is one of four regions in Ukraine which Russia claimed as its own in 2022, a move Kyiv and most Western countries denounced as an illegal land grab.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 16:54:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KB7CCJ7TQNKCFMZP6IJACG34MY.jpg?auth=ffb662a0eac1fcc488b8527ee8a3c5dc052828a6355fa7b93e528d7d375bedb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US health insurance costs to rise by 114% for millions as subsidies expire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260101-health-insurance-costs-rise-114-percent-millions-americans-obamacare-subsidies-expire</link><description>Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act (ACA, also known as "Obamacare") enrollees expired overnight, cementing higher health costs for millions of people in the United States at the start of the new year.

The change affects a diverse cross-section of the population who don’t get their health insurance from an employer and don’t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare – a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.

On average, the more than 20 million subsidised enrollees in the Affordable Care Act programme are seeing their premium costs rise by 114 percent in 2026, according to an analysis by the healthcare research nonprofit KFF.

The subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help US residents get through the Covid-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time then extended them, pushing the expiration date to the start of 2026. Some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5 percent of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.

Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue, demanding the health subsidies be extended before they agreed to a new Republican budget. Some Republicans also called for a bipartisan solution to save their 2026 political aspirations, given the ACA's popularity – two-thirds of Americans favour the system , according to KFF.

But while congressional Republicans acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.

Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees – especially younger and healthier Americans – to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.

Over time, that could make the programme more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.

The surging healthcare prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the US, which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.

It also comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability – including the cost of health care – topping the list of voters’ concerns.

“It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,” said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose healthcare costs are set to jump. “I’m incredibly disappointed that there hasn’t been more action.”

Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It’s a strain for the 49-year-old, but one he’s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.

Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker’s monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.

An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.

But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until January 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.

Provost said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year – but if not, she’ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter.

She can’t afford to pay for coverage for both of them without the subsidies.

After Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal healthcare and food assistance by passing Trump’s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the ACA subsidies to be extended.

In December, the GOP-controlled Senate rejected two partisan healthcare bills – a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health "savings accounts".

In the House, four Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it’s unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.

Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don’t understand what it’s really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.

Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.

“Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,” said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. “They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 17:23:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ef55d7dc-e727-11f0-a763-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25350476183812.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven bodies recovered, 96 rescued after migrant boat capsizes, Gambia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/seven-bodies-recovered-96-rescued-after-migrant-boat-capsizes-gambia-says-2026-01-01/</link><description>BANJUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Seven bodies were recovered and 96 people were rescued after a boat transporting migrants capsized overnight, Gambia's defence ministry said on Thursday.

The vessel was "allegedly carrying over 200 migrants", the ministry said in a statement, adding that 10 of the rescued migrants were in critical condition and receiving urgent medical attention.

The Atlantic migration route from the coast of West Africa to the Canary Islands, typically used by African migrants trying to reach Spain, is one of the world's deadliest.

More than 46,000 irregular migrants reached the Canary Islands in 2024, a record, according to the European Union. More than 10,000 died attempting the journey, a 58% increase over 2023, according to the rights group Caminando Fronteras.

At least 70 people were killed in August 2025 when a boat believed to have departed from Gambia carrying migrants capsized, in one of the deadliest accidents in recent years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 18:32:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World reacts to fatal fire at Swiss ski resort bar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/world-reacts-fatal-fire-swiss-ski-resort-bar-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - World leaders reacted to a fatal fire that tore through a crowded bar during a New Year's Eve party in the upscale Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana.

American forces have been pursuing the tanker, which maritime groups have identified as the Bella 1, for almost two weeks .

The U.S. on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four companies it said were operating in Venezuela’s oil sector as well as associated oil tankers, as President Donald Trump's administration increases pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Russia made the formal diplomatic request as Trump also seeks to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine.

Most injuries, many of them serious, occurred when the blaze swept through the crowded bar less than two hours after midnight Thursday in southwestern Switzerland .

The Crans-Montana resort is best known as an international ski and golf venue. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar morphed from a scene of revelry into the site of potentially one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.

Crans-Montana is less than 5 kilometres from Sierre, Switzerland, where 28 people, including many children, were killed when a bus from Belgium crashed inside a Swiss tunnel in 2012.

Here’s what we know about the deadly fire :

The blaze broke out around 1:30am Thursday inside the Le Constellation bar amid the holiday celebration.

Two women told French broadcaster BFMTV they were inside when they saw a male bartender lifting a female bartender on his shoulders as she held a lit candle in a bottle. The flames spread, collapsing the wooden ceiling, they told the broadcaster.

People frantically tried to escape from the basement nightclub up a narrow flight of stairs and through a narrow door, causing a crowd surge, one of the women said.

A young man at the scene said people smashed windows to escape the fire, some gravely injured, reported BFMTV. He said he saw about 20 people scrambling to get out of the smoke and flames, likening what happened to a horror movie.

The injured were so numerous that the intensive care unit and operating theatre at the regional hospital quickly hit full capacity, said Mathias Reynard, head of the regional government of the Valais Canton.

While officials said Thursday it was too early to determine the fire's cause, investigators have already ruled out that it could have been an attack.

Experts have not yet been able to go inside the wreckage, said Beatrice Pilloud, Valais Canton attorney general, at a news conference.

Work is underway to identify the victims and inform their families, according to Valais Canton police commander Frédéric Gisler.

The Swiss officials called the blaze an “embrasement généralisé”, a French firefighting term describing how a blaze can trigger the release of combustible gases that can then ignite violently and cause what English-speaking firefighters would call a flashover or a backdraft.

Victims suffered from serious burns and smoke inhalation. Some were flown to specialist hospitals across the country.

Authorities urged people to show caution in the coming days to avoid any accidents that could require the already overwhelmed medical resources.

With high-altitude ski runs rising around 3,000 metres in the heart of the Valais region’s snowy peaks and pine forests , Crans-Montana is one of the top venues on the World Cup circuit.

The resort will host the best men’s and women’s downhill racers, including Lindsey Vonn, for their final events before the Milan Cortina Olympics in February.

The town’s Crans-sur-Sierre golf club, down the street from the bar, stages the European Masters each August on a picturesque course.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 20:25:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e61933b6-e74b-11f0-a45a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-01T192903Z-60329277-RC2ISIAC1PJ4-RTRMADP-3-SWITZERLAND-BLAST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela frees 88 more prisoners detained after post-election protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-frees-88-more-prisoners-detained-after-post-election-protests-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government has freed 88 more people detained after protests that followed the South American nation's July 2024 election, marking the second mass release in as many weeks amid U.S. pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro.

The New Year's Day release follows the government's announcement that it released 99 people on December 26, which would bring a total of 187 people released in two weeks.

"These actions are part of the comprehensive review process of cases ordered by President Nicolas Maduro," the government said in a statement.

The Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners, a local non-governmental organization, said it had verified at least 55 prisoners had been released, with all but one freed from the Tocoron prison in central Venezuela.

Following the December 26 announcement, several NGOs questioned whether the government released as many as it said it had. Venezuelan NGOs have estimated around 900 political prisoners are still detained in Venezuela, including people arrested before the election.

Venezuela's government has said it does not hold political prisoners but rather imprisoned politicians, and those arrested were seeking to destabilize the country.

The releases come amid pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has said it would be smart for Maduro to leave power.

The U.S. has amassed a huge military presence in the Caribbean, killed dozens in strikes on boats near the Venezuelan coast it alleges were carrying drugs, and seized two fully loaded Venezuelan crude tankers .</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 22:46:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ACBMEPBQUFJJBJ76X6WNSZXU7A.jpg?auth=f076dc733ebb4410d20be2f6823f541c8d3c3fa96bfdbe3d9a77860a6a5c849c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro leaves hospital after surgeries, returns to prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-leaves-hospital-after-surgeries-returns-prison-2026-01-01/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was discharged from hospital on Thursday after undergoing medical procedures to treat a hernia and hiccups , according to a Reuters witness and local media reports.

Earlier in the day, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes rejected a request from Bolsonaro's lawyers seeking permission for the former president to serve his sentence under "humanitarian house arrest."

So severe were the burns suffered by the mostly young crowd of revellers in the Le Constellation bar that Swiss officials said it could take days before they name all the victims of the fire that also injured 115, many of them seriously.

Parents of missing youths anxiously issued pleas for news of their loved ones as foreign embassies scrambled to work out if their nationals were among those caught up in one of the worst tragedies to befall modern Switzerland.

"The first objective is to assign names to all the bodies," Crans-Montana's mayor Nicolas Feraud told a press conference on Thursday evening. This, he said, could take days.

Mathias Reynard, head of government of the canton of Valais, said experts were using dental and DNA samples for the task.

"All this work needs to be done because the information is so terrible and sensitive that nothing can be told to the families unless we are 100 percent sure," he said.

What caused the blaze was unclear. Swiss authorities said it appeared to be an accident rather than an attack.

Some accounts from survivors and footage broadcast on social media suggested that the ceiling of the bar's basement may have caught fire when sparkling candles got too close.

Residents of Crans-Montana, which has the distinction of being not only a popular draw for skiers, but also golfers, were stunned by the inferno. Many knew victims and some said they were lucky not to have been there themselves.

Hundreds of people stood in silence near the scene as they came to pay their respects to the victims on Thursday night.

"You think you're safe here but this can happen anywhere. They were people like us," said Piermarco Pani, an 18-year-old who, like many others in the town, knew the bar well.

Dozens of people left flowers or lit candles on a makeshift altar at the top of the road leading to the bar which police had cordoned off. Some cried, others quietly hugged one another.

Behind the cordon, the bodies of some victims still lay in the bar, police said, as they pledged to work around the clock to identify everyone who succumbed to the blaze.

Kean Sarbach, 17, said he had spoken to four people who escaped from the bar, some with burns, and that they had told him the flames had spread very quickly.

Elisa Sousa, 17, said she was meant to be there but ended up spending the evening at a family gathering instead.

"And honestly, I'll need thank my mother a hundred times for not letting me go," she said at the vigil for the victims. "Because God knows where I'd be now."</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:20:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XOGTBIGH4JKWJBTGHYJZKLGVVA.jpg?auth=d8e593a78067e1db45a850481ead6a3f7d033d40959d3eb1cc9a3c772b3af42d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's daughter makes public visit to state mausoleum</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-leader-kim-jong-uns-daughter-makes-public-visit-state-mausoleum-2026-01-01/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 2 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's daughter, Ju Ae, who is likely being prepared as his successor, accompanied her parents on her first public visit to the Kumsusan mausoleum to pay respects to former leaders, state media photos published on Friday showed.

Ju Ae has been making increasingly prominent appearances in state media over the past three years, fuelling speculation by analysts and South Korea's intelligence agency that she may be in line to be the country's fourth-generation leader.

Kim was also accompanied by his wife, Lee Sol Ju, and senior officials on the visit on January 1, with Ju Ae between her parents in the main hall of the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, state news agency KCNA photographs showed.

Kim Ju Ae , who is believed to have been born in the early 2010s, attended this year's New Year celebrations , according to state media on Thursday. In September, she travelled to Beijing with her father on her first public overseas outing.

Kim visits Kumsusan to honour his grandfather and state founder, Kim Il Sung, and father Kim Jong Il on key dates and anniversaries in a gesture affirming the dynastic heritage of the nuclear-armed country.

Thousands of people gathered in freezing conditions in the United States ’ largest city to celebrate the 34-year-old Democrat ’s inauguration after his rapid rise from relative anonymity just a year ago.

“They want to know if the left can govern. They want to know if the struggles that afflict them can be solved,” Mamdani said outside City Hall.

“We will do something that New Yorkers do better than anyone else: we will set an example for the world.”

In the 24-minute speech, he added: “Beginning today, we will govern expansively and audaciously.”

Mamdani, New York’s first Muslim mayor, emphasised cost-of-living issues that were central to his campaign, pledging to help those “betrayed by the established order”.

Left-wing allies Senator Bernie Sanders and congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also spoke before some 4,000 ticketed guests.

“Thank you for giving us, from coast to coast, the hope and the vision that we can create government that works for all, not just the wealthy and the few,” said Sanders, a former presidential hopeful.

At one point, the crowd broke into chants of “tax the rich”. Mamdani wants to raise taxes on New York’s wealthiest residents.

Thousands more thronged downtown Manhattan, many wearing yellow and blue beanies emblazoned with “Zohran”, to watch the ceremony on large screens.

“This is the first time that either of us in our entire lives has felt some kind of political hope at all,” 31-year-old scientist Jacob Byerly told AFP, standing alongside his wife Auburn.

Mamdani, a self-described democratic socialist , comes to power as Trump pushes a hard-right agenda nationally.

It remains to be seen whether he can deliver on his programme, which includes rent freezes, universal childcare and free public buses.

Trump’s approach could prove decisive. The Republican, himself a New Yorker, has repeatedly criticised Mamdani, although the two held unexpectedly cordial talks at the White House in November.

One potential flashpoint is immigration, as Trump expands raids and a broader crackdown on migrants across the United States. Mamdani has vowed to protect immigrant communities.

Before the November vote, Trump threatened to slash federal funding for New York if Mamdani won, branding him a “communist lunatic”. The mayor has said he believes Trump is a fascist.

Mamdani mentioned Trump only once in his speech, reflecting on the city’s diversity and noting that some Trump supporters had also backed him in the mayoral race.

The inauguration was rich in symbolism.

New York Attorney General Letitia James, who successfully prosecuted Trump for fraud , carried out a private midnight swearing-in at a disused subway station.

Mamdani’s office said the understated venue beneath City Hall reflected his commitment to working people.

In a first for the city, he was sworn in using Qurans.

Born in Uganda to a family of Indian origin, Mamdani moved to New York at the age of seven and enjoyed an elite upbringing, with only a relatively brief stint in politics.

To compensate for his inexperience, he is surrounding himself with seasoned aides drawn from previous mayoral administrations and former US president Joe Biden ’s government.

Mamdani has also opened dialogue with business leaders, some of whom had warned of a mass exodus of wealthy New Yorkers if he won. Real estate leaders have since played down those claims.

A vocal defender of Palestinian rights, he faces the task of reassuring New York’s Jewish community — the largest in the US — of his inclusive leadership.

A small group of protesters holding Israeli flags appeared during the ceremony, blowing air horns as Mamdani delivered his speech.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 23:22:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d11a098-e760-11f0-b1b7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26001741473836.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bolsonaro leaves hospital and returns to prison after being denied house arrest</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260101-bolsonaro-leaves-hospital-returns-to-prison</link><description>Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro left a hospital in capital Brasilia on Thursday, a week after he underwent a double hernia surgery. A car took the embattled ex-leader back to the federal police headquarters where he is serving his 27-year prison sentence for leading a coup d’état aimed at keeping him in office.

Hospital DF Star confirmed Bolsonaro was released after some other minor medical procedures after the double hernia surgery that was completed without complications.

Brazil ’s Supreme Court approved the release of the former president, who governed from 2019 to 2022, for the surgery.

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who sentenced Bolsonaro to prison, denied the former president’s request for house arrest after he leaves the hospital.

Bolsonaro has undergone several other medical procedures since he was stabbed in the abdomen during a campaign rally in 2018.

Bolsonaro has no contact with the few other inmates at the federal police headquarters in Brasilia, where he is held and where his 12-square-metre (around 130-square-foot) room has a bed, a private bathroom, air conditioning, a television and a desk.

In December, Bolsonaro shook Brazilian politics again by appointing his eldest son, Sen. Flávio Bolsonaro, to become his political party’s presidential candidate in next year’s election, challenging incumbent Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .

Neither Flávio Bolsonaro nor former first lady Michelle Bolsonaro made comments about the former leader returning to prison after his hospitalisation.

Michelle Bolsonaro said in her social media channels that “there is a Brazil of good people which loves you and prays for you”.

“We will beat the bad days,” she wrote.

Bolsonaro and several of his allies were convicted in September by a panel of Supreme Court justices of attempting to overthrow Brazil’s democratic system following his 2022 election defeat.

The plot included plans to kill Lula , Vice President Geraldo Alckmin and de Moraes. There was also a plan to encourage an insurrection in early 2023.

Bolsonaro was also convicted on charges that include leading an armed criminal organisation and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law.

The visit marks the second meeting between Xi and Lee in just two months, an unusually short interval that signals China's keen interest in reinforcing ties with Seoul and boosting economic collaboration and tourism, analysts say.

Relations between China and Japan are at their chilliest point in years after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

Xi's invitation to Lee for a state visit from Sunday is a calculated move aimed at deepening bilateral relations especially before the South Korean leader visits Japan, analysts say.

"China wants to emphasize South Korea's importance slightly more than before," said Kang Jun-young, professor of political economics at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies.

"China appears to have strategically decided that it would be better to have (Lee) visit China before South Korea holds a summit with Japan again," he added.

The Lee administration has said it aims to "restore" ties with Beijing, acknowledging China is South Korea's largest trading partner.

The pivot follows the two countries' strained relations under Lee's predecessor Yoon Suk Yeol, due to his closer alignment with Washington and Tokyo, as well as criticism of China's handling of Taiwan.

Now, South Korea is trying to maintain balance but leaning towards cooperation with China to avoid being forced into any troubles that would threaten the Asian industrial powerhouse.

Lee said in December he wouldn't take sides in the diplomatic dispute between China and Japan.

Still, China and South Korea face complex issues as China challenges the U.S., South Korea's major ally in the region, and as nuclear-armed North Korea remains unpredictable.

China is North Korea's major ally and economic lifeline.

Shin Beom-chul, a former South Korean vice defence minister and a senior research fellow at the Sejong Institute, said Xi and Lee might discuss some contentious issues such as efforts to modernise the South Korea- U.S. alliance that apparently aim to curb China's dominance.

Currently, about 28,500 U.S. troops are based in South Korea to counter any threat from North Korea.

U.S. officials have signalled a plan to make those U.S. forces more flexible to respond to other threats, such as defending Taiwan and checking China's growing military reach.

"Korea is not simply responding to threats on the peninsula," General Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea, said at a forum on Dec. 29. "Korea sits at the crossroads of broader regional dynamics that shape the balance of power across Northeast Asia." he said.

Lee's agenda with Xi includes persuading China to facilitate dialogue with North Korea, experts said.

North Korea has dismissed Lee's outreach, labelling him a "hypocrite" and "confrontational maniac".

Meanwhile, China and North Korea have been seeking closer coordination as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un stood shoulder to shoulder with Xi in September at a big military parade .

Lee's visit to Beijing is expected to address cooperation in areas including critical minerals , supply chain and green industries, his office said earlier.

Seoul sources nearly half of its supply of rare earth minerals, critical to semiconductor manufacturing, come from China. Beijing also accounts for a third of Seoul's annual chip exports, the largest market by far.

Last month, South Korean Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan and Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao agreed to work towards stable rare earth supplies, the South Korean industry ministry said.

The visit may also foster partnerships on artificial intelligence and advanced technologies, experts said.

China's Huawei Technologies plans to roll out the Ascend 950 AI chips in South Korea next year, aiming to provide an alternative to Nvidia for Korean firms, Huawei's South Korea CEO Balian Wang told a press conference last month.

Wang mentioned ongoing discussions with potential customers, without naming those clients.

Huawei did not address questions from Reuters about Wang's comments.

Another issue at stake is Beijing's effective ban on K-pop content since around the 2017 deployment of a U.S.-led missile defence system in South Korea.

“Wherever they want and whenever they want,” Maduro said of the idea of dialogue with the United States on drug trafficking, oil and migration in an interview on state TV.

To date, Maduro has not confirmed a US land attack on a docking facility in his country that allegedly targeted drug boats , according to comments made on Monday by US President Donald Trump.

Asked point-blank whether he confirmed or denied the attack, Maduro said: “This could be something we talk about in a few days.”

The attack would amount to the first known land strike of the US military campaign against drug trafficking from Latin America.

Trump said on Monday that the United States had hit and destroyed a docking area used by alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

He declined to say whether it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, noting only that it was “along the shore”.

“There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

“So we hit all the boats and now we hit the area — it’s the implementation area, that’s where they implement. And that is no longer around.”

For weeks, Trump has threatened ground strikes on drug cartels in the region, saying they would start “soon”, but this is the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes on boats in both the Caribbean Sea and the eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug smugglers.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings, a charge that Washington denies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 03:41:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/686d089c-da4f-11f0-816f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25344772186399.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi envoy says leader of Yemen separatist group STC blocked delegation's Aden landing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-envoy-says-leader-yemen-separatist-group-stc-blocked-delegations-aden-2026-01-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The Saudi-backed governor of Yemen's Hadramout province said on Friday he would launch a peaceful operation to take back military positions from the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council, but that the actions were not a declaration of war.

The move marks the latest escalation in war-torn Yemen where a rift between Gulf powers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who back opposing sides, has been playing out since December.

Yemen’s Saudi-backed government said on Friday it had appointed Hadramout Governor Salem Ahmed Saeed al-Khunbashi to take overall command of the "Homeland Shield" forces in the eastern province, granting him full military, security and administrative authority in what it said was a move to restore security and order.

The operation targets military sites only and is "not a declaration of war," it said.

The UAE backs the STC , which seized large swathes of southern Yemen last month from the internationally recognised government, backed by Saudi Arabia, which in turn saw the move as a threat.

The UAE last week said it was pulling its remaining forces out of Yemen after Saudi Arabia backed a call for its forces to leave within 24 hours in one of the severest disagreements between the two Gulf oil powers to ever play out in public.

The STC did not immediately respond to the Hadramout governor's declaration.

Saudi Arabia's ambassador to Yemen also on Friday blamed STC leader Aidarus Al-Zubaidi for refusing to grant landing permission the previous day for a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden.

A halt in flights at Aden international airport on Thursday continued into Friday as both sides traded blame as to who was responsible for the air traffic shutdown.

"For several weeks and until yesterday, the Kingdom sought to make all efforts with the Southern Transitional Council to end the escalation ... but it faced continuous rejection and stubbornness from Aidarus Al-Zubaidi," the Saudi ambassador, Mohammed Al-Jaber, said on X.

Zubaidi issued directives to close air traffic at Aden's airport on Thursday, the ambassador added, saying that a plane carrying a Saudi delegation to Aden aiming to find solutions to the crisis was denied permission to land.

In a statement on Thursday, the STC-controlled Transport Ministry in turn accused Saudi Arabia of imposing an air blockade, saying Riyadh required all flights to go via Saudi Arabia for extra checks.

Aden's international airport is the main gateway for regions of the country outside Houthi control.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 08:31:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ORRDY2S2D5NGBO64V6WA6FF3XI.jpg?auth=b597960c9819e60afc93944153d2e5917d593e629d179610641e8cec79742245&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US will intervene if Iran violently suppresses peaceful protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-us-will-intervene-if-iran-violently-suppresses-peaceful-protests-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said that if Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, the United States of America will come to their rescue.

Hong Kong has stepped up a crackdown on corruption linked to building renovation following a fire in late November that ripped through seven high-rise towers and killed more than 160 people.

John Lee, the city's leader, last month set up an independent committee to investigate the fire and the construction industry, and determine whether there was any bid-rigging in the award of contracts.

The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in a statement it conducted enforcement operations last week against a triad-linked corruption syndicate associated with building renovation.

The 21 arrested included middlemen, project consultants, project contractors and members of the owners' corporation of the two housing estates, the agency added.

In one of the estates, the contractor involved was suspected of bribing the project consultant and some members of the owners' corporation to obtain a project contract worth HK$33 million ($4.24 million).

In the other estate, the middlemen allegedly collected instruments of proxy, or authorisation tickets from homeowners "by corrupt means" in an attempt to manipulate votes and win future renovation contracts. It did not elaborate.

"Building maintenance is closely related to the public and involves multiple stakeholders. The ICAC has always attached great importance to corruption in building maintenance," the statement said.

The two estates targeted in last week's operation were in the Kwun Tong district in eastern Kowloon and not related to Wang Fuk Court, the site of the fire that broke out on November 26.

The ICAC has arrested at least 11 people in a corruption probe into renovation work at Wang Fuk Court.

Residents reacted with anger to the inferno, which took nearly two days to extinguish. Authorities have said substandard building materials used in renovating the high-rise blocks fuelled the fire.

"This operation is not a declaration of war, nor an attempt to escalate tensions," Salem Al-Khanbashi said in a statement reported by the official Saba Net news agency, shortly after he was also appointed to lead the Saudi-backed National Shield forces in Hadramawt.

The Southern Transitional Council (STC) seized ​large parts of the country from its internationally ‌recognised government last month in a ‍move viewed by Saudi Arabia as a threat to its own interests.

Maduro said Venezuela was a "brother country" to the United States and a friendly government. He noted that when he and Trump last spoke in November, the U.S. president had acknowledged his authority by addressing him as "Mr. President."

The longtime Venezuelan strongman spoke in an interview that was filmed on New Year's Eve and aired on Venezuelan state TV on the evening of New Year's Day.

In the broadcast, Maduro and his interviewer walk through a militarized zone of the capital Caracas. Later, Maduro takes the wheel of a car with the journalist in the passenger seat and the president's wife, Cilia Flores, in the back - a gesture commentators interpreted as an attempt to project confidence amid fears of a U.S. strike, despite Maduro's scaling back of public appearances in recent weeks.

The comments represent a shift in Maduro's tone towards the United States since the latter launched a large-scale military buildup in the southern Caribbean. Trump has accused the "illegitimate" Maduro of running a narco-state and threatened to remove him from power.

Maduro has vehemently denied links to crime and says that the U.S. is seeking to oust him to take control of Venezuela's vast oil reserves and rare earth mineral deposits.

At an event shortly before Christmas, Maduro urged Trump to focus on domestic challenges, saying: "Honestly, if I speak with him again, I will tell him that each one should attend to their internal affairs."

In the latest remarks, Maduro told his interviewer: "To the people of the United States I say what I have always said, Venezuela is a brother country... a friendly government.

"We must start to speak seriously, with the facts in hand. The U.S. government knows that, because we have said it a lot to their interlocutors, that if they want to speak seriously about the agreement to battle drug trafficking, we are ready to do that. If they want Venezuela's oil, Venezuela is ready to accept U.S. investments like those of Chevron, when, where and how they want to make them."</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:22:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QDZCB5TGQVPIVENT2TTU2W52RU.jpg?auth=8fcc2e18da5ddaf48ee8a7e6b1f6f80e2206925b628ee4004a01d679bf7efac1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Molotov cocktail, dead chickens sent to Indonesian government critics, rights groups say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/molotov-cocktail-dead-chickens-sent-indonesian-government-critics-rights-groups-2026-01-02/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A Molotov cocktail was thrown at the home of an Indonesian government critic, while others have received intimidating messages, rights campaigners said on Friday, warning of growing threats to freedom of speech in the Southeast Asian country.

The campaigners had recently been critical of the government response to severe flooding in northern Sumatra province in November that killed more than 1,000 people.

The acts of intimidation "constitute an attack on democratic values ​​and the freedom of expression guaranteed by the constitution", according to a joint statement issued on Wednesday by 91 human rights groups, including the Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network and the Human Rights Working Group.

Neither the Jakarta police nor the Indonesian presidential office responded immediately to requests for comment. Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto has repeatedly said that criticism is allowed but it must be constructive.

Ramond Donny Adam, a social media personality and member of the opposition Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, told Reuters on Friday a Molotov cocktail was sent to his home early on December 31.

Adam, better known as DJ Donny, said the bomb failed to explode, but the attack came two days after he was sent a dead chicken in a plastic box and a printout of his face with a red mark across his neck, along with another note saying, "You will end up like this chicken...Do not mess around".

"I have reported these two incidents to the police and the government must reveal who's behind this," said Donny, who has a million followers on Instagram and often posts messages criticising the government.

It was unclear who was behind the incident.

Greenpeace Indonesia country director Leonard Simanjuntak said a dead chicken was found in front of the house of a Greenpeace campaigner on December 30, with a message tied to its leg saying, "Watch your words if you want to protect your family, your mouth is your sword."

Simanjuntak suspected the intimidation was linked to Greenpeace's criticism of government policies surrounding the Sumatra floods and landslides.

Greenpeace criticised the government's forestry management , including the issuance of mining and palm oil plantation permits that some critics said had caused widespread deforestation and worsened the floods.

On her Instagram account, influencer Sherly Annavita said her car was spray painted and rotten eggs were thrown into her home. Annavita, who has more than two million followers, had recently written posts criticising Jakarta's slow response to the Sumatra floods.

"The Italian Golf Federation mourns the passing of Emanuele Galeppini, a young athlete who carried with him passion and genuine values," the federation said in a statement.

Swiss authorities have said around 40 people died in the fire and more than 110 were injured. Authorities have warned that naming the victims or establishing a definitive death toll would take time because many of the bodies were badly burned.

Italy's ambassador to Switzerland said earlier that six Italians were missing and 13 were in hospital receiving treatment for their injuries.

Galeppini had been in Crans-Montana with his family. Italian media reported that he had gone to the Constellation bar with two friends, who managed to escape the fire and were taken to nearby hospitals.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens Iran over protest deaths as unrest flares</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-threatens-iran-over-protest-deaths-unrest-flares-2026-01-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened on Friday to come to the aid of protesters in Iran if security forces fire on them, days into unrest that has left several dead and posed the biggest internal threat to Iranian authorities in years.

"We are locked and loaded and ready to go," he said in a social media post. The United States struck Iranian nuclear facilities in June, joining an Israeli air campaign that targeted Tehran's atomic programme and military leadership.

Top Iranian official Ali Larijani responded to Trump's comments warning that U.S. interference in domestic Iranian issues would equal the destabilisation of the whole region. Iran backs groups in Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.

The comments came as a local official in western Iran where several deaths were reported was cited by state media as warning that any unrest or illegal gatherings would be met "decisively and without leniency", raising the likelihood of escalation.

This week's protests over soaring inflation have spread across Iran, with deadly confrontations between demonstrators and security forces focused in the western provinces of Lorestan and Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari.

State-affiliated media and rights groups have reported at least six deaths since Wednesday, including one man who authorities said was a member of the Basij paramilitary affiliated with the Revolutionary Guards.

Iran has seen off repeated bouts of major unrest in recent decades, often quelling protests with heavy security measures and mass arrests. But economic problems may leave authorities more vulnerable now .

This week's protests are the biggest in three years, since nationwide demonstrations triggered by the death of a young woman in custody in late 2022 paralysed Iran for weeks, with rights groups reporting hundreds killed.

During the latest unrest, the elected President Masoud Pezeshkian has struck a conciliatory tone, pledging dialogue with protest leaders over the cost-of-living crisis, even as rights groups said security forces had fired on demonstrators.

Speaking on Thursday, before Trump threatened U.S. action, Pezeshkian acknowledged that failings by the authorities were behind the crisis.

"We are to blame... Do not look for America or anyone else to blame. We must serve properly so that people are satisfied with us.... It is us who have to find a solution to these problems," he said.

Pezeshkian's government is attempting a programme of economic liberalisation, but one of its measures, deregulating some currency exchange, has contributed to a sharp decline in the value of Iran's rial on the unofficial market.

The sliding currency has compounded inflation, which has hovered above 36% since March even by official estimates, in an economy battered by Western sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme.

The Israeli and U.S. strikes last year have added to the pressure on the authorities, as have the ousting of Syria's Bashar al-Assad, a close Tehran ally, and the Israeli pounding of its main regional partner, Lebanon's Hezbollah.

Iran continues to back groups in Iraq that have previously fired rockets at U.S. forces in the country, as well as the Houthi group that controls much of northern Yemen.

"American people should know that Trump started the adventurism. They ought to watch over their soldiers," said Larijani, the head of Iran's National Security Council and a top adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

The Hengaw human rights group reported on Thursday that 29 protesters had been detained during the latest wave of demonstrations, including 14 ethnic Kurds, seven Lors, seven women, and two children.

In Lorestan Province, home to much of Iran's Lor ethnic population and site of some intense protests, a senior judicial official told state media: "There will be no tolerance for illegal actions that threaten public order and safety."

The media said law enforcement forces had identified and arrested several "disruptive individuals" in the Lorestan counties of Azna and Delfan.

Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari has also witnessed protests.

The semi-official Fars News Agency reported on Thursday that three protesters were killed and 17 were injured during an attack on a police station in western Lorestan.

Fars and Hengaw also reported fatalities in Lordegan in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province. Authorities confirmed one death in Kuhdasht, Lorestan, while Hengaw reported another in the central province of Isfahan.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:46:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A62ZBIR76JMURC3GGE3GRGYDKQ.jpg?auth=185ce78083c9507112249ee78b67c34db48e275c9038278c20caa9cd06406a3d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan court sentences journalists to life over links to protests after Imran Khan’s arrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/pakistan-court-sentences-journalists-life-over-links-protests-after-imran-khans-2026-01-02/</link><description>KARACHI, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A Pakistani anti-terrorism court sentenced eight journalists and social media commentators on Friday to life imprisonment in absentia after convicting them of terrorism-related offences linked to online activity in support of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan.

The convictions stem from cases registered after violent protests on May 9, 2023, when Khan’s supporters attacked military installations following his brief arrest. Since then, the government and military have launched a sweeping crackdown on Khan’s party and dissenting voices, using anti-terrorism laws and military trials to prosecute hundreds accused of incitement and attacks on state institutions.

In its ruling, the court said actions by the accused “fell within the ambit of terrorism” under Pakistani law and that their online material promoted “fear and unrest” in society.

Most of those convicted are believed to be outside Pakistan and did not appear during the proceedings, court documents showed.

The convicted include former army officers-turned YouTubers Adil Raja and Syed Akbar Hussain, journalists Wajahat Saeed Khan, Sabir Shakir and Shaheen Sehbai, commentator Haider Raza Mehdi, and analyst Moeed Pirzada, according to the court’s decision.

Reuters was unable to reach the journalists or their lawyers for comment.

The Committee to Protect Journalists said in 2023 the investigations amounted to retaliation against critical reporting. “Authorities must immediately drop these investigations and cease the relentless intimidation and censorship of the media,” CPJ Asia programme coordinator Beh Lih Yi said.

The court handed down life sentences along with additional prison terms and fines, ordering further jail time if the fines are not paid. All sentences are subject to confirmation by the Islamabad High Court.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 10:46:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HLH2SWXUBVO6BOMQ5ANGG2LS3I.jpg?auth=54ce04cd92d16afbcd81e8a03b75e2e339228e3233080a5b111004f07f3ef6b1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan says he will discuss Ukraine, Gaza with Trump on Monday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-he-will-discuss-ukraine-gaza-with-trump-monday-2026-01-02/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he would have a phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday to discuss peace efforts between Ukraine and Russia as well as issues surrounding Gaza.

Below are details of the key factions in the conflict in Yemen, which has caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises:

The Yemeni conflict was triggered when the Houthi movement, formally named Ansar Allah, ousted the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government of then-president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi in late 2014.

The group remains the dominant military force in the country, controlling the capital Sanaa and Yemen's populous northern highlands. It is estimated to control territory where between 60% to 65% of Yemenis live.

The Saudi-led coalition accuses Iran of arming, training and funding the Houthis. The group denies being an Iranian proxy and says it develops its own weapons.

The Houthis have demonstrated their missile and drone capabilities during the Yemen war in attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE, targeting oil installations and vital infrastructure.

Seen as part of a regional alliance known as the "Axis of Resistance" backed by Iran, the Houthis have also rallied behind the Palestinians in the Gaza war , lobbing drones and missiles at Israel and attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea.

The Houthis have proven resilient, defying over ten years of bombing by the Saudi-led coalition, as well as U.S. and British strikes in recent years.

Riyadh entered Yemen when it led the military coalition against the Houthis in March 2015, seeking to restore Hadi's government. Saudi Arabia sought to prevent an Iran-aligned group from consolidating power on its southern border.

Riyadh and Tehran, despite a China-brokered thawing of relations, have long been regional rivals and deeply distrust one another.

The Southern Transitional Council, which was trained and equipped by the United Arab Emirates, seeks secession for the south, which was an independent state until unification with the north in 1990. The southern leadership at the time tried to secede in 1994 but was swiftly beaten by then-President Ali Abdallah Saleh's army.

The STC, led by Aidarous al-Zubaidi, is ostensibly part of the Saudi-led coalition but declared in 2020 it would establish self-rule in the south. Tensions peaked in December 2025 when the group seized large swathes of land in Hadramout and Al Mahra provinces and swept to the borders of Saudi Arabia, challenging the regional heavyweight's influence.

The Yemeni Congregation for Reform, better known as al-Islah, is a Sunni Islamist movement with historic ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. It is a key faction within the recognised government but is viewed by the UAE and the STC as a terrorist organisation. Its major stronghold has long been Marib, the country's sole gas-producing region with one of its largest oilfields.

The UAE joined the Saudi-led coalition and was among its most effective ground forces. A withdrawal of UAE troops was announced in 2019 and completed in 2020, but it maintained influence on the ground through the STC and other factions.

Abu Dhabi is motivated by its antipathy towards the Muslim Brotherhood and securing shipping lanes in the strategic Bab al-Mandab Strait and Gulf of Aden, analysts have said.

The eight-member Presidential Leadership Council, led by Rashad al-Alimi, is the internationally recognised authority in Yemen but faces dwindling power. It was formed in Riyadh in April 2022 to replace former president Hadi and unify anti-Houthi forces, but the council has been paralysed by the divisions it was meant to solve.

Following the STC’s December offensive, the government’s effective control is likely now limited to small, isolated pockets, and is reliant on Saudi airpower.

The National Resistance Forces are a well-equipped anti-Houthi force led by Tarek Saleh, a nephew of former Yemeni president Saleh and a member of the PLC. Originally established with UAE support to battle the Houthis on Yemen's west coast, the force has maintained ties to Saudi Arabia and aims for a unified Yemen, positioning itself as a counterweight to both the Houthis and southern secessionists.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 12:42:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZQONLNHQINPE5PJVNRCI6XMAHY.jpg?auth=e55e7b7210d51a91ba30b154869eb03361dd496493c0d0b48602f948ccd86493&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he offered position of chief of staff to military intelligence chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-he-offered-position-chief-staff-military-intelligence-chief-2026-01-02/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he has offered the position of presidential chief of staff to military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov.

Condoms and contraceptive pills now incur value-added tax of 13%, the standard rate for most consumer goods.

The move comes as Beijing struggles to boost birth rates in the world's second-largest economy. China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024 and experts have cautioned the downturn will continue.

China exempted childcare subsidies from personal income tax and rolled out an annual childcare subsidy last year, following a series of "fertility-friendly" measures in 2024, such as urging colleges and universities to provide "love education" to portray marriage, love, fertility and family in a positive light.

Top leaders again pledged last month at the annual Central Economic Work Conference to promote "positive marriage and childbearing attitudes" to stabilise birth rates.

China's birth rates have been falling for decades as a result of the one-child policy China implemented from 1980 to 2015, and rapid urbanisation.

The high cost of childcare and education as well as job uncertainty and a slowing economy have also discouraged many young Chinese from getting married and starting a family.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:21:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X4CC3URE6VMW7JFFQH5GYIMV5E.jpg?auth=888b581dac81b0a23c0e6f959c3350795c6deca8bc4414f7143def4963147408&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen is back from the brink, but frenemies Saudi Arabia and UAE have much to negotiate</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260102-yemen-back-from-brink-but-frenemies-saudi-arabia-and-uae-have-much-negotiate</link><description>The New Year kicked off with Yemen , an unstable country straddling a strategic maritime corridor between the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea , seemingly back from the brink.

After an explosive, public blowout in the last weeks of 2025 that saw Saudi Arabia bomb an alleged arms shipment from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to its proxies in Yemen, tensions have cooled. Abu Dhabi denied the arms shipment accusations, but nonetheless complied with a 24-hour deadline to withdraw its forces in southern Yemen.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE came together in a military coalition in 2015 to prevent a takeover of Yemen by Iran-backed Shiite Houthi rebels . But a decade later, the two Gulf powerhouses, who officially refer to each other as “brotherly” countries, have turned into frenemies. Ambition has driven a wedge between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and UAE President Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan and a once-close relationship between the two royals has been ripped by a divergence of strategic vision.

The Houthis have not been vanquished, but the coalition against them is hanging by a thread. Riyadh backs the internationally recognised Yemeni government under the Presidential Leadership Council (PLC), an unwieldy umbrella body that includes the Islah party, which the UAE accuses of ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and the party denies. Abu Dhabi supports the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is also within the PLC, but has secessionist aspirations that are at odds with its coalition partners.

The year may have begun with the UAE pulling its “counterterrorism teams” from southern Yemen, but few expect Abu Dhabi to stop wielding its influence and economic heft in a geostrategic coastal zone.

On the regional front, Emirati interests in the Red Sea area are increasing exponentially. Its co-signatory to the Abraham Accords, Israel , ended 2025 with the surprise recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland , just across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen. Meanwhile the Houthis continue to target Red Sea shipping lanes and Israeli cities under Iran’s “axis of resistance” banner.

Finally, the latest Saudi-UAE spat in Yemen unfolded in the volatile southern region that has long been an al Qaeda stronghold and offers ideal terrain for jihadist groups.

It may not be a very happy new year for Yemenis who have borne the brunt of a devastating conflict, nor for the international community scrambling to cope with the fast-moving pieces on the Middle East chessboard. By the end of the week, Saudi air strikes had already slammed southern separatist camps, causing deaths and injuries, according to a senior STC official.

In southern Yemen, this week's de-escalation came just as swiftly as the dramatic escalation. On Thursday, the UAE-backed STC said Saudi-aligned government forces would enter territories it had seized in recent weeks.

In its statement, the STC said it would continue to operate in the regions but had agreed to the deployment of the Riyadh-backed National Shield government force. “Today, we launched an operation to integrate the southern National Shield forces so that they can assume the responsibilities and missions that fall to our armed forces,” they announced.

But in Yemen, the devil lies in the official statement details. “We are seeing mixed messaging,” said Mohammed al-Basha, founder of the Basha Report, a US-based risk advisory, in a post on X , noting that while Saudi-aligned figures claimed National Shield forces “will take over security” in Hadramawt, “STC influencers say an agreement was reached to share security responsibilities, tasks, and even garrisons and bases”.

The current crisis was sparked by the STC’s lightening sweep in early December from its heartlands around the southwestern port city of Aden towards the east, seizing parts of the resource-rich Hadramawt and Al Mahra provinces.

Yemen’s history has been marked by a north-south divide, with its southern coastal regions – centred around the ancient strategic port of Aden – culturally distinct from the northern area which includes the capital Sanaa . The STC is the latest iteration of longstanding southern secessionist movements fed by grievances against the north.

Over the past few years, “the STC ran most of the south”, said Basha. “Any diplomat, envoy, journalist going to the south did not see any symbols of the Republic of Yemen, it existed only on paper.”

The “southern question”, as it’s known in Yemen policy circles, is a legitimate issue, analysts concede. But in its current form, there are two “major points of contention”, according to Elisabeth Kendall, president of Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a seasoned Yemen expert.

“One is, does the southern cause mean a separate southern region, or does it mean a separate southern state that's independent and sovereign? And two, how big is that southern region or state? Is it just the southern heartlands, the four governorates that are in and around Aden? Or does it include the two vast eastern governorates of Hadramawt and Al Mahra? The Saudis would argue that it does not include Hadramawt and Al Mahra because they border Saudi Arabia,” she added.

The easternmost Al Mahra governorate also borders Oman , a neutral Gulf country that has strained to contain a spillover of the Yemeni conflict into its own Dhofar region that has seen rebellions in the past. “Neither Saudi Arabia nor Oman want a UAE-influenced state on their borders,” Kendall said.

Within Yemen, there are divides between the southwestern and eastern states, notes Basha. “There's no cohesiveness, even though the STC is the largest political bloc. In theory they could run the south, but they don't have the support of the east,” he noted.

While the eruption of the “southern question” exposed the faultlines with the east, it did little to address Yemen’s core security issues. “Two groups are benefiting from everything that's happening right now in the east and the south. It's the Houthis and AQAP,” noted Basha, referring to al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. “The Houthis are sitting back, watching the anti-Houthi coalition fight each other, watching the two regional backers have a very public divorce,” he explained. “And al Qaeda loves to flourish wherever there's a vacuum.”

One of the key reasons for the STC’s lightening sweep to the east in December was the fear that the Saudis could reach a peace deal with the Houthis, leaving the Shiite rebels in a commanding position in the north while sidelining southern powerbrokers.

A prisoner swap between the Houthis and the Yemeni government last year sparked some hopes for a peace deal. But given the complexities of the conflict, expectations are low.

“In 2026, will we see a peace deal between the Saudis and the Houthis? Absolutely, yes. Is it going to be implementable on the ground? I am not sure,” said Basha. “The real problems in Yemen will appear after a peace agreement is signed,” he added, predicting that the country’s myriad armed groups are likely to “just either fight each other for territory and resources, or collapse, or join AQAP, or form other militant groups”.

While the UAE agreed to troop withdrawal from southern Yemen to avert a military confrontation with Saudi Arabia, analysts question whether it will mark an end to Abu Dhabi’s funding and support for its proxies in the region.

The 2025 crisis in Yemen has put a spotlight on the UAE’s increasingly assertive foreign policy and extension of its sphere of influence in Middle East, Africa and the seas in between.

“These maritime locations are supremely important geopolitically. The area that the UAE seeks to extend its influence in, via the STC, is right on that very important corner of the Arabian Peninsula, where the Gulf of Aden meets the Red Sea,” explained Kendall.

Yemeni territory includes the island of Perim, located in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which is a gateway for oil tankers heading to Europe via the Suez Canal . Further east lies Socotra, an archipelago and UNESCO World Heritage Site that is also a part of Yemen.

Satellite imagery reveals an expanded network of airstrips, military and intelligence bases built by the UAE, according to investigative reports . They extend from Socotra in the Indian Ocean to Yemen’s Arabian Peninsula coast to the Horn of Africa .

The UAE’s strategic partnership with Israel, strengthened by the Abrahams Accord, has also come under the spotlight during the recent tensions in Yemen.

Israeli media last month speculated about the resulting benefits of an independent southern Yemen under Abu Dhabi’s patronage. Arab outlets noted The National ’s interview with Aidarous Al Zubaidi, head of the UAE-backed STC and also vice president of the Saudi-backed PLC, wherein he said he believed “we will be part of the [Abraham] accords”.

While this may be music to the Trump administration’s ears, it adds credence among local populations to the Houthis' self-declared role as defenders of the Palestinian cause.

Last month, when Israel suddenly recognised Somalia’s breakaway region of Somaliland , it raised eyebrows in Middle Eastern capitals and policy circles – and protests in Mogadishu .

It also drew attention to the UAE’s goals in the region. Noting Abu Dhabi’s strategic sweep from Perim island in the west to Socotra in the east, Kendall remarked that the UAE “has a stranglehold on the Gulf of Aden. Add to that, the fact that it was silent when its ally in the Abraham Accords, Israel, expressed its solidarity with the breakaway ‘nation of Somaliland’ on the other side of the Gulf of Aden, and it looks like that whole area is encircled by the UAE.”

Meanwhile across the Red Sea in Sudan, UN sanctions monitors have described what they deemed credible allegations that the UAE provided military support to Sudan 's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in the civil war against the Sudanese army. Abu Dhabi denies the allegations.

The problem, many analysts say, is not Abu Dhabi’s goal of increasing strategic influence, but its effects on weak states. The UAE bases its foreign policy on “realpolitik and doesn't mind working with secessionist movements or with minorities”, said Basha. “You see that with the Rapid Support Forces. You're seeing that with the southerners in the STC. The Saudis are completely against that.”

This year, until and unless the two Gulf brotherly nations-turned-frenemies manage to sort out their differences, Yemen – and the wider Middle East – is unlikely to enjoy a lasting peace.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:22:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd77c40a-e7be-11f0-8c4e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25365410480398.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Watch live: Swiss officials brief media after deadly NYE fire in Cras-Montana bar</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260102-watch-live-swiss-officials-brief-media-after-deadly-nye-fire-in-cras-montana-bar</link><description>Swiss authorities are holding a press conference on Friday, one day after a deadly fire killed around 40 people and injured more than 115 at the Crans-Montana ski resort in the Swiss Alps .

Crans-Montana is best known as an international ski and golf resort. Overnight, its crowded Le Constellation bar was transformed from a scene of revelry into the site of one of Switzerland’s worst tragedies.

Investigators are probing the cause of the blaze, which broke out around 1:30am on Thursday during New Year’s celebrations at the bar.

Sudan’s team has reached the knockout stage of the competition for only the second time since they won the tournament in 1970, overcoming the immense difficulties of being exiled from their country because of the war.

The paramilitary group – which grew from the “Janjaweed” militia mobilised two decades ago by Sudan’s government to subdue its western Darfur province – has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023 when the two fell out over how to integrate their forces.

The conflict has since killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country.

Despite the conflict, Sudan’s football team have continued to play in exile and against the odds qualified for the Cup of Nations in Morocco, where they will meet the heavily fancied Senegal in the first of the last-16 matches at the weekend.

“Most of the time I try to run away from these questions because the emotions are terrible,” said a visibly upset Appiah at a press conference when asked about the impact of the war on his team.

“It is not something that we want to talk about, but we are hoping that if we win it will let the war calm down or even cease.

“There was a game we won (in recent World Cup qualifying) when the armies put their guns down and everyone was celebrating. Football can change things in this world,” added the Ghanaian born coach.

Sudan has not played a home match over the last three years with its footballing infrastructure damaged. The country’s top two clubs have moved to Rwanda, where they are competing as guests in the local league and Khartoum’s Al Hilal have also made it to the group phase of this season’s Champions League.

“Playing away from home and under these circumstances that you are all aware of, is very difficult,” added captain Bakhit Khamis.

“It’s very hard on us to live away from our families, from our homes. We are trying to cope with these circumstances, trying to please our fans, and hopefully things will get better. Everything we are doing on the pitch is an attempt to make things better for our people,” he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:46:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBMUVP7EIFOXVKYBGQHMB6WWPY.jpg?auth=693e0d2feca24d0a055b84b3a9355c3588ec3e0ed8722778761f92826683d318&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Earthquake of magnitude 6.3 strikes southern Mexico</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/earthquake-magnitude-63-strikes-mexico-gfz-says-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - A magnitude 6.3 earthquake struck the southern Mexican state of Guerrero on Friday, the German Research Center for Geosciences (GFZ) said.

The Allied Democratic Forces began as an insurgent force in Uganda but has been based in the forests of neighbouring Congo since the late 1990s, and is recognised by Islamic State as an affiliate.

Congo's army and Ugandan forces have pursued operations against the ADF, but the group's raids persist.

Its latest attacks occurred on Thursday night in Lubero, part of North Kivu province. Nine civilians were killed in Kilonge, two civilians in Katanga and two civilians and two soldiers in Maendeleo, according to Macaire Sivikunula, chief of the Bapere locality where the villages are located.

"The ADF rebels killed most of the victims with bladed weapons," although they also exchanged gunfire with soldiers in Maendeleo, he told Reuters.

Alain Kiwewa, Lubero's military administrator, said on Friday afternoon that 16 people had been confirmed dead.

An army spokesperson, Lieutenant Marc Elongo, said Congolese troops were "pursuing the enemy", without providing details.

Kakule Kagheni Samuel, head of civil society groups in Bapere, said the militants also burnt homes to the ground.

The U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Central African country, known as MONUSCO, said in November that the ADF killed 89 civilians in a spate of strikes over the course of a week.

And in September , the ADF claimed responsibility for an attack that claimed the lives of more than 60 civilians at a funeral in eastern Congo.

Sivikunula said local officials were waiting for soldiers to secure the area before organising funerals for victims of the overnight attacks because "the ADF are cunning (and) can ambush civilians who try to organise this kind of activity."

The ADF violence is separate from the war between Congo and Rwanda-backed M23 rebels that killed thousands of people and displaced hundreds of thousands last year, prompting mediation by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration and Qatar.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 14:46:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico reports second screwworm case in two days</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/mexico-reports-second-screwworm-case-two-days-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities reported a case of the New World screwworm parasite late on Thursday, the second case reported in two days as Mexico works to contain an outbreak that has kept the U.S.-Mexico border closed to Mexican livestock.

The parasite was detected and treated in a goat in the State of Mexico, which borders capital Mexico City, the ministry said, adding that the 20 other animals at the site tested negative and were given preventive treatment.

On December 31, the ministry reported a case in a six-day-old cow calf in the northern state of Tamaulipas, also the only positive case on site.

Mexico has so far reported a total of 13,106 cases since November of 2024, according to government data through December 31, 2025. Of those cases, 671 were active currently.

The southern border state of Chiapas has the most confirmed cases, followed by Oaxaca, Veracruz and Yucatan.

Screwworms are parasitic flies whose females lay eggs in wounds. Their larvae burrow through the flesh of animals, eventually killing their host if left untreated.

Mexico has been working to contain an outbreak of the screwworm, which has spread northward from Central America, rattling the livestock and beef industries of both the U.S. and Mexico.

Because of the outbreak, the U.S. has kept its southern border largely closed to Mexican livestock since May.

Although U.S. officials say the pest has not yet breached the U.S. border, it threatens $1.8 billion in damage to Texas' economy alone, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 15:24:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U6P33BTJGFJJJG3WJM3FOXIVXE.jpg?auth=a7a9f282b07ce81be0ea6b4b25c1092aefefeb5fbe6ca196925168c4f0271d64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he will appoint Oleh Ivashchenko as new military intelligence chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-he-will-appoint-oleh-ivashchenko-new-military-intelligence-chief-2026-01-02/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday he will appoint the head of the foreign intelligence service Oleh Ivashchenko as the new military intelligence chief.

Swiss officials put the death toll at 40 with more than 100 injured. Investigators are combing through the ruins of the bar, examining video recordings and interviewing survivors in the hunt for clues on how the fire broke out.

Several witnesses have recounted seeing bar staff holding up sparkling fountain candles attached to bottles of champagne. Prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud said the fountain candles were a leading line of enquiry that looked to be firming up.

"Everything suggests that the fire started from the burning candles or 'Bengal lights' that had been attached to champagne bottles. These went too close to the ceiling," she told a news conference. "From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread conflagration ensued."

Investigators have questioned the bar's two owners, a French couple who bought the bar in 2015 according to the local canton's company registry.

The probe will focus on previous renovations to the bar and the materials used, the availability of adequate fire extinguishing systems and escape routes, as well as the number of people who were in the bar when the fire started.

Pilloud said further investigations would determine whether there were grounds for criminal liability.

"If this is indeed the case and these individuals are still alive, an investigation will be opened against them for negligent arson, negligent homicide, and negligent bodily injury," the prosecutor added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:28:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MN3JOIDPUZK3XMBHHBUP7MYEWA.jpg?auth=32503722a21d7fb0304090ba29ec7fc89ea80a3adc2b9a01cadc44cf2b23b66c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Understanding Iran’s protest chants: What are demonstrators’ demands?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260102-understanding-iran-protest-chants-what-are-demonstrators-demands</link><description>A protest movement, which began in Iran on Sunday with a strike and demonstrations by Tehran's shopkeepers, continued Friday in multiple towns and cities across the country, with university students joining the protests.

Demonstrations are spreading from major cities to smaller provincial towns and are increasingly fraught.

At least seven people died on Thursday in clashes between protesters and security forces in western Iran , local media reported.

The Iranian authorities have ordered the closure of public institutions, placing much of the country on holiday, officially citing the cold weather and the need to save energy.

The discontent is not, so far, on the same scale as the unprecedented national protests seen in the wake of Mahsa Amini’ s death in 2022, during which demonstrators called for increased rights for women and the overthrow of the Islamic Republic.

But videos posted on social media show demonstrators from different social groups taking to the streets to express widespread discontent and voice demands for political, social and economic change. Here is what they are calling for:

This chant, taken up by protesters in the early days of the demonstrations, reflects growing anger over Iran's foreign policy.

For decades, Iran has pursued a policy of regional engagement by supporting the militant groups Hamas in the Palestinian territories and Hezbollah in Lebanon .

The protesters argue that these alliances are diverting resources away from domestic needs at a time when Iran is undergoing a severe economic crisis.

A sharp currency slide has crippled sales of imported goods – sparking unrest among Iran’s shopkeepers – while rampant inflation is affecting the wider population.

Prices rose by an average of 52 percent year-on-year in December, according to the Statistical Centre of Iran, and this average masks even more dramatic increases in the cost of basic necessities, fuelling popular anger against the regime.

On the third day of demonstrations, a young woman, dressed in trainers and with her hair up in a ponytail, led a group of protesting shopkeepers through a throughfare of Tehran’s Grand Bazar.

With her fist raised, video footage shows her turn to the crowd behind her and shout: “Don’t be afraid! Don’t be afraid! We are all together!”

Her courageous rallying cry shocked bystanders and was immediately picked up by the other, mostly male, demonstrators. As the protest passed by, the person filming the scene was impressed. “Well done! That girl is so brave,” they said.

The words the female demonstrator used are familiar – they have been heard at protests in Iran for years. But the sight of a young woman among the bazar traders, who appear to be supporting her, shows how two separate strands of dissent are starting to intertwine.

The bazar traders typically belong to more religious and traditional sections of society, making them unlikely allies of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” movement, sparked by Amini’s death, which calls for the end of repression and discrimination against women.

The joint protest in the Grand Bazar has been echoed in recent days by other chants calling for social unity.

At Yard University in central Iran, female students gathered on December 30 shouted: “ Iranians, speak up and demand your rights!”, “Don't just stand by and watch, join us!” and “ Anyone who says they are neutral is dishonourable .”

This chant, typically heard among university students, has resurfaced in recent days. In a video from December 30, students in the hallways of the Khajeh Nasir Toosi University of Technology in Tehran beat a rhythm with their feet as they chant the words.

Universities in Iran are under high surveillance but remain hotbeds of protest. Students from dormitories at the University of Tehran on Monday evening were heard chanting “ Protest, free students ! Protest!”

Security forces quickly surrounded their building and blocked the entryways. But they could not prevent student marches spreading to a dozen other major universities in the capital the next day.

Female students at Tehran’s Shahid Beheshti University attacked security forces who had come to break up a gathering in their halls of residence on Wednesday night with cries of “Without honour! Without honour!”, French journalist Armin Arefi reported.

The chant has been heard repeatedly at demonstrations since Sunday, breaking out near police roadblocks, during detonations of tear gas, and as the police performed violent arrests.

It can be heard in a video from December 31 showing a student being apprehended in front of his classmates by plainclothes security forces.

Shopkeepers and traders who took to the streets on Thursday started shouting insults at police officers before their cries turned to an exhortation for the forces of order to join the protest.

“Police officers! Support us!” they chanted, hopeful that some officers might switch allegiance and tip the balance of the movement in the protesters' favour.

Young protesters were filmed shouting a direct threat to Iran’s supreme leader on January 1, in the city of Marvdasht in southern Iran. The video has since been shared widely online.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , leader of the Islamic Republic, has long been the target of protesters' anger. “Death to the dictator” is a popular chant in Tehran and other provinces.

At the University of Tehran, students were also heard shouting “Death to the principle of Velayate Faqih!”, openly criticising Khamenei’s vision of the Islamic Republic.

Velayate Faqih (or the Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist) is a concept that gives religious leaders more power than their political counterparts and places the supreme leader at the head of State.

The chant targets not just the Khamenei but his entire political system.

Political chants have also referenced the former regime, which was led by Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, until he was overthrown by the Islamic Revolution in 1979. His son, Reza Pahlavi, now lives in the US and is a controversial opposition figure, supported by some protesters.

Chants of “this is the final battle, Pahlavi will return!” and “Reza Shah, may your soul rest in peace,” have been heard at some demonstrations.

Opponents of Reza Pahlavi point to his close ties with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu . Israeli media outlet Haaretz recently reported on an influence operation aimed at reinstalling him as Shah during the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June.

Demonstrators who reject both the current and former regime have been heard chanting “ Neither Shah nor Mullah [a title for Muslim clergy]”.

Beyond political allegiance, the majority of protesters are united around a broader aspiration: to turn the page on the Islamic Republic and build a different future.

Accompanied by an American delegation and greeted by former and current officials, Jolie said she was "honoured" to meet aid volunteers at the crossing.

A Red Crescent volunteer told the Oscar winner that "there are thousands of aid trucks just waiting" at the border crossing.

According to local media , the actor and former special envoy for the UN refugee agency made the visit to see the condition of injured Palestinians transferred to Egypt and to look into aid deliveries into the devastated territory.

Jolie and the Egyptian authorities have yet to officially comment on the visit.

The Rafah border crossing was set to be reopened under the ceasefire in effect in Gaza since October, but has so far remained closed.

In a joint statement on Friday, Egypt and six other countries, including Saudi Arabia , "urged the international community to pressure Israel, as the occupying power, to immediately lift the constraints on the entry and distribution of essential supplies" to Gaza.

In early December, Israel announced that the Rafah crossing would be opened only for those wishing to leave Gaza, prompting Cairo to swiftly deny that it had approved such a move.

Jolie, one of Hollywood's most iconic figures, stepped down from her role as special envoy for the United Nations refugee agency at the end of 2022 after more than 20 years of service, saying she wanted to work on broader humanitarian issues.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:30:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9ee68a74-e7e7-11f0-9f2b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26002475894149.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's STC aims to hold an independence referendum in two years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-stc-aims-hold-an-independence-referendum-two-years-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Yemen's southern separatist movement said on Friday it aims to hold a referendum on independence from the north in two years following its seizure of swathes of the country last month in a move that triggered a major feud between Gulf powers.

A first avalanche hit the southwest Alpine Maira Valley, near the French border in the Italian region of Piedmont, killing one person and injuring two others, Alpine Rescue (Soccorso Alpino) said. One of them is in critical condition.

Rescue teams set out on foot from lower altitudes after the strong winds prevented helicopter crews from reaching the site, the organisation said in a statement.

A second avalanche occurred near Pragelato, a popular ski destination about 60 km (37 miles) west of Turin.

A woman caught in the avalanche managed to free herself but was unable to move because of injuries. Rescue teams were working to evacuate her, with helicopters again limited by adverse weather conditions.

Authorities said they were monitoring reports of a third avalanche in Piedmont, but details were not immediately available.

Separately, in the northeastern Italian region of Veneto, an avalanche on the Vajo Gabene slope in the Small Dolomites killed a 50-year-old ski mountaineer, Italian news agency ANSA said.

Rescue teams reached him by helicopter but were unable to save him.

A combination of heavy snowfall and strong winds has raised avalanche risks across the Alps in recent days, prompting warnings for skiers and hikers.

Local officials urged caution and advised against off-piste excursions as conditions remain unstable.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:50:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria urges civilians to avoid debris from US-backed strikes on Islamists</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-urges-civilians-avoid-debris-us-backed-strikes-islamists-2026-01-02/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Nigeria's military urged civilians in the country's northwest on Friday not to keep or tamper with unexploded ordnance found at sites targeted in recent U.S.-backed airstrikes .

U.S. forces launched a rare strike deep inside Nigeria on December 25 at the request of Nigeria's government, firing 16 GPS-guided munitions from MQ‑9 Reaper drones at two Islamic State-linked camps in Sokoto.

"We do not expect civilians to pick up or keep such materials," Major General Michael Onoja, director of Defence Media Operations, told reporters on Friday. "We can only appeal to them to return all materials that may prove harmful to them."

Onoja said specialized ordnance units within the armed forces were tasked with recovering debris and other remnants from the strikes.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:50:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KKR4VKUILVMCTGRHMWWZRKBW34.jpg?auth=22232ec4f81eff015fb1faec6628e9cb7180b805cb6f182a7827ba830ecfb8a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US says it thwarted potential ISIS-inspired New Year's Eve attack in North Carolina</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fbi-says-it-thwarted-potential-isis-inspired-attack-new-years-eve-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Friday it thwarted an alleged plan by a North Carolina man to carry out an ISIS-inspired attack using knives and hammers on New Year’s Eve.

"Missile strikes in central Kharkiv have nearly destroyed a five-storey dwelling," Regional Governor Oleh Syniehubov told Ukrainian television, saying that according to preliminary information two ballistic missiles had struck the area.

"Rescue teams are on site. They are primarily clearing rubble and searching for people underneath."

Syniehubov said 25 people were injured, with 16 in hospital, including a woman in serious condition.

Mayor Ihor Terekhov put the casualty toll at 30 injured.

Located 30 km (18 miles) from the border, Kharkiv withstood Russian advances in the early weeks of Russia's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbour.

With Russia's forces focused since on capturing eastern regions of the country, the city has been a constant target of aerial attacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:20:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XBLXZZN5TVM3HH6JU27XGFPIAM.jpg?auth=95f44cc06b5af9cd35b627eacf51797bd39c89b7d46e97d3a7afd94d2c9ab503&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria police charge Joshua driver with dangerous driving over fatal collision</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/boxing-nigeria-police-charge-joshua-driver-with-dangerous-driving-over-fatal-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - Nigerian police said on Friday the driver of the vehicle involved in a crash that injured British former world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua and killed two of his close friends was charged with four counts.

Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, 46, appeared before the Sagamu Magistrate Court on Friday in connection with the accident on the Lagos-Ibadan Expressway, Ogun State Police Command said in a statement.

It told Reuters Kayode was charged on four counts, including causing death by dangerous driving. The case was adjourned to January 20.

Reuters was not immediately able to contact Kayode or a legal representative. Kayode has not commented publicly on the case.

Joshua, 36, sustained minor injuries when the Lexus SUV he was travelling in collided with another car on Monday. Two of his friends and team members, Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele, died in the crash.

Preliminary findings suggested the car was speeding and attempted a wrongful overtaking manoeuvre before hitting a stationary truck, the FRSC has said.

Joshua, who was born in Britain to Nigerian parents, was taken to hospital for checks and remains stable, his promoter Matchroom Boxing said.

President Bola Tinubu expressed condolences to Joshua and the victims' families, calling the incident a "tragic accident."

The crash came just over a week after Joshua knocked out American social media star Jake Paul in the sixth round of a bout in Miami. Joshua is expected to fight fellow Briton Tyson Fury later this year.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:43:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/754MCKXBHRP2ZPZFS2TC7LWZ2M.jpg?auth=f4b5f638bbb8ca48e975b236341d97e1834b6d471c9e969bb5864c5a9cf689e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelensky names spy chief Kyrylo Budanov as new top aide</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260102-ukraine-s-zelensky-names-spy-chief-kyrylo-budanov-as-new-top-aide</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday named military intelligence chief Kyrylo Budanov as the new head of his office, after his previous top aide resigned in November over a corruption scandal.

Budanov, 39, has built up a legendary reputation in Ukraine, credited with a series of daring operations against Russia since it launched an all-out assault against its neighbour in 2022.

"I had a meeting with Kyrylo Budanov and offered him the role of the Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine," Zelensky said on social media.

The nomination comes at a key moment in the nearly four-year war, with Zelensky announcing on Wednesday that a US-brokered deal to end the conflict was "90 percent" ready.

"At this time, Ukraine needs greater focus on security issues, the development of the Defence and Security Forces of Ukraine, as well as on the diplomatic track of negotiations," Zelensky said.

"Kyrylo has specialised experience in these areas and sufficient strength to deliver results."

Budanov said he had accepted the nomination and would "continue to serve Ukraine".

"It is an honour and a responsibility for me to focus on critically important issues of strategic security for our state at this historic time for Ukraine," he said on Telegram.

Procedures to formally appoint him as the president's chief of staff have been launched, Zelensky's adviser Dmytro Lytvyn told journalists.

Zelensky has also announced that Budanov will be replaced by the current head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Oleg Ivashchenko.

Budanov, when appointed, will succeed Andriy Yermak, who resigned in November after investigators raided his house as part of a sweeping corruption probe.

Yermak was Zelensky's most important ally, but a divisive figure in Kyiv, where his opponents said he had accumulated vast power, gate-kept access to the president and ruthlessly sidelined critical voices.

The four-year conflict, the deadliest on European soil since World War II, has killed tens of thousands and ravaged swathes of Ukrainian territory.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 17:44:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d0603f2-e7d4-11f0-b9c3-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-02T120450Z-1186667708-RC2ZSIA63Q4F-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZELENSKIY-CHIEF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge orders man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington to remain in custody</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-orders-man-accused-planting-pipe-bombs-washington-remain-custody-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday ordered that the man accused of planting pipe bombs in Washington the night before the January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack should remain behind bars while his case moves forward.

U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Sharbaugh ordered Brian Cole, 30, to be held without bail as he faces two criminal charges related to the attempted bombings of the Democratic and Republican party headquarters. Cole, who faces two explosives-related charges, has not yet entered a plea.

Sharbaugh concluded in his ruling that the U.S. government's evidence against Cole was strong and that the pipe bombs sparked fear and alarm ahead of the congressional certification of the election even though they did not explode.

"If the plan had succeeded, the results could have been devastating: creating a greater sense of terror on the eve of a high-security Congressional proceeding, causing serious property damage in the heart of Washington, D.C., grievously injuring DNC or RNC staff and other innocent bystanders, or worse," Sharbaugh wrote.

A lawyer for Cole argued during a December 30 court hearing that he should be released on strict conditions, pointing to his lack of criminal history and family support.

The attorney said a defense expert was prepared to testify that the devices were not capable of detonating. The FBI has concluded the pipe bombs were viable.

Federal prosecutors have said in a court filing that Cole confessed to planting the pipe bombs and told investigators after his arrest he thought the 2020 election had been “tampered with." President Donald Trump had falsely claimed that the election, which he lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was marred by fraud.

According to the filing, Cole said he didn't like either political party.

The pipe bombs were not discovered until about 1 p.m. on January 6, diverting police resources just as a mob of Trump supporters surged into the Capitol.</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 18:31:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L4OT2JEWGFKABAFQEMYZNAG3PQ.jpg?auth=e6044bb532f4ad4d0c36a5367b5a3038456ed1289e003c361c0a848c1e786c75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hiker killed in rare suspected mountain lion attack in Colorado</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hiker-killed-rare-suspected-mountain-lion-attack-colorado-2026-01-02/</link><description>Jan 2 (Reuters) - A hiker in Colorado has died in the state's first suspected fatal mountain lion attack in over 25 years, authorities said.

The woman was found unresponsive by other hikers on the Crosier Mountain trail northeast of Estes Park around noon on Thursday.

The hikers saw a mountain lion near the woman's body and scared it away by throwing rocks. A doctor was among the hikers and attended to the woman but found no pulse, Colorado Parks and Wildlife spokesperson Kara Van Hoose told reporters.

CPW officers responded to the scene and shot dead two lions in the area. It is not known whether one or multiple animals were involved in the suspected attack, the agency said in a statement. It is believed the woman was hiking alone.

“There were signs that this was consistent with a mountain lion attack,” Van Hoose told a press conference.

Mountain lion attacks on humans in Colorado are rare, with 28 reported to CPW since 1990. The last fatal attack was in 1999.

CPW pathologists are performing necropsies on the dead animals to check for abnormalities and neurological diseases like rabies and avian influenza, as well as human DNA, Van Hoose said.

CPW policy mandates the killing of any mountain lion involved in an attack on a human so as to prevent repeat incidents. If human DNA is not found on either dead lion, authorities will continue to search for animals that may have been involved, Van Hoose said.

Larimer County Coroner will release the identity of the victim and cause of death, she said.

Colorado has a healthy mountain lion population, estimated by CPW to be between 3,800 and 4,400 adults. Conservation efforts have brought the species back from near extinction in the 1960s due to bounty hunting.

Mountain lions are common in the Front Range area where the woman was found, Van Hoose said. The animals go down to lower elevations in winter in search of prey like deer and elk, increasing chances of encounters with humans.

In recent weeks, Kim has made a series of visits to various military and economic facilities to confirm their progress ahead of the key Ninth Party Congress of the Workers' Party, expected to convene early this year to set out major policy goals.

"I wanted to spend the beginning of 2026 with my comrades who are greeting the new year at the northwest tip of our country, so I rushed here as soon as the central event was over," Kim said, lauding the workers' efforts.

Witnesses reported seeing staff at the Le Constellation bar carrying so-called fountain candles atop bottles of champagne, and questions have also arisen about a foam material used to soundproof the ceiling of the basement where revellers danced.

Beatrice Pilloud, chief prosecutor of Valais, the canton that is home to the bar in the upscale ski resort of Crans-Montana, said that available indications were that the fire started because the sparklers got too near to the ceiling.

"From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread blaze ensued," she said on Friday afternoon.

Further investigations will show whether anyone faces criminal liability over the fire, Pilloud said.

Police arrived quickly at the scene according to local residents, but the fire burned victims so severely that investigators said they would need days to identify the bodies.

So far, officials have only identified a teenage Italian international golfer, Emanuele Galeppini. According to two people familiar with the investigation, some of the victims may be under 16.

Local residents said the bar was popular with young people and the Swiss government said many of the dead were likely youths. Beer and wine can be drunk from age 16 in Switzerland.

One of the bar's owners, Jacques Moretti, told the Tribune de Geneve newspaper that Le Constellation had been checked three times in 10 years and that everything was done according to the rules. Reuters was not immediately able to contact the bar's owners for comment.

Stephane Ganzer, head of security in Valais, said the investigation would determine if the bar had undergone its annual building inspections, but that the town had not raised concerns or reported defects to the canton.

Grieving residents continued paying their respects to the victims of the blaze on Friday, leaving flowers and tributes nearby, even as police began reopening the area around the cordoned-off bar in the heart of the wealthy mountain town.

One of them, Ashley Hauri, 23, said just before the fire broke out she had been on the verge of going to Le Constellation to catch up with friends. Ultimately, she decided against it.

Six of her former co-workers ranging in age from their 20s to their 40s were inside when the blaze erupted, she said. Two of them ended up in hospital; the other four are still missing.

"I was really shocked," said Hauri, who immediately tried to contact her friends. "But I had no answers, and I was really scared and panicked because I wanted to do something."</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 23:20:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3JDTZZVCYFOW7K4LK3SQJRGCG4.jpg?auth=25090f65e4e109ab1cbea8a28f606bbdccdda283c7c71dfced505068d35620c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief deeply concerned over Israel's suspension of NGOs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-chief-deeply-concerned-over-israels-suspension-ngos-2026-01-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 2 (Reuters) - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is deeply concerned by Israel's announcement of a suspension of the operations of several international non-governmental organizations in occupied Palestinian territory and called for the measure to be reversed, according to a statement on Friday.

The dozen orders Adams issued since his indictment included a directive to allow federal agents, including immigration officers, to use an office on Rikers Island, the city's main jail. That order was later struck down by a court.

The new mayor also struck down executive orders that Adams had portrayed as addressing antisemitism. Mamdani, a Muslim who some have accused of antisemitism over his support of Palestinians in Gaza, told reporters on Friday that he would fund measures to prevent hate crimes, and would make protection of Jewish New Yorkers a focus of his administration.

Mamdani recalled September 26, 2024, the day when Adams was charged with accepting illegal campaign contributions and luxury travel from Turkish nationals seeking to influence him, as "a moment when many New Yorkers lost even more faith in New York City politics and the ability of city government to actually prioritize the needs of the public, as opposed to the needs of the person."

In April, a U.S. judge dismissed the charges against Adams , a Democrat, at the request of the U.S. Justice Department, which had argued that the case was distracting the mayor from helping Republican President Donald Trump step up deportations.

Mamdani, from the left wing of the Democratic Party, has clashed with Trump over the immigration crackdown.

On Thursday, Mamdani revoked orders by Adams that had prevented city institutions from divesting from Israel and that defined antisemitism in a way recognized by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, an intergovernmental organization of 35 countries that promotes Holocaust education.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations is among groups that argue the IHRA definition has been used to try to silence advocates , opens new tab for Palestinian rights.

While Islamic organizations praised Mamdani's moves, Israel's Foreign Ministry posted on X on Friday that Mamdani "shows his true face: He scraps the IHRA definition of antisemitism and lifts restrictions on boycotting Israel. This isn’t leadership. It’s antisemitic gasoline on an open fire."</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2026 23:40:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7KYD6KHMRM2JC3SQQ2357LE5Y.jpg?auth=d12806a19aa582599177b91dad059b734a085f1978cc5d108c57f07a235662bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian police boost security for Sydney Ashes test after Bondi Beach attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/australian-police-boost-security-sydney-ashes-test-after-bondi-beach-attack-2026-01-03/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Australian police said they would bolster staffing at the Sydney Cricket Ground for the fifth Ashes test starting on Sunday, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city.

The father-and-son gunmen are alleged to have carried out the attack at a Hanukkah event at the famed Bondi Beach on December 14. Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country.

The massacre has sparked more active policing in Sydney, Australia's most populous city and the capital of New South Wales state.

Authorities on Saturday announced a "high-visibility" police presence for the marquee cricket series between Australia and England, which is held every two years. Measures at the cricket ground, some 5 km (3 miles) from Bondi Beach, would include the riot patrol unit, officers on horseback and officers carrying rifles.

“The difference will be in the visibility of long arms and a stronger presence," New South Wales Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said in a statement.

Police said they expected a capacity crowd for day one of the fixture, the final encounter in the five-match series already claimed by Australia.

"Many people may not be used to seeing police carrying rifles at sporting events, but our objective here is to help the public feel safe," Lanyon said.

Cricket Australia said first responders to the attack and "community members who bravely acted" would be honoured before the start of play on Sunday.

There will be a guard of honour on the field and a round of applause for "emergency response agencies and members of the community in the face of extreme danger", the governing body said in a statement.

On Wednesday, around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during New Year celebrations, which typically attract over a million revellers.

Several New Year events planned at Bondi were cancelled, while traditional Christmas celebrations there were muted, following the attack that authorities believe was inspired by Sunni Muslim militant group Islamic State.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 01:40:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GILJ3ZBYONOTJHC6VQCOFQLBXQ.jpg?auth=07a1b1bf6a696ec2860d292b4cac806e93eaa675344c0d0062020d8d1371a541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Military-backed party in Myanmar takes lead in first phase of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/military-backed-party-myanmar-takes-lead-first-phase-polls-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 02(Reuters) - Myanmar's military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party is leading after the first phase of a contentious general election , early results cited by state media showed, in the first vote since a 2021 coup.

Having sparked a nationwide rebellion after crushing pro-democracy protests in the wake of its coup, the ruling junta has said the three-phase vote would bring political stability to the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.

Partial results from Myanmar's first election since 2020, released by the Union Election Commission (UEC) for 56 constituencies, showed the junta-backed party winning by a wide margin as expected, despite thin turnout.

The results published on Friday show the Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP), led by retired generals, winning 38 of 40 seats in the Pyithu Hluttaw, or lower house, whose outcomes have been tallied.

The Shan Nationalities Democratic Party, also known as the White Tiger Party and the Mon Unity Party (MUP) got one seat each.

Among a diminished field of competitors handpicked by the military, the USDP also won 14 seats of the 15 regional or State Hluttaw seats tallied in the first-past-the-post system, while the Akha National Development Party took one.

For the upper house, or Amyotha Hluttaw, only one seat has been declared, which was won by the Wa National Party.

No date has been set for the final result of the election, criticised by the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups as anti-junta political parties are not in the running and it is illegal to criticise the polls.

The election panel has not revealed the total number of constituencies voting in the first phase, opting instead to release partial results on a constituency-by-constituency basis.

On Wednesday, the junta said 52% of voters , or more than half of those eligible, had cast ballots in the first phase.

That fell short of turnout of about 70% in general elections in 2020 and 2015, however, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit International Foundation for Electoral Systems.

Two more rounds of voting set for January 11 and January 25 will cover 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, in some of which the junta does not have complete control.

Aung San Suu Kyi , the Nobel Peace Prize winner deposed by the military months after she won the last general election by a landslide in 2020, remains in detention. Her National League for Democracy has been dissolved.

Ukraine is hosting security advisers for crunch talks on Saturday as Kyiv insists negotiations are zeroing in on a deal, while Russia claims a deadly New Year strike torpedoed the efforts.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said around 15 countries would attend the talks, along with representatives from the European Union and NATO, with a US delegation joining via video link.

Leaders from the so-called coalition of the willing are expected to convene in France next week after Saturday's talks.

The latest peace push comes after Zelensky announced in his New Year's Eve address that the US-brokered plan was "90 percent" ready, but cautioned that important territorial issues remain.

The cause and precise locations of the disturbances were not immediately clear. Videos circulating on social media showed multiple explosions across Caracas. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised land operations in Venezuela. He has not publicly detailed his aims but has privately pressured President Nicolas Maduro to flee the nation, Reuters has reported. Trump said on Monday it would be "smart" for Maduro to leave power.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. has made a major military buildup in the region, including an aircraft carrier, warships and advanced fighter jets stationed in the Caribbean.

Trump has announced a "blockade" of Venezuelan oil, expanded sanctions and staged more than two dozen strikes on vessels the U.S. alleges were involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

Last week, Trump said the United States had "hit" an area in Venezuela where boats are loaded with drugs, marking the first known time Washington has carried out land operations in Venezuela since the pressure campaign began.

He did not say whether those strikes were carried out by the CIA or not. Other media outlets have reported that the spy agency was behind them.

Trump has accused the South American country of flooding the U.S. with drugs, and his administration has for months been bombing boats originating in South America that it alleges were carrying drugs.

Trump on Monday said the United States hit and destroyed a docking area for alleged Venezuelan drug boats.

The Republican leader would not say if it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, noting only that it was "along the shore."

The attack would be the first known land strike on Venezuelan soil.

President Nicolas Maduro has neither confirmed nor denied Monday's strike, but said Thursday he was open to cooperation with Washington after weeks of US military pressure.

The Trump administration has accused Maduro of heading a drug cartel and says it is cracking down on trafficking, but the leftist leader denies any involvement in the narcotics trade, saying Washington is seeking to overthrow him because Venezuela has the largest known reserves of oil on Earth.

Washington has ramped up pressure on Caracas by informally closing Venezuela's airspace, imposing more sanctions and ordering the seizure of tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil.

For weeks Trump has threatened ground strikes on drug cartels in the region, saying they would start "soon," with Monday being the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes on boats in both the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug smugglers.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

The rapidly moving crisis in Yemen has opened a major feud between the two Gulf powers and fractured the coalition of forces , headed by the internationally recognised government, who are fighting the Iran-backed Houthi movement.

The UAE statement said Yemenis should exercise restraint and prioritise dialogue to safeguard security and stability.

It came hours after the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) announced its intention to hold a referendum on independence in two years as its forces were ejected from important areas they suddenly seized last month.

Saudi-backed forces said on Friday they had taken control of key locations in Hadramout, a large province with stretches of desert along the Saudi border, and on Saturday witnesses said they had entered parts of the region's capital Mukalla.

Yemen, split for a decade between warring regions, sits at a highly strategic location between the world's top oil exporter Saudi Arabia and the Bab al-Mandeb strait that guards the vital sea route between Europe and Asia.

The STC has for years been part of the internationally recognised government that controls southern and eastern Yemen and is backed by Gulf states against the Houthis.

Overnight the leader of that government, Presidential Council chief Rashad al-Alimi, said he had asked Saudi Arabia to host a forum to resolve the southern issue, adding he hoped this would bring all southern factions together.

The crisis began early last month when the STC suddenly seized swathes of territory including Hadramout, establishing firm control over the whole territory of the former state of South Yemen that merged with the north in 1990.

The leadership of the internationally recognised government, which had been based in Aden and included several ministers from the STC, departed for Saudi Arabia, which regarded the southern move as a threat to its security.

The crisis triggered the biggest split in decades between formerly close allies Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as years of divergence on critical issues came to a head, threatening to upend the regional order.

How far the feud over their differences on regional security bleeds into other issues may become plainer over the weekend as both countries join a scheduled OPEC meeting to determine the group's output policy.

Early this week Saudi Arabia bombed a base in Hadramout and asked all remaining UAE forces in Yemen to depart, calling this a red line for its security, and the UAE complied.

The STC declaration on Friday that it wants a two-year transition period leading to a referendum on independence for a new South Arabian state was the movement's clearest indication yet of its intention to secede.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:21:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XTQIKGOHANJU7ICFMK5AX7EHBI.jpg?auth=62db8daf5fa3a370376c812588080712678ebf12b68d33b8621983b176076c5d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US has captured Venezuela President Maduro</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-has-captured-venezuela-president-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. struck Venezuela overnight and captured its long-serving President Nicolas Maduro, President Donald Trump said early on Saturday after months of pressuring him over accusations of drug-running and illegitimacy in power.

Washington has not made such a direct intervention in Latin America since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega, over similar allegations.

"The United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the country," Trump said in a Truth Social post.

The U.S. had accused Maduro of running a "narco-state" and rigging last year's election, which the opposition said it won overwhelmingly. The Venezuelan leader, who succeeded Hugo Chavez to take power in 2013, has said Washington wants to take control of Venezuela's oil reserves, the largest in the world.

Trump said the operation was carried out "in conjunction with U.S. Law Enforcement" and promised more details at an 11 a.m. (1600 GMT) press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

Maduro was captured by elite special forces troops, a U.S. official told Reuters.

There was no immediate confirmation by the Venezuelan government of Maduro's capture or departure, but Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino was defiant.

"Free, independent and sovereign Venezuela rejects with all the strength of its libertarian history the presence of these foreign troops, which have only left behind death, pain and destruction," Padrino said in a video broadcast on state media about the same time that Trump posted his message.

"Today we clench our fist in defense of what is ours. Let us unite, for in the unity of the people we will find the strength to resist and to triumph."

While various Latin American governments oppose Maduro and say he stole the 2024 election, direct U.S. action revives painful memories of past interventions and is generally strongly opposed by governments and populations in the region.

The Venezuelan opposition, headed by recent Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, said in a statement on X that it had no official comment on the events.

In the early hours on Saturday, explosions rocked Venezuela's capital Caracas and elsewhere, prompting Maduro's government to declare a national emergency and mobilize troops. It said attacks also took place in the states of Miranda, Aragua and La Guaira.

Blasts, aircraft and black smoke could be seen across Caracas from about 2 a.m. (0600 GMT) for roughly 90 minutes, according to Reuters witnesses and images circulating on social media.

Residents expressed shock and fear as they captured video of billowing smoke and bright orange flashes in the sky. “My love, oh no, look at that,” said one woman in a video, gasping at blasts in the distance.

Carmen Marquez, 50, a resident of the eastern part of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them.

"Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We’re worried about what’s coming next. We don’t know anything from the government, only what the state television says," she said.

A power outage affected the southern area of Caracas, near a major military base, witnesses said. A local media outlet allied with the ruling socialist party said explosions had taken place near the Fuerte Tiuna and La Carlota military bases.

Venezuelan allies Cuba and Iran were quick to condemn the strikes. Tehran called it "a blatant violation of national sovereignty and territorial integrity" and urged the U.N. Security Council to intervene to stop the "unlawful aggression."

The U.S., Venezuela's opposition and various other nations say Maduro rigged an election last year to stay in power. He has said there is a Western conspiracy to oust him illegally.

Trump had repeatedly promised land operations in the South American oil producer and said on Monday it would be "smart" for Maduro to leave power.

The Venezuelan government, in a statement before Trump's announcement, said the goal of the attack was for the United States to take possession of the country's oil and minerals.

The U.S. has made a major military buildup in the region, including an aircraft carrier, warships and advanced fighter jets stationed in the Caribbean.

Trump has sought a "blockade" of Venezuelan oil, expanded sanctions against the Maduro government and staged more than two dozen strikes on vessels the U.S. alleges were involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea.

Last week, Trump said the United States had hit an area in Venezuela where boats are loaded with drugs, marking the first known time Washington has carried out land operations in Venezuela since the pressure campaign began.

Trump has accused Venezuela of flooding the U.S. with drugs, and his administration has for months been bombing boats originating in South America that it alleges were carrying drugs. Many nations have condemned the attacks as extrajudicial killings and Maduro's government has always denied any involvement with drug trafficking.

It was unclear under what legal authority the latest U.S. strikes were carried out. Legal experts have raised questions about the legality of the hits on suspected drug vessels in the region, which have killed more than 110 people so far.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 10:21:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLDZOA7YS5PILOSEHS5TNRUFSI.jpg?auth=dc8160ea4511e3c518dedfec0e8816acba644349a6b590fa0660196d34ac5b99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran supreme leader says will not yield as protests simmer and US threatens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-supreme-leader-says-will-not-yield-protests-simmer-us-threatens-2026-01-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed not to yield after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to come to the aid of protesters, as rights groups reported a sharp rise in arrests following days of unrest sparked by soaring inflation.

Speaking in a recorded appearance on television on Saturday, Khamenei said the Islamic Republic "will not yield to the enemy" and said rioters should be "put in their place".

Rights groups say more than 10 people have been killed and scores detained in demonstrations that have flared across Iran since Sunday as the collapsing rial currency hits an economy already undermined by sanctions.

Authorities have attempted to maintain a dual approach to the unrest, saying protests over the economy are legitimate and will be met by dialogue, while meeting some demonstrations with tear gas amid violent street confrontations.

"The bazaaris were right. They are right to say they cannot do business in these conditions," said Khamenei, referring to market traders' concerns over the currency slide.

"We will speak with the protesters but talking to rioters is useless. Rioters should be put in their place," he added.

Reports of violence have centred on small cities in Iran's western provinces, where several people have been killed. Authorities have said two members of the security services had died and more than a dozen were injured in the unrest.

Hengaw, a Kurdish rights group, said late on Friday that it had identified 133 people arrested, an increase of 77 from the previous day.

Trump on Friday said the U.S. was "locked and loaded and ready to go" but did not specify what action it might take against Iran, where it carried out airstrikes last summer , joining an Israeli campaign targeting Iran's nuclear sites and military leaders.

The threat of action adds to the pressure on Iran's leaders as they navigate one of the most difficult periods in decades, with the sanctions-hit economy shrinking and the government struggling to provide water and electricity in some regions.

Iran has suffered a succession of major strategic blows to its regional position since the start of the war in Gaza in 2023 between its ally Hamas and Israel.

Israeli strikes hammered Iran's strongest regional partner Hezbollah. Tehran's close ally Bashar al-Assad was ousted in Syria. The Israeli and U.S. assault strikes on Iran set back the expensive atomic programme and killed senior military leaders, revealing extensive penetration of Tehran's upper echelons.

The protests are the biggest since mass nationwide demonstrations in late 2022 over the death in custody of Kurdish woman Mahsa Amini. This week's demonstrations have not matched those in scale, but still represent the toughest domestic test for authorities in three years.

Rights groups such as Hengaw and activists posting on social media reported continued protests and violence by security forces across Iran, while state-affiliated media reported what it called attacks on property by infiltrators "in the name of protest".

State television has reported arrests of people accused of manufacturing petrol bombs and home-made pistols.

Numerous social media posts overnight said there had been unrest in a number of cities and towns, as well as three districts of the capital Tehran.

RUSSIA FOREIGN MINISTRY:

"This morning, the United States committed an act of armed aggression against Venezuela. This is deeply concerning and condemnable."

"The pretexts used to justify such actions are unfounded. Ideological animosity has prevailed over business pragmatism and the willingness to build relationships based on trust and predictability."

"In the current situation, it is important, first and foremost, to prevent further escalation and to focus on finding a way out of the situation through dialogue."

"Latin America must remain a zone of peace, as it declared itself to be in 2014. And Venezuela must be guaranteed the right to determine its own destiny without any destructive, let alone military, interference from outside."

"We support the statement by the Venezuelan authorities and the leaders of Latin American countries calling for an immediate meeting of the UN Security Council."

EUROPEAN UNION HIGH REPRESENTATIVE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS KAJA KALLAS:

"I have spoken with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and our Ambassador in Caracas. The EU is closely monitoring the situation in Venezuela.

"The EU has repeatedly stated that Mr Maduro lacks legitimacy and has defended a peaceful transition. Under all circumstances, the principles of international law and the UN Charter must be respected. We call for restraint."

IRAN'S SUPREME LEADER AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI:

"What matters is that when a person realizes the enemy is arrogantly trying to impose something on the country, on the officials, on the government, and on the nation, one must stand firmly against the enemy and bare one’s chest in resistance. We will not yield to the enemy."

"Relying on Almighty God, trusting in God, and with confidence in the support of the people, God willing and by divine grace, we will bring the enemy to its knees."

SPANISH FOREIGN MINISTRY:

"Spain calls for de-escalation and moderation, and for action to always be taken in accordance with international law and the principles of the UN Charter."

"In this regard, Spain is willing to offer its good offices to achieve a peaceful and negotiated solution to the current crisis."

"Earlier this morning, Saturday 3rd January 2026, the United States commenced military operations within the territory of Venezuela.2

"Trinidad and Tobago is NOT a participant in any of these ongoing military operations. Trinidad and Tobago continues to maintain peaceful relations with the people of Venezuela."

RODERICH KIESEWETTER, PROMINENT MP FROM GERMANY’S CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC UNION:

"With President Trump, the U.S. are abandoning the rules-based order that has shaped us since 1945."

"The coup in Venezuela marks a return to the old U.S. doctrine from before 1940: a mindset of thinking in terms of spheres of influence, where the law of force rules, not international law."

"Trump is destroying what was left of any trust in the U.S."

"The American actions in Venezuela overnight are unorthodox and contrary to international law - but if they make China and Russia think twice, it may be a good thing."

"I hope the Venezuelan people can now turn a new leaf without Maduro."

ITALIAN OPPOSITION PARTY LEADER AND FORMER PRIME MINISTER GIUSEPPE CONTE:

"The American aggression against Venezuela has no legal basis. We are facing a blatant violation of international law, which certifies the dominance of the strongest and best equipped militarily... I hope that the entire international community will make its voice heard and that everyone will understand that if rules only apply to enemies and not to friends, no one can feel safe anymore. Nor can the illiberal nature of a government's rule justify an attack to a sovereign state".

"International law prohibits the use of force as a means of national policy. Short of a U.N. Chapter VII mandate, force is only available in response to an armed attack or possibly to rescue a population under imminent threat of extermination."

"Clearly, none of these requirements are fulfilled by the armed operation against Venezuela. The U.S. interest in repressing the drugs trade or claims that the Maduro government was in essence a criminal enterprise offers no legal justification."

INDONESIA'S FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESPERSON, YVONNE MEWENGKANG:

Indonesia is monitoring developments in Venezuela to ensure the safety of its citizens.

"Indonesia also calls on all relevant parties to prioritize peaceful resolution through de-escalation and dialogue, while prioritizing the protection of civilians."

"Indonesia emphasizes the importance of respecting international law and the principles of the UN Charter."

BELGIUM'S DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS MINISTER MAXIME PREVOT:

"The safety of our citizens is a top priority. Our embassy in Bogotá, which is responsible for Venezuela, and our services in Brussels are fully mobilized. The situation is being closely monitored, in coordination with our European partners."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WB2XHWTHBBMMHG5JNKLBCVXGMY.jpg?auth=ce7b16e1261bb7eafcd67f8cafe9c4f2c598885b7ae64de0bbf9bae7537542d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela's president?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/who-is-nicolas-maduro-venezuelas-president-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Following are some key facts about Nicolas Maduro , the Venezuelan president who President Donald Trump said had been captured by U.S. forces on Saturday.

Trump, whose government has accused Maduro of running drug cartels and other crimes, had been pressuring the strongman to leave office for months.

- Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Hugo Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992.

- He campaigned for Chavez’s release from prison and became a fervent supporter of his leftist agenda. He won a seat in the legislature following Chavez's 1998 election.

- He rose to become president of the National Assembly and then foreign minister, travelling the globe to build international alliances through oil-financed assistance programs.

- Chavez named him as his hand-picked successor and Maduro was narrowly elected president in 2013 following Chavez's death.

- His administration oversaw a spectacular economic collapse characterized by hyperinflation and chronic shortages. His rule became best known for allegedly rigged elections, food shortages and rights abuses, including harsh crackdowns on protests in 2014 and 2017. Millions of Venezuelans emigrated abroad.

- His government was subject to aggressive sanctions by the U.S. and other powers. In 2020 Washington indicted him on corruption and other charges. Maduro rejected the accusations.

- He was sworn in for a third term in January 2025 following a 2024 election that was widely condemned by international observers and the opposition as fraudulent. Thousands of people who protested the government's declaration of victory were jailed.

- A U.N. Fact-Finding Mission found last month that the country's Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents, often with impunity.

- His government's repressive measures were highlighted by the award of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FHVBK67CG5NWJALKIX4QYNVY2U.jpg?auth=ed17f12cf6f30e1898ab72cbc5fa7e571687edb0c85504bb05d93b45d461c3c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Rioters must be put in their place,' says Iran’s Khamenei as death toll reaches at least 10</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260103-iran-supreme-leader-condemns-rioters-protest-death-toll-reaches-10</link><description>Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Saturday acknowledged the economic demands of Iranian protesters , while warning against what he described as rioting.

"The president and high-ranking officials are working to resolve" the economic difficulties in the sanctions-battered country, Khamenei said in a speech marking a Shiite holiday.

"The shopkeepers have protested against this situation and that is completely fair," he added. But Khamenei nonetheless warned that while "authorities must have dialogue with protesters, it is useless to have dialogue with rioters. Those must be put in their place."

At least eight people were reported on Thursday to have been killed in the protests so far, including members of the security services, according to official figures.

Two deaths overnight into Saturday involved a new level of violence. In Qom, home to the country's major Shiite seminaries, a grenade exploded, killing a man there, the state-owned IRAN newspaper reported. It quoted security officials alleging the man was carrying the grenade to attack people in the city, some 130 kilometres (80 miles) south of the capital, Tehran.

Online videos from Qom purportedly showed fires in the street overnight.

The second death happened in the town of Harsin, some 370 kilometers (230 miles) southwest of Tehran. There, the newspaper said, a member of the Basij, the all-volunteer arm of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, died in a gun and knife attack in the town in Kermanshah province.

The protests have mostly been concentrated in mid-sized cities in Iran's west and southwest, where clashes and vandalism have been reported.

At least 25 cities have seen protest gatherings of varying sizes, according to an AFP tally based on local media.

However, local media do not necessarily report on every incident, and state media have downplayed coverage of protests, while videos flooding social media are often impossible to verify.

The Fars news agency reported gatherings on Friday in several working-class neighbourhoods of Tehran, which is home to around 10 million people.

But on Saturday, a public holiday, the atmosphere in the capital appeared quiet, with streets mostly empty as the skies spat rain and snow, according to AFP journalists.

In Darehshahr, in the country's west, around 300 people blocked streets, threw molotov cocktails and "brandished Kalashnikovs" on Friday, according to Fars.

The movement kicked off on Sunday when shopkeepers went on strike in Tehran to protest economic conditions, and spread after university students elsewhere in the country took up the cause.

In recent days, the protests have taken on a more overtly political bent.

In Karaj, on the outskirts of the capital, "a few people burned the Iranian flag, shouting 'Death to the dictator!' and 'This isn't the last battle, Pahlavi is coming back!'" Fars reported, adding that others in the crowd objected to the slogans.

The pro-Western Pahlavi dynasty ruled Iran from 1925 to 1979, when it was toppled by the Islamic revolution.

Since the protests began, authorities have adopted a conciliatory tone when it comes to economic demands, while warning that destabilisation and chaos will not be tolerated.

Though widespread, the demonstrations are smaller than the ones that broke out in 2022, triggered by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini , who was arrested for allegedly violating Iran's strict dress code for women.

Her death sparked a nationwide wave of anger that left several hundred people dead, including dozens of members of the security forces.

Iran was also gripped by nationwide protests that began in late 2019 over a rise in fuel prices, eventually leading to calls to topple the country's clerical rulers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 11:39:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/263a95d6-e894-11f0-babc-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003388650698.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan security forces patrol Caracas' empty streets</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/shocked-venezuelans-hunker-down-unsure-what-comes-next-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan security forces patrolled largely empty streets at dawn in the capital, Caracas, on Saturday, hours after loud explosions woke residents to the news that U.S. commandos had bombed the country and captured President Nicolas Maduro .

Streets close to the Miraflores presidential palace were deserted except for checkpoints manned by uniformed gunmen, as residents expressed their shock at a U.S. military strike that left them guessing who was now in charge of the oil-rich nation.

Smoke streaked the sky, with a dark plume still billowing from the direction of the Port of La Guaira to the north, while another was visible near an air base in the capital.

Most residents stayed home, devouring the latest information on their phones, while some went to stock up on groceries in case they need to hunker down for a prolonged period.

For supporters of the opposition, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado , excitement was also in the air.

"My sister, who is in the United States, woke me up with the news; she was crying. We cried together out of happiness," said Jairo Chacin, 39, a mechanic and workshop owner in oil hub Maracaibo, as he waited in a long line to stock up on groceries.

"I went out to check on my business because I was afraid of looting, but the street is deserted. I wanted to fill up my gas tank, but the service stations are already closed, so I took the opportunity to buy food because we don't know what’s coming. Honestly, I have a mix of fear and joy."

U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed Maduro's capture after months of pressuring him over accusations of drug-running and illegitimacy in power. It was the first such U.S. military intervention since the invasion of Panama in 1989 to depose military leader Manuel Noriega .

Soon after the capture of Maduro, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello appeared on state TV standing on the street and wearing a helmet and flak jacket, urging Venezuelans not to cooperate with the "terrorist enemy".

The Venezuelan opposition said in a statement on X that it had no official comment on the events.

The overnight attack began at about 2 a.m. (0600 GMT), according to Reuters witnesses, who saw blasts, aircraft and black smoke across Caracas for roughly 90 minutes. Video verified by Reuters showed multiple explosions illuminating the night sky, followed by loud blasts. The attack left the southern area of the city, near a major military base, without electricity.

"I couldn’t believe it. I saw it first on social media and then on television. Now, I want to know what will come next," said Nancy Pérez, a 74-year-old woman who went out to a bakery near her home in Valencia, central Venezuela.

One eyewitness video, authenticated by Reuters, captured fire and smoke rising above the Port of La Guaira. The location was confirmed by the port layout, road dividers and buildings, which matched file and satellite imagery.

Other verified videos captured explosions and smoke at the Generalissimo Francisco de Miranda Air Base in eastern Caracas.

Flight radar trackers on Saturday morning showed the airspace over Venezuela was completely empty.

Carmen Marquez, 50, who lives in the east of the capital, said she went to her roof and could hear planes at different altitudes, though she could not see them.

"Flare-like lights were crossing the sky and then explosions could be heard. We're worried about what's coming next. We don't know anything from the government, only what the state television says," she said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 12:40:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6A5FEBSE3VPS5OZ2EMWEW7RRBI.jpg?auth=b7026e0bd3b4472ed500b013e6a02158ec412463da39e7f55f0530ee5fc6a0bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer says Britain was not involved in US strikes on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/uks-starmer-says-britain-was-not-involved-us-strikes-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Britain was not involved in the United States' strikes on Venezuela on Saturday and that it was important to uphold international law, and that he wanted to speak to U.S. President Donald Trump and find out exactly what had happened.

Trump said in a post on social media early on Saturday that U.S. forces had captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro and removed him from the country while Venezuela's Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said she did not know Maduro's location or if he was still alive.

Asked if he condemned the U.S. action like the leaders of Britain's left-leaning Liberal Democrat and Green parties, who both called it unlawful, Starmer said he first wanted to understand exactly what had happened.

"It's obviously a fast-moving situation and we need to establish all the facts," he said in a statement to British broadcasters.

"I want to speak to President Trump. I want to speak to allies. I can be absolutely clear that we were not involved ... and I always say and believe we should all uphold international law," he added.

Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party which is currently highest in the opinion polls, said he believed the U.S. actions broke international law "but if they make China and Russia think twice, it may be a good thing".

Starmer, a former human rights lawyer, also said the foreign ministry was working to ensure the roughly 500 British citizens in Venezuela remained safe.

His rule abruptly ended on Saturday when President Donald Trump announced U.S. forces had captured him and flown him out of the country.

A 63-year-old socialist and the handpicked successor of the late Hugo Chavez, Maduro was long accused by critics both at home and abroad of being a dictator who jailed or persecuted political opponents and repeatedly staged sham elections.

Maduro, a salsa aficionado with a flair for theatrics, often called opposition politicians "fascist demons" and took pride in resisting U.S. pressure against him, even having his invocation to Trump of "yes peace, not war" remixed into an electronica song.

He was sworn in for a third term in January 2025 following a 2024 election that was widely condemned as fraudulent by international observers and the opposition. Thousands of people who protested against the government's declaration of victory were jailed.

Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries also considered Maduro's election win in 2018 to be a sham.

His government's repressive measures were highlighted by the awarding of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize to opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

After Trump announced last October that he was authorizing CIA operations in the country, Maduro blasted "those demonic powers that aim to sink their claws into Venezuela to steal our oil." Maduro has long denied U.S. accusations of connections to drug smuggling and corruption.

In August, Washington doubled its reward for Maduro's arrest to $50 million over allegations of drug trafficking and links to criminal groups.

Trump ratcheted up the pressure in recent months with a huge build-up of the U.S. military in the southern Caribbean, more than two dozen strikes on vessels allegedly involved in trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea, and a ramping up of sanctions.

A U.N. Fact-Finding Mission found last month that the country's Bolivarian National Guard (GNB) committed serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity over more than a decade in targeting political opponents.

Maduro long denied abusing political and human rights, instead describing his government as being at odds with what he views as a decades-long imperialist campaign to topple Chavez's socialist movement and take Venezuela's oil.

He and his government called sanctions by the U.S. and others illegitimate measures that amounted to an "economic war" designed to cripple the country. His supporters hailed him as a hero who stood up to Washington in the tradition of Cuba's Fidel Castro.

Protesters led months of demonstrations in 2017 against Maduro's government, a period marked by accusations of torture, arbitrary arrests and abuse by security forces. Those protests left 125 people dead.

Dozens more died during protests after Maduro's inauguration to his second term in 2019. After the 2024 election, the U.N. found that Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests, with over two dozen dead and 2,400 arrests.

Maduro's rule was marked by an extended economic collapse in the once relatively affluent nation that prompted an exodus of some 7.7 million migrants.

Almost 82% of Venezuelans live in poverty, with 53% in extreme poverty, unable to buy even basic foodstuffs, a U.N. special rapporteur said in 2024 after visiting the country.

Maduro was born into a working-class family on November 23, 1962, son of a trade union leader. He worked as a bus driver during the time army officer Chavez led a failed coup attempt in 1992.

He agitated for Chavez to be released from prison and backed his fervent leftist agenda in an era when socialism was well out of favor.

After Chavez's 1998 election, Maduro won a seat in the legislature and spent years championing his mentor's self-styled revolution against U.S. intervention in Latin America.

Adversaries took swipes at Maduro's working-class roots and portrayed him as a buffoonish cretin who did little more than slavishly repeat Chavez's bombast.

But the criticism made little dent in his meteoric rise: he became president of the National Assembly and later foreign minister. In that role he crisscrossed the globe to help build alliances with other developing countries through oil-financed assistance programs.

Maduro was narrowly elected president after Chavez died from cancer in 2013. But there was a gaping chasm between his own appeal and the legendary charisma of his predecessor.

His rule was quickly plagued by bread lines and product shortages that smacked of Soviet-era collapse, largely due to his unwillingness to unwind lavish Chavez-era subsidies that were unsustainable after the oil boom came to an end.

As inflation soared in 2013, Maduro sent troops to occupy shops that sold home appliances and forced them to sell off their wares at fire-sale prices, helping fuel his popularity in the run-up to a nationwide election for mayors.

In 2018, militants attempted to assassinate him by sending explosives-laden drones over the top of a rally he was addressing on a Caracas avenue, leading him to reduce his spontaneous public appearances and limit live broadcasts of public events.

Throughout his career, Maduro was often flanked by his wife, Cilia Flores, who held numerous high-ranking positions, including attorney general and chief of parliament, and was often seen as a power broker with as much influence as her spouse.

Trump said on Saturday Flores was also captured and flown out of the country.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 14:19:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CU653BXW3BNXHPXQGSPQEVJ7SA.jpg?auth=a0df28f27bccaa3c1e37ef8d9f19ee858950aea3967783160cd0b04c95669f84&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors place bar managers under investigation after deadly blaze</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-prosecutors-place-bar-managers-under-investigation-after-deadly-blaze-2026-01-03/</link><description>VIENNA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors said on Saturday they have placed under criminal investigation the two managers of a bar where a blaze on New Year's Day killed at least 40 people.

Zelenskiy called on Ukrainian lawmakers to support Shmyhal, a former prime minister, as the new energy minister, saying his experience was vital to ensure stability in the power sector amid intensifying Russian attacks.

"It is crucial that, after each Russian strike, we can quickly restore what has been destroyed, and that the growth of Ukraine’s energy sector remains stable and sufficient to meet the country’s needs," Zelenskiy said, posting a picture of him meeting Shmyhal in the presidential office on Telegram.

Russia has pounded Ukraine's energy sector with drones and missiles for consecutive winters since the war began nearly four years ago. In recent months, Moscow has again intensified its strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, forcing long blackouts across the country during critical winter months.

Shmyhal, 50, is one of the most experienced government officials in Ukraine, praised by analysts for his skills to maintain economic stability and ensure efficient government operations after Russia's invasion in February 2022.

He was Ukraine's longest-serving prime minister, running the government from 2020 until July 2025, when he was appointed defence minister.

Shmyhal's appointment comes as Zelenskiy launched a major shake-up of the Ukrainian defence sector and security forces.

On Friday, Zelenskiy appointed popular military intelligence head Kyrylo Budanov as his chief of staff and also nominated a new defence minister.

The reshuffle of Ukraine's top officials overseeing security forces and crucial defence and energy sectors comes weeks after a major energy sector corruption scandal that caused Ukraine's biggest wartime political crisis, resulting in the dismissal of Zelenskiy's previous head of office. Justice and energy ministers also resigned as a result of the scandal.

Zelenskiy said the changes were needed to make Ukraine more resilient as the country faces a critical moment in its efforts to end the war with Russia.

The government changes come as Ukrainian negotiators press for security guarantees from the United States and European allies as U.S. President Donald Trump pushes both Kyiv and Moscow to find a solution on how to end the war.

National security advisors from 18 countries met in Kyiv on Saturday to discuss the details of security guarantees and economic agreements on Ukraine's post-war recovery.

Ukraine’s parliament must approve Zelenskiy’s nominations of energy and defence ministers.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:20:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FQ7OV3AFQFJKFIAUNBISE2TNOE.jpg?auth=ae41b9c934f0378af22a83485e994d2e94a7cd245b1aeef6bd1fc7b25c6e47ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela vice president Rodriguez in Russia, four sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-vice-president-rodriguez-russia-four-sources-say-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez is in Russia, four sources familiar with her movements said on Saturday, after President Donald Trump said President Nicolas Maduro had been seized by U.S. forces after an attack on the country.

"These acts represent a grave affront to Venezuela's sovereignty and yet another extremely dangerous precedent for the entire international community," Lula said in a post on X.

Lula also called for a "vigorous" response from the United Nations, adding that Brazil remains open to promoting dialogue and cooperation.

Earlier on Saturday, the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed Maduro, President Donald Trump said, in Washington's most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.

Lula had previously said that an armed intervention in Venezuela would be a "humanitarian catastrophe" , and has repeatedly offered for Brazil to mediate disputes between the countries.

Brazilian officials were holding an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Venezuela, the country's foreign ministry told Reuters, while noting that Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira had spoken with his Venezuelan counterpart on Saturday. It did not provide further details.

The head of Brazil's Federal Police also said Venezuela had closed its border with the country, one of the main crossing points for Venezuelan refugees in the region and where Brazil has run operations to assist them since 2018.

After a brief closure, the border was reopened, Roraima state Governor Antonio Denarium told Reuters. Roraima is one of two Brazilian states - along with Amazonas - to share borders with Venezuela and receives around 70% of all Venezuelan refugees that arrive in Brazil, the governor said.

There were no official reports of a higher influx of refugees at the border ahead of its closing due to the military escalation in Venezuela.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:20:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YIDKLLGQXFL2TFEFUPZEUCZJOQ.jpg?auth=ea5f5068d656a71bf5f6201014a91a6146da6ceb349d500e2225f4148292c1a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Inside Venezuela’s oil industry: World’s largest oil reserves, failing infrastructure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260103-world-largest-oil-reserves-failing-infrastructure-inside-venezuela-oil-industry</link><description>⁠The ‍United ​States is ⁠going to be "very strongly involved" in Venezuela 's ​oil ‍industry in the ​wake of the operation to ​capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro , President Donald Trump told Fox News ‍on Saturday.

"We have ​the greatest oil companies in the ‌world, the biggest, the greatest, ‍and we're going to be very much involved.

Here's what we know about Venezuela’s oil industry.

Venezuela holds the world’s largest oil reserves – about 303 billion barrels, or 17% of global reserves – surpassing OPEC+ leader Saudi Arabia , according to the London-based Energy Institute. Most of its reserves are heavy oil in the Orinoco Belt, making production costly, though technically straightforward, according to the US Energy Department.

Despite its vast reserves, Venezuela’s crude output remains far below capacity due to mismanagement, underinvestment, and sanctions. Production, which once peaked at 3.5 million barrels per day in the 1970s (over 7% of global output), fell below 2 million bpd during the 2010s and averaged around 1.1 million bpd last year.

Analysts note that any regime change could eventually boost production if sanctions are lifted and foreign investment returns. However, historical precedents in Libya and Iraq suggest recovery is unlikely to be rapid.

Venezuela nationalised its oil sector in the 1970s, creating Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA). In the 1990s, it briefly opened up to foreign investment, but under Hugo Chavez from 1999 onward, PDVSA was required to maintain majority ownership in all projects. The state company partnered with firms including Chevron, China National Petroleum Corporation, ENI, Total, and Russia’s Rosneft to boost production.

The United States was formerly Venezuela’s main oil buyer, but sanctions shifted the main market to China over the past decade. Exports halted entirely after the Trump administration’s blockade on vessels entering or leaving Venezuela in December 2025. PDVSA also owns significant refining capacity abroad, including CITGO in the US, though creditors are contesting control through long-standing legal cases in American courts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 15:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/378d7240-e8b2-11f0-9359-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25355780619234.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Condemnation and applause in Latin America</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/condemnation-applause-latin-america-after-us-seizes-venezuelas-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>SANTIAGO/SAO PAULO, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Latin American leaders were divided between condemnation and jubilation in the wake of a surprise attack on Venezuela early on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump said resulted in the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro.

While much of the region has long been wary of a return to U.S. interventions throughout the 20th century that helped install authoritarian governments from Chile to Honduras, Maduro - who presided over his country’s social and economic collapse - was an increasingly unpopular and isolated leader.

Many Latin American countries have also experienced a shift in recent elections to more right-leaning governments, many of whose leaders view the U.S.-backed military regimes of the last century as necessary bulwarks against socialism.

In a sign of the economic pain faced under Maduro, nearly 8 million Venezuelans have fled the country since 2018, with 85% of them migrating to neighbors in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the UN's International Organization for Migration.

Many countries in the region have experienced surges in organized crime in recent years and the specter of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang has loomed large over voters' minds, leading to a rise in politicians vowing to crack down on crime and immigration.

While few leaders will shed serious tears about Maduro's ousting, governments in the region will react along political lines, said Steven Levitsky, a professor and director of Harvard's David Rockefeller Center for Latin American Studies.

"I think you'll see right-wing governments applaud because that's what they do. You'll see left-wing governments criticize because how could they not?" Levitsky said.

The strongest condemnation of the attack came in a string of posts on X from neighboring Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, a leftist who has frequently clashed with Trump and has also been threatened by the U.S. president.

“The Colombian government rejects the aggression against the sovereignty of Venezuela and Latin America,” Petro said in one message, while calling for an immediate meeting of the United Nations Security Council, of which Colombia is a member.

His Brazilian counterpart, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, echoed Petro's comments.

“The bombings on Venezuela’s territory and the capture of its president cross an unacceptable line,” Lula said in a statement.

Chile’s outgoing President Gabriel Boric condemned the attack but President-elect Jose Antonio Kast, who rose to power by promising to crack down on migration and crime, said in a post on X that Maduro's arrest was great news for the region.

"Now begins a greater task. The governments of Latin America must ensure that the entire apparatus of the regime abandons power and is held accountable," Kast, who will be sworn in on March 11, said.

Argentina’s President Javier Milei, Trump’s closest ally in the region, has long criticized Maduro and posted videos and statements on X in favor of the attack.

In Ecuador, right-wing President Daniel Noboa said Venezuelans opposed to Maduro and his political godfather Hugo Chavez have an ally in Ecuador.

“All the criminal narco-Chavistas will have their moment,” Noboa said on X. “Their structure will finally collapse across the continent.”

Protests both in favor and against the strikes in Venezuela have been scheduled in Buenos Aires and other cities across the region.

The capture of Maduro by U.S. forces “is one of the most momentous decisions in the history of U.S.-Latin America relations,” said Brian Winter, editor-in-chief of Americas Quarterly and vice president of policy at Americas Society/Council of the Americas.

“The operation confirms return of Washington as policeman in its 'sphere of influence,' an idea that defined much of 19th and 20th centuries but had faded since (the) end of the Cold War,” Winter said in a post on LinkedIn.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WX7XTYXSMROINF3QZVX3BIMS6Q.jpg?auth=328f5341af57b25392cb7b8ea09c7cb824aac3a631cb31650272f44e8fdbf091&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela diaspora celebrates Maduro's deposition, wonders what's next</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-diaspora-celebrates-maduros-deposition-wonders-whats-next-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 (Reuters) - Venezuelan migrants around the world erupted in celebration on Saturday following the U.S.-led deposition of President Nicolas Maduro, whose government prompted one of the largest migration crises in recent history.

Chants celebrating Maduro's capture were heard in the streets of Chile's capital, where Venezuelans gathered to share their joy.

"We are free. We are all happy that the dictatorship has fallen and that we have a free country," said Khaty Yanez, a Venezuelan woman who has spent the last seven years in Chile.

"My joy is too big," her compatriot Jose Gregorio said. "After so many years, after so many struggles, after so much work, today is the day. Today is the day of freedom."

Since 2014, some 7.7 million Venezuelans or 20% of the population have left the country unable to afford food or seeking better opportunities abroad, according to the U.N. International Organization for Migration , opens new tab .

Neighboring Colombia has received the largest share of the diaspora, around 2.8 million, followed by 1.7 million in Peru, according to the R4V platform, a group of regional NGOs assisting migrants and refugees from Venezuela set up by the U.N. migration agency.

For years, the U.S. was a haven for Venezuelans but in President Donald Trump's second term many are being branded criminals and forced to seek refuge elsewhere .

After the initial joy, doubts about Venezuela's future also set in, as Venezuelans abroad wonder what the future holds for their country and its citizens.

Andres Losada, who has lived in Spain for three years and is among the 400,000 Venezuelans residing in the country according to official data, said he is struggling between worry and joy about the situation in Venezuela.

"Although what people are going through in Caracas is tough, I believe that beyond that there is a light that will lead us to freedom," he added.

Venezuelan security forces patrolled largely empty streets at dawn in the capital, Caracas, on Saturday. Most residents stayed home, devouring the latest information on their phones, while some went to stock up on groceries in case they need to hunker down for a prolonged period.

Speaking to a local TV station in Spain, Agustin Rodriguez, the vice president of a Venezuelan cultural association, expressed concern about the strikes but said they "may be necessary to find a way out for the country in which there can be a return to power alternation, where there can be a future."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7PLP7FO3E5LLTPJ3L7KPKKGURY.jpg?auth=8e1226105a34031b75a85367aebda05b844d200b746508028a665e1d34a2269f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan opposition activists in Madrid warily cheer Maduro capture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelan-opposition-activists-madrid-warily-cheer-maduro-capture-2026-01-03/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 3 (Reuters) - In Madrid, Venezuelan opposition activists and others who follow the situation in their homeland were glued to TV and social media on Saturday, amazed by news of Nicolas Maduro's capture by U.S. forces .

But they also wondered what comes next.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who had been applying intense pressure on Maduro for months, announced that U.S. forces had captured Maduro and flown him out of the country, saying later that the Venezuelan leader and his wife would be taken to New York.

Spain is home to the largest Venezuelan migrant population outside Latin America and the U.S., and they include senior opposition figures including Edmundo Gonzalez and Leopoldo Lopez.

"We are all happy," one opposition figure told Reuters by WhatsApp. "But we must ensure that the transition is orderly, peaceful and respectful," said the person, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the situation.

This person rejected the idea that Vice President Delcy Rodriguez might now take power, saying that the opposition leaders who won past elections before being blocked by Maduro were the rightful heirs to the Venezuelan presidency.

Venezuela's opposition, the United States and many other Western countries considered Maduro's election wins in 2018 and 2024 to be fraudulent.

"The Venezuelan people voted massively for Edmundo (Gonzalez) and Maria Corina Machado . Edmundo is the president-elect with constitutional legitimacy," the person said, referring to the July 2024 election and adding this ruled out Rodriguez.

Manuel Garcia, a former opposition leader and lawmaker who left Venezuela after the disputed 2024 election, said the speed of Maduro's removal demonstrated his government did not have the "military capacity they have been boasting about".

"Today marks the beginning of a new stage that will culminate in the consolidation of the transition led by María Corina and President Edmundo Gonzalez," Garcia said.

José Miguel Calvillo, an international affairs and migration professor at Madrid's Complutense University, said it was "very likely" that the U.S. had already had some back-channel discussions with elements of the Venezuelan government and the military to arrange a transition.

"If it is confirmed that the intervention of the United States has been supported by the internal government, a transitional government will be expected to include major players from the current opposition," he said.

"What is desirable for both Venezuela and the U.S. is that there will not be a radical break with the current government but rather a moderate transition."

Manuel Muñiz, chancellor of Madrid's private IE Business School, said the coming days would test the strength both of the opposition and the Venezuelan government beyond just Maduro.

"The Venezuelan regime is quite granular and present throughout Venezuelan society," he said. "There are a number of avenues in front of us, and not all of them lead to open, peaceful elections and a transition of power in Venezuela. There are some that lead to violence, disorder and instability."

Jimena Blanco, chief analyst for risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said there were divergent views in the opposition about whether Machado or Gonzalez should take the presidency.

Machado was barred from running in the 2024 presidential election, despite having won the opposition's primary by a landslide, and her ally Edmundo Gonzalez took her place as the main opposition candidate.

Machado won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her work promoting democracy.

Blanco said that while Gonzalez may be the constitutionally elected president, Machado is credited with unifying the opposition, creating the conditions for his election and risking her life staying in Venezuela to maintain opposition momentum.

"There are others that argue that Edmundo Gonzalez is elected president and he should take office," she said.

Scenarios discussed in opposition circles included a military junta of second or third tier armed forces leaders overseeing a civilian cabinet of opposition leaders that did not include Machado, for her to then run in elections.

"For her it would be very damaging if she was to be seen as to be placed in power rather than ascending to power through democratic channels she has tried to promote," Blanco said.

In the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago where many Venezuelans live, Agustín Rodríguez, vice president of the Canarian-Venezuelan Union migrant support network, said he had mixed feelings about Saturday's events.

But he hoped it meant the third of Venezuela's population that lives in exile - something he described as the country's "displaced heart" - could return.

Some 7.7 million Venezuelans left the country in recent years.

"No one likes to see these kinds of fireworks, but they may be necessary to find a way out for the country in which there can be a return to power alternation, there can be a future, people can return to their country," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 16:26:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LN33CFML4JLY7AICNXPHCIMRF4.jpg?auth=69ead17414fbb589dadee50bf4af6a4356a56562627b8ca0387df20307382685&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Disbelief as fire exploded inside Swiss bar: 'We thought it was a joke'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/disbelief-fire-exploded-inside-swiss-bar-we-thought-it-was-joke-2026-01-03/</link><description>CRANS-MONTANA, Switzerland, Jan 3 (Reuters) - When a devastating fire broke out in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana at around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, some New Year’s revellers seemed unsure at first whether to take it seriously.

Le Constellation, a two-storey bar with a glass-enclosed terrace, was still packed with partygoers, many of them teenagers.

Witnesses reported seeing a staff member, who was sitting on the shoulders of a colleague, carrying bottles with fizzing candle-style sparklers in the basement section shortly before the ceiling caught fire.

A video shared on social media and verified by Reuters shows a young man using his shirt to try to beat back flames that are beginning to form in the ceiling as others record the scene on their phones. Loud music plays in the background.

"We thought it was a joke, or that it wasn't necessarily serious," said Axel Clavier, a teenager who was in the basement with friends when the fire started.

Moments later, there was a huge cloud of black smoke, Clavier told the Swiss news agency Keystone. "We couldn't breathe anymore."

It all happened in seconds, said Julia, a 19-year-old from the Swiss city of Lausanne who did not want to give her last name. Panic ensued.

"People just suddenly started running and walking on top of each other," she told Reuters, fighting back tears. "There was an enormous crowd, and this really small entrance, and it was hard to escape."

She was on the ground floor and escaped with an injured foot. A friend, who was with her, got caught in the flames that tore through from the basement and ended up in hospital with severe burns, she said.

At least 40 people were killed and 119 injured in the inferno, said Swiss officials in the southwestern canton of Valais, an "unprecedented" toll in a resort known for panoramic Alpine views and sporting attractions like skiing and golf.

Initial investigations suggest the blaze started when the so-called fountain candles attached to champagne bottles got too close to the ceiling , local prosecutor Beatrice Pilloud told a news conference on Friday. "From there, a rapid, very rapid and widespread conflagration ensued."

Questions have also arisen about a foam material that may have been used to soundproof the ceiling of the basement where revellers danced to rap music.

The investigation will focus on renovations that were made to the bar and the materials used, the fire extinguishing systems and escape routes, as well as the number of people in the building when the blaze started, she said.

Swiss prosecutors said on Saturday they have placed the bar's two managers under investigation on suspicion of homicide by negligence and other crimes. Reuters could not immediately reach them for comment.

The Swiss newspaper Tribune de Geneve quoted one of the owners, Jacques Moretti, as saying the bar had been inspected three times in the past 10 years, and "everything was done according to the rules."

Reuters interviewed more than a dozen witnesses, including three survivors, and reviewed multiple videos and pictures to piece together what unfolded in the early hours of New Year's Day.

Known locally as "Le Constel", the bar was a popular evening hangout for foreign students and local teenagers, who in Switzerland are allowed to buy beer and wine from the age of 16.

"It's a bar where we'd go for our first outings when we were 16 or 17," said 21-year-old Samuel Rapp, who was at a Mexican restaurant next door when the fire broke out. "We'd go there because you can play pool; we'd play darts."

The night of the fire, witnesses described lines out the door with some people turned away because they had not booked tables.

One young survivor, who gave his name only as Nathan, said the display with the sparklers seemed to be a regular attraction.
"We were there the night before, and there was a table next to us that had the same show," he told Keystone.

A promotional video for the bar also showed people carrying bottles of champagne with fizzing sparklers at the venue.

Moretti acquired the bar with his wife in 2015, Swiss company records show. It was substantially refurbished since then, according to witness accounts and local media reports at the time.

Witnesses described a single stairwell leading from the basement to the enclosed terrace, with a small door at the end, where desperate people trying to escape from both floors became trapped. It was not immediately clear whether there were other emergency exits.

Laetitia Place, 17, said she had just entered the basement area expecting to meet friends when the fire exploded and raced across the ceiling.

"I saw a friend of mine, and then we saw the fire, and we went straight back up," she told Reuters.

"The first stairs are pretty easy to get through since they're wide," she said. "But after that, there's the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell. We were piled on top of each other; some people were burning, and some were dead next to us."

Clavier, who was also in the basement, said he got blocked by a mass of people. He described pushing over a table so he could shield behind it from the heat as he waited for the crowd to thin out.

"We couldn't see anything at all, as there was no light," he told reporters on Friday. "There was one door of 1.5 meters (4.9 ft) wide for some two or three hundred people to get out. The people fell, and they suffocated."

Others described seeing people trapped inside banging on the reinforced glass until it yielded. Clavier said he managed to break out after striking a window with a table and kicking it.

Emergency responders arrived at the scene in minutes, police said, but the fire spread so quickly that for many, it was too late. Improvised triage centres were set up in nearby cafes.

"We saw people burnt without any hair, without clothes because they were so burnt," said Jérémy Halna, a 22-year-old student who was visiting from France and said he helped some of those emerging from the flames into the freezing night.

A DEADLY 'FLASHOVER'
Many in the town described an agonising search for friends lost in the scramble and children who never returned from their night out.

The fire burned victims so severely that investigators said they would need days to identify the bodies.

"I don’t know if he is even recognisable," said Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, whose 16-year-old son, Arthur, sent her a New Year's text message from Le Constellation about an hour before the fire started.

"All that I want is to find my son and be close to him, whether he be alive or dead," she said.

Fire safety experts interviewed by Reuters said the evidence points to a familiar scenario: blazes ignited by indoor fireworks and other pyrotechnics have claimed hundreds of lives at bars and nightclubs.

"Nightclubs are not fire-safety friendly places," said Milad Haghani, associate professor of urban resilience and mobility at the University of Melbourne. He noted the danger of flammable soundproofing insulation, commonly found in such disasters.

When flammable surfaces ignite in confined spaces, a so-called "flashover" can occur, where nearly everything in a room explodes into flames at once.

"The fire will look for oxygen in order to grow; that's its physical mechanism," said Olivier Burnier, a partner in Swiss fire safety consultancy Fire Safety &amp; Engineering SA. "That's why we had what people described as an explosion."

Under Swiss law, any venue holding more than 100 people must have at least two 90-centimetre (35.4-inch) exits, he said. For those holding over 200, one exit must be 90 centimetres and the other at least 120 centimetres.

Pilloud, the prosecutor, said investigators would be looking into the safety measures at the bar, including exits and fire extinguishers.

One person familiar with the establishment, who asked not to be identified, said a water sprinkler system was installed by the previous owner. Reuters could not determine whether such a system was operating the night of the fire. At least one witness said she saw no sign of one as she fled the building.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XLJ2GBF2JBIKPB4GLGL237WAKA.jpg?auth=f108747aa3467c796ac955038bbbd6f824ff4b74a561bd270bfba2e7c2bc88e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Inside the US operation to capture Maduro</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/mock-house-cia-source-special-forces-us-operation-capture-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - At 4:21 on Saturday morning, U.S. President Donald Trump sent a message on his Truth Social platform: the United States had carried out a daring mission to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife.

The action came as a surprise, but according to sources familiar with the matter, planning for one of the most complex U.S. operations in recent memory had been in the works for some time and included detailed rehearsals.

Elite U.S. troops, including the Army's Delta Force, created an exact replica of Maduro's safe house and practiced how they would enter the strongly fortified residence.

The CIA had a small team on the ground starting in August who were able to provide insight into Maduro's pattern of life that made grabbing him seamless, according to one source familiar with the matter.

Two other sources told Reuters the intelligence agency also had an asset close to Maduro who would monitor his movements and was poised to pinpoint his exact location as the operation unfolded.

With the pieces in place, Trump approved the operation four days ago, but military and intelligence planners suggested he wait for better weather and less cloud cover.

In the early hours of Saturday, the mission to capture Maduro started. Trump, surrounded by his advisers at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, watched a live stream of the operation.

How the hours-long operation unfolded is based on interviews with four sources familiar with the matter and details Trump himself has revealed.

"I've done some pretty good ones, but I've never seen anything like this," Trump said on Fox News just hours after the mission was completed.

The Pentagon has overseen a massive military build up of forces in the Caribbean, sending an aircraft carrier, 11 warships and more than a dozen F-35 aircraft. In total, more than 15,000 troops have poured into the region for what U.S. officials have long described as anti-drug operations.

According to one of the sources, Trump senior aide Stephen Miller, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and CIA Director John Ratcliffe formed a core team working on the issue for months with regular - sometimes daily - meetings and phone calls. They often also met with the president.

Late on Friday night and into early Saturday, Trump and his advisers huddled as a number of U.S. aircraft took off and carried out strikes against targets inside and close to Caracas, including air defense systems, according to a U.S. military official.

Trump told Fox News Channel's "Fox &amp; Friends" the number of U.S. aircraft involved was "massive".

"We had a fighter jet for every possible situation," Trump said.

Sources have told Reuters that in addition to fighter jets, the Pentagon had also quietly moved into the region refueling air tankers, drones and aircraft specializing in electronic jamming.

U.S. officials told Reuters that the airstrikes hit military targets. Images taken by Reuters at the La Carlota air base in Caracas showed charred military vehicles from a Venezuelan anti-aircraft unit.

With the strikes taking place, U.S. Special Forces made their way into Caracas heavily armed, including with a blow torch in case they had to cut through steel doors at Maduro's location. Officials did not say how the troops entered the city, but video posted on social media by residents showed a convoy of helicopters flying over Caracas at a low altitude.

Once they reached Maduro's safe house the troops, along with FBI agents, made their way into the residence, which Trump described as a "very highly guarded... fortress."

"They just broke in, and they broke into places that were not really able to be broke into, you know, steel doors that were put there for just this reason," Trump said. "They got taken out in a matter of seconds."

It is unclear how U.S. forces were able to capture Maduro and his wife once they entered the house, but Trump said the Venezuelan leader had unsuccessfully tried to get to a safe room.

"He was trying to get into it, but he got bum rushed so fast that he didn't get into that," Trump said.

Some U.S. forces were hit, Trump said, but none were killed.

As the operation unfolded, Rubio started to inform lawmakers that it was underway. The notifications only began after the operation started and not before, as is customary for key lawmakers who play an oversight role, officials told Reuters.

Little is yet known about Maduro's extraction from Caracas. Trump said that one helicopter was hit "pretty hard" but was able to make it back.

The Venezuelan leader was flown to the USS Iwo Jima, an amphibious assault ship, and will be transferred to New York to stand trial.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6A5FEBSE3VPS5OZ2EMWEW7RRBI.jpg?auth=b7026e0bd3b4472ed500b013e6a02158ec412463da39e7f55f0530ee5fc6a0bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany urges political solution for Venezuela crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/germany-urges-political-solution-venezuela-crisis-2026-01-03/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Germany's foreign ministry on Saturday called for a political solution in Venezuela where the United States attacked and captured leader Nicolas Maduro .

"We call on all involved parties to avoid an escalation of the situation and to seek ways for a political settlement," said a written communication obtained by Reuters after a crisis team had met at the ministry.

"International law has to be respected ... Venezuelans deserve a peaceful and democratic future," it added.

The ministry said it was in close contact with the embassy in Caracas and a travel warning had been issued.

Its note echoed statements by both the European Union's top diplomat Kaja Kallas, who also has repeatedly said that Maduro "lacks legitimacy," and from EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who demanded the observance of international law.

German politicians and commentators on Saturday took mixed stances, with some applauding Maduro's removal and others condemning what they called the abandonment of the rules-based order of the post-1945 Western world.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2P62CJLHTRIHXCC3MEH6BUVZCA.jpg?auth=a3e8387ff99d0ecf233c4b4d8c6026e429e6d48f26a26efc884d2b805c5575a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is Delcy Rodriguez, the vice president who could replace Venezuela's Maduro?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/who-is-delcy-rodriguez-vice-president-who-could-replace-venezuelas-maduro-2026-01-03/</link><description>Buenos Aires, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Following are some facts about Venezuelan vice president Delcy Rodriguez, who could take charge of the government after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that President Nicolas Maduro had been captured by U.S. forces.

Security Council meeting.

Venezuela and Colombia, backed by Russia and China, have asked for the 15-member Security Council to meet, diplomats said, after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed its long-serving autocratic President Nicolas Maduro. The meeting has not yet been scheduled.

"These developments constitute a dangerous precedent," Guterres' spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. "The Secretary-General continues to emphasize the importance of full respect - by all - of international law, including the UN Charter. He’s deeply concerned that the rules of international law have not been respected."

The U.N. Security Council has met twice - in October and December - over the escalating tensions between the United States and Venezuela.

"The deadly and treacherous U.S. military attack is being carried out against a country that is at peace," Venezuela's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada wrote to the Security Council on Saturday, warning that it "has serious implications for regional and international peace and security."

He said the U.S. had violated the founding U.N. Charter, which states: "
 All members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state."

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has for months targeted suspected drug trafficking boats off the Venezuelan coast and the Pacific coast of Latin America. The U.S. ramped up its military presence in the region and announced a blockade of all vessels subject to U.S. sanctions, last month intercepting two tankers loaded with Venezuelan crude.

In October, the U.S. justified its action as consistent with Article 51 of the founding U.N. Charter, which requires the Security Council to be immediately informed of any action states take in self-defense against armed attack.

"This is not regime change this is justice," U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz posted on X on Saturday. "Maduro was an indicted, illegitimate dictator that led a declared Narco-terrorism organization responsible for killing American citizens."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:18:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CORQYBRJS5KXPMHLQ3NPWUMEKQ.jpg?auth=e671a3fd8fdd275a183fa4eba36474ad031a796008a7e9dd042d308952b6dbb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump signals US may expand focus to Cuba amid Venezuela operation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-signals-us-may-expand-focus-cuba-amid-venezuela-operation-2026-01-03/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday indicated that Cuba could become a topic of discussion as part of broader U.S. policy in the region, highlighting the potential for Washington to expand its focus beyond Venezuela amid rising tensions in Latin America.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 17:41:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YOU7WQN75RKD5KUWIWHPVRTGTE.jpg?auth=73963609b22e771730813f0691cf52e276341ac3262d68108e50d1101d9a1837&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US oil companies will spend billions in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-says-us-oil-companies-will-spend-billions-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 3 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said that American oil companies were prepared to enter Venezuela and invest to restore production in the South American country, an announcement that came just hours after Nicolás Maduro was captured and removed by U.S. forces.

"We’re going to have our very large U.S. oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country," Trump said on Saturday.

While Chevron is the only American major with current operations in Venezuela, Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab , among others, have storied histories in the country. The American Petroleum Institute, the largest U.S. oil trade group, said on Saturday it was monitoring the emerging situation.

“We’re closely watching developments involving Venezuela, including the potential implications for global energy markets,” an API spokesperson told Reuters.

Chevron, which exports around 150,000 bpd of crude from Venezuela to the U.S. Gulf Coast, said it is focused on the safety and wellbeing of its employees, in addition to the integrity of its assets.

"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,” a Chevron spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.

Top oilfield service companies SLB (SLB.N) , opens new tab , Baker Hughes (BKR.O) , opens new tab , Halliburton (HAL.N) , opens new tab and Weatherford (WFRD.O) , opens new tab did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Exxon and Conoco did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.

Trump's plans to have large U.S. oil companies enter Venezuela and get "oil flowing" will be hindered by lack of infrastructure that will require many years and heavy investment, analysts said. "There are still many questions that need to be answered about the state of the Venezuelan oil industry, but it is clear that it will take tens of billions of dollars to turn that industry around," said Peter McNally, Global Head of Sector Analysts at Third Bridge, adding that it could take at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country.

A U.S. embargo on all Venezuelan oil, meanwhile, remains in full effect, Trump said. He told reporters that the U.S. military forces would remain in position until U.S. demands had been fully met.

"The American armada remains poised in position, and the U.S. retains all military options until United States demands have been fully met and fully satisfied," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:52:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UP4TPIQUTRL4RF4JXJLD34NSLY.jpg?auth=f84af9634821dff498b848377234199b8a1d4376712d6204db5e58bdd2dc17f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democratic lawmakers say they were misled on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/democratic-lawmakers-say-they-were-misled-venezuela-2026-01-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Democratic members of the U.S. Congress said on Saturday that senior officials of President Donald Trump's administration had misled them during recent briefings about plans for Venezuela by insisting they were not planning regime change in Caracas.

The comments came after the U.S. attacked Venezuela and deposed its long-serving President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight operation, in Washington's most direct intervention in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama.

In briefings in November and December by officials including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, lawmakers said they were told repeatedly that there were no plans for a land invasion inside Venezuela and that the administration was not focused on regime change.

"Because the President and his Cabinet repeatedly denied any intention of conducting regime change in Venezuela when briefing Congress, we are left with no understanding of how the Administration is preparing to mitigate risks to the U.S. and we have no information regarding a long-term strategy following today’s extraordinary escalation," Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement on Saturday.

"Instead, the Administration consistently misled the American people and their elected representatives by offering three differing and contradictory explanations for its actions," Shaheen said.

The Pentagon, State Department and White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Several lawmakers said they felt they had been lied to.

"The Administration lied to Congress and launched an illegal war for regime change and oil," Democratic Representative Don Beyer of Virginia said on X. Beyer's district includes the Pentagon, just across the river from Washington.

At a news conference on Saturday, Trump said Congress had not been kept fully informed on the Venezuela plans because of concerns that word about his plans would get out. "Congress does have a tendency to leak," Trump told reporters.

Members of Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans as well as Democrats, had been clamoring for more information about his strategy toward the oil-rich South American nation since he began a military build-up in the southern Caribbean and ordered strikes on boats he said were carrying drugs.

Democrats had emerged from those meetings dissatisfied. "I asked them what their strategy is, and what they were doing, and again, did not get satisfying answers at all," Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York told reporters at the time.

Democratic Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts said on CNN: "When we had briefings on Venezuela, we asked, 'Are you going to invade the country?' We were told no. 'Do you plan to put troops on the ground?' We were told no. 'Do you intend regime change in Venezuela?' We were told no. So in a sense, we have been briefed, we've just been completely lied to."

Lawmakers said they were not briefed before the operation, although Rubio had been calling members of Congress on Saturday morning after it took place. There were no briefings for lawmakers scheduled by Saturday afternoon, although Republican congressional leaders said they hoped to arrange some after lawmakers return to Washington on January 5 following their year-end recess.

Most Republicans praised Trump's action.

Senate Republican Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said: "President Trump’s decisive action to disrupt the unacceptable status quo and apprehend Maduro, through the execution of a valid Department of Justice warrant, is an important first step to bring him to justice for the drug crimes for which he has been indicted in the United States."

Members of Congress have long accused presidents from both parties of seeking to sidestep the Constitution's requirement that Congress, not the president, approve anything other than brief and limited foreign military action.

On Venezuela, Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans had said even before Saturday's overnight action that they were worried that Trump was conducting a four-month-long military campaign without congressional authorization.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:16:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QG23ESPCYRJVRFBIVIFUWRG6DI.jpg?auth=5dded4c2a2ff1980b4e28d8755b259916dae0752d57009bcfe71a4c6db2d1293&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain will not recognize US intervention in Venezuela, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-will-not-recognize-us-intervention-venezuela-pm-says-2026-01-03/</link><description>Jan 3 - Spain will not recognize a U.S. intervention in Venezuela that violates international law, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday, after U.S. forces captured long-serving Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in an overnight operation.

"Spain did not recognize the Maduro regime.

Sanchez also called on all parties to "think of the civilian population, to respect the United Nations Charter, and to articulate a fair and dialogued transition."</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 19:17:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SIVXOPIU2FL5JEKQQTV7Y4ZWVA.jpg?auth=1671b3ed141e56fc99179cef6312a9ae39e60be55e4a3cda480d6a0e456ce6fa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he's 'not thrilled' with Putin over war in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-hes-not-thrilled-with-putin-over-war-ukraine-2026-01-03/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Jan 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was frustrated with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the continued war in Ukraine , repeating that he had initially believed that ending the war would be easy.

"I'm not thrilled with Putin. He's killing too many people," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, during a press conference to discuss the overnight U.S. military operation in Venezuela and capture of its President Nicolas Maduro .

Trump said he did not discuss Maduro with Putin when the two leaders spoke by telephone for over two hours on Monday, shortly before the U.S. president met with Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Palm Beach.

"We never spoke about Maduro," Trump said when asked if he and Putin had discussed the Venezuelan leader.

Russia's foreign ministry said on Saturday it was extremely concerned by reports that Maduro and his wife had been removed from the country during "aggressive actions" by the United States, and called for the pair's immediate release.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters that Maduro had rejected multiple chances to flee the country, and some reports suggested weeks ago that he could have headed to Russia or closely allied states.

Trump on Monday initially expressed sympathy for Russian allegations that Ukrainian drones attacked one of Putin's residences. He later appeared more skeptical and shared a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

The Wall Street Journal later reported that U.S. national security officials had found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike.

Trump has repeatedly expressed frustration about the lack of progress toward ending the war in Ukraine, which began with Russia's invasion in February 2022, focusing heavily on what he calls tens of thousands of troops being killed on both sides.</description><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jan 2026 20:23:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U4TWW4Z6HVOOVFUZ3CW62SPW7U.jpg?auth=85eac5450e31c9556f28ae53548df0918274ffb44f8e6355d9f009f5535908d1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
