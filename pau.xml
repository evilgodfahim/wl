Hours after news broke that the suspect was found dead in New Hampshire on Thursday, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said in a post on X that he was a Portuguese national who obtained permanent residence via the diversity visa lottery program. Noem said her department would pause processing of diversity lottery applications "to ensure no more Americans are harmed by this disastrous program."

The immediate effects of the move remained unclear on Friday since most of the people using the program apply from abroad through the State Department. A department spokesperson said the diversity program posed a threat to the U.S. public and that they were working "to put in place all necessary measures" to address it, but did not provide further details.

Trump, a Republican, returned to the White House in January vowing to clamp down on legal and illegal immigration. After an Afghan national was accused of attacking National Guard members in late November, his administration swiftly implemented new immigration restrictions , halting processing of Afghan immigration applications, ordering a review of approved asylum cases, and expanding Trump's existing travel ban to 20% of the world's countries.

While Trump officials framed the restrictions as needed for national security, critics said they used the attack to achieve a broader goal of reducing legal immigration.

Jorge Loweree, a managing director with the pro-immigration American Immigration Council, said the same dynamic was occurring with the diversity visa program.

"This isn't about any one individual," Loweree said. "What we're seeing is this administration using these cases, these stories, as a pretext to their own end, which is to target people from countries that they deem to be undesirable."

Trump has long criticized the diversity visa program, which offers up to 55,000 immigrant visas each year to countries with lower rates of immigration to the U.S. The program, created by the U.S. Congress in 1990, uses a lottery system to determine which applicants are awarded visas. Those approved can obtain permanent residence and eventual citizenship.

During Trump's first term in 2017, he called for ending the program after an Uzbek national was accused of a vehicle-ramming attack in New York City that killed eight people and injured many others. The attacker in that case, Sayfullo Saipov, was sentenced in 2023 to eight consecutive life sentences.

Noem said on X that the suspect in the Brown University shooting, Claudio Neves Valente, 48, had entered the U.S. in 2017 through the diversity visa program and "should never have been allowed in our country." Noem did not provide any evidence of prior security concerns related to the suspect's admission to the U.S., which occurred during Trump's first term.

Neves Valente was found dead Thursday night in a storage rental facility in Salem, New Hampshire, officials said. He is also suspected in the killing of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor two days after the Brown attack.

Neves Valente attended Brown University more than two decades ago and was a former classmate in Portugal of the slain MIT professor, Nuno Loureiro.

The top countries of origin for diversity visa recipients in fiscal year 2024 were Nepal, Uzbekistan, Kenya, Egypt and Russia, according to State Department figures. Some 41% were from African countries, the figures showed.

Only 118 Portuguese nationals entered the U.S. through the program in the past decade.

Even before Thursday's revelation about the Brown University shooting suspect's immigration history, the diversity program registration for fiscal year 2027, which typically begins in October, had already been delayed.

The U.S. State Department said in November that due to program changes, the registration would be postponed to an unknown date.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 19:17:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JEHXKCDKLVMBBBHF4X2QOTUUVQ.jpg?auth=9c77b3ce8fb472ccfe3c983cf8532865d4bd2c330998a9688edd876622df709b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bondi attack suspects kept to themselves during Philippines stay, hotel staffer recalls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bondi-attack-suspects-kept-themselves-during-philippines-stay-hotel-staffer-2025-12-19/</link><description>DAVAO CITY, Philippines, Dec 20 (Reuters) - When the two gunmen accused of attacking a Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach travelled to the Philippines last month, they kept to themselves most of the time and barely left their room, a hotel staff member said.
When they did, it was almost always around 9 a.m. and lasted just a little over an hour, said the worker, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity after the hotel's management ordered its staff not to talk to media.
Police allege Sajid Akram, 50, and his son Naveed, 24, killed 15 people on December 14 as hundreds celebrated the Jewish holiday.

Authorities say the attack, which shocked Australia and led to fears of rising antisemitism, appears to have been inspired by Islamic State. Sajid was killed at the scene while Naveed faces murder and terror charges after waking from a coma.

"They were not approachable at all. Other foreigners would typically talk to us," the hotel staffer said by phone.

The alleged gunmen stayed at GV Hotel in Davao City on Mindanao island in the southern Philippines. The hotel, in the city's downtown, sits alongside travel agencies, remittance centres, pawnshops, a hardware store, an appliance store and a few strip clubs.

GV Hotel, in a statement sent to media, confirmed the men booked through a third party and were initially scheduled to arrive on November 15, but arrived earlier on November 1.

The employee said the pair initially booked a room for seven days, but extended their stay three more times and paid in cash.

The worker said they had limited interaction with Naveed Akram, who inquired at the front desk on their second night whether the hotel sold boxes of bottled water. In another instance, Naveed asked where he could buy durian, a popular fruit in Davao. But beyond customary greetings, Naveed barely interacted with hotel staff, the worker said.

The source could not recall any interaction with Sajid Akram, the father.

"They had no visitors. They did not bring anyone else inside their room, none at all," the worker said.

When the pair went out, Sajid brought his backpack while Naveed wore a shoulder bag. The hotel staff could not determine what the contents of the bag were and whether they brought items from outside.

Philippine authorities are still investigating what the duo did during their stay in the south. National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano told reporters on Friday they did not spend enough time out of their hotel to travel to other towns in Mindanao.

"So there is no way that they can or they had ... undergone any training," Ano said.

Ano said extremist threats in the Philippines have largely declined since the Marawi siege in 2017 in which some 165 security force members and 47 residents were killed. Only two militant groups are known to be still operating in the south, Ano said.

Abubacar Camid, who leads a mosque community near the hotel where the Akrams stayed, said there was no indication the two visited the Muslim community surrounding the mosque. Camid said they reviewed camera footage as soon as they heard about the link to Davao.

"We did not see them here. All newcomers are vetted thoroughly," Camid said in an interview.

Davao residents said their visit to the city had put at risk efforts to rid the Philippines' southern islands of the stigma of extremism.

"I am a bit disheartened," said recent graduate John Edward Mier. "For how many years, Mindanao has been trying to redeem itself (and show) that the security station is okay even if there are hotspots for extremist groups."</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 19:39:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OIA62ATUHBKBBIQPPKYFL5I5LM.jpg?auth=75a10cfac37193e5b9be3572393bca6d77e9e4f3af5bc802975551e6023da7c3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK author David Walliams dropped by publisher after harassment allegations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-author-david-walliams-dropped-by-publisher-after-harassment-allegations-2025-12-19/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - David Walliams, a bestselling British children's author, was dropped by HarperCollins UK on Friday after the Daily Telegraph reported the publisher had investigated claims that he had harassed some of its junior female employees.

The newspaper said one of the women who had raised concerns about the 54-year-old had been given a five-figure payoff by the publisher and left.

"After careful consideration, and under the leadership of its new CEO, HarperCollins UK has decided not to publish any new titles by David Walliams. The author is aware of this decision," the publisher said in a statement to the Daily Telegraph.

"HarperCollins takes employee wellbeing extremely seriously and has processes in place for reporting and investigating concerns. To respect the privacy of individuals we do not comment on internal matters."

Walliams' representatives did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for comment.

Walliams, who found fame on British television with comedy partner Matt Lucas in the early 2000s, has sold more than 60 million books and been translated into 55 languages.

His bestsellers include his 2008 debut "The Boy in the Dress", "Billionaire Boy" and "Gangsta Granny".

The Daily Telegraph, citing sources, said that, following the investigation, some junior staff were kept away from the author and one employee had received a payoff.

The reports present a starkly different picture from that painted by U.S. President Donald Trump and his Ukraine peace negotiators, who have said Putin wants to end the conflict. The most recent of the reports dates from late September, according to one of the sources.

The intelligence also contradicts the Russian leader’s denials that he is a threat to Europe.

The U.S. findings have been consistent since Putin launched his full-scale invasion in 2022. They largely align with the views of European leaders and spy agencies that he covets all of Ukraine and territories of former Soviet bloc states, including members of the NATO alliance, according to the sources.

"The intelligence has always been that Putin wants more," Mike Quigley, a Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in a Reuters interview. "The Europeans are convinced of it. The Poles are absolutely convinced of it. The Baltics think they're first.”

Russia controls about 20% of Ukraine’s territory, including the bulk of Luhansk and Donetsk, the provinces that comprise the industrial heartland of the Donbas, parts of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson provinces and Crimea, the strategic Black Sea peninsula.

Putin claims Crimea and all four provinces as belonging to Russia. Trump is pressuring Kyiv to withdraw its forces from the small part of Donetsk they control as part of a proposed peace deal, according to two sources familiar with the matter, a demand that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and most Ukrainians reject.

“The president’s team has made tremendous progress with respect to ending the war" and Trump has stated that a peace deal "is closer than ever before," said a White House official without addressing the intelligence reports.

The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CIA and the Russian embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Trump’s negotiators - his son-in-law Jared Kushner and billionaire real estate developer Steve Witkoff - have for weeks been negotiating the 20-point peace plan with Ukrainian, Russian and European officials.

While U.S. officials say they have made progress, major differences remain on the issues of territory.

Kushner and Witkoff were meeting on Friday with Ukrainian negotiators in Miami and were to hold talks with Russian representatives this weekend, said a White House official.

U.S., Ukrainian and European negotiators reached a broad consensus on Monday in talks in Berlin on what four European diplomats and the two sources familiar with the matter said are robust U.S.-backed guarantees of Ukraine’s security against future Russian aggression.

One source and a diplomat said that those guarantees hinge on Zelenskiy agreeing to cede territory to Russia. But other diplomats said that was not the case and alternatives were still being examined as Zelenskiy has ruled out ceding territory.

The diplomats said the guarantees, which would take effect after the signing of a peace agreement, call for the deployment of a mostly European security force in neighboring countries and in Ukraine away from the front lines to aid in repulsing any future Russian attack.

Ukraine's military would be capped at 800,000, said the source. But several diplomats said Russia seeks a lower cap to which the Americans are open.

The U.S. would provide intelligence and other support, and the package would be ratified by the U.S. Senate, they said. According to two sources familiar with the talks, Washington's plan would also include U.S.-backed air patrols over Ukraine.

Zelenskiy on Thursday appeared cautious on the proposals, saying "There's a question I still can't get an answer to: What will these security guarantees actually do?"

And it is deeply uncertain whether Putin will agree to such guarantees as he has repeatedly rejected the deployment of foreign troops in Ukraine.

Putin on Friday offered no compromises, although he told an annual news conference that he was ready to discuss peace.

He said his terms would have to be met as his forces have advanced 6,000 square km (2,300 square miles) this year.

It is unclear how U.S. officials have responded to Putin's demands. Witkoff has previously suggested that Russia has a right to claim the four provinces and Crimea.

Some Trump administration officials have acknowledged that Putin may be unwilling to settle for less than his initial goal of conquering Ukraine.

"I don't know if Putin wants to do a deal or Putin wants to take the whole country. These are things that he has said openly," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday at a press conference.

"We know what they wanted to achieve initially when the war began. They haven't achieved those objectives."</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:23:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X53A5LZE3ZP63KNAK65GWTPGPU.jpg?auth=92ab73b8d9f37c28ebc394c808fe59093f739f4f752b8fc029be56ecd56c7b53&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US issues sanctions on family members, associates of Venezuela's Maduro</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-issues-sanctions-family-members-associates-venezuelas-maduro-2025-12-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on family members and associates of Nicolas Maduro and his wife, as Washington ratchets up pressure on the Venezuelan president.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it had imposed sanctions on seven people it said were tied to Maduro and his wife. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent accused them of "propping up Nicolas Maduro's rogue narcostate."

"We will not allow Venezuela to continue flooding our nation with deadly drugs," Bessent said.

"Maduro and his criminal accomplices threaten our hemisphere's peace and stability. The Trump administration will continue targeting the networks that prop up his illegitimate dictatorship."

Venezuela's information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maduro and his government have vehemently denied links to crime and say that the U.S. is seeking to oust him in order to take control of Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

In recent months, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has been ratcheting up pressure on Maduro, executing a large-scale military buildup in the southern Caribbean.

It has carried out strikes against suspected drug vessels in the region, seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, and declared a "blockade" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.

Trump has also repeatedly said that strikes on land in Venezuela are coming soon.

Friday's action sanctioned relatives of Carlos Erik Malpica Flores, the nephew of Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores. The U.S. says Malpica Flores was involved in a corruption plot at state oil company PDVSA. He was sanctioned by Washington last week.

His mother - the sister of Maduro's wife - as well as his father, sister, wife and daughter were hit with sanctions on Friday.

The Treasury on Friday also extended a general license protecting Venezuela-owned refiner Citgo Petroleum from creditors through February 3 that was set to expire on December 20. It was a far shorter extension than the last one Treasury issued in June, which had a six-month duration.

Washington has protected the Houston-based company from creditors in recent years even amid a court-organized auction of shares in its parent company, PDV Holding. The license temporarily bans transactions with a Venezuela-issued bond collateralized with Citgo equity.

A U.S. judge in November authorized the sale of shares in the parent of Citgo Petroleum to an affiliate of Elliott Investment Management, following his approval of a $5.9 billion bid from the company in a court-organized auction to pay Venezuela-linked creditors.

The sale order, which is pending Treasury Department approval, was the last major legal step to wrap a two-year auction aimed at paying up to 15 creditors for debt defaults and expropriations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 20:24:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OODPAK4UDFI5RK7BK6F64BTXCA.jpg?auth=97dafe8056b309f4d856359edd6b04b0d1aa9177e2874ad660ba226533a3cfab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN demands Rwanda leave Congo, extends UN peacekeeping mission</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-demands-rwanda-leave-congo-extends-un-peacekeeping-mission-2025-12-19/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The U. N. Security Council on Friday condemned an offensive by M23 in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, demanded Rwanda stop supporting the rebels and withdraw its troops, and renewed the mandate for U.N. peacekeepers.

The 15-member council, in a unanimously-adopted resolution, also demanded that Congolese troops stop supporting groups such as the FDLR and that DRC fulfil its commitment to "neutralize the group."

The FDLR was founded by Hutus who fled Rwanda after participating in the 1994 genocide that killed close to one million Tutsis and moderate Hutus. M23 says it is fighting to protect ethnic Tutsi communities in eastern Congo.

The latest M23 advance in mineral-rich eastern Congo came a week after Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame met U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington earlier this month and affirmed their commitment to a U.S.-brokered peace deal.

Rwanda, which says its troops are in eastern Congo for what it calls defensive measures, has rejected claims of supporting M23 and has blamed Congolese and Burundian forces for the latest escalation of violence.

The Security Council extended for one year the mandate for the long-running peacekeeping mission, known as MONUSCO. There are currently nearly 11,000 troops and police deployed as part of the operation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:19:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DUDKP6NAJ5LNTMUGKKQIEG3K3Q.jpg?auth=eafbb7b1ebf93c7fca041b71c1ff15a544aa5393821e41c03a8262c4d97a5b81&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four died in ICE custody this week as 2025 deaths reach 20-year high</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/four-died-ice-custody-this-week-2025-deaths-reach-20-year-high-2025-12-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Four immigrants died in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody in the past week, according to the agency, as deaths in 2025 reached a two-decade high.

The four detainees, from Haiti, Nicaragua, Eritrea and Bulgaria, died between December 12 and 15, ICE notices said. While the incidents remain under investigation, ICE said two followed medical emergencies and two were believed to be the result of natural causes.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, has pushed for the mass deportation of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. To increase removals, his administration has ramped up ICE detention to record levels, with roughly 66,000 people detained as of late November.

At least 30 people have died in ICE detention this year, according to agency notices. The total for 2025 - which still has 12 days remaining - is the highest level since 2004 , opens new tab , according to ICE statistics.

"ICE remains committed to ensuring that all those in its custody reside in safe, secure and humane environments," the agency said in a statement announcing one of the latest deaths.

Democrats on Thursday criticized the deaths in detention, blaming the Trump administration.

"ICE has a responsibility to take care of these people, something they are clearly disregarding," said U.S. Representative Pramila Jayapal, whose district includes most of Seattle. "This is beyond horrifying."

A federal judge on Wednesday said the Trump administration could not bar members of Congress from making unannounced visits to immigration detention centers. Democratic lawmakers had sued over the lack of access, saying the visits were protected under U.S. law and necessary for oversight.

Following the judge's order, U.S. Representative Dan Goldman, a Democrat, on Friday visited an ICE holding facility in Lower Manhattan in New York City.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:21:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ELG4TOJBVBKJFGGVXL7XXUTFHU.jpg?auth=b2e2af313fa7fbfe00fb90ee3c191e62f18e1003f7bad9193cd2e09b60477d87&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four died in ICE custody this week as 2025 deaths reach 20-year high</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/four-died-ice-custody-this-week-2025-deaths-reach-20-year-high-2025-12-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:22:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump administration imposes restrictions on Mexican train crews operating inside US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-imposes-restrictions-mexican-train-crews-operating-inside-2025-12-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Transportation Department said Friday that it would impose restrictions on Mexican train crews operating in the United States after inspections raised safety concerns about the English proficiency of some personnel.

The department's Federal Railroad Administration issued letters Friday to Union Pacific and Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited after inspectors discovered inbound crew members appeared to have had difficulty interpreting bulletins and communicating safety requirements in English with inspectors.

The department said Friday that crews from Mexico operating trains on behalf of the two railroads may not operate more than 10 miles into the U.S. from their point of entry, and uncertified crews must stop at the customs inspection point and interpreters must be certified under safety regulations.

The two railroads did not immediately comment.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said FRA was addressing concerns about cross-border train operators who lack basic English language proficiency. Duffy has previously taken steps to tighten rules requiring English proficiency by truck drivers and threatened to withhold funding from states for failing to comply with rules.

“Whether you're operating an 80-ton big rig or a massive freight train, you need to be proficient in our national language – English. If you aren’t, you create an unacceptable safety risk," Duffy said. “These commonsense steps will ensure every train crew operator can communicate with inspectors and understand basic operational bulletins."

FRA told the railroads because "hazardous materials documents and emergency response information are required to be maintained in English the ability of the operating crew to understand these materials is critical" and warned incidents of crews operating in the U.S. without a sufficient understanding of the English language to perform their duties safely could result in the Trump Administration taking enforcement action.

The Teamsters union said USDOT "took decisive action to restrict cross-border railroad operations from Mexico" and praised the agency for protecting union railroad jobs and prioritizing rail safety on trains entering the United States.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:42:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JAS2QHNI6FJYBALNZMLXYLTYJA.jpg?auth=baf1d82dfaefef375c2a1d21b0eb7641b14ed07493ec2d39883088d687efa413&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump nominates Lt.

Reuters first reported Trump's planned nomination of Donovan last week.

Admiral Alvin Holsey retired two years early at a ceremony in Miami last Friday, amid rising tensions with Venezuela that include last week's seizure of an oil tanker and nearly 30 deadly strikes on suspected drug-smuggling boats.

Three U.S. officials and two people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Holsey was pushed out by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. Two officials said Hegseth had grown frustrated with Southern Command as he sought to flex U.S. military operations and planning in the region.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 21:42:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IGEUVB7VJBJ5TDXP57X7CQH6ZM.jpg?auth=d33af0ef5d6f75020178620edce4994b8e00e2fda046f4ec85381f0f54a78516&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio says new governance bodies for Gaza will be in place soon, followed by international force</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/rubio-says-new-governance-bodies-gaza-will-be-place-soon-followed-by-2025-12-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 19 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that a new governance structure for Gaza -- made up of an international board and a group of Palestinian technocrats -- would be in place soon, followed by the deployment of foreign troops, as the U.S. hopes to cement a fragile ceasefire in Israel's war in the Palestinian enclave.

Rubio, speaking at a year-end news conference, said the status quo was not sustainable in Gaza, where Israel has continued to strike Hamas targets while the militant group has reasserted its control since the October peace agreement brokered by President Donald Trump's administration.

"That's why we have a sense of urgency about bringing phase one to its full completion, which is the establishment of the Board of Peace, and the establishment of the Palestinian technocratic authority or organization that's going to be on the ground, and then the stabilization force comes closely thereafter," Rubio said.

Rubio said progress had been made recently on identifying Palestinians to join the technocratic group, and said Washington was aiming to get the governance bodies in place "very soon," without offering a specific timeline.

Rubio was speaking after U.S. Central Command hosted a conference in Doha this week with partner nations to plan the International Stabilization Force (ISF) for Gaza. Two U.S. officials told Reuters last week that international troops could be deployed in the strip as early as next month , after the U.N. Security Council voted in November to authorize the force.

It remains unclear how Palestinian militant group Hamas will be disarmed and countries considering contributing troops to the ISF are wary that Hamas will engage their soldiers in combat.

Rubio did not specify who would be responsible for disarming Hamas, and conceded that countries contributing troops want to know what the ISF's specific mandate is and how it will be funded. "I think we owe them a few more answers before we can ask anybody to firmly commit, but I feel very confident that we have a number of nation states acceptable to all sides in this who are willing to step forward and be a part of that stabilization force.," Rubio said, noting that Pakistan was among the countries who had expressed interest.

Establishing security and governance was key to drawing donors to pay for reconstruction in Gaza, Rubio added.

"Who's going to pledge billions of dollars to build things that are going to get blown up again because a war starts?" Rubio said, discussing the possibility of a donor conference to raise reconstruction funds. "They want to know who's in charge, and they want to know that there's security so and that there'll be long term stability."</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:21:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HCKBAHWSPFJDRCBI6FMO4U2JTE.jpg?auth=919ab1fb25fcadb82580462e38cb69cc04f8259dae05f12e73e169699964a00f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli attack on school shelter in Gaza City kills 5 Palestinians, hospital chief says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-attack-school-shelter-gaza-city-kills-5-palestinians-hospital-chief-says-2025-12-19/</link><description>Dec 19 (Reuters) - Five Palestinians were killed in an Israeli attack on a school sheltering displaced people in the Al-Tuffah neighbourhood, east of Gaza City, the head of Al Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, Mohamed Abu Selmia, told Reuters on Friday.

The Palestinian civil emergency service said in a statement most of the killed are children, in addition to a number of wounded who were transferred to hospitals for treatment.

The civil defence added they were only able to recover the bodies after the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) coordinated with the Israelis.

With those five killed, the number of Palestinians killed by Israeli fire rose to 400 since the ceasefire began in October, according to the health ministry.

Israel said three soldiers have been killed by Palestinian militants in Gaza over the same period.

The Israeli military said later on Friday that a number of suspicious individuals were identified in command structures west of the Yellow line, and the troops fired at them.

"The IDF is aware of the claim regarding casualties in the area, and the details are under review", Israeli military said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:22:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US strikes Islamic State targets in Syria, New York Times reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-strikes-islamic-state-targets-syria-new-york-times-reports-2025-12-19/</link><description>Dec 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. military has launched airstrikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria on Friday in retaliation for an attack on U.S. personnel, two U.S. officials said on Friday.

The attacks come after President Donald Trump vowed to retaliate after an attack on U.S. personnel last weekend in Syria by a suspected Islamic State member.

A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, described the strikes as a large-scale response that included strikes against targets across central Syria.

Two U.S. Army soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed on Saturday in the central Syrian town of Palmyra by an attacker who targeted a convoy of American and Syrian forces before being shot dead, according to the U.S. military. Three other U.S. soldiers were also wounded in the attack.

A U.S.-led coalition has carried out airstrikes and ground operations in Syria targeting Islamic State suspects in recent months, often with the involvement of Syria's security forces.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:22:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian missiles attack port infrastructure near Ukraine's Odesa, kill seven, deputy PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-missiles-attack-port-infrastructure-near-ukraines-odesa-kill-seven-2025-12-19/</link><description>Dec 19 (Reuters) - A Russian missile attack late on Friday on port infrastructure around Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa killed seven people and injured 15, Ukrainian officials said.

"In the late evening, Russia attacked port infrastructure in Odesa region with ballistic missiles," Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba wrote on Telegram.

Kuleba and Odesa regional governor Oleh Kiper said that, according to preliminary reports, seven people were killed and 15 injured.

A source familiar with the matter said the attack was on Pivdennyi -- one of three ports in the area.

Odesa, a focal point of Ukrainian grain and other exports, has been a frequent target of Russian attacks since Russia invaded its smaller neighbour in February 2022.

The intensity of the attacks has increased in recent days. One strike damaged a bridge southwest of Odesa and cut a major route between the city and the Danube River port of Reni and complicated border crossings to Moldova and Romania.</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:22:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S. investigators study Brown University shooter's failed past in academia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-investigators-study-brown-university-shooters-failed-past-academia-2025-12-19/</link><description>PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island/LISBON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - A quarter of a century ago, Claudio Neves Valente was briefly enrolled as a young, promising doctoral student in the physics department at Brown University before dropping out of the school in Rhode Island.

On Friday, police were still trying to figure out why Valente returned to the Ivy League school nearly a week ago, armed with at least one handgun. He killed two students and injured several others before fleeing from the building where he once studied.

Searching for a motive, investigators were examining Valente's earliest days in academia, which took him from the University of Lisbon to the U.S. Northeast.

Two days into the manhunt for the Brown University attacker, a physics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology was fatally shot in his home outside Boston: Nuno Loureiro, who had been Valente's classmate as physics students at Lisbon's elite Instituto Superior Técnico in their native Portugal in the late 1990s.

Investigators announced on Thursday night they believe both attacks were committed by Valente, 48, whom they found dead on Thursday in a storage locker he had recently rented in Salem, New Hampshire, having apparently shot himself in the head.

MIT, one of the world's preeminent scientific research universities, mourned Loureiro, 47, calling him "an incredible scientist, colleague, mentor, and friend" in a statement.

His former classmate and suspected murderer, Valente, was not known at all by the international community of physicists. Investigators have not said what Valente did in the decades after abandoning his physics studies.

"It's quite shocking to even think that someone who studied with (Loureiro) may have had some kind of anger that comes from the period" when they attended school together, Bruno Goncalves, the director of Lisbon's Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion Institute where Loureiro once worked, said in an interview.

Brown University President Christina Paxson wrote in a message to the campus on Friday that Valente was enrolled in a physics PhD program for a few months in 2000 to 2001. She wrote that "it is likely that he would have taken courses and spent time at the site of the shooting, Barus &amp; Holley, where the vast majority of physics courses take place in classrooms and laboratories."

Any affiliation Valente had with Brown ended in 2003, when he dropped out after a long leave of absence, according to university officials and investigators. There was no sign of any recent contact. No Brown employee spoken to so far has any memory of him, Paxson wrote.

Hospitalized survivors of Saturday's attack in the Brown classroom also appear to not have known their assailant, but later recognized Valente when shown images of him by investigators.

One victim told investigators she got a "look at" the shooter, and, upon seeing Valente's photo, she "froze, physically pushed back, and became emotional," according to a police affidavit.

Aside from perhaps using the same classrooms in different decades, there were no known ties between Valente and the two young students killed at Brown: Ella Cook and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov.

Valente won the U.S. green card lottery and became a lawful permanent resident in 2017, according to a police affidavit. He listed Brown's Barus &amp; Holley building as the address of his "institution" in his immigration paperwork, despite also noting there that he had dropped out more than 15 years earlier.

Outside the Barus &amp; Holley building on Friday, Rahul Mani, a graduate student in computer science, stood in the pelting rain soaking a largely deserted Brown campus, where the semester was ended early. Nearby, a food truck run by a local charity was feeding first responders and investigators.

"I had to come here to see it for myself," Mani said. "I am glad they found the shooter but it is still a very, very unnerving feeling to be here."

Valente grew up in Torres Novas, a town an hour north of Lisbon, and was good enough at physics as a high school student that he competed in a Physics Olympiad. As a 17-year-old, he went on a trip to Canberra in Australia with other students and teachers, according to local media.

Loureiro, the murdered MIT professor, studied physics engineering alongside Valente at Lisbon's Instituto Superior Técnico. It was unclear whether the two men knew each other.

Valente became a teaching assistant at the institute, before his contract was terminated in February 2000, according to Diário da República, Portugal's official state gazette.

A few months later, Valente would enroll at Brown.

Meanwhile, Loureiro went on to Imperial College London, getting his physics PhD and working in the field of theoretical physics and its applications in fusion. In 2009, he became a researcher at Lisbon's Institute of Plasmas and Nuclear Fusion, before moving to the U.S. in 2016 to become a professor at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Physicist Luis Batalha, who now lives in San Francisco, wrote on social media that Loureiro was a "rare local hero" to Portuguese physicists.

"He was a role model we could truly relate to," he wrote, "someone who once sat in the very same classrooms we did and proved that it was possible to reach the absolute pinnacle of the field."</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 22:23:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FBAQCE4WPJIBRODJG7DXXGEAXM.jpg?auth=6faaba94adf125a24e0d3ecf672c33aa7090eda08275f86ad17f86b964595251&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>IMF welcomes EU's 90 bln euro loan to Ukraine, more work to be done</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/imf-welcomes-eus-90-bln-euro-loan-ukraine-more-work-be-done-2025-12-19/</link><description>NEW YORK/LONDON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund welcomed on Friday that European Union leaders agreed to lend 90 billion euros ($105 billion) to Ukraine, a spokesperson said.

"This is an important milestone towards closing financing gaps and restoring debt sustainability," said the IMF in an emailed response.

EU leaders decided earlier on Friday to borrow cash to lend Ukraine 90 billion euros for the next two years - rather than use frozen Russian assets.

The funding is critical for Ukraine, which has been heavily reliant on donor cash since Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022 upended its economy.

European financial support is a key element of the IMF's assessment of Ukraine's debt as sustainable - a requirement for most lending programmes.

Ukraine and the IMF struck a preliminary agreement on a new, $8.1 billion lending programme in late November that still needs approval from the fund's Executive Board.

Prior actions needed for the board to consider the new program include the adoption of a program-consistent budget for next year, broadening the tax base, and promoting anti-corruption reforms, among others. Getting financing assurances from donors is also required. No date has been set for a board meeting on Ukraine.

The Fund has estimated that Ukraine will need about 135 billion euros ($158.57 billion) for 2026 and 2027. The interest-free EU loan should cover about two-thirds of Ukraine's needs for the next two years.

"We are continuing to work with international donors to secure the necessary financing assurances," the IMF said.

Underscoring the imbalance, Ukraine's Finance Minister Sergii Marchenko told G7 leaders on Friday that it is necessary to continue work on implementing a Reparations Loan.

The war itself continues to sap Kyiv's financial resources, and the country plans to spend the bulk of state revenues - 2.8 trillion hryvnias or around 27.2% of GDP - to fund its defence efforts in 2026.

IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack said in a news briefing on December 4 that "on the question on the Russian assets, what I can say is that we do welcome the rigorous discussions in Europe to support Ukraine, and the goal to do so in a manner that is consistent with restoring Ukraine's debt sustainability."</description><pubDate>Fri, 19 Dec 2025 23:20:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2J5UDWCE6FISLEMTG5RYY3W7EA.jpg?auth=a986817ae994b7acb6c3286a8dd1465f5d7d180883c3ba8d6aab0b8540851013&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro to leave prison to hospital for surgical procedure, GloboNews reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-leave-prison-hospital-surgical-procedure-globonews-reports-2025-12-19/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 19 (Reuters) - Brazilian Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorized former President Jair Bolsonaro to leave the Federal Police Superintendency in Brasilia, where he is serving a 27-year prison sentence, for a surgical procedure at a hospital, local network GloboNews said on Friday.

The mass shooting, Australia's worst in nearly 30 years, is being investigated as an act of terrorism targeting the Jewish community, while authorities have ramped up patrols and policing across the country to prevent further violence.

The Bondi Beach volunteer and professional surf lifesavers, in their distinctive red and yellow uniforms, lined the sand on Saturday morning for two minutes of silence to honour the shooting victims, a Surf Life Saving Australia spokesperson said.

Peter Agnew, the group's president, said in televised remarks that the tribute was "out of respect to the Jewish community and also to support each other this morning".

On Friday, Australia's Jewish community gathered at Bondi Beach for prayers, while hundreds of swimmers and surfers formed a huge circle in the waters off the famed beach to honour victims.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday joined an event at the Great Synagogue in Sydney, writing on social media platform X: "All Australians stand together against antisemitism and hatred."

Albanese, under pressure from critics who say his centre-left government has not done enough to curb a surge in antisemitism since the start of the Gaza war, has said the government would strengthen hate laws in the wake of the massacre.

Both the federal government and the state government of New South Wales, where Sydney is located, have pledged a raft of reforms, including tightening gun control laws.

Alleged gunman Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene.

His 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, who was also shot by police and emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon, has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, according to police. They believe the pair was inspired by militant Sunni Muslim group Islamic State.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 01:38:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GGBNHVC5Y5JYRDEFW52OMOXYM4.jpg?auth=aa84c912b5a1101d2bf74d2662adf2820a72ca0bab8beba1e3acee9b6d170b2c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US drops Uganda deportation order against Chinese dissident, lawyer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-drops-uganda-deportation-order-against-chinese-dissident-lawyer-says-2025-12-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. on Friday dropped its effort to deport a Chinese national who helped document Beijing's alleged abuses against Uyghur Muslims to Uganda, the man's lawyer told Reuters.

Guan Heng, a Chinese citizen-journalist, fled the U.S. in 2021 after taking video of alleged concentration camps in China's western Xinjiang region. He released the video after arriving in the U.S., where he applied for asylum.

Guan was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in August for illegally entering the country, part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. He remains in a New York state detention center.

His detention and threatened deportation to Uganda has stirred controversy, not least because he helped document abuses in China that the U.S. government during Trump's first term deemed "genocide."

His supporters and lawyer say Guan faced almost certain persecution if deported to Uganda. The East African country, where Beijing has considerable political and economic clout, this year entered into an agreement with the U.S. to take in nationals from third countries.

"We just got a letter informing that DHS (Department of Homeland Security) will not seek to remove Mr. Guan to Uganda," his lawyer Allen Chen told Reuters.

Chen said it was not clear if Washington would continue to pursue Guan's removal, either to China or another country, but said sending such a "high-profile dissident" back to China would be unlikely.

Under Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policies, migrants may be deported to third countries if immigration authorities either have "credible" diplomatic assurances they will not be persecuted or tortured if sent there or have given the migrants as little as six hours of notice ahead of time that they are being sent to such a place.

Nonetheless, Chen said the withdrawal of the Uganda removal order was a positive development, adding that he expected Guan would have a bond hearing in coming weeks, though his asylum case could take several years.

"More information on this case is forthcoming," a DHS spokesperson told Reuters, adding that Guan had entered the U.S. illegally at an unknown date and time.

"All of his claims will be heard before an immigration judge," the spokesperson said.

The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Guan, who traveled through South America to the Bahamas before navigating open water in a small boat to the Florida coast, filed his asylum request shortly after his arrival in the U.S. in 2021.

Separately, Reuters reviewed a copy of a letter sent by the State Department that appeared to offer support for Guan's asylum claim.

The letter, sent to Immigration Judge Charles Ouslander, described Guan's role in documenting abuses by Chinese authorities and the threat of persecution facing dissidents and journalists in China.

"In recent years, China has harassed and retaliated against those it deems disloyal to the CCP (Chinese Communist Party), regardless of whether they live in China or abroad," acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for the department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Julie Turner wrote in the letter, dated December 12.

The State Department did not respond immediately to Reuters questions about Guan.

China denies abuses toward Uyghurs and other Muslims.

Several U.S. lawmakers have also pressed for Guan's release and asylum approval.

Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Democratic ranking member of the House of Representatives' select committee on China last week told DHS Secretary Kristi Noem in a public letter regarding Guan that the U.S. has a "moral responsibility to stand up for victims of human rights abuses in Xinjiang."</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 01:39:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OOFME6573NNVNOPRII6NKMDM5E.jpg?auth=ef4ef8060396733bdb946f8e1efd8658aeac9ba2fe830cf3f63a9d1d5075e2d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Dmitriev heading for US to meet Witkoff, Kushner, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-dmitriev-heading-us-meet-witkoff-kushner-source-says-2025-12-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, is heading to Miami for a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, a Russian source told Reuters.

The meeting in Miami takes place after talks in Berlin with Ukrainian and European officials held by Witkoff and Kushner earlier this week to try to reach a deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine. The duo were also scheduled to meet Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov in Miami on Friday.

The Russian source said that any meeting between Dmitriev and the Ukrainian negotiators had been ruled out.

"Three-way contacts with the Ukrainian side are not planned," said the Russian source with the direct knowledge of the visit, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Trump's administration is pushing to bring an end to nearly four years of war, but bridging the positions of Russia, Ukraine, and European Union leaders on issues such as Ukraine's NATO membership and territorial concessions has not been easy.

Witkoff and Kushner have been working with EU and Ukrainian negotiators on an amended version of a peace plan, earlier drafts of which were criticized by the EU and Ukraine as being slanted toward Russia.

The Kremlin said on December 12 that it had not yet seen the latest version of the plan, amended with Ukrainian and European proposals.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov, who will not travel to the U.S. over the weekend, said at the time that Moscow may not like some of those proposals.

The Kremlin had reiterated that Ukraine not joining the NATO military alliance was a fundamental condition of the talks.

Ushakov also said that a ceasefire in Ukraine would only be possible after Kyiv's forces withdraw from the entire Donbas region, suggesting that the Russian army could stay away from areas currently controlled by Ukraine.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said this week that Russia's opposition to the deployment of European troops to Ukraine, offered as a security guarantee from the West under a possible future U.S.-brokered peace deal, is well known, but that the issue could be discussed .</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 01:40:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YZEXMQVGMVKLDLFQ57PXN2QNYY.jpg?auth=0544481463724daed10dbed61382ecc035153f0577242ae8ece41d57b1ea4d7e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Takeaways from release of Epstein files</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/takeaways-release-epstein-files-2025-12-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Friday released a new cache of documents from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

The Epstein files have been a significant political problem for President Donald Trump, with many of his supporters and Republicans in Congress demanding their release. It remains to be seen if this partial release will satisfy Trump's critics on the issue.

Here are some initial takeaways from the documents:

The big question before the document release was: How prominently would Trump feature in them? He and Epstein were friends and socialized frequently in the 1990s and early 2000s. Trump says they had a falling out in the mid-2000s, before Epstein's first conviction in 2008.

Friday's document dump of government files containing hundreds of thousands of pages was therefore notable for the lack of mentions of Trump. The Justice Department said more documents will be released over the next two weeks.

An initial examination of the cache by Reuters found scant photos of Trump or any mentions of him in documents. There was a single photo of Epstein appearing to hold a check with Trump's name on it, and a separate photo taken inside Epstein's Manhattan townhouse where a copy of Trump's 1997 book, 'Trump: The Art of the Comeback', was tucked inside a bookshelf.

Trump's name appeared in flight manifests listing passengers on Epstein's private plane that were included in a first batch of material the Justice Department released in February.

Trump and several of his family members were also listed in an Epstein contact book, which was made public during the 2021 trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein’s former associate who was found guilty of child sex trafficking and other offences in connection with Epstein’s crimes.

Trump has often denied any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein or that he had any knowledge of his crimes when the two socialized in Florida.

The documents contained a number of mentions and photos of former Democratic President Bill Clinton.

There were several photos of Clinton, including one of him in a swimming pool with Maxwell and an unidentified person. Others showed Clinton in a hot tub, and another with a young woman sitting on the armrest of his seat with her arm draped around his shoulders, her face redacted. A fourth was a photo of a painting of Clinton in a blue dress hanging in Epstein's New York home.

The release of the Clinton photos could conflict with Justice Department policy not to release material related to ongoing investigations. Trump, a Republican, has ordered the Justice Department to investigate Clinton's ties to Epstein, in what critics viewed as an effort to shift the focus away from his own relationship with Epstein.

Clinton has always denied any knowledge of Epstein’s crimes when the two socialized and traveled together and has said he wishes he had never met Epstein.

There was no immediate response to a request for comment from the Clinton Foundation.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Congress in a letter that the department had identified more than 1,200 victims of Epstein and their relatives during an “exhaustive review” of the documents.

One document was Epstein's masseuses list, which contained 254 names. All the names were redacted.

Honduras' presidential election took place on November 30 but nearly three weeks later there is still no clarity on who will be the country's next president. The chaotic elections have been rocked by a fumbled vote tallying process, allegations of fraud and U.S. intervention.

"The Department has refused the visa application of Marlon Ochoa and taken steps to impose visa restrictions on another individual for undermining democracy in Honduras," Rubio said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 03:17:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A7O2VO6NNFJWXJDXZEEPHPG7SI.jpg?auth=cf960df84711facba0f191221193bb58746eb28e4cde2677255a75db2f476ccf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran executes man accused of spying for Israel, judiciary's news outlet says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-executes-man-accused-spying-israel-judiciarys-news-outlet-says-2025-12-20/</link><description>Dec 20 (Reuters) - Iran executed a man on Saturday who it said was convicted of spying for Israel and having ties to Iranian opposition groups, the judiciary's Mizan news agency reported.

Entangled in a decades-long shadow war with Israel, Iran has executed many people it accused of having links with Israel's intelligence service and facilitating its operations in the country.

The Oslo-based Iran Human Rights group said on X that the man, whom it identified as 27-year-old architecture student Aghil Keshavarz, was sentenced to death on charges related to espionage for Israel "based on confessions extracted under torture".

The Iran-Israel conflict escalated into a war in June, when Israel struck various targets inside Iran, including through operations that relied on Mossad commandos being deployed deep inside the country.

Executions of Iranians convicted of spying for Israel have significantly increased this year, with multiple death sentences carried out in recent months.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 04:36:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MNNAMPEIQFOHZPEZR64BF3YKQM.jpg?auth=a90adf5f0f18bd7f16257010c3514bb9e18fd27e9d2faa1d0802fbbe858439a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Russian officials to meet in Florida for more Ukraine talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-russian-officials-meet-florida-more-ukraine-talks-2025-12-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 20 - U.S. negotiators are set to meet Russian officials in Florida on Saturday for the latest talks aimed at ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, as President Donald Trump’s administration tries to coax an agreement out of both Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict.

The meeting follows U.S. talks on Friday with Ukrainian and European officials, the latest discussions of a peace plan that has sparked some hope of a resolution to the conflict that began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

President Vladimir Putin's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, is leading the Russian delegation that will meet with property tycoon-turned-diplomat Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. Marco Rubio, Trump’s top diplomat and national security advisor, said he may also join the talks.

Previous meetings have taken place at Witkoff’s golf club in Miami’s Hallandale Beach.

U.S., Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week reported progress on security guarantees for Kyiv as part of the talks to end the war, but it remains unclear if those terms will be acceptable to Moscow.

A Russian source told Reuters that any meeting between Dmitriev and the Ukrainian negotiators had been ruled out.

U.S. intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to capture all of Ukraine, sources familiar with the intelligence said, contradicting some U.S. officials' assertions that Moscow is ready for peace.

Putin offered no compromise during his annual press conference in Moscow, insisting that Russia’s terms for ending the war had not changed since June 2024, when he demanded Ukraine abandon its ambition to join NATO and withdraw entirely from four Ukrainian regions Russia claims as its own territory.

Kyiv says it will not cede land that Moscow's forces have failed to capture in nearly four years of war.

Ukraine’s top negotiator Rustem Umerov said U.S. and European teams on Friday held talks and agreed to pursue their joint efforts.

"We agreed with our American partners on further steps and on continuing our joint work in the near future," Umerov wrote on Telegram of the discussions in the United States, adding that he had informed President Volodymyr Zelenskiy of the outcome of the talks.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rubio told reporters earlier on Friday that progress has been made in discussions to end the war but there is still a way to go.

"In the end, it's up to them to make a deal. We can't force Ukraine to make a deal. We can't force Russia to make a deal. They have to want to make a deal," Rubio said.

"The role we're trying to play is a role of figuring out whether there's any overlap here that they can agree to, and that's what we've invested a lot of time and energy and continue to do so. That may not be possible. I hope it is. I hope it can get done this month before the end of the year."</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 06:31:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QJEO22Y35RIQDPCURX4L7Z2NPU.jpg?auth=0c16dcf940d46348658e26d2b03a9b9d158a5e97704d23638391b69558c888a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taipei attacker acted alone, police say after four die</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taipei-attacker-acted-alone-police-say-after-four-die-2025-12-20/</link><description>TAIPEI, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The man suspected of carrying out an attack in Taiwan with a smoke grenade and knife acted alone, police said on Saturday of the incident that killed four, including the attacker.

Chang Wen, 27, from the northern city of Taoyuan, died falling from a building during a police chase on Friday evening in a packed shopping district in central Taipei, police said.

"Based on relevant verification work carried out continuously since yesterday, we have not found that the suspect had any other accomplices," National Police Agency Director-General Chang Jung-hsin told reporters.

Investigations are ongoing as to the motive, he said.

Premier Cho Jung-tai said late on Friday that the man had been the subject of an arrest warrant, wanted for suspected evasion of Taiwan's compulsory military service.

Eleven people were injured in the attack, of whom two are in intensive care, the health ministry said.

Chang Wen let off smoke bombs at Taipei's main train station, then made his way to a mall at a nearby subway station, attacking people both inside the shopping centre and on his way there, police said.

Violent crime in Taiwan is very rare, and in response to the attack the police presence has been stepped up across the island, including in the bustling capital Taipei.

"For areas in Taipei city where crowds are expected to gather in various commercial districts, we are upgrading security measures citywide," Mayor Chiang Wan-an told reporters. "This includes not only increasing the police presence but also ensuring that all officers are fully equipped with the necessary gear."

President Lai Ching-te, who visited some of the injured in hospital on Saturday morning, wrote on his Facebook page that the government would learn the lessons from this incident.

"We will also ensure that rapid-response units can be mobilised immediately when emergencies occur, so as to safeguard public safety," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 07:39:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z4KBO642YNPU3E7GSM6QL2QK2E.jpg?auth=b0d1e3c6d0c3a8e3269202b50c210150a1cb10bc5b759c0456d9b8015f7f7a28&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ghana's president urged to rally African leaders behind push for slavery reparations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghanas-president-urged-rally-african-leaders-behind-push-slavery-reparations-2025-12-20/</link><description>Dec 20 (Reuters) - Ghana's President John Dramani Mahama held talks with a global delegation seeking reparations for transatlantic slavery and colonialism, who urged him to rally other African leaders to choose "courage over comfort" and support the growing movement.

The delegation, made up of experts from Africa, the Caribbean, Europe, Latin America, and the United States, presented Mahama with priority actions under the African Union's (AU) reparations agenda, it said in a statement on Friday.

In February, the AU launched a drive to create a "unified vision" on what reparations may look like, from financial compensation and formal acknowledgments of past wrongs to policy reforms.

At least 12.5 million Africans were kidnapped and forcibly transported by European ships, then sold into slavery from the 15th to the 19th centuries. Advocates say action is needed to confront today's legacies , including racism.

Calls for reparations have gained momentum but there is also a growing backlash. Many European leaders have opposed even discussing the matter, with opponents arguing today's states and institutions should not be held responsible for historical wrongs.

While Ghana has been at the forefront of reparations advocacy in Africa, the delegation emphasised the need for "strategic coherence and unity" among political leaders across the continent.

They urged Mahama to encourage other leaders to "choose courage over comfort" by standing with civil society and affected communities in Africa and the diaspora in demanding reparations.

The delegation also met on Wednesday with Ghana's Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa and Mahama's envoy on reparations Ekwow Spio-Garbrah.

At a European Union–AU summit in Luanda, Angola's capital, last month, leaders from both regions acknowledged the "untold suffering" caused by slavery and colonialism but stopped short of committing to reparations.

During the summit, Ghana's Vice President Jane Opoku-Agyemang urged EU member states to support a UN resolution Ghana is preparing to recognise slavery as one of the "gravest crimes against humanity".</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 07:39:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YRJYSG52UVNHFCHKBKHA4CYZYI.jpg?auth=71b6dd01c6320347aa6513c4e65045179a641ce06f62f674a0f6f233791b13e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China envoy visits Cambodia seeking to de-escalate fighting with Thailand</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-envoy-visits-cambodia-seeking-de-escalate-fighting-with-thailand-2025-12-20/</link><description>BANGKOK, Dec 20 (Reuters) - China’s special envoy for Asian affairs visited Phnom Penh this week to push for Cambodia and Thailand to de-escalate their fierce border fighting, Cambodia’s foreign ministry said on Saturday.

Deng Xijun's visit comes as the U.S. and China renew efforts to bring the two countries to a ceasefire, ahead of a special meeting on Monday of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.

Around 60 people have died and more than half a million have been displaced since the two nations resumed hostilities, ending a ceasefire that Donald Trump had brokered in

"Deng Xijun reaffirmed that China will continue to play a constructive role in facilitating dialogue between Cambodia and Thailand with a view to promoting the peaceful settlement of disputes," the ministry said in a statement.

Secretary of State Rubio told reporters on Friday the U.S. was cautiously optimistic that Thailand and Cambodia could be back in compliance with the ceasefire by early next week.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 08:27:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S65AOWTU6NKL3H6LQO6AQ72OBY.jpg?auth=23bd5cf6bc2865347790121f9fe764fe42106acccd35846fa09f7983d55e4f89&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan court hands Imran Khan, wife 17-year jail terms in another graft case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-court-hands-imran-khan-wife-17-year-jail-terms-another-graft-case-2025-12-20/</link><description>LAHORE, Dec 20 (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Saturday sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi to 17 years in prison each in a corruption case involving the under-priced purchase of luxury state gifts, the court and Khan's lawyers said.

The latest conviction adds to a series of legal troubles for Khan, who has been behind bars since August 2023 and faces dozens of cases filed since he was ousted from office in 2022, ranging from graft to anti-terrorism and state secrets charges.

Khan has denied wrongdoing in all the cases, which his party says are politically motivated.

"The court announced the sentence without hearing the defence and sentenced 17 years imprisonment to Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi with heavy fines," Khan's family lawyer Rana Mudassar Uemr Umer?, told Reuters.

They were handed 10 years' rigorous imprisonment under Pakistan's penal code for criminal breach of trust and a further seven years under anti-corruption laws, along with fines of 16.4 million rupees each, the court said.

The case relates to luxury watches gifted to Khan by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during official visits, which prosecutors said Khan and his wife then purchased from the state at a heavily discounted price in violation of Pakistan's gift rules.

The case is separate from an earlier state gifts prosecution linked to Khan’s August 2023 arrest. Earlier sentences of 14 years for Khan and seven years for Bushra Bibi were later suspended on appeal. The couple denies wrongdoing.

The cases are commonly known in Pakistan as the Toshakhana cases, referring to the state repository where gifts received by public officials are deposited.

Khan, a former cricket star turned politician, remains one of Pakistan's most polarising figures, with his legal battles unfolding as his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party remains sidelined from power.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 08:27:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G27BFZC46VNXRFNMPZA6QIEZPU.jpg?auth=2a3675c818e636f2c09ddb514395df85a107820a2790d321563e002977ca540c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine says it hit Russian oil rig, patrol ship in Caspian Sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraine-says-it-hit-russian-oil-rig-patrol-ship-caspian-sea-2025-12-20/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Ukraine said its drones struck a Russian oil rig belonging to Lukoil (LKOH.MM) , opens new tab in the Caspian Sea and a military patrol ship near a rig as Kyiv steps up attacks on Moscow's oil infrastructure.

The attack, which Ukraine's general staff said took place on Friday, is one of a string of strikes targeting Russian drilling infrastructure in the Caspian Sea in recent weeks, but the first one that the Ukrainian military acknowledged officially.

A drilling platform of the Filanovsky oil rig was damaged in the attack, according to the Ukrainian military. The rig came under drone attacks at least two more times in December.

Reuters was not able to confirm the report. Lukoil was not available for immediate comment.

Ukraine says that Russian oil infrastructure is a legitimate target since the trade revenue is Russia's main source for financing its almost four-year-old full-on war against the country.

The general staff added that a military patrol ship was targeted in the strike as well, and the level of damage was being assessed.

Ukraine has been attacking Russian oil refineries throughout 2024 and 2025, but has visibly widened its campaign in recent weeks, claiming credit for sea-drone attacks on Russian shadow fleet tankers in the Black Sea and Mediterranean.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 08:27:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A3QOG4NHMZMHBCV3SL7MK7YJGE.jpg?auth=95fc1cda6562dc21a429e73a09991d7a7e5f5354c597e4de09e77c2a78af5b77&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh tightens security after youth leader’s killing as media attacks stoke unrest fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/bangladesh-tightens-security-after-youth-leaders-killing-media-attacks-stoke-2025-12-20/</link><description>Dec 20 (Reuters) - Bangladesh tightened security on Saturday, deploying police and paramilitary forces in the capital Dhaka ahead of funeral prayers for a slain youth leader and election candidate whose death has sparked a surge of violence.

The unrest in the South Asian nation after the shooting death of Sharif Osman Hadi has included coordinated mob attacks on major newspapers and cultural institutions.

Hadi, 32, a key figure in the student-led uprising last year that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka last week while launching his campaign. He died on Thursday night in Singapore after six days on life support.

Bangladesh is to elect a new parliament on February 12 - a transition many hope will help the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people recover from nearly two years of instability and reclaim its position as a regional success story.

But frequent bouts of violent protests and political wrangling among disparate groups including Islamist hardliners have punctured the national sense of euphoria that arose after Hasina was ousted in August 2024.

It has also exposed the limitations of the interim government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, analysts say, raising questions over his grip on governance in the world's largest apparel producer after China.

Yunus' government, which declared Saturday a day of state mourning for Hadi, urged citizens to resist "mob violence by fringe elements", warning that turmoil threatens Bangladesh’s fragile democratic transition.

Human Rights Watch called Hadi’s killing a “terrible act” and urged the government to act urgently to halt the violence that has gripped the country since Hasina's ouster.

The group also condemned the attacks on media as an assault on free expression.

Bangladesh ranks 149th of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index. Rights groups warn that continued attacks on journalists and activists could further shrink civic space ahead of the election.

Amnesty International urged prompt, independent investigations into Hadi's killing and the subsequent violence, including the burning of newspaper offices and harassment of journalists.

Demonstrations continued on Friday in the Shahbagh area of the capital, where crowds demanded justice for Hadi and accountability for the attacks. A mob stormed the Dhaka office of Udichi Shilpigosthi, Bangladesh’s premier progressive cultural organisation.

The violence has spread beyond the capital. In Chittagong, protesters attacked the Indian Assistant High Commission, reflecting growing anti-India sentiment since Hasina fled to New Delhi after her ouster.

Her party, the Awami League, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could derail the vote.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 09:21:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SBJEGRD4INPQVEIKVB6GMOE4YE.jpg?auth=29f79df13f8bffaa032a1cefa46f0dafe2914c6eeec58094567c0b10108d4b98&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven elephants killed in India train accident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/seven-elephants-killed-india-train-accident-2025-12-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:17:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Insight: How Brazil's deadliest police raid turned into a bloodbath</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/how-brazils-deadliest-police-raid-turned-into-bloodbath-2025-12-20/</link><description>RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Just after midnight on October 28, a group of police officers were startled by roughly 20 armed men on motorcycles fleeing the Alemão favela, one of the headquarters of Rio de Janeiro's most notorious gangs.

A shootout broke out. Two of the men were hit and fell. As they lay dying from their wounds, they told the officers the group had “leaked information” that police were closing in on the headquarters of the Comando Vermelho gang, and they were looking to escape, according to a police incident report from that day seen by Reuters.

A couple of hours later, fireworks rang out over Alemão and the neighboring Penha favela, a common way of warning that police were approaching, two residents told Reuters. People started taking shelter wherever they could.

“Your adrenaline is sky-high,” said Wazen Ferreira, a local journalist who hid in a bar with other residents when the fireworks started. "Your mouth goes dry, and all you feel is thirst.”

At around 4 a.m., over a dozen black armored trucks and several police cars started converging on the favela complex carrying hundreds of officers into dimly-lit streets.

Gang members set fire to rolls of tires and old cars to block Penha's wider streets, sending dark fumes curling into the sky where police drones struggled to track the gang’s movements in a maze of alleyways and dirt tracks.

What came next was a 17-hour firefight that left at least 121 dead, including four police officers. A fifth officer died weeks later from his injuries.

The police operation, the deadliest in Brazil’s history , was designed to neutralize the local leadership of the Comando Vermelho gang. Officials have called the operation a success and promised more of its kind.

But a Reuters review of depositions from eight senior officers, witness interviews, police reports and video evidence paints a different picture: leaks sent suspects fleeing, police fell into a deadly trap that forced a rescue mission, and the leadership of Comando Vermelho emerged unscathed .

Two weeks after the raid, Reuters had to go through makeshift barricades and gang checkpoints to access the favela.

A dozen residents, local leaders, and government officials told Reuters that the raid had done nothing to break the gang's hold on the community .

“They still believe in this failed public safety plan,” Albert Alves, who heads a local education nonprofit, said of authorities as he inspected bullet holes in the mirror of their ballet room. “It has gone on for a long time and has no results.”

WALKING INTO A TRAP

By the time police rolled into the neighboring Penha and Alemão favelas, gang leader Edgar Alves de Andrade, known as Doca, and his closest lieutenants may have known they were coming for days.

Inclement weather, which spoils visibility for police drones, had led security forces to reschedule the raid repeatedly, allowing rumors to circulate online, Andre Luiz de Souza Neves, one of the police directors who planned the raid, told prosecutors.

Though officers told prosecutors they did not identify any leaks of their plans, some said the decision to employ an extraordinary number of trucks and troops may have alerted gang scouts who follow police movements.

"We didn't get there with the element of surprise," said Fabricio Oliveira Pereira, who heads the civil police special unit, in his deposition.

Although the gang knew they were coming, police pressed ahead with their plan to serve warrants at Doca’s home, known as the “Bear's Den,” where the Comando Vermelho was thought to have stashed weapons, drugs and accounting records.

They never got there. As they approached the address before 9 a.m., officers leading the advance were hit with gunfire from the hillside above, according to police depositions and incident reports.

Officer Bernardo Leal Annes Dias, 45, was in an alley behind Doca's house when he took a bullet to the right leg, later amputated in the hospital after he was rescued on the back of a motorcycle.

Around the corner, Detective Marcus Vinicius Cardoso de Carvalho, 51, was killed with a shot to the chest.

Police realized the men had walked into a trap.

The officers running the raid decided they needed to send backup to “contain” the gang members firing from the hillside, said Moyses Santana Gomes, head of the anti-narcotics division, in his deposition.

But not all the civil police officers that they sent in were ready for what awaited them.

That team included 34-year-old Rodrigo Velloso Cabral, who had joined the service two months before.

Police drone footage showed five of his colleagues walking shoulder-to-shoulder down a dirt track leading to forested hills that commanders had seen gang members entering hours earlier.

As the group came under fire, one officer fell to the ground, grasping at his leg. Another lifted a bloody hand.

As they took cover, Cabral, several meters behind them, retreated with another colleague toward safer ground. Just after that, senior officers said, he was killed with a shot to the head.

None of the men were wearing helmets.

In Brazil, the civil police are in charge of investigating crimes, while military police are responsible for preventing them.

Both forces have tactical units, including the military police’s BOPE division, which has been involved in some of Brazil's deadliest raids and whose emblem – a skull pierced by a dagger – is known throughout the country as a symbol of police lethality .

In the raid against the Comando Vermelho, civil police were deployed into the favela to search for suspects and seize evidence, while the more militarized BOPE division took up positions on the surrounding hills above the Penha and Alemão favela complexes in northern Rio, where some 280,000 people live.

The two favelas are separated by more than a kilometer of rolling hills known as Serra da Misericordia, or Mercy Ridge, carved by rock quarries and draped in thickets of tropical forest.

In prior raids on the favelas, gang members had escaped and received reinforcement across the hills. To prevent that, a BOPE unit climbed from Alemão to the top of Mercy Ridge shortly after 5 a.m. to apprehend suspects and keep watch over the civil police serving warrants below.

“More important than the war is who stands by our side in the trenches," BOPE commander Corbage told his officers before the raid, in a video later shared online. "Let’s fight for our brothers!”

Around 10 a.m., when news of the first police casualties reached the BOPE unit on Mercy Hill, some abandoned their positions for what their commander Marcelo Corbage later called a “rescue mission,” while a second group stayed back to hold their strategic position on the hill.

Only their unit had paramedics, he told prosecutors in a deposition.

Police estimated there were some 500 armed gang members in Penha, and hundreds more in Alemão.

Victor dos Santos, Rio’s secretary of public safety, told Reuters that the plan was to dispatch a total of 2,500 officers to the area because they wanted a five-to-one numerical advantage.

Santos said that ratio meant “in theory, the criminal would be intimidated by this police force and would surrender.”

But in reports filed to prosecutors, police only said they had sent 1,100 men into the Penha complex that morning, or roughly a two-to-one ratio.

Marcelo de Menezes, head of Rio's military police, declined to confirm that number, but told Reuters in an interview that the 2,500 officers cited by the government included a contingent supporting the raid from a distance, including patrols of the surrounding neighborhoods .

As BOPE came out of the hills, they found their colleagues under fire. Police drone footage showed dozens of suspected gang members, many armed with rifles and dressed in camo-patterned combat fatigues, had entered the lower fringes of the forested hills.

A police drone showed two BOPE officers dragging Cabral's body down a dirt trail, as gang members hid behind trees nearby.

With two police officers already dead and five wounded, BOPE Captain Jansen Ferret told prosecutors the officers had to keep the gang from “decimating” more of their colleagues.

At that moment, he said, their mission “turned into a fight for life.”

Reuters could not determine how a group of BOPE officers fought off the gang to rescue the rest of their wounded colleagues.

By around 1 p.m. the BOPE rescue team had lost one of their own officers with a shot to the head; another was rushed to the hospital with a shot to the chest and died after doctors tried to resuscitate him for 40 minutes. Seven others on the team were injured.

Among the gang members who hid in the woods was Wellington Brito, 20, whose mother Taua told Reuters that she had noticed he was bringing home more money since he started consorting with gang members. Reuters could not verify if he was armed.

As gunfire echoed through the favela, Taua texted her son and found out he was on the run.

"I told you to stay home," she wrote at 7:12 a.m. in texts viewed by Reuters. "You don't need to go through this."

Fifteen minutes later, he wrote back that his hope was to "clear my name," adding: "I just want this all to end."

None of the edited footage police released to the press showed what happened that afternoon in detail, though civil rights organizations and public defenders have pressed prosecutors and the Supreme Court to release footage from drones and the bodycams police officers wore.

What is certain is that little of it was planned. Civil police filed legal documents that morning for an operation concluding by noon. Military police told the prosecutors overseeing police activity that they expected to be done by 5 p.m.

BOPE's Corbage told prosecutors his unit did not think to bring spare batteries for the 77 bodycams they brought for the 215 officers deployed, because they did not expect the operation to last more than six hours.

Brazil's Supreme Court ruled in 2022 that every police officer deployed to Rio favelas must be equipped with a working body camera.

That decision was part of Brazil's response to its conviction before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights for Rio police killings in 1994 and 1995. The record death tolls have only climbed since then .

As the carnage stretched on that afternoon, fear took hold of officers, said Neves, one of the police directors, in his deposition.

“We won't make it out of here alive,” he recalled one colleague telling him after the raid.

Neves said as the hours passed, police learned which of their colleagues had been shot, creating “a huge sense of anguish” for officers still in the line of fire.

In some of Rio's most lethal police operations, death counts have soared after early police casualties, including a raid that left 28 dead in the nearby Jacarezinho favela in 2021 – previously Brazil's deadliest.

“There is a recurring pattern of revenge, where officers enforce their own sense of justice,” said Adilson Paes de Souza, a former military police officer in the state of Sao Paulo, who researches police lethality.

Santos, Rio's secretary of public safety, told Reuters that there was “no massacre,” and that people were killed because they decided to confront the police.

“Obviously, it’s not reasonable to expect an officer not to try to save his own life or that of a colleague,” he added.

As rifle fire rattled through the afternoon, schools shut down, bus lines stopped circulating, and major streets across Rio were blocked with buses burned in retaliation by criminals, police said.

Victims, most already dead, began arriving in a nearby hospital. Families missing relatives gathered at police headquarters for news.

The shooting slowed after sunset, when Brazilians learned on the nightly news that the body count had risen to 64 , already enough to make it the deadliest raid in Rio's history.

But many Penha residents still had friends and relatives missing. Erivelton Vidal, a community leader, was with several families who set out from their residents' association below the hill in Penha to go looking on Mercy Ridge.

When they arrived, they could still see an armored truck, he said.

The elite police unit had collected dozens of bodies, their commander Corbage said in his deposition, citing the instructions of a senior officer overseeing police forensics.

Witness videos show a caravan of five mortuary vans arrived at the Rio police morgue after 10:30 p.m. that evening.

Transporting corpses before forensic analysis creates serious challenges for an independent investigation of the dozens of killings that day.

"The removal of the already lifeless bodies constitutes a violation of the current legislation," said Cassio Thyone, a forensics expert with the Brazilian Forum for Public Security, a think tank.

Around 9 p.m. on the night of the raid, Vidal said residents came upon several corpses in the area.

One group found a severed head stuck between tree branches, registered in a video that was verified by family members and a congressional report.

Taua Brito, Wellington's mother, was among them. By the light of her cell phone, she followed a path into the woods past dozens of bodies without finding her son.

Vidal said the citizen search party decided to bring the bodies down to a main street in the community so residents could identify their loved ones.

“I asked them not to, because there is a kindergarten there,” he said. But, he added, “the majority prevailed.”

Through the night, residents told Reuters that they hauled dozens of bodies into pickup trucks and carried them down to Penha's main square, removing bloodstained clothes from many of the corpses.

Mothers and children watched the line of undressed men grow , some with their organs spilled out, others with faces mangled beyond recognition, stabbed, headless or missing limbs.

Brito found her son Wellington’s body under a blood-stained sheet, lined up with dozens of bodies in the middle of the street. She kneeled next to him and cried, stroking his face.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:17:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump enters election year with big wins - and bigger political headwinds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-enters-election-year-with-big-wins-bigger-political-headwinds-2025-12-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump stormed back into office with a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. But it has come at a steep cost: as he enters the New Year and midterm elections loom, his once unshakeable hold on Republicans is slipping, say historians and analysts.

Back in January, as Trump triumphantly returned to the White House for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much of U.S. cultural life. He delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.

Like all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the inevitable waning of power in his second year. But he also begins the New Year with an erosion in political support.

Some Republican lawmakers are rebelling, and opinion polls show a growing number of voters are unhappy with the high cost of living , an aggressive immigration crackdown and a sense that Trump has pushed the boundaries of presidential power too far.

Trump's approval rating slipped to 39% in recent days to nearly its lowest level of his current term as Republican voters soured on his handling of the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll .

Now, Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, threatening Trump's domestic agenda and raising the specter of a third impeachment by Democrats if they win control of the House of Representatives.

Kush Desai, a White House spokesman, said lowering inflation - which he blamed on former Democratic President Joe Biden - has been a priority for Trump since his first day back in office.

"Much work remains," Desai said, adding that Trump and his administration will continue to focus on the issue.

MOST POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s

In his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce , dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.

He has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies , canceled or restricted access to some vaccines , and attacked universities , law firms and media outlets .

Despite promising to end the Ukraine war on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.

All modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.

The conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.

"Donald Trump has wielded power with fewer restraints in the last 11 months than any president since Franklin Roosevelt," said presidential historian Timothy Naftali.

In the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.

Analysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with rising living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.

Trump hit the road this month to promote his economic agenda and kick off what aides say will be multiple speeches next year to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.

But his meandering 90-minute address to supporters in Pennsylvania earlier this month - in which he riffed on a range of subjects unrelated to the economy and derided the issue of "affordability" as a Democratic "hoax" - alarmed some Republican strategists.

A Republican with close ties to the White House conceded that Trump faces headwinds on the economy heading into the New Year and the public mood on the rising cost of living has "become a persistent drag."

"We have to remind voters they need to give the president a full four years," said the Republican, speaking on condition of anonymity to more freely discuss internal discussions.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 11:17:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HWQX2QF6LVONNHX74YOS25U5LU.jpg?auth=9295b00936c8fbac5fe965acafd0ab4495086fe8a6321c90423aed38e629efcc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French presidential silverware keeper faces trial over suspected porcelain theft</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-presidential-silverware-keeper-faces-trial-over-suspected-porcelain-theft-2025-12-20/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 20 (Reuters) - France's presidential silverware keeper and two other men are set to stand trial over the suspected theft of porcelain and other precious tableware, the Paris prosecution office said.

The Elysee, the president's official residence, had reported the disappearance of silverware and tableware pieces used for state dinners and other events, with the value of the missing items estimated between 15,000 and 40,000 euros ($17,500 and $46,800), the prosecution office said.

Prosecutors said the silverware keeper Thomas M. and his partner Damien G. were arrested on suspicion of theft on Tuesday. They said another man, Ghislain M., was arrested on suspicion of receiving stolen goods. Their full names were not given due to French privacy customs.

The French presidency did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Interviews with presidential staff pointed suspicions at Thomas M., whose suspected downward inventory adjustments appeared to anticipate future thefts, prosecutors said.

They said about 100 objects were discovered in Thomas M.'s personal locker, his vehicle and home, including copper pots, Sevres porcelain and Baccarat champagne glasses.

Investigators found an air force-stamped plate and ashtrays on his Vinted account, prosecutors said. Vinted did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

French paper Le Parisien, which first reported the case, said Ghislain M. worked as a guard at the Louvre museum, citing his lawyer as saying that his client's motivation for his suspected involvement was his "passion" for rare antique goods.

A court banned him from returning to his Louvre post pending trial, the paper reported. The museum and the prosecutors did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report.

The museum suffered its own spectacular daylight heist in October when thieves disguised as construction workers stole priceless pieces from France's crown jewels, sparking a debate about security standards at the country's landmarks.

The Sevres porcelain factory, one of the Elysee's main suppliers, identified a number of items on auction websites, prosecutors said, adding that some items had been returned.

The trial is scheduled for February.

Russia has unleashed an almost continuous drone and missile campaign against a region where ports critical to Ukraine's foreign trade and fuel supplies operate, after Moscow threatened to cut " Ukraine off from the sea ".

Airstrikes have escalated even as the U.S. pursues an uphill diplomatic drive to broker an end to the war. U.S. negotiators were set to meet Russian officials in Florida on Saturday for the latest attempt to coax a deal out of Russia and Ukraine.

Saturday's attack on Pivdennyi port hit reservoirs, Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on the Telegram messaging app, a day after a missile strike on the port that killed eight people and injured at least 30.

On Thursday and Friday, Russian forces targeted a bridge on the Dniester river estuary near the village of Mayaky, northeast of Pivdennyi, Ukrainian officials said.

The bridge connects parts of the region fragmented by the undulating sea coast and river estuaries, and is the only main route towards Moldova's border crossings to the west.

"Without significant success on the (battle) front, the enemy is trying to terrorise civilians to create internal destabilisation. These plans are clear, and we are effectively countering them together with the people of Odesa," deputy presidential administration head Viktor Mykyta said on Telegram.

Russian officials have not commented on the attacks.

Ukrainian authorities temporarily re-routed passengers to other crossings, including by water, into Moldova. Mykyta said Ukraine would create as many alternative crossings as necessary, "no matter how hard the enemy tries to destroy the connection".

Last week, one of the war's biggest Russian air attacks on the strategic Black Sea region damaged energy facilities and prompted a blackout in Odesa, plunging hundreds of thousands of civilians into darkness for days.

Airstrikes on ports damaged three Turkish-flagged vessels in December.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has vowed to cut Ukraine's access to the Black Sea in retaliation for Kyiv's maritime drone attacks on Moscow's sanctions-busting "shadow-fleet" tankers.

Ukraine says those vessels are used to transport oil, Russia's main revenue source for funding its almost four-year-old full-scale invasion of its neighbour.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 13:46:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/THRFCTPC2VOSXEQVBTBMPU22FQ.jpg?auth=df1453dc41f5634a23ba58d4aaa223b69d6c3ec0ec471e9bb1bad98db8908898&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US offers new talks format including Russia and Ukraine, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-offers-new-talks-format-including-russia-ukraine-zelenskiy-says-2025-12-20/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 20 (Reuters) - The United States has offered a potential new format for peace talks between Ukraine and Russia with American and possibly European envoys participating, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday.

Kyiv will decide on the format once it is clear whether bilateral discussions with U.S. negotiators that resumed on Friday are positive, Zelenskiy said, adding he planned to take up the matter with Ukraine's delegation chief Rustem Umerov.

Speaking to reporters in Kyiv, he did not go into specifics as to what kind of format President Donald Trump's administration had proposed.

"The U.S. said they would have a separate meeting with representatives of Russia. And they proposed the following format, as far as I understand: Ukraine, America, Russia, and, since there are representatives of Europe there, probably Europe as well," Zelenskiy said.

U.S. negotiators were set to meet Russian officials in Florida on Saturday.

Ukraine and Russia have not negotiated face to face since July, but U.S.-backed shuttle diplomacy to end the almost four-year-old war in Ukraine has intensified in recent weeks.

Ukrainian and European representatives held a round of discussions with American counterparts in the United States on Friday and agreed to resume contacts soon, Umerov said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 14:19:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VKFNVSDYWJKAFJRJP6EGP2GZDQ.jpg?auth=7aaa2332c14732b4d85f5550a6240a381e843eb5414e678dc7809980e95e1e6d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netanyahu plans to brief Trump on possible new Iran strikes, NBC News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-plans-brief-trump-possible-new-iran-strikes-nbc-news-reports-2025-12-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:19:48 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula warns US intervention in Venezuela could be catastrophic</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-warns-us-intervention-venezuela-could-be-catastrophic-2025-12-20/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said on Saturday that an "armed intervention in Venezuela would be a humanitarian catastrophe" in the face of escalating actions from the United States toward regional neighbor Venezuela.

On Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a "blockade" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, in Washington's latest move to increase pressure on Nicolas Maduro's government, targeting its main source of income.

Lula and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the leaders of Latin America's two largest economies, had already urged restraint this week, as tensions escalated.

But on Saturday, during a summit of the South American Mercosur bloc in Foz do Iguaçu, a city in southern Brazil, Lula made a stronger statement against what he said would be a "dangerous precedent for the world."

More than four decades after the Falklands War, between Argentina and Britain, he added, "the South American continent is once again haunted by the military presence of an extra-regional power."</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 15:40:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YM3Z243ZK5PMNNFEHETCSFL7ZQ.jpg?auth=26ef2cb61c483ae5a1fd82ff45f8c7c11794df09f970e34fbe15546bdbfdf94b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US interdicting sanctioned vessel off Venezuelan coast, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-interdicting-sanctioned-vessel-off-venezuelan-coast-officials-say-2025-12-20/</link><description>Dec 20 (Reuters) - The United States is interdicting and seizing a vessel off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, three U.S. officials told Reuters on Saturday, a move which comes just days after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a "blockade" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.

The officials, who were speaking on the condition of anonymity, did not say where the operation was taking place but added the Coast Guard was in the lead.

The Coast Guard and Pentagon referred questions to the White House, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

This would mark the second time in recent weeks that the Coast Guard, along with other agencies, seized a sanctioned tanker.

"I am ordering A TOTAL AND COMPLETE BLOCKADE OF ALL SANCTIONED OIL TANKERS going into, and out of, Venezuela," Trump said on Tuesday.

In the days since U.S. forces seized a sanctioned oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela last week , there has been an effective embargo in place, with loaded vessels carrying millions of barrels of oil staying in Venezuelan waters rather than risk seizure.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 16:24:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanon close to completing disarmament of Hezbollah south of Litani River, says PM</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-close-completing-disarmament-hezbollah-south-litani-river-says-pm-2025-12-20/</link><description>Dec 20 (Reuters) - Lebanon is close to completing the disarmament of Hezbollah south of the Litani River, Prime Minister Nawaf Salam said on Saturday, as the country races to fulfil a key demand of its ceasefire with Israel before a year-end deadline.

The U.S.-backed ceasefire, agreed in November 2024, ended more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and required the disarmament of the Iran-aligned militant group, starting in areas south of the river adjacent to Israel.

Lebanese authorities, led by President Joseph Aoun and Salam, tasked the U.S.-backed Lebanese army on August 5 with devising a plan to establish a state monopoly on arms by the end of the year.

"Prime Minister Salam affirmed that the first phase of the weapons consolidation plan related to the area south of the Litani River is only days away from completion," a statement from his office said.

"The state is ready to move on to the second phase - namely (confiscating weapons) north of the Litani River - based on the plan prepared by the Lebanese army pursuant to a mandate from the government," Salam added.

The statement came after Salam held talks with Simon Karam, Lebanon's top civilian negotiator on a committee overseeing the Hezbollah-Israel truce.

Since the ceasefire, the sides have regularly accused each other of violations, with Israel questioning the Lebanese army's efforts to disarm Hezbollah. Israeli warplanes have increasingly targeted Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and even in the capital.

Hezbollah, a Shi'ite Muslim group, has tried to resist the pressure - from its mainly Christian and Sunni Muslim opponents in Lebanon as well as from the U.S. and Saudi Arabia - to disarm, saying it would be a mistake while Israel continues its air strikes on the country.

Israel has publicly urged Lebanese authorities to fulfil the conditions of the truce, saying it will act "as necessary" if Lebanon fails to take steps against Hezbollah.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 16:25:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3CMKP7HAHBMXPMKKMCRRJF6OBU.jpg?auth=b68e5bcdb8609b91d7788b50ffb4b7e81feb08691f992b5f5de9a10032c39b63&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy favours US proposal of three-way talks if it produces results</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-favours-us-proposal-three-way-talks-if-it-produces-results-2025-12-20/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 20 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Ukraine would back a U.S. proposal for three-sided talks with the United States and Russia if it facilitated more exchanges of prisoners and paved the way for meetings of national leaders.

Zelenskiy, speaking to local journalists in Kyiv, also said top Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov had told him of the latest discussions that took place on Friday with U.S. negotiators in the United States.

A new round was scheduled for Saturday, he said, focusing on Ukraine's post-war recovery. Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev was also in Miami for talks with U.S. officials.

Zelenskiy said the United States was now proposing three-sided talks -- the United States, Ukraine and Russia -- at the level of national security advisers.

"If such a meeting could be held now to allow for swaps of prisoners of war or if a meeting of national security advisers achieves agreement on a leaders' meeting...I cannot be opposed. We would support such a U.S. proposal. Let's see how things go."

Zelenskiy said Ukraine stood for proposals that would leave the "contact line" where it was without Ukraine having to give up territory it still controlled in the industrial region of Donbas in eastern Ukraine.

"For me, the fair version is we stand where we are now standing," he said.

"This is a matter of principle. Whatever the format and however we approach the issue, it is important for us that Ukrainian authorities retain control over that part of Donbas that we control now."

He said a U.S. proposal to create a "free economic zone" in eastern Ukraine was a matter "to be decided by the people of Ukraine".

"We are carefully working on every point, on every step in order to achieve not a vague 'understanding' about the division of territory and resources, but an agreement on stable and lasting peace and reliable security guarantees," he said.

Zelenskiy also said Ukraine and its European allies should continue to support the current U.S.-led peace talks, a format that was worth "fighting for", while adding: "If it doesn't work out, we will all think about other options."

Zelenskiy was responding to a question about remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron suggesting that Europe would have to re-engage in direct talks with Russia if the U.S.-led efforts founder.

Zelenskiy earlier said he would discuss the new U.S. proposal for three-sided talks with Umerov.

The Trump administration touted this week's release of a cache of Epstein-related files as a show of transparency, but a handful of Republican lawmakers and right-wing media figures joined Democrats in blasting Friday's disclosures as inadequate and possibly in violation of a law that prompted their release.

While the criticism fell short of a broader party backlash, it underscored that the Epstein controversy was far from being put to rest and was likely to linger into next year, when Republicans will be fighting to keep control of Congress.

The release of files, starting Friday and followed by a second, much smaller batch released Saturday, is intended to comply with a bipartisan law passed by Congress in November that mandated the disclosure of all Epstein files held by the Justice Department, despite a months-long effort to keep them sealed by U.S. President Donald Trump, who once counted Epstein as a close friend.

The new disclosure represented only a fraction of the total data the FBI and Justice Department have said they possess related to Epstein and was heavily redacted, including several documents or 100 pages or more that were entirely blacked out.

Also notable was the dearth of references to Trump, who had a well-publicized friendship with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s. Instead, the released files extensively featured former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat and political foe.

Brian Darling, a Republican strategist and former Senate aide, said the limited disclosures would fuel conspiracy theories about Epstein as well as legitimate transparency concerns, potentially dampening turnout among Trump voters.

"The heavily redacted disclosures of the Epstein documents added more fuel to the fire of controversy," Darling said. "This remains a political risk for all Republicans in swing seats going into the midterms."

The U.S. Justice Department on Friday released some 300,000 pages of documents, photos, and other materials from the government's investigations into Epstein, who died by suicide in a jail cell in 2019 as he faced federal charges of sex trafficking of minors.

The wealthy financier's history of hobnobbing with prominent figures has fueled speculation about whether anyone in his social circle was involved with his alleged sexual activity. One person, British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, has been convicted on Epstein-related charges to date.

The Epstein scandal resonates with much of Trump's base because it reinforces their belief in a corrupt establishment — often labeled the "Deep State" — willing to protect itself at all costs, a narrative Trump has repeatedly promoted.

Rachel Blum, a political science professor at the University of Oklahoma, said the lack of fuller disclosures could erode support among some Trump backers, including young men who swung to him in 2024 in part over their distrust of government.

"He's at risk of becoming the Deep State," Blum said. "I think this has the potential to damage his credibility more than a lot of the other scandals he's gone through."

The Justice Department's initial disclosure fell short of the law's mandate that all investigative files involving Epstein be released by Dec. 19. The law allowed for records to be withheld or redacted if the information posed a threat to national security or identified victims of sexual abuse.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on Friday that the deadline was missed due to the massive volume of data and the need for careful redactions to protect victims. He promised to release more files "over the next couple of weeks."

Democrats criticized the administration for not releasing all the files and for the extensive redactions. Representative Ro Khanna of California, who co-authored the law requiring full disclosure, floated possible impeachment of Blanche and Attorney General Pam Bondi over the failure to release the files on time.

Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky who worked with Khanna on the legislation, said he, too, believed that Bondi was in violation of the law, warning in a post to X that she and others could face criminal charges in the future when the Justice Department was in Democratic hands.

Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, a House Republican who split with Trump last month over her efforts to compel disclosure of the Epstein files, cited the failure to release all the documents as well as the heavy redactions as among actions she considered inconsistent with Trump's Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement.

"People are raging and walking away," she wrote on X.

Some conservative commentators also criticized the Justice Department's decision not to disclose more.

Kyle Seraphin, a right-wing podcaster and former FBI agent, reposted an old X post by Bondi praising the Trump administration as the most transparent in history, saying, “One gets the feeling that this is tongue-in-cheek at this point…”

Owen Shroyer, a podcaster who was pardoned by Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol but has since become a critic of the president, said he believed the Justice Department was intentionally slow-walking disclosures.

"They covered up the Epstein Files. No other way to put it now," Shroyer wrote on X after Friday's release.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 21:17:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7FI6AAGRNOCZOEXSSA4IQSWMA.jpg?auth=c9b2712bab4fbdaf22ce3594ea0b87292c810d291a6e4b4c9ba876f4bc0b53fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's KCNA: Japan's ambition for nuclear weapons should be curbed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kcna-japans-ambition-nuclear-weapons-should-be-curbed-2025-12-20/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 21 (Reuters) - North Korea said Japan's ambition for possession of nuclear weapons should be "thoroughly curbed," state media KCNA reported on Sunday.

Japan is showing the intention to possess nuclear weapons explicitly by saying it needs to review the three non-nuclear principles, KCNA said citing a commentary of North Korea's foreign-policy official.

Japan began making such comments actively as soon as the United States approved a request from South Korea for building a nuclear submarine, the media said.

In October, U.S. President Donald Trump said he has given South Korea approval to build a nuclear-powered submarine, after his visit to the Asian ally for a summit on trade deala with South Korean President Lee Jae Myung.</description><pubDate>Sat, 20 Dec 2025 22:19:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3BKBP7VO5VKE7EPRDB37TXKZQQ.jpg?auth=aea0d17e0d1fbb7ec301b7da517682633233bd7ee459b570189d3bbfe5e1fcaa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia holds day of reflection to honour victims of Bondi Beach attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-holds-day-reflection-honour-victims-bondi-beach-attack-2025-12-20/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Australia held a day of reflection on Sunday to honour those killed and wounded in a mass shooting that targeted a seaside Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach a week ago.

The gun attack, Australia's worst in nearly 30 years, is being investigated as an act of terrorism targeting Jews. Authorities have ramped up patrols and policing across the country to prevent further antisemitic violence.

Australian flags were flown at half-mast on Sunday on federal and New South Wales state government buildings, with an official minute of silence to be held at 6:47 p.m. local time.

Authorities also invited Australians to light a candle on Sunday night "as a quiet act of remembrance with family, friends or loved ones" of the 15 people killed and dozens wounded in the attack, allegedly carried out by a father and son.

"At 6:47 p.m., you can light a candle in your window to remember the victims of the antisemitic terrorist attack in Bondi and support those who are grieving," Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on social media platform X late on Saturday.

Albanese, under pressure from critics who say his centre-left government has not done enough to curb a surge in antisemitism since Israel launched its war in Gaza, has vowed to strengthen hate laws in the wake of the massacre.

On Saturday, the government of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, pledged to introduce a bill on Monday to ban the display of symbols and flags of "terrorist organisations", including those of al-Qaeda, Al Shabaab, Boko Haram, Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic State.

Around 1,000 surf lifesavers returned to duty at Bondi Beach on Saturday, restarting patrols after a halt sparked by the shooting on the first evening of the Jewish festival.

A day earlier, Australia's Jewish community gathered at Bondi Beach for prayers, while hundreds of swimmers and surfers formed a huge circle in the waters off the beach to honour victims.

Alleged gunman Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene. His 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, who was also shot by police and emerged from a coma on Tuesday afternoon, has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, according to police. He remained in custody in hospital.

Authorities believe the pair was inspired by militant Sunni Muslim group Islamic State, with flags of the group allegedly found in the car the two took to Bondi.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 01:49:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B2NXN7NIAJLZJLZC7ODXCVGTDQ.jpg?auth=285b4a77928e09a6ab4dcf9293c94021778af6bdb7b3c174f73a85ce396e44bc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan government rejects seizure of new vessel transporting oil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuelan-government-rejects-seizure-new-vessel-transporting-oil-2025-12-20/</link><description>Dec 20 (Reuters) - The Venezuelan government rejected the seizure of a new vessel transporting oil, it said in a statement on Saturday, describing it as a "serious act of international piracy," after the United States seized another tanker near the coast of the South American country.

"This is not a forecast," Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters.

"I am sure that the proposals that the Europeans and Ukrainians have made or are trying to make definitely do not improve the document and do not improve the possibility of achieving long-term peace."

European and Ukrainian negotiators have been discussing changes to a U.S. set of proposals for an agreement to end the nearly four-year-old war, though it is unclear exactly what changes have been made to the original U.S. proposals.

U.S. negotiators met Russian officials in Florida on Saturday.

Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev told reporters after meeting U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, that the talks were constructive and would continue on Sunday.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 08:48:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3D36C33QW5LWXHRVGIHZVG77YY.jpg?auth=2d6fdf9548a526b4a560dc980e9535e07a65190aea6d4bec203aa59974c01159&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia honours Bondi Beach attack victims; PM Albanese booed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-honours-bondi-beach-attack-victims-pm-albanese-booed-2025-12-21/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Australia honoured victims on Sunday of a gun attack a week earlier on a seaside Hanukkah celebration, as the prime minister announced a review of the country's law enforcement and intelligence agencies.

The nation marked a day of reflection to honour the 15 people killed and the dozens wounded in the attack by two gunmen at Sydney's Bondi Beach. With security tight and flags at half-staff on government buildings, a minute of silence was held at 6:47 p.m. (0747 GMT), the time the attack began.

Television and radio networks paused for a minute’s silence.

Tens of thousands, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and other leaders, attended a memorial event at Bondi Beach under a heavy police presence including snipers on rooftops and police boats in the waters.

Albanese was booed by the crowd on arrival, and later when the speaker mentioned his name during the memorial. He sat on the front row wearing a kippah, the traditional Jewish cap.

Albanese, under pressure from critics who say his centre-left government has not done enough to curb a surge in antisemitism since the start of the war in Gaza, was not scheduled to speak at the event.

"We have lost our innocence....last week took our innocence," David Ossip, the president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies said in a speech to start the proceedings.

"Like the grass here at Bondi was stained with blood, so, too, has our nation been stained. We have landed up in a dark place. But friends, Hanukkah teaches us that light can illuminate even the bleakest of places. A single act of courage, a single flame of hope, can give us direction and point the path forward."

Also present at the memorial was the father of Ahmed al Ahmed, hailed as the 'Bondi Hero' for wrestling a gun from one of the attackers.

"Ahmed has asked me to pass on the following message to us all: 'The Lord is close to the broken hearted. Today I stand with you, my brothers and sisters'," Ossip said.

Authorities invited Australians to light a candle on Sunday evening, the start of the eighth and final day of the Jewish festival of lights, "as a quiet act of remembrance with family, friends or loved ones" of the victims of the attack.

The government said it had consistently denounced antisemitism over the last two years and passed legislation to criminalise hate speech. It expelled the Iranian ambassador after accusing Tehran of directing two antisemitic arson attacks.

Albanese said the review, to be led by a former chief of Australia's spy agency, would probe whether federal police and intelligence agencies have the "right powers, structures, processes and sharing arrangements in place to keep Australians safe".

The attack exposed gaps in gun-license assessments and information-sharing between agencies that policymakers have said they want to plug. Albanese has announced a nationwide gun buyback, while gun safety experts say the nation's gun laws, among the world's toughest, are riddled with loopholes.

Authorities are investigating the shooting as an act of terrorism targeting Jews. Patrols and policing across the country have been ramped up to prevent further antisemitic violence. Authorities believe the gunmen were inspired by militant Sunni Muslim group Islamic State.

"The ISIS-inspired atrocity last Sunday reinforces the rapidly changing security environment in our nation. Our security agencies must be in the best position to respond," Albanese said in a statement, adding that the review would conclude by the end of April.

He has also vowed to strengthen hate laws in the wake of the attack.

The Bondi Beach attack was the most serious of a string of antisemitic incidents in Australia, which have included attacks on synagogues, buildings and cars, since Israel launched the war in October 2023, in response to an attack by Hamas.

Albanese condemned anti-immigration rallies being held in Sydney and Melbourne on Sunday.

"There are organised rallies seeking to sow division in the aftermath of last Sunday’s antisemitic terrorist attack, and they have no place in Australia," he said in a statement. "They should not go ahead and people should not attend them.”

Only about 50 people were at the Sydney rally by mid-afternoon, according to a Reuters witness.

On Saturday, the government of New South Wales, which includes Sydney, pledged to introduce a bill on Monday to ban the display of symbols and flags of "terrorist organisations", including those of Islamic State, Hamas, al-Qaeda, Al Shabaab, Boko Haram and Hezbollah.

Authorities say Islamic State flags were found in the car the alleged attackers took to Bondi.

Alleged gunman Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police at the scene. His 24-year-old son Naveed Akram, who was also shot by police and emerged from a coma on Tuesday, has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, according to police.

about 50 residents of a Ukrainian border village into ​Russia, Ukrainian media quoted the military ‍as saying.

Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne and ​the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet said Russian ​forces entered Ukrainian territory on Saturday night in the area of the village of Hrabovske.

Most of the local residents captured from the village were elderly people, the media said.

The Kremlin denied that three-way talks between Ukraine, Russia and the United States were on the cards, as diplomats gathered in Miami for talks on ending the conflict.

"At present, no one has seriously discussed this initiative, and to my knowledge, it is not in preparation," Russian President Vladimir Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters, according to Russian news agencies.

US negotiators met Russian officials in Florida for the latest talks aimed at ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, as President Donald Trump’s administration tries to coax an agreement out of both sides to end the ​conflict.

The Miami meeting followed US talks on Friday with Ukrainian and European officials, the latest discussions of a peace plan that has ‍sparked some hope of a resolution to the conflict that began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev told reporters after meeting US special envoy ​Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner that the talks were constructive and would continue on Sunday. A White House official ​said the talks had concluded for the day.

Vladimir Putin is ready to talk with France's Emmanuel Macron over the war in Ukraine, the Russian president's spokesman said in an interview published Sunday.

Putin has "expressed readiness to engage in dialogue with Macron", Dmitry Peskov told state news agency RIA Novosti.

"Therefore, if there is mutual political will, then this can only be assessed positively."

Macron said this week he believed Europe should reach back out to Putin over ending the war.

"I believe that it's in our interest as Europeans and Ukrainians to find the right framework to re-engage this discussion" in the coming weeks, the French president said.

Washington proposed trilateral talks between US, Russia and Ukraine .

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that only the US is capable of persuading Russia to end the war in Ukraine.

Russian missile strikes on port infrastructure in Odesa , southern Ukraine, killed eight people and left 27 wounded.

The missing files, which were available Friday and no longer accessible by Saturday, included images of paintings depicting nude women, and one showing a series of photographs along a credenza and in drawers. In that image, inside a drawer among other photos, was a photograph of Trump, alongside Epstein, Melania Trump and Epstein's longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell .

The Justice Department didn’t answer questions Saturday about why the files disappeared but said in a post on X that “photos and other materials will continue being reviewed and redacted consistent with the law in an abundance of caution as we receive additional information.”

Online, the unexplained missing files fueled speculation about what was taken down and why the public was not notified, compounding long-standing intrigue about Epstein and the powerful figures who surrounded him. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee pointed to the missing image featuring a Trump photo in a post on X, writing: “What else is being covered up? We need transparency for the American public.”

The episode deepened concerns that had already emerged from the Justice Department’s much-anticipated document release. The tens of thousands of pages made public offered little new insight into Epstein’s crimes or the prosecutorial decisions that allowed him to avoid serious federal charges for years, while omitting some of the most closely watched materials, including FBI interviews with victims and internal Justice Department memos on charging decisions.

Some of the most consequential records expected about Epstein are nowhere to be found in the Justice Department's initial disclosures, which span tens of thousands of pages.

Missing are FBI interviews with survivors and internal Justice Department memos examining charging decisions – records that could have helped explain how investigators viewed the case and why Epstein was allowed in 2008 to plead guilty to a relatively minor state-level prostitution charge.

The gaps go further.

The records, required to be released under a recent law passed by Congress, hardly reference several powerful figures long associated with Epstein, including Britain’s former Prince Andrew, renewing questions about who was scrutinized, who was not, and how much the disclosures truly advance public accountability

Among the fresh nuggets: insight into the Justice Department’s decision to abandon an investigation into Epstein in the 2000s, which enabled him to plead guilty to that state-level charge, and a previously unseen 1996 complaint accusing Epstein of stealing photographs of children .

The releases so far have been heavy on images of Epstein’s homes in New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands, with some photos of celebrities and politicians.

There was a series of never-before-seen photos of former President Bill Clinton but fleetingly few of Trump. Both have been associated with Epstein, but both have since disowned those friendships. Neither has been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and there was no indication the photos played a role in the criminal cases brought against him.

Despite a Friday deadline set by Congress to make everything public, the Justice Department said it plans to release records on a rolling basis. It blamed the delay on the time-consuming process of obscuring survivors' names and other identifying information. The department has not given any notice when more records might arrive.

That approach angered some Epstein accusers and members of Congress who fought to pass the law forced the department to act. Instead of marking the end of a yearslong battle for transparency, the document release Friday was merely the beginning of an indefinite wait for a complete picture of Epstein’s crimes and the steps taken to investigate them.

“I feel like again the DOJ, the justice system is failing us,” said Marina Lacerda, who alleges Epstein started sexually abusing her at his New York City mansion when she was 14.

Federal prosecutors in New York brought sex trafficking charges against Epstein in 2019, but he killed himself in jail after his arrest.

The documents just made public were a sliver of potentially millions of pages records in the department’s possession. In one example, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said Manhattan federal prosecutors had more than 3.6 million records from sex trafficking investigations into Epstein and Maxwell, though many duplicated material already turned over by the FBI.

Many of the records released so far had been made public in court filings, congressional releases or freedom of information requests, though, for the first time, they were all in one place and available for the public to search for free.

Ones that were new were often lacking necessary context or heavily blacked out. A 119-page document marked “Grand Jury-NY," likely from one of the federal sex trafficking investigations that led to the charges against Epstein in 2019 or Maxwell in 2021, was entirely blacked out.

Trump’s Republican allies seized on the Clinton images, including photos of the Democrat with singers Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. There were also photos of Epstein with actors Chris Tucker and Kevin Spacey, and even Epstein with TV newscaster Walter Cronkite. But none of the photos had captions and was no explanation given for why any of them were together.

The meatiest records released so far showed that federal prosecutors had what appeared to be a strong case against Epstein in 2007 yet never charged him.

Transcripts of grand jury proceedings, released publicly for the first time, included testimony from FBI agents who described interviews they had with several girls and young women who described being paid to perform sex acts for Epstein. The youngest was 14 and in ninth grade.

One had told investigators about being sexually assaulted by Epstein when she initially resisted his advances during a massage.

Another, then 21, testified before the grand jury about how Epstein had hired her when she was 16 to perform a sexual massage and how she had gone on to recruit other girls to do the same.

“For every girl that I brought to the table he would give me $200,” she said. They were mostly people she knew from high school, she said. “I also told them that if they are under age, just lie about it and tell him that you are 18.”

The documents also contain a transcript of an interview Justice Department lawyers did more than a decade later with the US attorney who oversaw the case, Alexander Acosta, about his ultimate decision not to bring federal charges.

Acosta, who was labor secretary during Trump’s first term, cited concerns about whether a jury would believe Epstein’s accusers.

He also said the Justice Department might have been more reluctant to make a federal prosecution out of a case that straddled the legal border between sex trafficking and soliciting prostitution, something more commonly handled by state prosecutors.

“I’m not saying it was the right view,” Acosta added. He also said that the public today would likely view the survivors differently.

“There’s been a lot of changes in victim shaming,” Acosta said.

Jennifer Freeman, an attorney representing Epstein accuser Maria Farmer and other survivors, said Saturday that her client feels vindicated after the document release. Farmer sought for years documents backing up her claim that Epstein and Maxwell were in possession of child sexual abuse images.

“It’s a triumph and a tragedy,” she said. “It looks like the government did absolutely nothing. Horrible things have happened and if they investigated in even the smallest way, they could have stopped him.”</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:22:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3bbc6fba-de44-11f0-950e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25353839766531.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US forces intercept second merchant vessel off Venezuela amid blockade of sanctioned vessels</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251220-us-forces-stop-second-merchant-vessel-off-venezuela-after-trump-announces-oil-blockade</link><description>US forces on Saturday stopped an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela for the second time in less than two weeks as President Donald Trump continues to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro .

The pre-dawn operation comes days after Trump announced a “blockade” of all sanctioned oil tankers coming in and out of the South American country and follows the December 10 seizure by American forces of an oil tanker off Venezuela’s coast.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that the US Coast Guard with help from the Defense Department stopped the oil tanker that was last docked in Venezuela. She also posted on social media an unclassified video of a US helicopter landing personnel on a vessel called Centuries.

A crude oil tanker flying under the flag of Panama operates under the name and was recently spotted near the Venezuelan coast, according to MarineTraffic, a project that tracks the movement of vessels around the globe using publicly available data. It was not immediately clear if the vessel was under US sanctions.

“The United States will continue to pursue the illicit movement of sanctioned oil that is used to fund narco terrorism in the region,” Noem wrote on X. “We will find you, and we will stop you.”

The action was a “consented boarding,” with the tanker stopping voluntarily and allowing US forces to board it, according to a US official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.

Pentagon and White House officials did not immediately respond to a requests for comment.

Trump following the first tanker seizure, of a vessel named the Skipper, this month vowed that the US would carry out a blockade of Venezuela. It all comes as Trump has ratcheted up his rhetoric toward Maduro and warned that the longtime Venezuelan leader’s days in power are numbered.

And the president this week demanded that Venezuela return assets that it seized from US oil companies years ago, justifying anew his announcement of a “blockade” against oil tankers traveling to or from the South American country that face American sanctions.

Trump cited the lost US investments in Venezuela when asked about his newest tactic in a pressure campaign against Maduro, suggesting the Republican administration’s moves are at least somewhat motivated by disputes over oil investments, along with accusations of drug trafficking. Some sanctioned tankers already are diverting away from Venezuela.

"We’re not going to be letting anybody going through who shouldn’t be going through,” Trump told reporters earlier this week. “You remember they took all of our energy rights. They took all of our oil not that long ago. And we want it back. They took it – they illegally took it.”

US oil companies dominated Venezuela’s petroleum industry until the country’s leaders moved to nationalize the sector, first in the 1970s and again in the 21st century under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez. Compensation offered by Venezuela was deemed insufficient, and in 2014 an international arbitration panel ordered the country’s socialist government to pay $1.6 billion to ExxonMobil.

The targeting of tankers comes as Trump has ordered the Defense Department to carry out a series of attacks on vessels in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific Ocean that his administration alleges are smuggling fentanyl and other illegal drugs into the United States and beyond.

At least 104 people have been killed in 28 known strikes since early September.

The strikes have faced scrutiny from US lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and that the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.

The Coast Guard, sometimes with help from the Navy, had typically interdicted boats suspected of smuggling drugs in the Caribbean Sea, searched for illicit cargo, and arrested the people aboard for prosecution.

The administration has justified the strikes as necessary, asserting it is in “armed conflict” with drug cartels aimed at halting the flow of narcotics into the United States. Maduro faces federal charges of narcoterrorism in the US.

The US in recent months has sent a fleet of warships to the region, the largest buildup of forces in generations, and Trump has stated repeatedly that land attacks are coming soon.

Maduro has insisted the real purpose of the US military operations is to force him from power.

White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said in an interview with Vanity Fair published this week that Trump “wants to keep on blowing boats up until Maduro cries uncle.”</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:22:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/811a94a8-daf5-11f0-a93c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25346745749734.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>MAGA civil war steals the spotlight at 'AmericaFest' conference</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251220-maga-civil-war-steals-spotlight-americafest-conference-turning-point-usa</link><description>The first major gathering of Turning Point USA since the murder of its influential founder was supposed to bring America's far-right activists together to celebrate the life of Charlie Kirk .

Influential podcaster Ben Shapiro came straight out of the gate, attacking former Fox News host Tucker Carlson for an uncritical interview with self-described white nationalist Nick Fuentes.

"The conservative movement is... in danger from charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle, but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty," he said.

Shapiro said Carlson should never have given oxygen to Fuentes, whose views are described as anti-Semitic, misogynistic and racist.

Kirk had "despised" Fuentes, Shapiro added.

"He knew that Nick Fuentes is an evil troll and that building him up is an act of moral imbecility, and that is precisely what Tucker Carlson did."

Carlson shot back, mocking Shapiro for suggesting censorship, which he claimed was anathema to the Turning Point founder.

"Deplatforming and denouncing people at a Charlie Kirk event. I'm like, what? It's hilarious," he told the audience a few hours later.

The brewing MAGA civil war is over who will take the reins when Trump – who cannot run for the White House again – steps back.

No one has formally declared their candidacy for the 2028 Republican presidential nomination, but a number of names are being bandied around as pretenders to the throne.

They include Fuentes and firebrand congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who last month broke with Trump, saying his second term agenda was a betrayal of his voters.

Vice President JD Vance, who is due to speak at the gathering on Sunday, got a significant boost Thursday when Erika Kirk endorsed him for a 2028 White House run.

"We are going to get my husband's friend JD Vance elected for 48 in the most resounding way possible," she said to cheers from the thousands-strong crowd. The next US president will be the country's 48th leader.

Former presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy, who ran for the Republican nomination in 2024, did not comment directly on Kirk's endorsement.

"We're at a fork in the road, and I think that there are competing visions for the future of the right," Ramaswamy told AFP. "I think it's great for us to have that conversation."

The Vance endorsement from Turning Point's new CEO is why Shapiro is annoyed, hinted Carlson, whose newsletter on Friday gloated "Sorry, Ben Shapiro, JD is America First."

"Trump created this amazing coalition, bringing in people who had never voted Republican before ... and that coalition took over the most powerful government in the history of the world," Carlson told the audience on Thursday.

"So there's a lot of blood at stake here, as the question becomes, who gets to run it after, who gets the machinery when the President exits the scene.

"There are a lot of people in Washington, maybe even in this room, who aren't quite sure what they want, but they know they don't want – JD Vance ."

The spat between two of the loudest voices in the far-right mediasphere comes as former Daily Wire host Candace Owens continues to cause waves with a series of provocative claims.

Owens, whose YouTube channel has 5.7 million subscribers, is involved in a bizarre fight with French President Emmanuel Macron over wild claims his wife Brigitte is actually a man.

She is also in a quarrel with Erika Kirk over unsubstantiated claims of a conspiracy involving the US and Israeli governments in the killing of her husband.

Kirk on Thursday sought to tamp down the divisions on the right, which she said had appeared after Charlie's death.

"When he was assassinated, we saw infighting. We've seen fractures," she said.

"We've seen bridges being burned, that shouldn't be burned."</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:22:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a6c5fe82-dcf2-11f0-abf6-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25352824906892.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Key takeaways from the Justice Department release of thousands of Epstein files</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251220-key-takeaways-us-justice-department-epstein-files-release</link><description>The US Department of Justice on Friday published thousands of files related to Jeffrey Epstein , a release long anticipated for its potential to reveal new details about the late sex offender and his connections to powerful people.

But it was clear soon after the release that it would fall far short of those expectations. The partial release angered Democrats , who accused the Trump administration of trying to hide information. The Justice Department said it would continue releasing documents in the weeks ahead.

The file dump – dominated by photographs, but also including call logs, court records and other documents, many with redactions – comes after politicians and the public waged a massive campaign for transparency about the government’s investigations into the wealthy financier.

US President Donald Trump , who was friends with Epstein for years before the two had a falling-out, tried for months to keep the records sealed. Though he hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, he has argued there is nothing to see in the files and the public should focus on other issues.

On November 19, relenting to political pressure from his fellow Republicans, Trump signed a bill mandating the release of most of the Justice Department’s files on Epstein within 30 days. The White House said Friday’s release of the files shows how the administration is the “most transparent in history”.

Here are some takeaways about the Justice Department’s initial Epstein file release:

The law signed by Trump last month set Friday as the deadline for the Justice Department to release most of its files about Epstein.

Ahead of the release, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told Fox News he expected several hundred thousand files to be released Friday, along with several hundred thousand more to come later.

But the number of files that actually landed on the Justice Department’s website seemed to be a thin slice of the total number expected. Blanche acknowledged in a letter to Congress that the production of files was incomplete. The department said it expected to complete its production of Epstein documents by the end of the year.

Senator Dick Durbin has said that Trump's Attorney General Pam Bondi “pressured the FBI to put approximately 1,000 personnel” on 24-shifts “to review approximately 100,000 Epstein-related records” ahead of their release.

“My office was told that these personnel were instructed to ‘flag’ any records in which President Trump was mentioned,” Durbin wrote in a July letter to Bondi.

Among the documents made public are around 4,000 files – mostly photographs – under a subset the Justice Department described as “DOJ Disclosures”. The vast majority of the photographs were taken by the FBI during searches of Epstein’s homes in New York City and the US Virgin Islands.

Also included were images of envelopes, folders and boxes containing investigative materials from various probes related to Epstein. Many records are redacted, and anything containing a victim’s personally identifiable information, including materials depicting sexual and physical abuse, isn’t authorised for release.

Various other files released by the Justice Department on Friday include court records, public records and disclosures to House committees. At least some of that material has already circulated in the public domain after years of court action and investigations.

Many of the most discussed photos from the files show the former Democratic president Bill Clinton. Clinton has acknowledged that he travelled on Epstein’s private jet but said through a spokesperson that he had no knowledge of the late financier’s crimes.

Some of the photos show Clinton on a private plane, including one with a woman seated next to him with her arm around him. Her face is redacted from the photo.

Another photo shows him in a pool with British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell , who has been convicted of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, and with another person whose face is redacted. One shows him with the late pop star Michael Jackson , singer Diana Ross and a woman whose face is redacted.

Another shows Clinton in a hot tub with a woman whose face is redacted. The Justice Department did not explain how those photos were related to the criminal investigation.

Nevertheless, senior White House aides quickly called attention to them on X. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, wrote “Oh my!” and added a shocked face emoji in response to the photo of Clinton in the hot tub.

Angel Ureña, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, said in an X post that “this isn’t about Bill Clinton” and accused the White House of trying to protect others.

“There are two types of people here,” he wrote. “The first group knew nothing and cut Epstein off before his crimes came to light. The second group continued relationships with him after. We’re in the first.”

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and the mere inclusion of someone’s name or images in files from the investigation does not imply otherwise.

To some exploring the records released Friday, the most interesting parts were which high-profile figures appeared scarcely – or not at all.

For example, Trump is minimally referenced in the files, and the small number of photos that do show him appear to have been in the public domain for decades. The president made no reference to the initial records release during a rally Friday night in North Carolina.

The release does include at least one photo of the former prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, who appears in a tuxedo lying on the laps of what appear to be several women who are seated, dressed in formalwear. One of Epstein’s accusers, Virginia Giuffre, accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with men, including the prince.

Marina Lacerda, one of the women who says she survived sexual assault by Epstein, beginning when she was 14 years old, said Friday she wanted to see greater transparency from the Justice Department and expressed frustration over redactions and the incomplete release.

“Just put out the files,” she said. “And stop redacting names that don’t need to be redacted.”

Several lawmakers blasted the Trump administration for failing to produce all the documents required under the law.

Reps. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., and Thomas Massie, R-Ky., had introduced what is known as a discharge petition, which eventually led to the congressional vote that forced the release of the Epstein files. On Friday, both took to social media to criticise the partial release.

Massie wrote that it “grossly fails to comply with both the spirit and the letter of the law”. Khanna called the release so far “disappointing”.

“We’re going to push for the actual documents,” he said.

Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said that by disregarding the deadline, the administration was denying justice to Epstein’s victims. He added he was “exploring all avenues and legal tools to get justice for the victims and transparency for the American people”.

If Democratic lawmakers so choose, they could go to court to force the Justice Department to comply with the law, but that would almost certainly be a lengthy process that plays out while the department releases more files.

Separately, the House Oversight Committee has issued a subpoena for the Epstein files. That could give Congress another avenue to force the release of more information to the committee, but it would require Republicans to join them in contempt-of-Congress proceedings against a Republican administration.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:22:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cbac5b6c-dd45-11f0-a8a6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/a0f6a550154825f11b3a3a0ee2fc0b3cc4bde010.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan sentences ex-PM Imran Khan and wife to another 17 years in prison for corruption</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251220-pakistani-court-sentences-former-pm-imran-khan-wife-17-years-corruption-case</link><description>A Pakistani court convicted and sentenced imprisoned former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife on Saturday to 17 years in prison after finding them guilty of retaining and selling state gifts, officials and his party said.

The couple pleaded not guilty when they were indicted last year. They were accused of selling the gifts, including jewellery from Saudi Arabia’s government, at prices far below their market value while he was in office. Prosecutors said Khan and his wife declared the value of the gifts at just $10,707, far below their actual market value of $28,521, allowing them to purchase the items at a reduced price.

Under Pakistani law, for government officials and politicians to keep gifts received from foreign dignitaries, they must buy them at the assessed market value and declare any proceeds earned from selling them.

Khan’s opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party denounced the verdict in a statement, calling it “a black chapter in history”, and said Khan was present in the court when the judge announced the verdict in the Adiala prison in the city of Rawalpindi.

Khan, 73, was ousted in a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and his party is in opposition in the parliament. He has been serving multiple prison terms since 2023 on corruption convictions and other charges that the former cricket star and his supporters have alleged are aimed at blocking his political career.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:22:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f152dbb8-dd8e-11f0-bd49-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25017283291818.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Russian officials to meet in Florida for latest round of Ukraine talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251220-us-russian-officials-to-meet-in-florida-for-latest-round-of-ukraine-talks</link><description>US negotiators are set ⁠to meet Russian officials in Florida on Saturday for the latest talks aimed at ending Russia’s war in Ukraine , as President Donald Trump’s administration tries to coax an agreement out of both Russia and Ukraine to end the conflict.

The meeting follows US talks on Friday ​with Ukrainian and European officials , the latest discussions of a peace plan that has sparked some hope of a resolution ‍to the conflict that began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

President Vladimir Putin 's envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, is leading the Russian delegation that will meet with property tycoon-turned-diplomat ​Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner . Marco Rubio , Trump’s top diplomat and national security advisor, said he ​may also join the talks.

Previous meetings have taken place at Witkoff’s golf club in Miami’s Hallandale Beach.

US, Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week reported progress on security guarantees for Kyiv as part of the talks to end the war, but it remains unclear if those terms will be acceptable to Moscow .

A Russian source told Reuters that any meeting between Dmitriev and the Ukrainian negotiators had been ruled out.

US intelligence reports continue to warn that Russian President Vladimir Putin intends to capture all of Ukraine, sources familiar with the intelligence said, contradicting some US officials' assertions that ‍Moscow is ready for peace.

Putin offered no compromise during his annual press conference in Moscow , insisting that Russia’s terms for ending the war had not changed since June 2024, when ​he demanded Ukraine abandon its ambition to join NATO and withdraw entirely from four Ukrainian regions Russia claims as its own territory.

Kyiv says it will not cede land that Moscow's forces have failed to capture in nearly four years of war.

Ukraine’s top ‌negotiator Rustem Umerov said US and European teams on Friday held talks and agreed to pursue their joint efforts.

"We agreed with our American partners on further steps and on continuing our joint work in the ‍near future," Umerov wrote on Telegram of the discussions in the United States, adding that he had informed President Volodymyr Zelensky of the outcome of the talks.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Rubio told reporters earlier on Friday that progress has been made in discussions to end the war but there is still a way to go.

"In the end, it's up to them to make a deal. We can't force Ukraine to make a deal. We can't force Russia to make a deal. They have to want to make a deal," Rubio said.

"The ‍role we're trying to play is a role of figuring out whether there's any overlap here that they can agree to, and that's what we've invested a ‌lot of time and ​energy and continue to do so. That may not be possible. I hope it is. I hope it can get done this month before the end of the year."</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:22:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8ff4fbf6-dd81-11f0-8fcf-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Kirill-Dmitriev-Witkoff.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian forces take Ukrainian villagers across border, media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-forces-take-ukrainian-villagers-across-border-media-says-2025-12-21/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Russian forces have crossed the border with Ukraine in the northeastern Sumy region and taken about 50 residents of a Ukrainian border village into Russia, Ukrainian media quoted the military as saying on Sunday.

Ukraine's public broadcaster Suspilne and the Ukrainska Pravda news outlet said Russian forces entered Ukrainian territory on Saturday night in the area of the village of Hrabovske.

Most of the local residents captured from the village were elderly people, the media said.

Reuters could not independently verify the report. Russia has not yet commented on the matter.

Russian forces have secured a foothold in several villages in Sumy region in recent months and many towns have been subjected to shelling.

The head of the Sumy region military administration, Oleh Hryhorov, said on Telegram that authorities had begun evacuating residents of border villages who had earlier declined to be moved.

He did not identify the affected places but urged residents of border areas to agree to evacuation.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:43:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ongoing Ukraine peace talks in Miami 'constructive', Kremlin envoy says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251221-ongoing-ukraine-peace-talks-miami-constructive-kremlin-envoy-says</link><description>A Kremlin envoy says peace talks on a US-proposed plan to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine were pressing on "constructively” in Florida .

The talks are part of the Trump administration’s monthslong push for peace that also included meetings with Ukrainian and European officials in Berlin earlier this week.

“The discussions are proceeding constructively. They began earlier and will continue today, and will also continue tomorrow,” Kirill Dmitriev told reporters Saturday, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti.

Dmitriev met with US President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner in Miami, the agency reported.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Saturday that much will depend on the US posture after discussions with the Russians. This came a day after Ukraine’s chief negotiator said his delegation had completed separate meetings in the United States with American and European partners.

Trump has unleashed an extensive diplomatic push to end the war, but his efforts have run into sharply conflicting demands by Moscow and Kyiv. Russian President Vladimir Putin has recently signaled he is digging in on his maximalist demands on Ukraine, as Moscow’s troops inch forward on the battlefield despite huge losses.

On Friday, Putin expressed confidence that the Kremlin would achieve its military goals if Kyiv didn’t agree to Russia’s conditions in peace talks.

European Union leaders agreed on Friday to provide €90 billion ($106 billion) to Ukraine to meet its military and economic needs for the next two years, although they failed to bridge differences with Belgium that would have allowed them to use frozen Russian assets to raise the funds. Instead, they were borrowed from capital markets.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 09:44:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4bbed6c-de4b-11f0-8985-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25338510718407.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Long lines at the food pantry: Inflation tests Trump’s base in Michigan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/long-lines-food-pantry-inflation-tests-trumps-base-michigan-2025-12-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 10:22:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Swedish customs says it has boarded Russian ship in Swedish waters to conduct inspection</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swedish-customs-says-it-has-boarded-russian-ship-swedish-waters-conduct-2025-12-21/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Sweden's customs service said on Sunday that authorities had boarded a Russian freighter that anchored in Swedish waters on Friday after developing engine problems, and was conducting an inspection of the cargo.

The owners of the vessel, the Adler, are on the European Union's sanctions list, Martin Hoglund, spokesman at the customs authority said.

"Shortly after 0100 last night we boarded the ship with support from the Swedish Coast Guard and the police service in order to make a customs inspection," Hoglund said. "The inspection is still ongoing."

Hoglund declined to say what the customs service had found on board the ship.

According to ship-tracking service Marine Traffic, the Adler is a 126-metre-long, roll-on, roll-off container carrier. It is anchored off Hoganas in southwest Sweden.

In addition to the Adler being on an EU sanctions list, the vessel and its owners M Leasing LLC are also both subject to U.S. sanctions, suspected of involvement in weapons transport, according to OpenSanctions, a database of sanctioned companies and individuals, persons of interest and government watchlists.

Hoglund said the ship had left the Russian port of St Petersburg on December 15, but he said customs did not have any information about its destination.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 10:23:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump set to expand immigration crackdown in 2026 despite brewing backlash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-set-expand-immigration-crackdown-2026-despite-brewing-backlash-2025-12-21/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is preparing for a more aggressive immigration crackdown in 2026 with billions in new funding, including by raiding more workplaces — even as backlash builds ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Trump has already surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents. While federal agents this year conducted some high-profile raids on businesses , they largely avoided raiding farms, factories and other businesses that are economically important but known to employ immigrants without legal status.

ICE and Border Patrol will get $170 billion in additional funds through September 2029 - a huge surge of funding over their existing annual budgets of about $19 billion after the Republican-controlled Congress passed a massive spending package in July.

Administration officials say they plan to hire thousands more agents, open new detention centers, pick up more immigrants in local jails and partner with outside companies to track down people without legal status.

The expanded deportation plans come despite growing signs of political backlash ahead of next year’s midterm elections.

Miami, one of the cities most affected by Trump’s crackdown because of its large immigrant population, elected its first Democratic mayor in nearly three decades last week in what the mayor-elect said was, in part, a reaction to the president. Other local elections and polling have suggested rising concern among voters wary of aggressive immigration tactics.

"People are beginning to see this not as an immigration question anymore as much as it is a violation of rights, a violation of due process and militarizing neighborhoods extraconstitutionally," said Mike Madrid, a moderate Republican political strategist. "There is no question that is a problem for the president and Republicans."

Trump’s overall approval rating on immigration policy fell from 50% in March, before he launched crackdowns in several major U.S. cities, to 41% in mid-December, for what had been his strongest issue .

Rising public unease has focused on masked federal agents using aggressive tactics such as deploying tear gas in residential neighborhoods and detaining U.S. citizens .

In addition to expanding enforcement actions, Trump has stripped hundreds of thousands of Haitian, Venezuelan and Afghan immigrants of temporary legal status, expanding the pool of people who could be deported as the president promises to remove 1 million immigrants each year – a goal he almost certainly will miss this year. So far, some 622,000 immigrants have been deported since Trump took office in January.

White House border czar Tom Homan told Reuters Trump had delivered on his promise of a historic deportation operation and removing criminals while shutting down illegal immigration across the U.S.-Mexico border. Homan said the number of arrests will increase sharply as ICE hires more officers and expands detention capacity with the new funding.

“I think you're going to see the numbers explode greatly next year,” Homan said.

Homan said the plans “absolutely” include more enforcement actions at workplaces.

Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way, said U.S. businesses have been reluctant to push back on Trump's immigration crackdown in the past year but could be prompted to speak up if the focus turns to employers.

Pierce said it will be interesting to see "whether or not businesses finally stand up to this administration."

Trump, a Republican, recaptured the White House promising record levels of deportations, saying it was needed after years of high levels of illegal immigration under his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. He kicked off a campaign that dispatched federal agents to U.S. cities in search of possible immigration offenders, sparking protests and lawsuits over racial profiling and violent tactics.

Some businesses shut down to avoid raids or because of a lack of customers. Parents vulnerable to arrest kept their children home from school or had neighbors walk them. Some U.S. citizens started carrying passports.

Despite the focus on criminals in its public statements, government data shows that the Trump administration has been arresting more people who have not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.

Some 41% of the roughly 54,000 people arrested by ICE and detained by late November had no criminal record beyond a suspected immigration violation, agency figures show. In the first few weeks in January, before Trump took office, just 6% of those arrested and detained by ICE were not facing charges for other crimes or previously convicted.

The Trump administration has taken aim at legal immigrants as well. Agents have arrested spouses of U.S. citizens at their green card interviews, pulled people from certain countries out of their naturalization ceremonies, moments before they were to become citizens, and revoked thousands of student visas .

The administration’s planned focus on job sites in the coming year could generate many more arrests and affect the U.S. economy and Republican-leaning business owners.

Replacing immigrants arrested during workplace raids could lead to higher labor costs, undermining Trump’s fight against inflation, which analysts expect to be a major issue in the closely watched November elections, determining control of Congress.

Administration officials earlier this year exempted such businesses from enforcement on Trump’s orders, then quickly reversed , Reuters reported at the time.

Some immigration hardliners have called for more workplace enforcement.

"Eventually you’re going to have to go after these employers,” said Jessica Vaughan, policy director for the Center for Immigration Studies, which backs lower levels of immigration. “When that starts happening the employers will start cleaning up their acts on their own.”</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 11:38:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J3RCYDR5CVM6ZMOHNCAUHHH5QI.jpg?auth=7b061c5bead523370603c8101ec074ec507c9a4c37460f79423c7f9a9f3a2579&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Macron addresses French troops on visit to the United Arab Emirates</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251221-live-macron-addresses-french-troops-on-visit-to-the-united-arab-emirates</link><description>Macron is meeting with UAE President Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to discuss "strengthening the strategic partnership" between the two countries, according to the French presidency, which stressed their cooperation on security and defence.

The French president traditionally celebrates the end-of-year holidays with troops deployed abroad, of whom there are more than 900 in the UAE.

France cooperates with the UAE on areas including artificial intelligence and trade, and now wants to secure the Gulf state's support in its war on drug trafficking.

Major traffickers are believed to have found refuge in the UAE, Dubai in particular, and some of them are thought to have built up substantial real estate portfolios there.

The French delegation includes Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin, who last month called on the UAE to extradite some 15 suspected drug traffickers wanted by France.

And Macron said on Tuesday that he wanted to seek cooperation from countries where certain ringleaders are located to seize their assets and have them arrested.

Sello last saw him on June 30 and does not know if his son is still alive.

Moses is one of some 22 men who left South Africa on July 8, believing they were travelling to Moscow for “advanced military training”. They did not return and were instead reportedly sent to fight for Russia in the Ukraine war.

South African police are also investigating the alleged involvement of Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, daughter of former president Jacob Zuma , along with two others, Blessing Khoza and Siphokazi Xuma. The investigation was launched after another of Zuma’s daughters filed a police report against her half-sister, accusing her of recruiting fighters for Russia and saying that eight of her family members were among those recruited.

Zuma-Sambudla has since resigned as a member of parliament for Zuma’s uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party but denies wrongdoing. The MK Party has denied any involvement.

In a separate case, five suspects have been arrested for allegedly recruiting South Africans to fight for Russia . Their trial is set to begin on February 10 at the Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court in Gauteng.

While authorities are investigating both matters, the chances of the men returning to South Africa before Christmas are slim.

Speaking to FRANCE 24 from his farm in Botswana , Sello said his son and his cousin were the only two recruits from Botswana among a group of about 18 mostly South African men who went to Russia under the guise of security training.

They were invited for “personal development training, which included what they called VIP protection training and military intelligence training”, explained Sello. In the beginning, he did not have direct communication with the recruiters. He was told about the training by the cousin’s father, who was in contact with people believed to be linked to Zuma-Sambudla.

Although Sello was “a bit sceptical” about the training, his son, Moses, was persuaded to go.

Moses left for South Africa on June 30 and travelled to Russia around July 8. His return ticket was dated July 28. But “they never came back”.

After more than a month, Sello managed to talk to his son. “They (his son and cousin) called me on August 28, saying they are being forced to go into the war zone, which they believed was dangerous.”

It was the last time they spoke.

It was during this conversation that Moses said Zuma-Sambudla pressured them into entering a combat zone. They were promised that it would only be for 12 to 15 days, “then they will be out of it”.

Almost five months later, “We are helpless here,” Sello says.

When he started to reach out to the people who recruited the men, he was referred to Khoza, “as he was the man who was checking in with the boys”. Sello says Khoza told him that he was going to Moscow in mid-September and would call him upon his return to South Africa.

But Khoza failed to follow up as promised. “He never called me and never took my calls, and he never answered my messages, ever since the day he said he would call me.”

Sello said Zuma-Sambudla had assured him the boys would return home. But their fate remains unclear.

“Some say they are dead. Others say they are alive,” he said. “It’s horrible. I’m angry and hurting. I just want my son.”

Sello had heard rumours of men from West Africa disappearing after going to Russia. This fuelled his suspicions about the security training in Moscow. However, he was repeatedly told by the cousin’s father, who was in contact with the recruiters, that the boys wouldn’t go to the front, only to Moscow.

During their last call in August, Moses told him they were wearing uniforms bearing an insignia associated with units aligned with Wagner mercenaries.

FRANCE 24 obtained drone footage showing two black men who were killed in combat; their identities are unconfirmed. However, their uniforms could support Sello’s claim that African recruits have ended up in mercenary units rather than with the Russian armed forces.

The uniforms included the “OS Archon” – ОС Архон – badge, which is believed to be associated with an ultra-nationalist Russian military unit that has been linked to Russian mercenaries, including fighters who have operated alongside or within Wagner-aligned structures, such as Africa Corps.

The camouflage uniforms the deceased soldiers are wearing are freely available on the civilian market and are being used in many countries, according to defence analyst Ricardo Teixeira of South Africa’s Institute of Race Relations. While their uniforms are not Russian, Teixeira explained that the body armour and helmet are Russian.

Teixeira told FRANCE 24 that there are very few black soldiers among regular Russian forces in eastern Ukraine, making it likely that the men were foreign recruits. He said the timing of the footage aligns with a combat mission the South African group was believed to have taken part in.

In a letter marked “urgent” and dated September 19, former president Jacob Zuma wrote to Russian Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, confirming the MK Party’s support for Russia’s “Special Military Operation” – as Russia refers to the war in Ukraine – and stating that 18 South Africans had travelled to Russia for “advanced military training”.

Zuma wrote that, instead of being enrolled in an officer training programme, the men were placed on basic infantry contracts in Pskov. He requested their immediate withdrawal from combat and the cancellation of their contracts or reassignment to non-combat roles.

Teixeira questioned the rationale for sending men abroad for training when South Africa has a large private security industry.

“It is very clear that they weren’t there for bodyguard training. There are 14,000 private security companies in South Africa, and over 650,000 active security guards.”

Teixeira notes the Wagner Group is present across Africa, including in Pretoria and countries such as Mali, Sudan and Libya. He said Wagner and related groups have repeatedly been accused of recruiting people for logistics or technical work before deploying them to the front lines.

A spokesperson for the South African presidency, Vincent Magwenya, said on December 15 that there were no new developments in the investigation.

Ukraine’s ambassador to South Africa, Olexander Scherba, told FRANCE 24 that, while Ukraine is willing to investigate, the matter falls primarily under South Africa’s jurisdiction.

Asked whether the embassy could assist in bringing the men home, he said there was “very little, practically nothing” it could do.

“The evilness of what has been done to these families is mind-boggling,” Scherba said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 14:44:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ed22b48e-ddb4-11f0-b623-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Russia-soldier.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US intercepts another vessel near Venezuela, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-intercepts-another-vessel-near-venezuela-officials-say-2025-12-21/</link><description>Dec 21 (Reuters) - The United States has intercepted another vessel off the coast of Venezuela in international waters, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday, the second such operation this weekend.

The demonstration, part of a wider movement confronting political interference in higher education, was the first of its kind in Novi Pazar, a town with a majority Bosniak Muslim population.

It is among many protests organised after the collapse of a railway station roof last year in the northern city of Novi Sad, which killed 16 people.

Students from Novi Pazar have become famous countrywide after walking for days to join mass protests in Novi Sad to mark the first anniversary of the roof collapse on November 1.

Now they say the university administration has revoked regular student status for those absent due to protests and dismissed dozens of lecturers.

"I came here to express support to Novi Pazar students," said Momcilo Zelenbaba, who travelled from the town of Jagodina 190 km (120 miles) north of Novi Pazar. "I came because 200 students lost their status and 30 professors lost their jobs."

Protesters are demanding the resignation of the university's managing board and the election of a new rector.

"We are here today to send a message to Serbia that we fight for an interim management and the survival of our university," said Dzenana Ahmetovic, a protester. "This concerns all of us, not only Novi Pazar."

Throughout the day-long protest, participants observed a moment of silence for the victims of the roof collapse. They waved flags representing their towns and universities, whistled, and chanted their signature slogan: “Pump up!”

The protest movement - led by students, academics, and opposition figures - accuses Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and his populist nationalist party of fostering corruption, poor public services, nepotism, and restrictions on media freedom. Vucic and his party deny the allegations.

Novi Pazar is Serbia's youngest town demographically, with 60% of its majority Muslim population under the age of 30. Despite its distinct ethnic make-up, no clashes with Orthodox Serb neighbours have been reported since the breakup of Yugoslavia more than three decades ago.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 16:25:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FEVJZCW37JJJNMWD32WEUJ5XFQ.jpg?auth=1772138bc2770d7e5d318085bfa1519b72a13ff458e94dbebe5e917c03bfb0be&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US pursuing third vessel near Venezuela, officials say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251221-us-pursuing-third-vessel-near-venezuela-officials-say</link><description>The US Coast Guard is pursuing an oil ⁠tanker in international waters near Venezuela, officials told Reuters on Sunday, in what would be the second such operation this weekend and the third in less than ​a week.

The officials, who were speaking on the condition of anonymity, did not give a specific ​location for the operation. The White House did not immediately ​respond to a request for comment on Sunday.

US President Donald Trump last week announced a "blockade" of all oil tankers under sanctions entering and leaving Venezuela.

Trump's pressure campaign on Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean ‍Sea near the South American nation. At least 100 people have been killed in the attacks.

The ​White House's National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett said on Sunday that the first two oil tankers seized were operating on the black market ‌and providing oil to sanctioned countries.

"And so I don't think that people need to be worried here in the US ‍that the prices are going to go up because of these seizures of these ships," Hassett said. "There's just a couple of them, and they were black market ships."

But one oil trader told Reuters that the seizures raise geopolitical risks and probably will push oil prices higher when Asian trading resumes on Monday. On the ‍other hand, expectations of an end to the war in Ukraine could help keep ‌oil's price gains ​in check, the trader said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 16:27:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0cbef9c0-de81-11f0-9d9f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-21T004255Z-1542631356-RC2GKIAIHV2M-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-MILITARY-VESSEL.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Third 'Avatar' film lights up global box offices</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/third-avatar-film-lights-up-box-offices-with-345-million-opening-2025-12-21/</link><description>Dec 21 (Reuters) - Director James Cameron's third "Avatar" movie adventure racked up roughly $345 million in global box office sales over its opening weekend, distributor Walt Disney (DIS.N) , opens new tab said on Sunday.

The estimated sales for "Avatar: Fire and Ash" landed in line with pre-weekend forecasts of at least $340 million.

U.S. and Canadian box offices accounted for $88 million of the total, Disney said.

Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington voice the lead characters in the "Avatar" series, the story of a clan of 9-foot-tall blue people known as Na'vi who are forced to fight to protect their family and their planet.

The first "Avatar" film, released in 2009, leads all-time box office charts with $2.9 billion in global ticket sales.

The decision taken by the security cabinet brings the total number of settlements approved over the past three years to 69, according to a statement from the office of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich.

The latest approvals come days after the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank – all of which are illegal under international law – had reached its highest level since at least 2017.

"The proposal by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz to declare and formalise 19 new settlements in Judea and Samaria has been approved by the cabinet," the statement said, using the Israeli biblical term for the West Bank, without specifying when the decision was made.

The final approval came from the security cabinet, which is part of the overall right-wing government.

Smotrich is a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself.

"On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state," he said in the statement.

"We will continue to develop, build and settle the land of our ancestral heritage, with faith in the justice of our path."

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recently condemned what he described as Israel's "relentless" expansion of settlements in the occupied territory.

It "continues to fuel tensions, impede access by Palestinians to their land and threaten the viability of a fully independent, democratic, contiguous and sovereign Palestinian State", Guterres said earlier this month.

Since the start of the war in Gaza, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have proliferated, with several European countries, Canada and Australia recently moving to formally recognise such a state, drawing rebukes from Israel.

A UN report said the expansion of settlements was at its highest point since 2017, when the United Nations began tracking such data.

"These figures represent a sharp increase compared to previous years," Guterres said, noting an average of 12,815 housing units were added annually between 2017 and 2022.

"These developments are further entrenching the unlawful Israeli occupation and violating international law and undermining the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination."

Excluding East Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank , along with about three million Palestinian residents.

Smotrich's office said the 19 newly approved settlements are located in what it described as "highly strategic" areas, adding that two of them – Ganim and Kadim in the northern West Bank – would be re-established after being dismantled two decades ago.

Five of the 19 settlements already existed but had not previously been granted legal status under Israeli law, the statement said.

While all Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory are illegal under international law, some wildcat outposts are also illegal under Israeli law.

Many of these, however, are later legalised by Israeli authorities, fuelling fears about the possible annexation of the territory.

US President Donald Trump has warned Israel against annexing the West Bank.

"Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened," Trump said in a recent interview with Time magazine.

Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, where violence has surged since the Gaza war erupted in October 2023 following Hamas's attack on Israel.

Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 1,027 Palestinians in the West Bank – both militants and civilians – since the start of the fighting in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures.

At least 44 Israelis have been killed in the West Bank in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations during the same period, according to Israeli data.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 17:42:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bb020334-de8f-11f0-a89f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-10T163258Z-1418150915-RC2W6GAPZ6IA-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-SETTLEMENT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Austrian painter Arnulf Rainer dies at 96</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/austrian-painter-arnulf-rainer-dies-96-2025-12-21/</link><description>Dec 21 (Reuters) - Austrian artist Arnulf Rainer has died at the age of 96, Austrian news agency APA reported on Sunday.

Both painter and graphic artist, Rainer was initially drawn to surrealism, but from the 1950s he became renowned for what he called "overpainting" - painting over existing works or pictures, frequently images of himself or those created by him.

"The two leaders began by reflecting on the war in Ukraine," Starmer's office said in a readout of the call, adding they had discussed the work of the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" countries that have pledged to support Ukraine.

"The Prime Minister updated on work by the Coalition of the Willing to support any peace deal and ensure a just and lasting end to the hostilities."

U.S. negotiators met Russian officials in Florida on Saturday for the latest talks aimed at ending the conflict, as Trump's administration tries to coax an agreement out of both sides.

The Miami meeting followed U.S. talks on Friday with Ukrainian and European officials, the latest discussions of a peace plan that has sparked some hope of a resolution to the conflict that began when Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.

The Downing Street readout also said that Starmer and Trump discussed the appointment of Christian Turner as ambassador to the United States after his predecessor Peter Mandelson was fired when supportive emails he sent to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein came to light.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 18:51:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WQOE4P422VMTRBPROO4GABJIDI.jpg?auth=18ae2f1f164afccb03a016209f7c016a1501cf47fa76e1b63f4e8faee0ef065b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More abducted Nigerian students have been rescued, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/more-abducted-nigerian-students-have-been-rescued-police-say-2025-12-21/</link><description>YENAGOA, Nigeria, Dec 21 (Reuters) - More Nigerian children abducted last month from a Catholic school in Niger state have been released, state police said on Sunday, following one of the country's biggest mass kidnappings of recent years.

"I can confirm that they have been released, but we will only do the head count tomorrow to ascertain the number of those released," Wasiu Abiodun, Niger state police command told Reuters.

It was also not immediately clear how the pupils were freed.

Earlier on Sunday, ARISE news channel quoted Nigerian officials as saying that 130 pupils had been released.

"Authorities say the successful release of all the victims followed sustained security pressure and coordinated efforts, as calls intensify for stronger protection of schools and decisive action to prevent a repeat of such attacks," ARISE said.

The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has previously said that gunmen seized more than 300 pupils and 12 staff from St Mary's Catholic School in Papiri village on November 21.

Fifty of the children managed to escape, CAN said, while Nigeria's government said on December 8 that it had managed to rescue 100 of those abducted.

The abduction caused outrage over worsening insecurity in northern Nigeria, where armed gangs frequently target schools for ransom. School kidnappings surged after Boko Haram militants abducted 276 girls from Chibok in 2014.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 20:22:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NZU6IEN7RZJ3POP7YD2G6VHHLY.jpg?auth=c8e2c3d0c06c26ba9f65f1bed0ef761e475815634d2939351b8bf2c99e6b0a74&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff calls Ukraine talks productive</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-envoy-witkoff-calls-ukraine-talks-productive-2025-12-21/</link><description>WEST PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Talks held between U.S., European and Ukrainian officials over the last three days in Florida aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine were productive and focused on aligning positions, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday.

U.S. President Donald Trump has been pressuring Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the nearly four-year-old conflict as soon as possible, but Russia wants to keep the Ukrainian areas it has seized and Kyiv has refused to cede ground.

After meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev on Saturday, Witkoff and Trump adviser Jared Kushner met on Sunday with officials from Ukraine and Europe, and then separately with the Ukrainian delegation, led by senior official Rustem Umerov.

Witkoff, in a social media post, called Sunday's talks "productive and constructive" and focused on a "shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe."

He did not mention his talks with the Russians.

The meetings in Miami were the latest in a series of talks between the U.S., Russia and Ukraine on a U.S.-drafted 20-point plan to end the war.

Witkoff said the U.S.-Ukraine meeting focused on four key points: further development of the 20-point plan, a multilateral security guarantee framework, a U.S. security guarantee framework for Ukraine, and further development on economics and prosperity to rebuild Ukraine.

Negotiators focused especially on "timelines" and "sequencing of next steps," Witkoff said.

U.S., Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week reported progress on security guarantees for Kyiv as part of the talks to end the war, but it remains unclear if those terms will be acceptable to Moscow.

"Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future," Witkoff said.

Prior to the Miami meeting, U.S. intelligence continued to indicate Putin has not abandoned his ambitions of taking over Ukrainian territory, according to six people familiar with the intelligence.

In response to a Reuters report on Friday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on X that U.S. intelligence assessments have shown Russia “does not currently have the capability to conquer and occupy all of Ukraine, let alone Europe.”

Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump's, said on NBC's "Meet The Press" on Sunday it was still unclear if Putin would accept the current deal.

If he does not, Graham said, the Trump administration should adopt an approach similar to its recent actions with oil tankers near Venezuela and "seize ships that are carrying sanctioned Russian oil.”

A Russian refusal to accept the current proposal should also lead to labeling “Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for kidnapping 20,000 Ukrainian kids,” Graham said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 21:18:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V6L4EK6BKZKEVMVN7WV7E54CDY.jpg?auth=3491dec78a2960893163717ab8eaf85adadbfd0a5ac136f9d6f2a52732b7f9aa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff calls Ukraine talks in Miami 'productive'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251221-us-envoy-witkoff-calls-ukraine-talks-in-miami-productive</link><description>Talks held between US, European and Ukrainian officials over the last three days in Florida aimed at ending Russia 's war in Ukraine were productive and focused on aligning positions, US special envoy ​Steve Witkoff said on Sunday.

Witkoff, in a social media post, called Sunday's talks "productive and constructive" and focused on a "shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe ."

He did not mention his talks with the Russians. The meetings in Miami were the latest in a series of talks between the US, Russia and Ukraine on a US-drafted 20-point plan to end the war.

Witkoff said the US-Ukraine meeting focused on four key points: ‍further development of the 20-point plan, a multilateral security guarantee framework, a US security guarantee framework for Ukraine, and further development on economics and prosperity to rebuild Ukraine.

Negotiators ​focused especially on "timelines" and "sequencing of next steps," Witkoff said.

US, Ukrainian and European officials earlier this week reported progress on security guarantees for Kyiv as part of the talks to end the war, but it remains unclear if those terms ‌will be acceptable to Moscow .

"Peace must be not only a cessation of hostilities, but also a dignified foundation for a stable future," Witkoff said.

Prior to the Miami meeting, US intelligence continued to ‍indicate Putin has not abandoned his ambitions of taking over Ukrainian territory, according to six people familiar with the intelligence.

In response to a Reuters report on Friday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on X that US intelligence assessments have shown Russia “does not currently have the capability to conquer and occupy all of Ukraine, let alone Europe.”

Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close ally of Trump's, said on NBC's "Meet The Press" on Sunday it was still unclear if Putin would accept the current deal.

If he does not, ‍Graham said, the Trump administration should adopt an approach similar to its recent actions with oil tankers near Venezuela and "seize ships that are carrying sanctioned ‌Russian oil.”

A Russian refusal ​to accept the current proposal should also lead to labeling “Russia a state sponsor of terrorism for kidnapping 20,000 Ukrainian kids,” Graham said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 21:42:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4bbed6c-de4b-11f0-8985-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25338510718407.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ASEAN to seek resolution to Thailand-Cambodia conflict with Malaysia meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/asean-seek-resolution-thailand-cambodia-conflict-with-malaysia-meeting-2025-12-21/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Southeast Asian foreign ministers meet in Malaysia on Monday, seeking to end border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia that have killed at least 40 people and displaced more than half a million this month.

The ministers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will seek to revive a short-lived ceasefire brokered by Malaysia, this year's ASEAN chair, and U.S. President Donald Trump.

ASEAN members Thailand and Cambodia are scheduled to attend the gathering in Kuala Lumpur, the first face-to-face meeting between the governments since the fighting resumed on December 8.

Bangkok and Phnom Penh each accuse the other of moves that led to the breakdown of the July ceasefire and a wider October peace deal. Heavy exchanges of fire have occurred in many of the long-disputed areas along their 817-km (508-mile) land border, from forested inland areas near Laos to coastal provinces.

In addition to the regional push for peace, the U.S. and China have pursued separate diplomatic efforts to end the conflict, with no signs of success so far.

The ASEAN meeting, chaired by Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan, will consider steps ASEAN could take to help de-escalate the situation and end the fighting, Malaysia’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Sunday.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim expressed hope that the meeting would enable Thailand and Cambodia to negotiate openly, resolve differences and achieve a fair and lasting solution.

"I emphasised the importance for Cambodia and Thailand to uphold the spirit of dialogue, wisdom and mutual respect in order to end the tensions and maintain peace and stability in this region," Anwar said on X on Sunday, adding that he had spoken with both prime ministers.

He told reporters last week he was "cautiously optimistic" about the outcome of the meeting, adding that Thai caretaker Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian premier Hun Manet were both "keen to achieve an amicable resolution as soon as possible".

An ASEAN team will present findings to the foreign ministers from its field observations and data captured by satellite-monitoring technology provided by the U.S., Anwar posted on social media.

Thailand has carried out airstrikes on Cambodian military positions and halted fuel shipments through a Laotian border checkpoint due to fears they were being diverted to Cambodia.

The Thai army said Cambodia had been using drones to drop bombs on Thai bases and firing rockets at civilian areas.</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Dec 2025 23:19:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S65AOWTU6NKL3H6LQO6AQ72OBY.jpg?auth=23bd5cf6bc2865347790121f9fe764fe42106acccd35846fa09f7983d55e4f89&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan prepares to restart world's biggest nuclear plant, 15 years after Fukushima</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/japan-prepares-restart-worlds-biggest-nuclear-plant-15-years-after-fukushima-2025-12-21/</link><description>NIIGATA, Japan, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Japanese region of Niigata is expected to endorse a decision to restart the world's largest nuclear power plant on Monday, a watershed moment in the country's pivot back to nuclear since the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, located about 220 km (136 miles) northwest of Tokyo, was among 54 reactors shut after a massive earthquake and tsunami crippled the Fukushima Daiichi plant in the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl.

Since then, Japan has restarted 14 of the 33 that remain operable, as it tries to wean itself off imported fossil fuels. Kashiwazaki-Kariwa will be the first operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) (9501.T) , opens new tab , which ran the doomed Fukushima plant.

"We remain firmly committed to never repeating such an accident and ensuring Niigata residents never experience anything similar," said TEPCO spokesperson Masakatsu Takata.

If approved, TEPCO is considering reactivating the first of seven reactors at the plant on January 20, public broadcaster NHK reported. Takata declined to comment on timing.

TEPCO earlier this year pledged to inject 100 billion yen ($641 million) into the prefecture over the next 10 years as it sought to win the support of Niigata residents.

But many locals remain wary.

A survey published by the prefecture in October found 60% of residents did not think conditions for the restart had been met. Nearly 70% were worried about TEPCO operating the plant.

Ayako Oga, 52, settled in Niigata after fleeing the area around the Fukushima plant in 2011 with 160,000 other evacuees. Her old home was inside the 20 km irradiated exclusion zone.

The farmer and anti-nuclear activist has now joined protests against what she sees as a new threat on her doorstep.

"We know firsthand the risk of a nuclear accident and cannot dismiss it," said Oga, adding that she still struggles with post-traumatic stress-like symptoms from what happened at Fukushima.

Even Niigata Governor Hideyo Hanazumi, who backed the restart last month, hopes that Japan will eventually be able to reduce its reliance on nuclear power. "I want to see an era where we don't have to rely on energy sources that cause anxiety," he said.

On Monday, the prefecture's assembly will cast a vote of confidence on Hanazumi, a de facto ballot on his support for the restart.

The vote is seen as the final hurdle before TEPCO restarts the first reactor, which alone could boost electricity supply to the Tokyo area by 2%, Japan's trade ministry has estimated.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who took office two months ago, has backed nuclear restarts to strengthen energy security and to counter the cost of imported fossil fuels, which account for 60% to 70% of Japan's electricity generation.

Japan spent 10.7 trillion yen ($68 billion) last year on imported liquefied natural gas and coal, a tenth of its total import costs.

Despite its shrinking population, Japan expects energy demand to rise over the coming decade due to a boom in power-hungry AI data centres.

To meet those needs, and its decarbonisation commitments, it has set a target of doubling the share of nuclear power in its electricity mix to 20% by 2040.

Joshua Ngu, vice chairman for Asia Pacific at consultancy Wood Mackenzie, said public acceptance of the restart of Kashiwazaki-Kariwa, would represent "a critical milestone" towards reaching those goals.

In July, Kansai Electric Power (9503.T) , opens new tab , Japan's top nuclear power operator, said it would begin conducting surveys for a reactor in western Japan, the first new unit since the Fukushima disaster.

But for Oga, who will join protests outside the Niigata assembly as lawmakers cast their vote on Monday, the nuclear revival is a terrifying reminder of the potential risks.

"Every news update about the restart — it's like reliving the fear," she said.

The state parliament was recalled for two days from Monday to debate the firearm legislation, which would cap the number of firearms a person can own at four, or up to 10 for certain groups, such as farmers.

There is currently no limit to firearm ownership if the reason can be justified to police, and there are more than 50 people in the state who own more than 100 guns, the Australian Broadcasting Corp said in a report, citing police data.

One of the alleged Bondi gunmen, Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police and owned six firearms. His 24-year-old son Naveed Akram has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism, according to police.

Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured in the mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach on December 14. The attack has shocked the nation and sparked calls for tougher gun laws and heightened efforts to stop antisemitism.

The proposed legislation would also give police more powers to remove face coverings during protests or rallies. The state government has vowed to ban the chant "globalise the intifada" which it says encourages violence in the community.

Jewish leaders on Sunday called for a royal commission, the most powerful type of Australian government inquiry, to be set up to investigate the attack at Bondi.

The opposition Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley backed those calls on Monday, and told a news conference that she has called on Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to meet with her to review the terms of reference for a royal commission.

Albanese has faced mounting criticism from opponents who argue his government has not done enough to curb a rise in antisemitism. He was booed by sections of the crowd during a memorial event in Bondi attended by tens of thousands of people on Sunday, one week after the shooting.

Albanese's government has said it has consistently denounced antisemitism and highlighted legislation passed over the last two years to criminalise hate speech and doxxing. It also expelled Iran's ambassador earlier this year after accusing Tehran of directing antisemitic attacks in Sydney and Melbourne.

"You've seen us crack down on hate speech. You've seen us criminalise doxxing. You've seen us be very clear about counterterrorism laws banning Nazi salutes and so forth," Foreign Minister Penny Wong told ABC Radio on Monday.

A poll conducted for the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper among 1,010 voters released on Monday found Albanese's approval rating slumped 15 points to -9 from +6 at the beginning of December, the lowest since his resounding election win in May.

Authorities on Monday started clearing flowers, candles, letters and other items placed by the public at Bondi Beach.

The tributes would be preserved for display at the Sydney Jewish Museum and the Australian Jewish Historical Society, authorities said.

Thirteen people remain in hospital, including four in critical but stable condition, health officials said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 01:48:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PSEQQJAOKBNLLKFLX5Y5TIDSMQ.jpg?auth=b925596afcd6a9326626fbcd7b554b8e286f7625b089123ec09b35789fd13c50&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia's ex-PM Najib to face two key court rulings in 1MDB saga</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysias-ex-pm-najib-face-two-key-court-rulings-1mdb-saga-2025-12-22/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Malaysia's former prime minister Najib Razak, jailed for corruption in the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal , will learn on Monday if he can serve the remainder of his sentence at home in the first of two rulings this week that will test current premier Anwar Ibrahim's campaign against graft.

Najib, who has been in prison since 2022, had his 12-year jail sentence halved last year by a pardons board chaired by the country's former king.

But he insists the monarch also issued an "addendum order" that converts his sentence to house arrest, and he has been seeking to compel the government to confirm the document's existence and enforce its contents.

Government officials for months denied knowledge of its existence, though the former king's office and a federal lawyer this year confirmed the royal document had been issued.

The Kuala Lumpur High Court will rule on the bid on Monday, four days before delivering its verdict in the biggest trial facing Najib over the scandal at 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund he co-founded in 2009.

Any decision in favour of Najib could prove unpopular with the public, especially supporters of Anwar, who came to power in 2022 on an anti-corruption platform, analysts said.

"It's a test of the prosecution, it's a test of the judiciary, it's a test of political will," said Bridget Welsh of the University of Nottingham Asia.

Anwar has faced repeated questions about his commitment to reform as prosecutors dropped several charges against Najib. This month, prosecutors also abandoned an appeal against the acquittal of Najib's wife Rosmah Mansor in a separate graft case.

Anwar has said he does not interfere in court cases, though the country's attorney generals are appointed by the prime minister and their independence has often been questioned.

Malaysian and U.S. investigators say at least $4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB between 2009 and 2014, and that more than $1 billion made its way into bank accounts linked to Najib.

He was found guilty of graft and money laundering in 2020 after receiving funds from a 1MDB unit. Two years later, he became the first Malaysian prime minister to go to prison after losing all his appeals.

Voted out in 2018, Najib last year apologised for mishandling the scandal during his time in office, but he has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying he was misled about the source of the funds by fugitive financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials.

On December 26, the court will also decide whether to convict Najib of four additional charges of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering involving the illegal transfer of about 2.2 billion ringgit ($538.69 million) from 1MDB.

If found guilty, he could face a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.

Najib's lawyer, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, said last week that the house arrest decision would not have any bearing on the 1MDB trial, though he hoped both would go his client's way.

"We hope Monday is a good decision for us, and we hope that (December) the 26th likewise will be a good decision for us," he told reporters.

Lee's office has said it expects to complete the move to the Blue House mansion by around Christmas.

The presidential residence, however, is not moving at the same time as parts of the Blue House are undergoing an inspection due to damage that occurred during the last administration, and measures will be announced later, the office said on Monday.

Lee, who won a snap election in June, pledged during his campaign to eventually move the presidential office to Sejong city, south of Seoul, where several government ministries are located, to help boost local economies outside the capital.

The presidential office did not say on Monday what will happen to the compound Lee is leaving.

Former leader Yoon, who was removed from office in April after briefly declaring martial law, broke with decades of tradition by shifting his office and residence out of the Blue House.

Soon after taking office in 2022, Yoon moved the presidential office to a cluster of former defence ministry buildings in another area of central Seoul, defying security concerns and spending about $40 million , opens new tab on the move.

The move whipped up a debate among experts on feng shui, a practice that originated in ancient China to ensure harmony between people and their environment, after some political rivals accused Yoon of being influenced by those who said the Blue House location was inauspicious.

After Yoon moved out, the Blue House was opened to the public and more than 8 million people had visited by mid-June this year.

The Blue House, or "Cheong Wa Dae" in Korean, is named after the blue tiles that cover the top of the main building and is nestled in a scenic spot in front of the Bugaksan mountain.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 01:49:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4TQ3IAV7AVPK7OHVHNEUZSYMZU.jpg?auth=8069197257457ae9c7a1dc80d0d194628dbd4a7e50f12bb3b3044fa3fe2ea4bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's ruling Socialists suffer historic defeat in regional election</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251222-spain-ruling-socialists-suffer-historic-defeat-in-regional-elections-far-right</link><description>Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez 's scandal-hit Socialists endured a crushing defeat in a regional election in Extremadura on Sunday, which saw far-right Vox make big gains.

The Socialists, who lead the minority national coalition, have been rocked by corruption and sexual misconduct allegations and the vote in the rural southwestern region was seen as an indicator of the party's wider prospects.

They won just 18 seats in the 65-seat assembly down from 28, their worst-ever regional result in Extremadura.

The Socialists had governed the region for decades but the conservative Popular Party (PP) took control with Vox's support in 2023.

The PP called the vote hoping to get a majority and although they came out on top again on Sunday with 29 seats, they fell short.

The result means the PP will once again rely on Vox, which went from five to 11 seats, to pass legislation.

Regional governments in Spain control key policy areas such as education, healthcare, infrastructure, and culture.

It was the first regional election since a court ordered Jose Luis Abalos, a former top aide to Sanchez, to stand trial over claims he took kickbacks related to the awarding of public contracts.

The prime minister's wife, Begona Gomez, and younger brother, David are also facing graft allegations.

David Sanchez is set to go on trial for influence peddling in May along with 10 other defendants including the Socialist candidate to head Extremadura's government, Miguel Angel Gallardo -- who called Sunday's election results "really bad".

The Socialists have also come under fire in recent weeks for allegedly failing to address sexual harassment by senior male officials.

Sunday's vote will be followed by regional elections in Andalusia, Aragon, and Castile and Leon during the first half of 2026.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 01:50:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2e83d910-cc23-11f0-acf6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Sanchez-parlement.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON 2025: Day 1 roundup</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251221-afcon-2025-day-1-roundup</link><description>Produced by Emily Boyle, Elom Toble and Guillaume Gougeon</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 01:50:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5b87bdca-debe-11f0-a182-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1839821082694877e077e909-25184420.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drone attack damages two vessels in Russia's Krasnodar, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drone-attack-damages-two-vessels-russias-krasnodar-officials-say-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian drone attack damaged two vessels, two piers and sparked a fire in a village on the Black Sea coast in Russia’s Krasnodar region, regional authorities said on Monday.

All crew on the ships at the Volna terminal on the Black Sea have been safely evacuated, the Krasnodar region’s operational headquarters said on the Telegram messaging app.

The damage led to a fire spreading up to 1,500 square metres (1,794 square yards), said authorities. By 0200 GMT the fire was still raging.

Ukraine has often struck the Krasnodar region with drones, targeting refineries, fuel depots, ports and airfields. The Black Sea region is vital for Russia’s energy exports and military logistics, bordering Crimea and lying within drone range of southern Ukraine.

The village of Volna is close to the Crimean bridge over the Kerch Strait, a major artery for Russian forces , as it links the mainland to the Crimean peninsula that was annexed in 2014 from Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:43:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea parliament passes bill to launch probe into 2024 Jeju Air crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-parliament-passes-bill-launch-probe-into-2024-jeju-air-crash-2025-12-22/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 22 (Reuters) - South Korea's parliament passed a bill on Monday to launch an independent probe into the Jeju Air plane crash in December 2024 that killed 179 people in the deadliest air disaster on the country's soil.

A panel made up of 18 members of parliament will investigate the possible causes of the crash, including whether enough was done against the risk of a bird strike, any engine or mechanical failures and an embankment that the plane struck at the end of the runway.

The inquiry will also investigate whether government agencies tried to cover up or downplay anything that was found during the official investigation, according to the bill.

A Jeju Air Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 made a belly-landing at Muan airport without its landing gear down after an aborted landing, overshot the runway and slammed into an embankment, killing all but two of the 181 people on board as it erupted in a fireball.

An investigation by the government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board had yet to produce a final report. It said in an interim report in January that the aircraft's two engines sustained bird strikes.

In an update seen by Reuters in July, the board found the left engine had been shut down even though it sustained less damage than the right and could have kept the aircraft flying.

The embankment at the end of the runway that supported airport navigation equipment was found to be not in line with global standards that call for such a structure to be set up in a way that would easily give way in case of impact, experts say.

Most air accidents are caused by multiple factors and experts caution against putting too much weight on incomplete evidence.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:45:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HABOSBR3XFMA5E62NZPCLKFCIA.jpg?auth=01f70a736f23fa4a786f6a959b9b7d416e90b0bedb5d148f68ecd5c544642f5c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia court dismisses ex-PM's bid to serve sentence under house arrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-court-dismisses-ex-pms-bid-serve-sentence-under-house-arrest-2025-12-22/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 22 (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Monday dismissed jailed ex-premier Najib Razak's bid to serve the remainder of his sentence at home, saying a royal document allowing the move was invalid as it was not made according to procedure.

CBS removed a link to the "Inside CECOT" segment page on Sunday. The page, which previously featured a trailer, now displays "The page cannot be found" message. However, a description on its Paramount Plus website earlier said the segment was scheduled to air at 7:30 p.m. ET Sunday, with correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaking to recently released deportees about the "brutal and torturous" conditions they had endured in the prison.

The decision comes even as the network goes through changes under Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss , who was picked to lead CBS News in October after CBS parent company Paramount Skydance (PSKY.O) , opens new tab acquired the online publication she founded, The Free Press.

Weiss, a former New York Times and Wall Street Journal opinion writer, was considered a controversial choice as she had never managed a television newsroom or produced broadcast news content before. On December 10 she named Tony Dokoupil as the new anchor of its flagship "CBS Evening News" segment, replacing the dual anchor team of John Dickerson and Maurice DuBois.

CECOT is a mega-prison in El Salvador where the U.S. has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial. It has been condemned by human rights groups for its harsh conditions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B2OY6LWQMBOHJI4OFO6LZSZDVU.jpg?auth=c833dee57da754bc4742598e14f729b516af95ea254174c4f547c5b80fffb0d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea parliament passes bill to launch probe into 2024 Jeju Air crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-parliament-passes-bill-launch-probe-into-2024-jeju-air-crash-2025-12-22/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:45:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Malaysia court dismisses ex-PM's bid to serve sentence under house arrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-court-dismisses-ex-pms-bid-serve-sentence-under-house-arrest-2025-12-22/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:45:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump names Louisiana governor Landry as Greenland special envoy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-louisiana-governor-greenland-special-envoy-2025-12-22/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:45:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>CBS postpones '60 Minutes' report on El Salvador's CECOT prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/cbs-postpones-60-minutes-report-el-salvadors-cecot-prison-2025-12-22/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:46:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Nigeria says 130 abducted schoolchildren freed after mass kidnapping</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251222-nigeria-says-130-abducted-schoolchildren-freed-after-mass-kidnapping</link><description>Nigerian authorities have secured the release of 130 kidnapped schoolchildren taken by gunmen from a Catholic school in November, a presidential spokesman said Sunday, after 100 were freed earlier this month.

"Another 130 abducted Niger state pupils released, none left in captivity," Sunday Dare said in a post on X.

In late November, hundreds of students and staff were kidnapped from St Mary's co-educational boarding school in north-central Niger state.

The attack came as the country buckled under a wave of mass abductions reminiscent of the infamous 2014 Boko Haram kidnapping of schoolgirls in the town of Chibok.

The west African country suffers from multiple interlinked security concerns, from jihadists in the northeast to armed "bandit" gangs in the northwest.

The exact number taken from St Mary's has been unclear throughout the ordeal.

Initially, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) said 315 students and staff were unaccounted for after the attack in the rural hamlet of Papiri.

Around 50 of them escaped immediately afterwards, and on December 7 the government secured the release of around 100.

That would leave about 165 thought to be still in captivity before Sunday's announcement that 130 were rescued.

But a UN source told AFP that all those taken appeared to have been released -- as dozens thought to have been kidnapped had in fact managed to run off during the attack, and make their way home.

The accounting has been complicated because the children's homes are scattered across swathes of rural Nigeria, sometimes requiring three or four hours of travel by motorbike to reach their remote villages, the source said.

The source told AFP that "the remaining set of girls/secondary school students will be taken to Minna", the capital of Niger state, on Monday.

"We'll have to still do final verification," Daniel Atori, a spokesman for CAN in Niger state, told AFP.

He added that Niger state Governor Mohammed Umaru Bago had called the bishop of the Kontagora diocese, which runs the school, "to confirm the release of the children and teachers", though "the figure was not mentioned".

It has not been made public who seized the children from their boarding school, or how the government secured their release.

Analysts have said that based on past rescues, it was likely the authorities paid a ransom, which is technically prohibited by law.

Kidnappings for ransom are a common way for criminals and armed groups to make quick cash in Nigeria.

But a spate of mass abductions in November put an uncomfortable spotlight on the country's already grim security situation.

Assailants kidnapped two dozen Muslim schoolgirls, 38 church worshippers and a bride and her bridesmaids -- with farmers, women and children also taken hostage.

The kidnappings came as Nigeria faces a diplomatic offensive from the United States, where President Donald Trump has alleged that there were mass killings of Christians that amounted to a "genocide" and threatened military intervention.

Nigeria's government and independent analysts reject that framing, which has long been used by the Christian right in the United States and Europe.

One of the first mass kidnappings that drew international attention was in 2014, when nearly 300 girls were snatched from their boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok by Boko Haram jihadists.

A decade later, Nigeria's kidnap-for-ransom crisis has "consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry" that raised some $1.66 million between July 2024 and June 2025, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based consultancy.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 03:46:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d5c68dac-deda-11f0-bc6f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25355780794630.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's top leadership talks heat up as Communist Party meets</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-top-leadership-talks-heat-up-communist-party-meets-2025-12-22/</link><description>HANOI, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Senior officials of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party began a two-day meeting on Monday that is set to select candidates for the country's leadership positions for the next five years.

The gathering precedes the five-yearly party congress , scheduled on January 19-25, which will formally nominate leaders and set key policy and economic targets for the remainder of the decade.

Party chief To Lam opened the meeting saying the plenum of the party's central committee is tasked with finalising the selection of state and party leaders, according to his speech published on the government portal.

"I propose that you all focus your intellect and responsibility to select personnel to be nominated for the 14th Party Congress in a straightforward, objective and impartial manner," Lam told the roughly 200 party members attending the meeting.

The names of candidates shortlisted in previous party meetings have not been disclosed. The party said in its portal the meeting will conclude on Tuesday but authorities did not say whether the plenum's decisions will be made public after its conclusion.

Lam, 68, is seeking a second term as party chief, the country's most powerful job which he assumed in August last year after his predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong died .

The sweeping administrative and economic reforms that Lam introduced during his roughly 18 months at the helm have earned him admirers but also stirred discontent.

Alongside the party chief, delegates will also select candidates for the other four "pillars" of the state: president, prime minister, chairman of the parliament, and the standing member of the party's secretariat.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 04:41:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B5OGMUSQZBIRXLNAVXBKAE2R5M.jpg?auth=b9163eba78ee5328c680f48e6f6af7ea5f3ba2c70b22765fc8c53e10c7ff5a18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gold prices hit record high on US interest rate-cut bets</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251222-gold-prices-hit-record-high-on-fed-rate-cut-bets-usa-economy</link><description>Gold prices surged to a record high on Monday, riding on growing expectations of further US interest rate cuts and strong safe-haven demand, with silver also joining the rally to hit an all-time peak.

Spot gold XAU= rose 1.2% to a record $4,391.92 an ounce, while spot silver XAG= climbed 2.7% by 0344 GMT to hit a historic high of $69.23.

Bullion has gained 67% so far this year, shattering multiple records and breaching the $3,000 and $4,000 per-ounce milestones for the first time. It is poised for its biggest annual gain since 1979.

Silver has surged 138% year-to-date, vastly outperforming gold, underpinned by robust investment inflows and persistent supply constraints.

"With December usually producing positive returns for gold and silver, seasonality is on their side," said StoneX senior analyst Matt Simpson.

"Given that gold has already risen 4% this month and we're nearing the end of the year, bulls may want to tread with caution as volumes are to deplete and odds of profit-taking are also likely on the rise."

Traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset, gold has been supported by heightened geopolitical and trade tensions, steady central bank buying and expectations of lower interest rates next year.

A softer dollar has provided an additional tailwind by making the metal cheaper for overseas buyers.

Markets are currently pricing in two US rate cuts for next year despite the Federal Reserve signalling caution. Non-yielding assets such as gold tend to benefit in lower interest rate environments. FEDWATCH

Simpson said two Fed rate cuts were pencilled in for 2026, with a faster US jobs slowdown and a shift to a more dovish Fed likely to add further upside to gold.

Four residents of the low-lying Indonesian island of Pari, which has been repeatedly flooded as warmer temperatures push up sea levels, submitted a legal complaint in January 2023 to the cantonal court in Zug, Switzerland.

Non-profit Swiss Church Aid (HEKS/EPER), which is backing the Pari case, said the court had decided to admit the complaint. In a statement, Holcim acknowledged the court had admitted the case, and said it intends to appeal.

The court was not immediately available for comment.

According to Swiss Church Aid, the case marks the first time a court has admitted climate litigation brought against a large corporation in Switzerland.

Holcim said it is fully committed to reaching net zero by 2050 and is following a rigorous, science-based approach to achieve that goal. The company also says it has reduced direct CO2 emissions from its operations by more than 50% since 2015.

The plaintiffs are seeking compensation from Holcim for climate damage they have suffered, financial participation in flood protection measures and a rapid cut in CO2 emissions.

Cement production accounts for about 7% of global CO2 emissions, the Global Cement and Concrete Association says.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:25:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HJNL64EYQRMQZCWZNCZVT2GJ5U.jpg?auth=0ff2de3726c4f7a4fe8395cdcaa6fc213bd38452bf25eac85b1e5323bedee8f8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: How a five-yearly Communist Party congress will pick Vietnam's next leaders​</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-five-yearly-communist-party-congress-will-pick-vietnams-next-leaders-2025-12-22/</link><description>HANOI, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Vietnam's ruling Communist Party will convene its 14th five-yearly congress on January 19-25 to select top leaders and set key targets until 2030.

About 1,600 delegates, representing more than 5 million party members, will name around 200 officials to the Central Committee, which then picks the 17-19 members of the Politburo, the party's most powerful body, from which the general secretary is chosen.

Key candidates are expected to be shortlisted by the party in meetings preceding the congress .

Parliamentary elections will follow in March-May, with lawmakers expected to endorse the party's choices for the top state roles: president, prime minister, chairman of the parliament, ministers and the head of the central bank.

The party chief has in recent years gained more powers, making that position the country's most powerful job.

Current party chief To Lam , 68, assumed the role after the death of long-serving leader Nguyen Phu Trong in July 2024.

In his brief term, Lam, who is seeking a second term, launched sweeping reforms, tightened security and expanded the powers of the police ministry, which he had run for about a decade.

Vietnam’s leadership operates through collective decision-making, ensuring stability in economic and foreign policy since the Doi Moi reforms of the late 1980s, which transformed the war-torn, impoverished nation into one of Asia’s fastest-growing economies.

Foreign policy has centred on balancing ties with major powers - China, the U.S. and Russia - under the so-called “Bamboo Diplomacy”, a term coined by Trong. Lam has dropped the phrase but kept the approach, which is expected to remain unchanged barring major geopolitical shifts.

In the economic sphere, Lam has favoured promoting private enterprise through "national champions" under the guidance of the state.

The developing country wants to reduce its reliance on overseas investment, which dominates its export-driven economy, but remains keen to attract advanced technology and capital to achieve its goal of becoming a high-income country by 2045.

Economic growth underpins the party’s legitimacy.

Despite global trade uncertainty, Vietnam targets annual gross domestic product growth of at least 10% in the 2026-2030 period, according to a draft policy report , which usually reflects economic targets included in a resolution at the end of the congress - far above the missed 6.5% to 7% goal for 2021-2025.

Facing unprecedented high tariffs on U.S. imports of Vietnamese goods, which may affect revenues from its largest foreign market, Vietnam is seeking to develop a new growth model where the private economy is the "driving force" but the state retains a "leading role", according to the party report.

As part of the strategy, public spending to fund infrastructure and development projects will rise, with a projected budget deficit of about 5% of GDP in the next five-year period, up from 3.1% to 3.2% in 2021-2025.

HOW LONG HAS THE PARTY RULED VIETNAM?

Founded by Ho Chi Minh in 1930, the Communist Party took control of northern Vietnam in 1954 after French colonial rule ended.

After the end of the war with the United States and the fall of Saigon in 1975, Vietnam was reunited under the party, which has since ruled unchallenged, allowing no opposition.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 05:25:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/47XGNF5XWNMGBBEUDEAVA55X5M.jpg?auth=63de4b328f4f2f77f7037615efacda0352702fc58b894c747da6b96717ddba17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Delivering under fire: How Nova Post became Ukraine's wartime success story</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/delivering-under-fire-how-nova-post-became-ukraines-wartime-success-story-2025-12-22/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 06:37:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Live: US, Ukraine hail 'productive' Miami talks but no breakthrough</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251222-live-us-ukraine-hail-productive-miami-talks-but-no-breakthrough</link><description>Two NATO-nation intelligence services suspect Russia is developing a new anti-satellite weapon to target Elon Musk's Starlink constellation with destructive orbiting clouds of shrapnel, with the aim of reining in Western space superiority that has helped Ukraine on the battlefield.

Intelligence findings seen by The Associated Press say the so-called “zone-effect” weapon would seek to flood Starlink orbits with hundreds of thousands of high-density pellets, potentially disabling multiple satellites at once but also risking catastrophic collateral damage to other orbiting systems.

Analysts who haven't seen the findings say they doubt such a weapon could work without causing uncontrollable chaos in space for companies and countries, including Russia and its ally China, that rely on thousands of orbiting satellites for communications, defense and other vital needs.

Talks held between US, European and Ukrainian officials over the last three days in Florida aimed at ending Russia's war in Ukraine focused on aligning positions, US special envoy Steve Witkoff said on Sunday, calling those meetings and separate talks with Russian negotiators productive.

US President Donald Trump has been pressuring Ukraine and Russia to come to an agreement on ending the nearly four-year-old conflict as soon as possible, but Russia wants to keep the Ukrainian areas it has seized and Kyiv has refused to cede ground.

After meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev on Saturday, Witkoff and Trump adviser Jared Kushner met on Sunday with officials from Ukraine and Europe, and then separately with the Ukrainian delegation, led by senior official Rustem Umerov.

Witkoff, in a social media post, called Sunday's talks "productive and constructive" and focused on a "shared strategic approach between Ukraine, the United States and Europe."

Two vessels and two piers were damaged as a result of a Ukrainian drone attack in Russia’s Krasnodar region, authorities in the southern Russia region said on Monday.

All crew on the ships at the Volna terminal in the region have been safely evacuated, the Krasnodar region’s operational headquarters said on the Telegram messaging app. The damage led to a fire spreading across up to 1,500 square metres (1,794 square yards), the authorities added.

US and Ukrainian envoys issued a joint statement on Sunday that hailed "productive and constructive" talks in Miami but did not announce any apparent breakthrough in efforts to end the war with Russia .

The Kremlin denied that three-way talks between Ukraine , Russia and the United States were on the cards, as diplomats gathered in Miami for talks on ending the conflict.

British ‍Prime Minister ​Keir Starmer discussed efforts to achieve a "just and lasting end" ⁠to the war in Ukraine on Sunday with President Donald Trump , Starmer's Downing Street office said in a statement, after talks ​between officials in Florida.

Balde, 60, leads the Democratic Front of Guinea (FRONDEG) party.

An economist with degrees from the Sorbonne and Columbia University, he quit Alpha Conde's party in 2020 to oppose his bid for a third term. Conde won that election but was ousted in the 2021 coup and now lives in exile.

Balde is a former central bank vice-governor and minister of higher education.

He is a member of the Fulani ethnic group, Guinea's largest, like exiled opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo, who is also in exile and not contesting the election.

Balde is considered a strong contender who could capture a significant share of the opposition vote.

The standard-bearer for the Liberal Bloc party, Millimono, 63, initially backed Doumbouya's junta, straining ties with more established parties like Diallo's Union of Democratic Forces of Guinea (UFDG) and Conde's Rally of the Guinean People (RPG).

He later turned critic, and toughened his stance when Doumbouya signaled he would renege on his promise not to run in the election.

Millimono ran in the 2015 presidential election, winning around 1.4% of the vote against Conde. He holds a PhD in Educational Administration from the University of Montreal.

Sylla, 74, was a member of parliament before the 2021 coup, when the National Assembly was dissolved. He was named energy minister under Doumbouya, though he is no longer in that role.

Sylla and his New Generation for the Republic (NGR) party have broad support among young people in the Basse-Guinee coastal region that includes the capital Conakry.

He has lived and studied in the United States.

Camara, 69, is the only woman contesting the presidency. She is president of the Front for National Alliance (FAN) and served as foreign affairs minister under Conde in 2016 and 2017.

A lawyer by training, Camara is running for president for the second time. In 2020, she won about 0.7% of the vote.

The youngest candidate on the ballot, Kourouma, 42, is an economist who studied in Russia.

Leader of the Rally for Renaissance and Development (RRD) party, he was a lawmaker before the coup. He won around 0.5% of the vote in the 2020 vote but was nonetheless close to Conde.

Nabe, 53, is a relative political newcomer who trained as an economist at the London School of Economics and was formerly sales director of a major cement production company in Guinea.

He is leader of the Alliance for Renewal and Progress (ARP).

A self-made diamond merchant and the leader of the Rally for a Prosperous Guinea (RGP) party, Keita, 72, is running for the second time, after garnering about 0.8% of the vote in 2010. He is not seen as a serious contender.

Haidara, 72, is the only independent candidate apart from Doumbouya. He remains virtually unknown in this campaign.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 07:27:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NZSLLROT55JAVPUJZR76NN3T4A.jpg?auth=2a107e5a04c2ca3bbef028a80dc7e044a12e4ec1117595f8c45c2958a25bfebd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo heads to polls as political deadlock threatens vital funds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovo-heads-polls-political-deadlock-threatens-vital-funds-2025-12-22/</link><description>PRISTINA, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Kosovo will hold elections on December 28 after a year-long political stalemate that led to the dissolution of parliament and left a 1-billion-euro hole in the small Balkan country's shaky finances.

Prime Minister Albin Kurti’s Vetevendosje party won the last election in February, but failed to secure a majority or find a willing coalition party after an acrimonious campaign. Many fear a repeat could throw Europe's newest state into further crisis, just four months before parliament must vote for a new president and as deadlines loom to ratify international loans.

“These elections will be the most important ones in recent Kosovo history because they are coming after one year of deadlock, but also four months before a new president will be elected," said political analyst Artan Muhaxhiri.

"If Kurti wins again with around 42%, all this deadlock will be repeated, because the gap between Kurti and other parties is huge, unbridgeable."

Polls are not made public in Kosovo, so there is little sign of how the vote will go.

But it appears unlikely that any of the major opposition parties will be willing to form a government with Kurti, who they say has stoked tensions with Kosovo's ethnic Serb minority in the north, done little to improve living standards, and tarnished Kosovo's reputation abroad.

Kurti, who came to power in 2021, blames the opposition for the stalemate and remains publicly optimistic about winning the 500,000 "hearts" required to gain an outright majority.

At a rally this week, he promised to increase salaries, spend one billion euros a year on capital investment and create a new prosecution unit to fight organised crime.

“Now I believe that it has never been more realistic than now to have Kurti Three," he told local TV station Kanal 10 this month, using his term for a third mandate.

Kosovo gained independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. backing, which included a 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbian forces waging a brutal campaign to crush an uprising by the 90% ethnic Albanian majority.

Despite international support since, the country of 1.6 million people has struggled with poverty, political instability and organised crime. Kurti's first tenure was the only time a Pristina government has completed a full term.

That instability was on full show this year, when it took lawmakers 73 votes over six months to elect a parliament speaker - a position that had to be filled before a winning party could try to form a government.

Even then, Kurti could not pull together a majority and stepped aside to allow his ally Glauk Konjufca to try. When Konjufca failed, President Vjosa Osmani dissolved parliament and called the December elections.

"At the moment, the state isn’t effective. Everything here needs to change because nothing is functioning," said 79-year-old Pristina resident Shaip Gashi.

The result has been dire for Kosovo's finances, which are already strained by European Union sanctions imposed over what the EU said was Kurti's role in fanning strife with Serbs in north Kosovo, where they form a majority.

The EU is set to lift those measures after Serb mayors were inaugurated following local elections held in October.

Still, some 880 million euros ($1.03 billion) in EU funds for Kosovo's budget has been delayed, as has 127 million euros of financial support from the World Bank, including some aimed at strengthening health and education systems.

Those funds are urgently needed in one of Europe's poorest countries that falls short of its Balkan neighbours in both sectors.

The World Bank told Reuters that 90 million euros of that support will be terminated if not ratified by the Kosovo parliament by February 13. Deadlines for the rest are in April and May.

Some of the EU money may also be at risk, politicians have said. An inconclusive election could scupper all that money if a parliament is not formed quickly.

"People are desperate to see things moving forward. They are struggling to pay for medicine and electricity," said Vlora Citaku from the opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo, which has campaigned on raising quality of life through healthcare and education and increased salaries.

The customs service said on Sunday that authorities had boarded the Adler, a Russian freighter, that anchored in Swedish waters near Hoganas in south-west Sweden on Friday after developing engine problems.

"The prosecutor has decided not to open an investigation into suspected violation of sanctions," a spokesperson for the customs service said. "The ship has therefore been allowed to go on its way."

In addition to the Adler being on a European Union sanctions list, the vessel and its owners M Leasing LLC are both subject to U.S. sanctions, suspected of involvement in weapons transport, according to OpenSanctions, a database of sanctioned companies and individuals, persons of interest and government watchlists.

The customs service declined to say what cargo the Adler, which left St Petersburg on December 15 for an unknown destination, had been carrying.

LSEG tracking data showed the ship travelling north up the west coast of Sweden.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 08:32:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7VROFFR3M5OH3OJDQIR3ZQ2GPY.jpg?auth=284a435120c82a12139fb98b3e2cb3e130dea289c0e53ae01e9e776a6b9be5c3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China lodges complaint about Japan official visiting Taiwan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-lodges-complaint-about-japan-official-visiting-taiwan-2025-12-22/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China has lodged a diplomatic complaint with Japan regarding the visit by a high-ranking official of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to Taiwan, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Monday.

Venezuela has the right to develop relations with other countries, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said at a daily press briefing, adding that China opposes all "unilateral and illegal" sanctions.

On Saturday, the U.S. Coast Guard intercepted a second oil tanker in international waters off the Venezuelan coast, days after President Donald Trump announced a "blockade" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela.

The tanker, Centuries, loaded in Venezuela under the false name "Crag" and was carrying some 1.8 million barrels of Venezuelan Merey crude oil bound for China, documents showed.

The crude was bought by Satau Tijana Oil Trading, one of many intermediaries involved in Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA's sales to Chinese independent refiners, the documents showed.

A White House spokesperson said the "falsely flagged vessel" carried sanctioned oil and was part of Venezuela's shadow fleet.

The Venezuelan government called the tanker interception a "serious act of international piracy."

China is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, which accounts for roughly 4% of its imports.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 09:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PNKHJKCDEBJ7DLTJPNOGA6RO6M.jpg?auth=6bfabe0a80dcddebda54ac47fadc657ecc6a175bf8c390177e7e91482f786f9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>High-profile Russians assassinated since start of Ukraine war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/high-profile-russians-assassinated-since-start-ukraine-war-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - A Russian general was killed by a car bomb in Moscow on Monday, the latest in a growing list of military officials and other pro-war figures to be assassinated since the start of the war in Ukraine. Ukrainian military intelligence has claimed responsibility for a number of the attacks.

Here are details of the most prominent cases.

December 22, 2025 - Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov is killed by a bomb that explodes under his Kia Sorento in southern Moscow. Sarvarov was head of the Russian General Staff's army operational training directorate. Russian investigators say they suspect the involvement of Ukrainian special services. There is no immediate comment from Kyiv on the killing.

April 25, 2025 - Lieutenant General Yaroslav Moskalik, 59, is killed by a car bomb near Moscow. Moskalik was deputy head of the Main Operations Directorate of the General Staff.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Moscow did not know how reliable the sources quoted by Reuters were, but that if the report was accurate then the U.S. intelligence conclusions were wrong.

The visit by Turkey's foreign and defence ministers and its intelligence chief comes amid efforts by Syrian, Kurdish and U.S. officials to show some progress with the deal. But Ankara accuses the SDF of stalling ahead of a year-end deadline.

Turkey views the U.S.-backed SDF, which controls swathes of northeastern Syria, as a terrorist organisation and has warned of military action if the group does not honour the agreement.

Last week Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Ankara hoped to avoid resorting to military action against the SDF but that its patience was running out.

The Foreign Ministry source said Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler and the head of Turkey's MIT intelligence agency, Ibrahim Kalin, would attend the talks in Damascus, a year after the fall of former President Bashar al-Assad.

The source said the integration deal "closely concerned Turkey's national security priorities" and the delegation would discuss its implementation. Turkey has said integration must ensure that the SDF's chain of command is broken.

Sources have previously told Reuters that Damascus sent a proposal to the SDF expressing openness to reorganising the group's roughly 50,000 fighters into three main divisions and smaller brigades as long as it cedes some chains of command and opens its territory to other Syrian army units.

Turkey sees the SDF as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group and says it too must disarm and dissolve itself, in line with a disarmament process now underway between the Turkish state and the PKK.

Ankara has conducted cross-border military operations against the SDF in the past. It accuses the group of wanting to circumvent the integration deal and says this poses a threat to both Turkey and the unity of Syria.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:48:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IR62FGQBGFOJXHYXYXLWRJG7OU.jpg?auth=faa000c5d8e06a1bb4f513e3760bd649c343e87b4fa7b48fe32f82b48f06423b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo urges joyful, welcoming Church in speech to Vatican cardinals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/pope-leo-urges-joyful-welcoming-church-speech-vatican-cardinals-2025-12-22/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Pope Leo indicated on Monday that he plans to follow the reform agenda of his predecessor Francis, praising the late pontiff's attempts to make the global Catholic Church more inclusive in an annual Christmas address to Vatican cardinals.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, told the Church's senior-most officials that Francis, who died in April , had been a "prophetic voice" who strived to create "a joyful Church, welcoming to all and attentive to the poorest".

Francis, who led the 1.4 billion-member Church for 12 years, often used his annual Christmas speech with the cardinals to deliver blistering critiques of their work.

In several lengthy speeches over the years, he listed what he called the "illnesses" and "diseases" of the Vatican's central bureaucracy, known as the Roman Curia.

Leo, who has a more diplomatic style than his Argentine predecessor, spoke for only 15 minutes and offered no such rebukes. But he repeated many themes central to Francis' papacy.

The pope warned officials against "falling into rigidity or ideology" in enforcing Church teachings and said the Vatican’s complex structure "must not weigh down or slow the progress" of their work.

He lamented that interpersonal conflicts sometimes mar Vatican operations.

"We observe with disappointment that certain dynamics - linked to the exercise of power, the desire to prevail, or the pursuit of personal interests - are slow to change," Leo said.

"We then ask ourselves: is it possible to be friends in the Roman Curia?"

Leo called for "an ever more missionary Roman Curia, in which institutions, offices and tasks are conceived in light of today's major ecclesial, pastoral and social challenges, and not merely to ensure ordinary administration."</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 10:48:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/27S55UYWCRKA3FI6M6ZNHRJIDU.jpg?auth=923b12879e5f3022f5edac5380dc58f1ab4840fdfd352b7526e420d1f0b4452f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Orban's giveaways still not turning election tide in Hungary</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/orbans-giveaways-still-not-turning-election-tide-hungary-2025-12-22/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Hungary's Viktor Orban may have got a brief poll boost last month from a costly pensions sweetener but he faces a race against time before April's election to turn the stagnating economy around enough to extend a 15-year grip on power.

Orban's reelection bid will be watched far beyond Hungary. A thorn in the side of the European Union, the nationalist leader counts U.S. President Donald Trump as an anti-EU ally and maintains close ties with Russia's Vladimir Putin.

Yet the domestic economy is not on his side. Income tax rebates he pushed through ahead of the 2022 election helped fuel Europe's worst inflationary surge - one which left scars.

An autumn Eurobarometer survey showed that rising costs of living topped Hungarians' domestic concerns - despite inflation retreating from highs above 25% in early 2023 to the central bank's 2-4% tolerance band in November.

While the inflation surge has lifted Hungarian food prices close to EU average levels, the annual average full-time salary per employee was third-lowest in the bloc and pension spending is also among the lowest as a share of output.

The pension top-up, aimed at Hungary's 2.4 million retirees who make up over a quarter of the electorate, will cost $454 million next year, with its price tag rising each following year as it is phased in over the next government cycle.

It gave Orban's Fidesz a boost among older voters last month in a survey by the 21 Research Centre. Fidesz's poll rating rose by one point to 27% of all voters before retreating to 26% in December, when support for Tisza rose by three points to 34%.

David Szollosi, 83, who earns what he called an above-average pension, said the top-up could help Orban win some pensioner votes but would not be a game-changer for livelihoods.

"Such measures help people's positive attitude," said the great-grandfather. "But we are facing rather uncertain years ahead."

Erzsebet Botlik, who used to work as a cashier and cleaner, welcomed the top-up to be paid in February. She said she planned to vote for Fidesz, due to pensions and Orban's hard line on immigration - but did not feel particularly well off.

"I would barely have anything if not for my two (adult) children," Botlik, who was queuing for food donations at a charity, said of their financial help to her.

Orban's pre-election moves also bear the hallmarks of similar pledges by mainstream parties elsewhere in central Europe, which can help win votes, but are very difficult to reverse politically for whoever ends up being elected.

Fitch Ratings cut Hungary's outlook to negative on Orban's pre-election spending moves. It said further measures cannot be ruled out ahead of the vote, with most polls showing Orban's Fidesz trailing opposition rival Tisza by a wide margin.

While paying some near-term dividends, the pension moves will have a far larger cost in the long run. In August the IMF warned that, without reforms to its pension system, Hungary was set for "explosive growth" in borrowing beyond 2030, with its public debt estimated at a staggering 255% of output by 2054.

Some public comments to Orban's Facebook post announcing the pension top-up were critical of the move, calling instead for hikes to smaller pensions or indexation to wages, while others derided it as a "joke" or "vote buying".

While the European Commission's monthly consumer survey was off its summer lows in November, the Hungarian index stayed far below levels in nearby Poland and the Czech Republic, whose economies have outpaced that of Hungary over the past year.

Hungary's central bank now expects inflation to temporarily dip below its 3% target in the first quarter, which could open the door to a rate cut just before the election likely in April -- but all of that might come too late for Orban.

"The problem is that (sentiment) is still negative and it cannot be changed dramatically in a few months. The time is too short and the amount of money to be distributed is limited," 21 Research Centre Director Daniel Rona said.

Dan said hundreds of magistrates had described a climate of fear and undue influence by the Supreme Judicial Council, the country's top justice watchdog, which they accused of acting in the interest of a select group rather than the public.

"The situation we are in is serious, in that there is this suspicion about the integrity of the judicial system," he said in a statement, adding the claims would be investigated.

"The conclusion ... is that there is a category of magistrates ... chief court judges who do not act in the public interest, but who act in the interest of a group."

The meeting followed Dan's open invitation to members of the judiciary to submit complaints, after he said on Sunday he had received roughly 2,000 pages of examples of integrity problems warranting investigation and further action.

The president appoints chief judges and prosecutors and can attend meetings of the top judicial council, but does not have the legal powers to replace them.

However, far-right lawmakers have accused Dan, a centrist, of interfering in the independence of the judiciary and demanded he be impeached.

The accusations of abuses in the justice system came after independent media outlet Recorder aired a documentary purporting to show how chief judges use legal loopholes for unethical practices, including questionable acquittals.

Thousands of people protested in the capital Bucharest and across Romania in early December against the alleged abuses.

Romania is one of the European Union's most corrupt states. Brussels kept the country's justice system under special monitoring after it joined the EU in 2007. Since this was lifted in 2023 the pace of anti-graft investigations has slowed.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 11:19:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VH4DDUIOSRKEZKAED3EUEF7CHM.jpg?auth=8e8b2bcefcf2cc7b9170d4cd4e0bffe97ac79ef040288ba8c7594d318f56cdb6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM races to pass stopgap budget law to avoid shutdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-pm-races-pass-stopgap-budget-law-avoid-shutdown-2025-12-22/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu held talks on Monday with French political leaders on emergency legislation to keep the government running in the new year in the absence of a proper budget.

A joint committee of lawmakers from both chambers failed on Friday to hammer out a full 2026 budget bill, forcing Lecornu to seek stopgap legislation to allow spending, tax collection and borrowing to continue in January.

Lecornu's office said that he would meet with officials from parties other than the far right and hard left ahead of a cabinet meeting where the rollover law is due to be approved before being sent to parliament.

The law, which legislators are likely to approve on Tuesday, would buy more time to debate a proper 2026 budget in January.

Investors and ratings agencies are scrutinising France's finances, with the country running the euro zone's highest budget deficit.

Conservative lawmaker Philippe Juvin, who has been steering the 2026 budget through the lower house, said he expected a full text to be passed in early January.

Juvin told BFM TV he hoped Lecornu would use special constitutional powers to force through a compromise text that could be amenable to Socialist lawmakers.

Lecornu had pledged not to use such powers and to do so would likely trigger a vote of no confidence from the far right or hard left, though such a motion would fail without Socialist support.

Lecornu's minority government has little room for manoeuvre in France's fractious parliament, where budget battles have already toppled three governments since President Emmanuel Macron lost his majority in a 2024 snap election.

France used emergency rollover legislation last year until a proper 2025 budget could be passed in February, which the government says cost 12 billion euros ($14 billion).

The Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez lost 10 seats in the 65-seat assembly, continuing a downward trend from 2023, when it tied with the People's Party (PP), which took office with Vox's backing.

The losses in a region it governed for decades put further pressure on the PSOE - whose minority national government has been weakened by a series of scandals . Regional elections are due in Aragon, Castile and Leon and Andalusia next year.

Extremadura leader Maria Guardiola, of the PP, called the snap election after failing to pass the regional budget as Vox refused to back it.

The PP won 29 seats, one more than in 2023 but four short of a majority, while Vox rose to 11 seats from five, again leaving the conservatives reliant on far-right backing to govern.

The Socialist Party fell to 18 seats from 28 in one of its historic strongholds. Days earlier, the party had apologised for failures in handling sexual harassment complaints, prompting criticism from coalition partners and the opposition.

Asked about the video, an Israeli military spokesperson said: "A Palestinian suspected of hurling a block at IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldiers was shot. The incident is under review."

Palestinian officials said that Rayyan Mohammad Abu Mualla was shot and killed on Saturday in the northern West Bank town of Qabatiya, during a raid by the Israeli military.

The Israeli military initially said on Saturday: "During IDF operational activity in the area of Qabatiya, a terrorist hurled a block toward the soldiers, who responded with fire and eliminated the terrorist."

CCTV footage showed two Israeli soldiers - one crouching and one standing on a lit street corner at dark - and a third soldier appearing to take position in an adjacent street leading to the same corner.

A person is then seen walking down a street and as he reaches the corner, he is shot by the crouching soldier and falls back and onto the ground.

The video does not appear to show him throwing a block or holding one.

The video starts six minutes before the shooting, showing the streets empty and then a military vehicle driving down the street as one person peers off a rooftop and another through a window as the soldiers arrive at the scene.

The person who is shot appears in the video three seconds before the shooting, and it is not possible to ascertain what the person was doing or holding before he is seen.

The footage was obtained from the owner of the security camera and its location and date were verified by Reuters. The incident is partly obscured because of the angle of the camera and the low light.

Abu Mualla's mother, Ibtihal, said that the Israeli military had taken his body away.

CCTV footage from around 22 minutes after the shooting appears to show his body being placed by soldiers on a stretcher and driven away in a military vehicle 11 minutes after that, 33 minutes after the shooting.

"They could have shot him in the leg, my son didn't throw anything towards them," said Mualla. "I want to bury my son with dignity," she said.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Since January, when Israel began stepping up raids in the northern West Bank, 53 Palestinian minors have been killed by Israeli forces, according to the Palestinian health ministry.

Israel says the raids are meant to tackle Palestinian militants and thwart attacks against Israelis.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 11:40:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli military says it is examining killing of Palestinian teen in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-is-examining-killing-palestinian-teen-west-bank-2025-12-22/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 11:40:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Denmark to summon US ambassador after Trump appoints Greenland envoy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251222-denmark-to-summon-us-ambassador-after-trump-appoints-greenland-envoy</link><description>Denmark said Monday it would summon the US ambassador after President Donald Trump appointed a special envoy to Greenland , the Danish autonomous territory he has threatened to annex .

Since returning to the White House in January 2025, Trump has repeatedly said the US needs the resource-rich island for security reasons, and has refused to rule out the use of force to secure it.

On Sunday, Trump appointed the governor of Louisiana, Jeff Landry, as special envoy to Greenland.

Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Monday he was "deeply angered" by the move and warned Washington to respect Denmark's sovereignty.

In a post on his social media platform Truth Social early on Monday, Trump said Landry "understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security, and will strongly advance our Country's Interests for the Safety, Security, and Survival of our Allies, and indeed, the World".

Landry responded directly to Trump in a post on X: "It's an honour to serve you in this volunteer position to make Greenland a part of the US."

The Danish foreign minister told television TV2 the appointment and statements were "totally unacceptable" and said his ministry would call in the US ambassador in the coming days "to get an explanation".

"As long as we have a kingdom in Denmark that consists of Denmark, the Faroe Islands, and Greenland, we cannot accept that there are those who undermine our sovereignty," he said.

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen meanwhile said the appointment "doesn't change anything for us here at home".

"We will determine our future ourselves. Greenland is our country," he wrote on Facebook, adding: "Greenland belongs to Greenlanders, and territorial integrity must be respected".

The vast majority of Greenland's 57,000 people want to become independent from Denmark, but do not wish to become part of the United States, according to a January opinion poll.

Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have repeatedly insisted that the huge Arctic island is not for sale and that it will decide its future itself.

"The appointment confirms the continued American interest in Greenland," Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement.

"However, we insist that everyone – including the US – must show respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark."

Greenland is strategically located between North America and Europe at a time of rising US, Chinese and Russian interest in the Arctic, where sea lanes have opened up because of climate change .

Greenland's location also puts it on the shortest route for missiles between Russia and the United States.

In August, Denmark summoned the US charge d'affaires after reports of attempted interference in Greenland.

At least three US officials close to Trump were observed in Greenland's capital Nuuk trying to identify people for and against a rapprochement with the United States.

The US opened a consulate in Greenland in June 2020.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 11:41:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/61e38998-df26-11f0-afc4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25356311802790.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Polish president appoints new Monetary Policy Council member Zarzecki</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/polish-president-appoints-new-monetary-policy-council-member-zarzecki-2025-12-22/</link><description>WARSAW, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Polish President Karol Nawrocki appointed sociologist Marcin Zarzecki to the Monetary Policy Council, the president's office said in a statement on Monday.

The accused, who was arrested in May and identified only as Fahad A. under German privacy rules, was suspected of working as a guard in a prison in the Syrian capital between the end of April 2011 and mid-April 2012, it said.

"There, he participated in well over 100 interrogations during which prisoners were subjected to severe physical abuse, such as electric shocks or beatings with cables," it said.

"On the orders of his superiors, the accused also abused inmates at night, for example by hanging them from the ceiling, dousing them with cold water, or forcing them to remain in uncomfortable positions. As a result of such mistreatment and the catastrophic prison conditions, at least 70 prisoners died."

German prosecutors have used universal jurisdiction laws that allow them to seek trials for suspects in crimes against humanity committed anywhere in the world.

Based on these laws, several people suspected of war crimes during the Syrian conflict have been arrested in the last few years in Germany, which is home to around one million Syrians.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 12:43:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sovereignty of Kingdom of Denmark must be preserved, EU spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/sovereignty-kingdom-denmark-must-be-preserved-eu-spokesperson-says-2025-12-22/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The territorial integrity and sovereignty of the Kingdom of Denmark, including Greenland, must be preserved, an EU spokesperson said on Monday, reiterating what he said was a long-standing position, when asked about the U.S. appointment of a special envoy to Greenland .

They quickly recognized one of the shooters: He had been shot himself two days earlier.

Officers soon found a handgun under his bed, one of them wrote in a court filing. Because the man was a felon, merely having the weapon could be a serious federal crime – precisely the sort of case federal authorities long made a staple in their efforts to combat violent crime in one of the United States’ most dangerous cities.

But federal authorities did not charge him. The U.S. Attorney's Office in Baltimore declined to comment on the case.

The federal government has retreated from gun enforcement in Baltimore and elsewhere this year as more of its investigators turn their attention to President Donald Trump’s new priority for law enforcement: hunting immigrants in the U.S. illegally to deport, Reuters found after reviewing millions of court records and interviewing five former federal officials who participated in the effort.

Last year, federal prosecutors in Maryland charged 131 people with violating the two most commonly enforced federal gun laws. So far this year, they have brought 89 such cases, about 32% fewer, and the lowest number in at least 25 years, according to Reuters' analysis of court dockets. The shift is part of a broader federal slowdown in the state, where the number of federal prosecutions unrelated to immigration has fallen nearly 10% in 2025, the dockets show.

The Justice Department’s retreat from gun enforcement in Baltimore is one facet of an abrupt shift in federal law enforcement this year that has sidelined some traditional crime-fighting efforts such as those targeting money-laundering , tax offenses and drugs to pursue deportations instead, Reuters found after reviewing court records nationwide.

The Trump administration ordered thousands of federal agents to focus on immigration enforcement, leaving the number of criminal prosecutions for everything from drug to tax offenses at their lowest point in decades.

“They were wasting their time,” said Darius Reeves, who was the head of the Baltimore field office for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the agency in charge of deportation efforts, until he retired in May. “You’re taking away valuable resources from critical missions like getting guns off the street.”

Justice Department spokeswoman Natalie Baldassarre said in a statement that "assisting our partners with immigration enforcement has not deterred our ability to successfully investigate and prosecute other types of crime to keep American citizens safe." She said Reuters was "cherry-picking" data to show otherwise.

The retreat from gun enforcement extends beyond Baltimore. Reuters found 40 of the nation's 94 federal court districts in which gun prosecutions dropped more than 10% compared to last year, including those surrounding cities such as New Orleans and Milwaukee, whose murder rates have ranked among the nation’s highest.

“Everything has been swallowed up by immigration enforcement,” said a former Justice Department official, who, like several others, spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the department’s internal workings.

Reuters examined the extent of the pullback by gathering the dockets of every publicly available federal criminal case since the 1990s from an online legal research service that, like Reuters news agency, is a division of Thomson Reuters. In some cases, Reuters used artificial intelligence to help classify the charges people faced. A review of a random set of records showed its assessments to be 98% accurate.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would not say how many of its agents in Maryland have been shifted to immigration work. But nationwide, the administration has enlisted thousands of federal agents normally focused on other types of enforcement to help, Reuters reported this year after interviewing 20 current and former officials. Records obtained by the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, show nearly 1,200 ATF agents , opens new tab spent at least some of their time devoted to immigration instead of gun enforcement this year, about half of its workforce.

“ATF, in essence, is not investigating gun crimes,” a former official who worked on the immigration deployments in another state said.

Even small diversions can have an outsized impact when it comes to gun cases because the ATF is a comparatively small piece of federal law enforcement. “If you have two or three agents who have to go out with ICE, that’s a lot,” another former official said.

The diversion came as the ATF is losing agents. Personnel records reviewed by Reuters show 219 criminal investigators left the agency between January and October, almost 40% more than departed in the previous four years. Reuters was unable to determine what the net loss of agents was during this time. ATF declined to answer a question about its staffing levels.

The ATF said in a statement that its agents “continuously show up for our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners” and that the administration has authorized it to hire more agents.

Reeves, the former ICE supervisor, said his office was inundated with a rotating assortment of investigators from other agencies who had been ordered to help with immigration enforcement. They were seldom helpful, he said, because they had little experience in the intricacies of immigration law. Many weren’t happy to be there, either.

“They would rather be doing their own work, which is important work,” Reeves said.

The pressure from Washington to increase deportation numbers was so intense that Reeves said he withdrew his own officers from an FBI-run gang task force in Maryland because he needed them elsewhere.

“Everything shifted to quotas,” he said.

ICE did not respond to questions about its operations.

Baltimore “was always a target-rich environment for ATF,” said Jeff Cohen, who supervised the agency’s legal team in the region until he retired last summer. And the agency prioritized making federal cases out of gun crimes there. Re-assigning agents is almost certain to stall out some of their cases, especially longer-term efforts that focus on gun trafficking.

The slowdown in Baltimore is a stark contrast to Trump’s anti-crime efforts 40 miles away in Washington – a city with a lower crime rate and far more police than Baltimore – where the administration has deployed hundreds of additional federal agents and thousands of soldiers to stamp out what the president described as a crisis of crime.

Baltimore has struggled with gun violence for decades. And although the city’s homicide rate has fallen sharply this year, it still ranks among the most dangerous big cities in the United States, according to data gathered by the FBI and the Real Time Crime Index, a privately run website that collects crime statistics from police agencies serving about a third of the United States.

Most of the job of pursuing gun criminals falls to local authorities. But the Justice Department long has made targeting armed criminals a central part of its effort to battle violent crime, often bringing federal charges against people arrested by local police. The people federal authorities charge are more likely to be locked up while the case is pending, more likely to be convicted and serve more time in prison when they are.

The decline in federal gun prosecutions in Maryland was steeper than the drop in crime this year. Nor can it fully explain the federal retreat. In nearby Washington, for example, federal authorities nearly doubled the number of gun prosecutions even as violent crime dropped by almost a third, according to police statistics and court records.

City police in Baltimore more than quadrupled the number of people they charged under Maryland’s law that prohibits felons from having guns. Last year, police records show they charged 37 people through the beginning of December; this year they made 171 arrests.

Meanwhile, court dockets show the number of people charged in federal court in Maryland with possessing guns illegally – usually because they had been convicted of a felony before – dropped by nearly 40%.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:35:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EPHIKYBDBFIDVPLIFY52DERKVA.jpg?auth=4599c81048cb224ee23ea607712e5c3e61be8c39980dd765728f06579ea4be04&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh editors warn of 'fight for survival' as mob violence targets media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/bangladesh-editors-warn-fight-survival-mob-violence-targets-media-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's top media editors warned on Monday that threats against journalists have escalated into a fight for survival, after the killing of a prominent youth leader triggered violent attacks on newspaper offices last week.

Sharif Osman Hadi, 32, a leading figure in last year's student-led uprising that toppled longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka while launching his campaign for February's parliamentary election. He died on Thursday in a Singapore hospital.

His killing sparked widespread protests that spiraled into arson and vandalism targeting major media outlets and cultural institutions. Offices of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo were among those attacked.

Assailants accused the newspapers of "serving the interests of India and Sheikh Hasina," allegations editors strongly denied. Hasina fled to India after her ouster and remains in New Delhi despite Dhaka seeking her extradition.

At a protest meeting organized by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh, The Daily Star editor Mahfuz Anam said journalists were receiving explicit death threats.

"On social media, we have seen messages saying journalists of The Daily Star and Prothom Alo should be hunted down and killed in their homes," Anam said. "Freedom of expression is no longer the main issue. Now it is about the right to stay alive."

Bangladesh ranks 149th out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index . Rights groups say continued attacks on journalists and activists could further shrink civic space ahead of the election.

Editors' Council president and New Age editor Nurul Kabir, who was assaulted while trying to rescue colleagues, accused the attackers of attempting to burn journalists alive inside their offices.

Bangladesh is governed by an interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus and is due to elect a new parliament on February 12. The interim government blamed the violence on fringe elements and vowed full justice for the attacks.

Police have identified 31 suspects and arrested nine in connection with the assaults, Yunus' press office said on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 13:35:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's Christmas lottery spreads riches, brings cheer to wildfire-hit Leon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spains-christmas-lottery-spreads-riches-brings-cheer-wildfire-hit-leon-2025-12-22/</link><description>MADRID, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Spain's Christmas lottery showered 2.77 billion euros ($3.25 billion) in prizes on Monday, with a significant number of winners of the top award, "El Gordo" (The Fat One) living in Leon province that was ravaged by wildfires earlier this year.

"After the terrible summer we've been through with the wildfires, which was horrible, I'm very emotional - it's overwhelming, I can hardly believe it," lottery winner Laura told radio station SER.

The state-run draw's total prize pot edged up from last year's 2.70 billion euros.

In the nationally televised draw at Madrid's Teatro Real, pupils from San Ildefonso school picked the winning numbers from two revolving globes, a tradition dating back more than 200 years that marks the start of Spain's festive season.

Audience members queued for hours to enter, wearing Santa hats, regional costumes and their personal lucky charms.

The draw was briefly interrupted when a small group of protesters stood up inside the theatre, shouting pro-Palestinian slogans, before the ceremony resumed.

Lottery mania grips Spain in the weeks leading up to the Christmas draw, with families, friends and co-workers pooling money for tickets or fractions of tickets, often favouring "lucky" vendors or numbers.

Spaniards spend an average of 66.6 euros on El Gordo tickets, according to vendors' association Anapal. The best-selling ticket, dubbed "decimo" (tenth), costs 20 euros and its holders can earn 10% of the prize money awarded.

At least ten of the 13 selections made to date by Leo, including the new Archbishop of New York, announced on Thursday to replace the leading conservative Cardinal Timothy Dolan, have spoken publicly on the issue.

In diverse statements, some have called the Trump policies cruel; others have urged the administration to use due process before deporting immigrants.

One of Leo's closest U.S. advisors told Reuters the pope's appointments show that treatment of immigrants is now a firm part of the Church's position that life is sacred from conception until death, one of the 1.4-billion-member denomination's strongest teachings.

"It signals a maturing of our understanding of what it means to be pro-life," said Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich, who is part of a Vatican office that advises Leo on which Catholic priests to appoint as bishops.

The U.S. bishops' pro-life agenda focused for decades on ending legal abortion in the country, with their national conference supporting an annual march in Washington, D.C. and lobbying to end the now overturned 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court ruling.

Leo appeared to broaden the pro-life umbrella in September, when he questioned whether U.S. President Donald Trump's policies were in line with the Church's teachings, drawing a heated backlash from some prominent conservative Catholics.

"Someone who says I am against abortion but I am in agreement with the inhuman treatment of immigrants in the United States, I don't know if that's pro-life," the pope said in response to journalists' questions outside his residence in Castel Gandolfo, in Italy.

In his first seven months as pope, Leo has appointed new Catholic bishops in cities across the U.S., from San Diego to Austin to Pittsburgh.

Bishop Ronald Hicks, 58, who Leo named on Thursday to replace Dolan in New York in a leadership shake-up , gave his first remarks in Spanish that day at a press conference about his appointment before switching to English.

Hicks, who will lead 2.8 million Catholics in New York, is a former missionary in El Salvador. He reiterated an earlier endorsement of a November statement by the U.S. bishops' conference, which decried Trump's immigration crackdown.

Since Catholic bishops normally only retire for health or age reasons, and can serve until age 80, many of the new bishops appointed by Leo could be expected to stay in their roles for decades.

"Certainly the most lasting legacy of any pope, is the episcopal appointments he makes," said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a U.S. Church expert and professor at Fordham University. "Every appointment is important, and every one means something."

Trump, who once called the late Pope Francis "disrespectful" for criticizing the president's immigration policies, has not responded directly to Leo's criticisms.

The administration's crackdown has included deployment of National Guard troops in cities across the country and raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials at workplaces, businesses and on city streets.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance, a Catholic convert, told right-wing outlet Breitbart in November that he was aware of Leo's comments and said the administration's policies were humanitarian.

"Every nation has the right to control its borders," said Vance.

Four of Leo's choices as U.S. bishops are immigrants themselves. A fifth was born in Texas but spent most of his childhood in Mexico.

San Diego Bishop Michael Pham, a former Vietnamese refugee appointed by Leo in May, has accompanied asylum seekers to court, in an attempt to prevent ICE agents from arresting them as they go to their hearings.

Bishop Ramon Bejarano, who grew up in Chihuahua, Mexico and will soon lead the Church in Monterey, California, took part in a February protest with thousands in downtown San Diego against the immigration crackdown.

Pittsburgh Bishop Mark Eckman, appointed by Leo in June, called immigration policies "cruel and inhumane" in a November open letter.

Imperatori-Lee said the pope "is putting into practice what the Gospel invites us all to do, by appointing men who have … forcefully defended immigrants and stood up for human dignity."</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:21:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UXG66ZKBBRIPHC6UE7VL4VYWYI.jpg?auth=8a59c552ab07b89882d18afe2b6b4948da3ceb332444fb4581743b348e1f89f1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netanyahu government moves to shut down Israel's Army Radio station</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/netanyahu-government-moves-shut-down-israels-army-radio-station-2025-12-22/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Israel's cabinet voted on Monday to shut down a popular national radio station, one in a series of measures by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing coalition that critics see as blows to democracy.

Defence Minister Israel Katz had proposed that Army Radio, broadcasting since the early days of the state, will be shut down by March 1, 2026, in what he described as an attempt to preserve the military’s nonpartisan character.

Its original purpose, Katz said in a statement, had been to broadcast for Israel's soldiers but that with time it served as a platform for views that "attack the IDF (Israel Defence Forces) and the IDF soldiers themselves".

Army Radio is among two state-funded news outlets in Israel, the other being public broadcaster KAN that operates a television news channel, several radio stations and a popular digital platform. Both are editorially independent.

Katz said an army-operated station broadcasting to civilians was an anomaly for any democracy. Netanyahu said in remarks to the cabinet session, "I think it exists in North Korea and maybe a few other countries, and we probably don't want to be counted among them."

Critics denounced the move, saying it would harm free speech.

"They want an obedient media, they don't want critical media," Anat Saragusti, who oversees press freedom for the Israeli Union of Journalists, said at a crisis conference attended by hundreds of journalists in Tel Aviv this month.

The Movement for Quality Government in Israel, an independent anti-corruption watchdog, said it has petitioned the Supreme Court against the government's decision.

The Israel Democracy Institute (IDI), a non-partisan think tank, said that shutting Army Radio effectively wipes out half of Israel's independent public news broadcasts and that such a sweeping measure must be brought before parliament.

"The decision to shut down a public media organisation is not an isolated move. It is part of a broader and worrying pattern of ongoing harm to Israeli democracy," IDI said in a statement published online.

Other plans by Netanyahu's coalition include a law that would expand a temporary emergency measure allowing for bans on media deemed a threat to national security, as well as a broad reform to the entire Israeli media market.

The law has already used to ban operations by pan-Arab broadcaster Al Jazeera in Israel during the Gaza war.

A flurry of bills by the nationalist-religious ruling coalition that were largely suspended during the two-year Gaza war included an overhaul of the judicial system , which sparked mass street protests in Israel.

Some of the bills have since been reintroduced by members of Netanyahu's coalition as Israel heads into an election year, and its prime minister is seeking an unprecedented mid-trial pardon from corruption charges , which he denies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UAN262MT4RJQZAAWJU7T4FJNPQ.jpg?auth=561dcc898f709ca9665aa772d8ec77d0310b3597681accabc7b4b580f582a847&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: How a remote airstrip in Libya reshaped Sudan's civil war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/how-remote-airstrip-libya-reshaped-sudans-civil-war-2025-12-22/</link><description>CAIRO/NAIROBI - A remote airstrip in southeastern Libya has reshaped Sudan's civil war by providing a lifeline to the Rapid Support Forces paramilitary group, according to more than a dozen military, intelligence and diplomatic officials.

The paramilitary group – which grew from the “Janjaweed” militia mobilised two decades ago by Sudan’s government to subdue its western Darfur province – has been fighting the Sudanese army since April 2023 when the two fell out over how to integrate their forces.

The conflict has since killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country.

Military supplies sent via the airstrip in Kufrah, about 300 km from Sudan's border, helped the RSF revive its fortunes after the Sudanese army retook the capital Khartoum in March, the officials said. The supply route was central to the RSF’s brutal capture of the city of al-Fashir in October, which allowed the paramilitary group to consolidate its control over Darfur and preceded a series of victories in Sudan’s south.

The vast desert region of Kufrah is controlled by a Libyan military commander allied with the United Arab Emirates - a Gulf nation that U.N. experts and the U.S. Congress have accused of sponsoring the RSF. The UAE denies backing either side in Sudan's conflict.

The airport – largely unused before this year – has undergone extensive renovation and received dozens of cargo flights since the spring, coinciding with a growing RSF presence to its south, an analysis of satellite images, flight tracking data and social media shows.

A U.N. official familiar with RSF operations, who asked not to be named, said the group’s use of Kufrah had “changed the whole game” by providing a conduit for supplies and fighters to bolster the 18-month siege of al-Fashir.

Justin Lynch, managing director of the Conflict Insights Group analysis firm, said he identified at least 105 cargo plane landings at Kufrah between April 1 and November 1 by correlating satellite images with flight tracking data. Reuters was not able to confirm his figure independently.

The "pattern, location, and aircraft" of the flights into Kufrah "correlate with UAE support to the RSF," Lynch said. "Kufrah and southern Libya have become a significant logistics hub for the RSF."

UAE also has economic interests in Sudan, where it had planned billions of dollars in investments in a Red Sea port and Sudanese farmland before the war. It also has ties to the RSF’s commander, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, who sent thousands of troops to fight for the UAE in Yemen.

The UAE did not respond to requests for comment. The RSF, which has denied receiving Emirati support, also did not respond to Reuters questions.

Sudan's army has repeatedly accused the RSF of securing military cargoes via Libya and in September submitted a complaint to the United Nations that alleged Colombian mercenaries had traveled via Kufrah to support the RSF.

The Libyan National Army, which is under the command of Khalifa Haftar, controls eastern and southern Libya where the airport is located. It has repeatedly denied backing the RSF and insisted it is not taking sides in Sudan's conflict.

Reuters could not reach LNA leadership for comment. An LNA military official in Kufrah, who declined to be named, said the cargo flights into Kufrah had transported civilians, soldiers and police to and from other eastern Libyan airports. He denied there were RSF fighters in the area.

"We don't have anything to do with conflicts in neighbouring countries," the official said.

To determine the scale of the Kufrah operation, Reuters spoke to 18 diplomatic, military, intelligence and other officials from Western and African countries, and 14 experts on regional and military affairs.

In October, the Wall Street Journal quoted U.S. officials as saying the UAE had stepped up arms deliveries to the RSF via Libya and Somalia. The details of the airport's role are reported here for the first time.

Libya has been divided for years between rival factions which have both been accused of smuggling weapons, drugs and migrants. Local units of the LNA, which seized control of eastern Libya with UAE backing nearly a decade ago, have long-established trafficking ties with elements of the RSF, according to a Dec. 1 report from the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime.

Shortly after Sudan's war broke out, some LNA fighters helped move military cargo down to the border that had arrived to Kufrah by plane from Benghazi, according to a U.N. expert report. But army advances soon disrupted the route, and the airport fell back into disuse.

The RSF renewed its interest in Kufrah after political pressure last year complicated its use of a supply line through a remote airstrip in eastern Chad, significantly closer to the frontlines in Darfur, according to officials and experts.

By January, a camp about 80 kilometers south of Kufrah can already be seen forming in Copernicus satellite service images. The Centre for Information Resilience (CIR), a UK-based non-profit, said in a July report it had traced RSF vehicles and fighters at the camp to Darfur.

The RSF's retreat from Khartoum moved the war's center of gravity to Darfur, making the re-establishment of supply lines from Libya imperative, the Global Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime report said.

After the RSF re-captured key border areas in June, the "Libya corridor" became "a key focal point" for RSF supply operations, according to a Western diplomatic cable sent to other Western countries in September, reviewed by Reuters.

By May, Kufrah's airport had already been revamped, with a new facade, fountains and lawn. Two local airlines began flights with Benghazi in June.

The number of large cargo planes on the tarmac also increased. None were visible in any of last year’s Copernicus images, available roughly every three to five days.

But in April, at least one appears in six out of seven images.

The numbers rose throughout the summer and in the weeks before al-Fashir’s fall as many as five were visible at a time.

Flight tracking data from FlightRadar24 shows at least some of the cargo flights to Kufrah were operated by airlines previously accused of involvement in trafficking weapons from the UAE.

One Ilyushin-76 with the tail number EX-76008, which flew to Kufrah from Dubai on June 5, was operated by a Kyrgyz airline, Sapsan Airlines LLC.

A May 2022 UN expert report on Libya said the airline had carried out flights "for the direct, and indirect, supply of military equipment and other assistance" as part of an airbridge to Haftar in the early 2020s.

The same plane flew to Kufrah on July 12 from Bosaso in Somalia's Puntland region, where the UAE has trained and funded local security forces. The UAE has denied using the airport to supply the RSF.

Two Ilyushins operated by FlySky Airlines – another Kyrgyz operator accused in the U.N. report of trafficking weapons from the UAE to Haftar – have also landed in Kufrah, flight tracking data and social media posts show.

Both planes – EX-76017 and EX-76022 – had made at least a half dozen flights each from the UAE to Amdjarass, the airstrip in eastern Chad, according to a previous Reuters analysis . U.N. experts in a January 2024 report cited "credible" accusations the UAE was supplying the RSF with weapons via that runway, which Abu Dhabi denied.

FlySky did not reply to requests for comment. A Sapsan Airlines employee said by phone the airline was being shut down and directed questions to the airline's UAE-based owner, Bu Shames FZE. Bu Shames did not reply to phone calls and emails seeking comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:22:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q33IWQIK3RACXLUXHGCGBZAYGY.jpg?auth=226c0cc10c9089e451bb543e429566fad1832cefba2a47f280ca381fb1126b62&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey expects second phase of Gaza ceasefire deal to start in early 2026</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-expects-second-phase-gaza-ceasefire-deal-start-early-2026-2025-12-22/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Turkey expects the second phase of a Gaza ceasefire deal to begin early in 2026, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Monday, following talks with U.S., Qatari and Egyptian officials in Miami over the weekend.

The pair, prominent figures in the movement that challenged President Alexander Lukashenko in a disputed 2020 election, were released on December 13 as part of a deal under which the U.S. lifted sanctions on Belarusian potash in exchange for their freedom.

They had been expected to give a news conference in Berlin on Tuesday.

"Maria and Viktar need some time to recover and to reconnect with their loved ones," Kalesnikava's sister Tatsiana Khomich told Reuters. "After the New Year, we will get back with a format that will allow for the broadest possible participation."

The two were imprisoned on what Western observers said were trumped-up political charges. Human rights activists said they had been subjected to degrading treatment and undergone serious health emergencies during their time in detention.

Last week Germany announced that it would grant residency to the pair, part of a policy of allowing prominent prisoners of conscience residence on their release.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:22:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G46NMQXJINOETEC536NHKYLMBM.jpg?auth=0527442ea2cd44a4d38a3ef4966396a98783741e5cafac5a0c1804b44c1ec91c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africans dragged into Russia's war in Ukraine dig trenches, dodge bullets</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/south-africans-dragged-into-russias-war-ukraine-dig-trenches-dodge-bullets-2025-12-22/</link><description>DURBAN, South Africa, Dec 22 (Reuters) - South African father-of-three Dubandlela was overcome with pride when his 20-year-old son signed up in July to receive elite training as a VIP bodyguard in Russia.

Five months later, Dubandlela is in despair. His son had fallen for an alleged recruitment scam in which he and at least 16 other South African men say they were conscripted by an unspecified mercenary group and sent to join Russian forces in Ukraine.

"I blame myself," Dubandlela, who had been unable to afford university fees for his son, told Reuters at his home in Durban on South Africa's eastern coast.

The Russian foreign ministry did not respond to a written request for comment on the alleged scam or the current circumstances of the 17 South Africans.

President Cyril Ramaphosa's spokesman Vincent Magwenya said the case was "receiving the highest possible attention."

"The process to retrieve those young men remains a very sensitive process," he said. "They are facing grave, grave danger to their lives and we are still in discussions with various authorities, both in Russia as well as in Ukraine, to see how we can free them from the situation they are in.

"In fact, the emphasis is more with the authorities in Russia and less so with the authorities in the Ukraine, because the information that we have is that they were bungled into the Russian military forces," he told a press briefing this month.

On Dubandlela's phone are photos that he said his son had sent earlier this month from what he said was a location near the front line in the eastern Ukrainian region of Donbas.

One shows his son in combat fatigues, awkwardly holding an AK-47 assault rifle.

Another shows his son trying to sleep in his underwear on the concrete floor of a cupboard-sized basement after taking cover from Ukrainian drones. He looks so thin that his ribs are visible.

Dubandlela, 56, declined to let his full name or that of his son be used in this article over fears for his son's safety.

He said his son had told him that he and other South African recruits spent all day digging trenches in the freezing cold.

"Sometimes there's no food, even for a week; sometimes no water," Dubandlela said.

He said his son often cried on the phone.

"'I want to come back home...Please, Daddy, talk to someone'," he quoted his son as saying.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm some aspects of the accounts provided in interviews by Dubandlela and two South African recruits interviewed by telephone from Donbas.

Much of the Donbas region is now controlled by Russian forces and fighting has been heavy there since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

The scam that Dubandlela said ensnared his son came to light on November 6, when South Africa said it had received distress calls from 17 men aged between 20 and 39 who said they were trapped in Donbas.

An investigation into the scam by an elite police unit known as "Hawks" focused on the alleged involvement of one of former President Jacob Zuma's daughters, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla.

Zuma-Sambudla later resigned as lawmaker in the Umkhonto weSizwe opposition party led by her father. She has denied knowing of the scam.

Zuma-Sambudla did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Her lawyer, Dali Mpofu, declined to comment.

In a police affidavit on November 24, she said she had been "a victim of deception". Her party told a press conference four days later that her resignation was not an admission of guilt, that it had nothing to do with the scam.

A police spokesperson said they are treating the probe, which is active and ongoing, as a suspected crime against the state, because it is unlawful for South Africans to provide unauthorised military assistance to foreign states, armed groups or mercenaries.

Days after arriving in Russia on July 11, the 17 recruits were presented with contracts in Russian in the southern city of Rostov-on-Don, two recruits told Reuters by telephone from Donbas.

They were reluctant to sign, because there was no translator available, but said that Zuma-Sambudla, who was present, persuaded them to do so, saying they were contracts for security training, both recruits said.

Zuma-Sambudla did not respond to a Reuters request for comment about her presence at the meeting in Donbas.

When the recruits found out they were going to war, "we were shocked," one told Reuters by telephone from Donbas.

In August, both South African recruits said, they were told they were going to war.

WhatsApp exchanges shared with Reuters between one of the recruits and Zuma-Sambudla - on her verified account with her phone number and picture - show a message in which the recruit says "as we speak now, we are packing and preparing to move to war."

"It's not the front line. They are just scaring you," comes the reply from a person whose identity Reuters could not establish, and an explanation that the recruits will "only patrol."

"Ok, now they are taking our stuff, like bank cards and phones," writes the recruit, who is told: "it's fine, there's no stress".

The recruit who shared the exchange with Reuters is a 40-year-old South African bodyguard with children of 17, 11 and 3 who declined to be identified for safety reasons. He said the exchanges with Zuma-Sambudla happened in the late morning of August 28. Zuma-Sambudla did not respond to Reuters' queries about the messages.

The man said he and the other recruits frequently had their phones taken off them and often ate just bread and tinned fish.

They loaded artillery shells into launchers, had basic military equipment and feared for their lives, he said. The man said he was in Donbas when Reuters last spoke to him on Dec. 18.

It is not just South Africans who unwittingly ended up in Ukraine's war. Kenya said on Nov. 12 over 200 of its citizens were fighting for Russia in Ukraine, and that recruiting agencies were still actively working to lure more Kenyans into the conflict. Authorities in Botswana have said two men were duped into joining the war under false promises of jobs.

Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to a written request for comment. Russia does not comment on foreign mercenaries fighting in Ukraine.

Ukraine's foreign minister said last month that more than 1,400 citizens from three dozen African countries were fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. Russia does not provide details of non-Russians fighting in Ukraine.

Among those who went to fight, in August, was 22-year-old Kenyan David Kuloba. His mother, Susan, shared a copy of his contract in Russian with Reuters.

David agreed to "voluntarily ... enter military service for the period stipulated by this contract period, ... be true to the military oath, selflessly serve the Russian people, and courageously and capably defend the Russian Federation," the contract states.

When he realised he would be sent to Ukraine, he reassured his mother he'd be safe, she told Reuters.

That was the last she heard from him.

Responding on Friday to Reuters questions on David's whereabouts, a spokesperson for the Kenyan foreign ministry said "investigations are still ongoing and multi-agency-led (so) we can are only await more details."

Yet on September 30, Susan received a voice message from one of David's fellow combatants on WhatsApp who had witnessed what happened: David was killed in an explosion on the front line.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:48:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I7E4F5ZT4NIZVHK5OCFO7IPETQ.jpg?auth=212856efc4a6904a713bded991d71d1ee7d788c421b1d1e12a8bfa663120c13c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: China likely loaded more than 100 ICBMs in silo fields, Pentagon report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-likely-loaded-more-than-100-icbms-silo-fields-pentagon-report-says-2025-12-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - China is likely to have loaded more than 100 intercontinental ballistic missiles across three silo fields and has no desire for arms control talks, according to a draft Pentagon report which highlighted Beijing's growing military ambitions.

China is expanding and modernizing its weapons stockpile faster than any other nuclear-armed power. Beijing has described reports of a military buildup as efforts to "smear and defame China and deliberately mislead the international community."

Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump said that he may be working on a plan to denuclearize with China and Russia. But the draft Pentagon report, which was seen by Reuters, said Beijing did not appear to be interested.

"We continue to see no appetite from Beijing for pursuing such measures or more comprehensive arms control discussions," the report said.

In particular, the report said that China had likely put in more than 100 solid-fuelled DF-31 ICBMs in silo fields close to China's border with Mongolia - the latest in a series of silo sites. The Pentagon had previously reported the existence of the fields but not the number of missiles loaded.

The Pentagon and China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The draft Pentagon report did not identify any potential target of the reported newly placed missiles. U.S. officials noted that the report could change before it was sent to lawmakers.

The report said China's nuclear warhead stockpile was still in the low 600s in 2024, which reflected "a slower rate of production when compared to previous years."

But the report added that China's nuclear expansion was ongoing and it was on track to have over 1,000 warheads by 2030.

China has said it adheres to a "nuclear strategy of self-defense and pursues a no-first-use policy."

Trump has said he wants the United States to resume nuclear weapons testing , but it is unclear what form that will take.

The wide-ranging Pentagon report detailed China's military build-up and said that "China expects to be able to fight and win a war on Taiwan by the end of 2027."

China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has never renounced use of force to "reunify" with the island.

Beijing was refining its military options to take Taiwan by "brute force," the report said, adding that one option could include strikes 1,500-2,000 nautical miles from China.

"In sufficient volume, these strikes could seriously challenge and disrupt U.S. presence in or around a conflict in the Asia-Pacific region," it added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:48:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ARBGVIKABBOCVIJD2CIVGM34R4.jpg?auth=f2bb5c093199256fe0a963141fbd64e359201f8d140dbb77933469369063feb4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan strikes $4 billion deal to sell weapons to Libyan force, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-strikes-4-billion-deal-sell-weapons-libyan-force-officials-say-2025-12-22/</link><description>KARACHI, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Pakistan has reached a deal worth over $4 billion to sell military equipment to the Libyan National Army, four Pakistani officials said, despite a U.N. arms embargo on the fractured North African country.

The deal, one of Pakistan's largest-ever weapons sales, was finalised after a meeting last week between Pakistan military chief Field Marshal Asim Munir and Saddam Khalifa Haftar, deputy commander-in-chief of the LNA, in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, said the four officials.

The officials, all involved in defence matters, declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the deal.

Pakistan's foreign ministry, defence ministry and military did not respond to requests for comment.

Any arms agreement with the LNA is likely to face scrutiny given Libya's long-running instability following a 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi and split the country between rival authorities.

A copy of the deal before it was finalised that was seen by Reuters listed the purchase of 16 JF-17 fighter jets, a multi-role combat aircraft that has been jointly developed by Pakistan and China, and 12 Super Mushak trainer aircraft, used for basic pilot training.

One of the Pakistani officials confirmed the list was accurate while a second official said the arms on the list were all part of the deal but could not provide exact numbers.

One of the Pakistani officials said the deal included the sale of equipment for land, sea and air, spread over 2-1/2 years, adding it could also include the JF-17 fighter jets. Two of the officials said the deal was valued at more than $4 billion, while the other two said it amounted to $4.6 billion.

The LNA's official media channel reported on Sunday that the faction had entered a defence cooperation pact with Pakistan, which included weapons sales, joint training and military manufacturing, without providing details.

"We announce the launch of a new phase of strategic military cooperation with Pakistan," Haftar said in remarks broadcast on Sunday by Al-Hadath television.

Authorities in Benghazi also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The U.N.-recognised Government of National Unity, led by Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah, controls much of western Libya, while Haftar's LNA controls the east and south, including major oilfields, and does not recognise the western government's authority.

Libya has been subject to a U.N. arms embargo since 2011, requiring approval from the U.N. for transfers of weapons and related material.

A panel of experts , opens new tab said in a December 2024 report to the U.N. that the arms embargo on Libya remained "ineffective". The panel said some foreign states had become increasingly open about providing military training and assistance to forces in both eastern and western Libya despite the restrictions.

It was not immediately clear whether Pakistan or Libya had applied for any exemptions to the U.N. embargo.

Three of the Pakistani officials said the deal had not broken any U.N. weapons embargo.

One of the officials said Pakistan is not the only one to make deals with Libya; another said there are no sanctions on Haftar; and a third said Benghazi authorities are witnessing better relations with Western governments, given rising fuel exports.

Pakistan has been seeking to expand defence exports, drawing on decades of counterinsurgency experience and a domestic defence industry that spans aircraft production and overhaul, armoured vehicles, munitions and naval construction.

Islamabad has cited its Air Force's performance in clashes with India in May.

"Our recent war with India demonstrated our advanced capabilities to the world," military chief Munir said in remarks broadcast by Al-Hadath on Sunday.

Pakistan markets the Chinese co-developed JF-17 as a lower-cost multi-role fighter and has positioned itself as a supplier able to offer aircraft, training and maintenance outside Western supply chains.

Pakistan has also been deepening security ties with Gulf partners, signing a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement with Saudi Arabia , opens new tab in September 2025 and holding senior-level defence talks with Qatar.

The Libya deal would expand Pakistan's footprint in North Africa as regional and international powers compete for influence over Libya's fragmented security institutions and oil-backed economy.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:48:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QGBLPVRD7JI6LONVYIPLFFJG44.jpg?auth=1e700cd8ae2885d58650f66a1a2e9bc5ab24fa8f3208d041e14e8964a13fb8d4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodia says Thailand launched air strikes after ASEAN met on border clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251222-cambodia-says-thailand-launched-air-strikes-after-asean-met-on-border-clashes</link><description>Cambodia said Thailand launched air strikes on its territory on Monday, shortly after Bangkok announced the two nations had agreed to hold talks this week aimed at halting deadly border clashes.

Renewed fighting this month shattered a previous truce and has killed at least 23 people in Thailand and 20 in Cambodia, while more than 900,000 have been displaced on both sides, officials said.

Thailand's Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow announced the planned bilateral parley after a meeting in Kuala Lumpur with his counterparts from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ), of which Cambodia is also a member.

He told reporters that the discussion would be held Wednesday in Thailand's Chanthaburi, within the framework of an existing bilateral border committee.

But just hours after the regional crisis talks were held in Malaysia, Cambodia's defence ministry said the Thai military deployed fighter jets to bomb areas of Siem Reap and Preah Vihear provinces.

Siem Reap province is the home of Cambodia's famed Angkor temple complex, a UNESCO heritage site. Its top tourist attraction, Angkor Wat, sits just over an hour's drive from Srae Nouy commune, parts of which were bombarded according to Phnom Penh.

The Thai army said Cambodia fired dozens of rockets into Thailand on Monday, with Bangkok's air force responding with air strikes on two Cambodian military targets.

Despite the cross-border fire, Cambodia's interior ministry said it remains "optimistic that the Thai side will demonstrate sincerity" in implementing a ceasefire.

Thailand's Sihasak, however, cautioned that the upcoming meeting may not immediately produce a truce.

"Our position is a ceasefire does not come with an announcement, but must come from actions," he said.

His ministry said the two nations' militaries would "discuss implementation, related steps and verification of the ceasefire in detail".

Monday's meeting was convened by ASEAN chair Malaysia, which in late October hosted a summit where a truce declaration was signed under the auspices of US President Donald Trump .

Sihasak said that the October declaration was rushed.

"The United States wanted the declaration signed in time by the visit of President Trump," he said.

"Sometimes we really need to sit down and thrash things out so that things that we agree will really hold."

Speaking at the start of Monday's meeting, Malaysia's Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan urged the feuding neighbours and other ASEAN representatives to "give this matter our most urgent attention".

"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation for the people we serve," Mohamad said.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said last week that ASEAN must "press upon them (Thailand and Cambodia) that it is imperative for them to secure peace".

Each side has blamed the other for instigating the renewed clashes, claiming self-defence and trading accusations of attacks on civilians.

The conflict stems from a territorial dispute over the colonial-era demarcation of their 800-kilometre border and a smattering of ancient temple ruins situated on the frontier.

As well as the air strikes, Phnom Penh's defence ministry accused Thailand of firing artillery shells into Cambodian territory.

One civilian, a Chinese mining company worker, was wounded, Cambodia's interior ministry said.

Beijing earlier on Monday expressed hope that the two sides would "come to a ceasefire as soon as possible".

The October joint declaration overseen by Trump was meant to prolong a fragile truce reached after five days of deadly clashes in July.

Ahead of the talks in Kuala Lumpur, Cambodia said it would "reaffirm its firm position of resolving differences and disputes through all peaceful means, dialogue and diplomacy".

Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak had reiterated Bangkok's conditions for negotiations, including a demand that Cambodia announce a truce first and cooperate in de-mining efforts at the border.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said that Washington hoped for a new ceasefire by early this week.

Trump, whose administration helped broker the previous truce alongside Malaysia and China, claimed this month that Thailand and Cambodia had agreed to halt the fighting.

But Bangkok denied any such deal, with clashes continuing for two weeks and spreading to nearly all border provinces on both sides of the frontier.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 14:49:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8cfb814a-df39-11f0-9525-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25356421063475.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cyberattack disrupts France's postal service during Christmas rush</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251222-cyberattack-disrupts-france-s-postal-service-during-christmas-rush</link><description>A suspected cyberattack knocked France’s national postal service and its banking arm offline Monday, blocking and delaying package deliveries and online payments at the height of the busy Christmas season.

The postal service, called La Poste , said in a statement that a distributed denial of service incident, or DDoS, “rendered its online services inaccessible”. It said the incident had no impact on customer data, but disrupted package and mail delivery.

At a Paris post office decked out in holiday garlands and usually bustling this time of year, employees turned away frustrated customers lining up to send or retrieve packages, including Christmas gifts.

Customers of the company’s banking arm, La Banque Postale , were blocked from using the application to approve payments or conduct other banking services. The bank redirected approvals to text messages instead.

“Our teams are mobilised to resolve the situation quickly,” the bank said in messages posted on social networks.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility.

It came a week after France’s government was targeted by a cyberattack that disrupted the Interior Ministry, in charge of national security.

In that incident, a suspected hacker extracted a few dozen sensitive files and obtained access to data relating to police records and wanted persons, Interior Minister Laurent Nuñez said on broadcaster France-Info. He blamed “imprudence” at the ministry for the incident. French media reported that a 22-year-old was detained.

Also, last week, prosecutors said that France’s counterespionage agency is investigating a suspected cyberattack plot involving software that would have allowed remote users to control the computer systems of an international passenger ferry. A Latvian crew member is in custody facing charges of having acted for an unidentified foreign power, officials said.

France and other European allies of Ukraine allege that Russia is waging “hybrid warfare” against them, using sabotage, assassinations, cyberattacks, disinformation and other hostile acts that are often hard to quickly trace back to Moscow.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 15:23:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ebd356ac-df43-11f0-b3d2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25238359922737.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador soldiers sentenced to decades in prison over disappearance of murdered boys</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-soldiers-sentenced-decades-prison-over-disappearance-murdered-boys-2025-12-22/</link><description>QUITO, Dec 22 (Reuters) - An Ecuadorean court on Monday sentenced 11 of 17 soldiers to more than 34 years in prison over the forced disappearance of four boys aged 11 to 15 during security operations in the South American nation's largest city, Guayaquil, last year.

Judge Ana Barao said the poster "attacks an ethnic minority," and she gave Andre Ventura 24 hours to remove them or face a daily fine of 2,500 euros ($2,940) per poster.

The anti-immigration, anti-establishment Chega emerged just six years ago and in May became the second-largest parliamentary force after the ruling centre-right alliance.

"(The posters) aggravate the stigma and prejudice that Roma communities already face in Portuguese society in general, thus fostering intolerance, segregation, discrimination and, ultimately, hatred," Barao wrote in her ruling.

Ventura has called the court case an "attack on freedom of expression", but last week promised to comply with whatever the court decided. A Chega spokesperson said Ventura would respond later.

Ricardo Sa Fernandes, the lawyer representing the Roma associations that filed the complaint, said the decision would help make Portugal "more just and decent", calling it "a victory for the resistance" of the Roma.

In May, Portuguese prosecutors opened an investigation into discriminatory remarks against Roma made by Ventura.

Recent opinion polls place Ventura, who campaigns on a promise to fight corruption, among the frontrunners in the first round of Portugal's presidential election on Jan. 18.

Polls also indicate he would lose to any of his three main rivals in a runoff vote.

In his first interview with international media since declaring his presidential ambitions earlier this month, the senator said he was planning to travel abroad in January. Stops may include the United States, Argentina, Chile, Israel, Europe and the Middle East.

Elected to Brazil's Senate in 2018 on the conservative wave that brought his father to the presidency, he vowed to take up the mantle of the elder Bolsonaro's market-friendly reforms while distancing himself from right-wing culture wars.

"I consider myself, truly, a more centered Bolsonaro," he said in a Friday afternoon interview from his Brasilia office, decorated with miniatures of his father and U.S. President Donald Trump. "I've always had this profile: being more moderate, more measured."

Since winning the endorsement of his father , now serving a 27-year sentence for a failed coup plot , Senator Bolsonaro, 44, has pitched himself to business leaders as a conservative candidate without baggage on topics such as COVID-19 vaccines.

"I am a Bolsonaro who got vaccinated. I took two doses of AstraZeneca, and my father preferred not to," he said.

News of the younger Bolsonaro's candidacy this month rattled financial markets. Investors had bet the ex-president would back a more seasoned candidate such as Sao Paulo Governor Tarcisio de Freitas , his former infrastructure minister, to head off a fourth term from leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

Evangelical firebrand Pastor Silas Malafaia, one of his father's key counselors, has also cast doubt on the senator's "political muscle."

While the senator acknowledged skepticism from some political allies, he insisted he can unite the right and deliver a bold pro-market agenda, prioritizing "fiscal balance, reduced public spending, modernization of the State and an obsession with lower taxes."

Recent polls show him leading a crowded field of right-wing presidential hopefuls, but lagging 80-year-old Lula in a potential runoff.

Senator Bolsonaro said his economic views include cutting taxes, modernizing the state, and privatizations to energize Latin America's largest economy, which could include the debt-laden Brazilian postal service.

He also suggested a closer look at the holdings of state-run oil company Petrobras to potentially divest assets and streamline operations, as management did under his father.

"It's a large conglomerate of companies," he said of the oil firm. "We need to see what works and should continue, and what doesn't work."

The senator said he also saw room to shake up Brazil's commercial aviation market with fresh competition to improve services and prices.

"Today you practically have two or three airlines operating in Brazil, which is very few," he said.

For his own foreign travel next month, he said his itinerary is being organized by his brother Eduardo Bolsonaro, who lost his status as federal lawmaker after moving to the United States to urge a policy response to his father's trial.

The senator said it was still unclear if he would meet with senior U.S. officials on the trip. However, he would like to meet with Trump, he noted, and hopes to invite him to the January 2027 inauguration if he wins next October's election.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6YZOIPYXJVLA3K7AJBTCUT7K7U.jpg?auth=b2e6aa4b1f601b353216aab870c885b09a820a36b05cc7fac86a3bb8f624d71a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italian prosecutors ask to drop case of suspected Russian drone flyovers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italian-prosecutors-ask-drop-case-suspected-russian-drone-flyovers-2025-12-22/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 16:54:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump pulls 30 envoys in ‘America First’ push, critics say it weakens US leadership</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-pulls-30-envoys-america-first-push-critics-say-it-weakens-us-leadership-2025-12-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is recalling nearly 30 ambassadors and other senior career diplomats to ensure embassies reflect its “America First” priorities, a move critics said would weaken U.S. leadership in the world.

The State Department declined to provide a list of the diplomats being recalled. A senior department official said on Monday the move was "a standard process in any administration" but critics said that wasn't so.

"An ambassador is a personal representative of the President, and it is the President’s right to ensure that he has individuals in these countries who advance the America First agenda," said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Nearly 30 senior diplomats were among those ordered back to Washington, people familiar with the matter said.

They were posted to smaller countries where the top U.S. representative has traditionally been from the Foreign Service, which is made up of career officials not aligned with a political party, the people said.

The recalled diplomats were encouraged to find new roles in the State Department, a second U.S. official said.

Trump has sought to place loyalists in senior roles since starting his second term after encountering resistance during his first term advancing his foreign policy priorities within the U.S. national security establishment.

Jeanne Shaheen, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, assailed the Republican administration's removal of the diplomats while about 80 ambassadorial posts remain vacant.

"President Trump is giving away U.S. leadership to China and Russia by removing qualified career Ambassadors who serve faithfully no matter who's in power," Shaheen posted on X. "This makes America less safe, less strong and less prosperous."</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:19:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IJR273B4RBNXHGOCXUMHN5YYW4.jpg?auth=33f6e1048905cd59dabbb9bcb82195072afa8c0e9925ef7fad0b7dfab27a8754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US conducting surveillance flights over Nigeria after Trump intervention threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-conducting-surveillance-flights-over-nigeria-after-trump-intervention-threat-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. has been conducting intelligence-gathering flights over large parts of Nigeria since late November, according to flight tracking data and current and former U.S. officials, in a sign of increased security cooperation between the countries.

Reuters could not determine what information the flights are meant to obtain.

But the flights in West Africa follow U.S. President Donald Trump's threats in November to militarily intervene in Nigeria over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities. The flights also are occurring just months after a U.S. pilot working for a missionary agency was kidnapped in neighboring Niger.

The U.S. contractor-operated aircraft used for the surveillance operations typically takes off from Ghana and flies over Nigeria before returning to Accra, the Ghanaian capital, the tracking data for December shows.

Flight tracking data shows the operator is Mississippi-based Tenax Aerospace, which provides special mission aircraft and works closely with the U.S. military, according to the company's website. Tenax Aerospace did not respond to a request for comment.

Liam Karr, the Africa Team Lead for the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute, has analyzed the flight data. He said the operation appeared to be running out of an airport in Accra, a known hub for the U.S. military's logistics network in Africa.

Karr said the operation was an early sign the U.S. was rebuilding its capacity in the region after Niger ordered U.S. troops to leave a sprawling, newly built air base in the desert last year, and turned instead to Russia for security assistance.

"In recent weeks we've seen a resumption of intelligence and surveillance flights in Nigeria," Karr said in an interview.

A former U.S. official said the aircraft is among several assets the Trump administration moved to Ghana in November. It is unclear how many aircraft remain in Ghana, but the former official said the missions include tracking down the kidnapped U.S. pilot and gathering intelligence on militant groups operating in Nigeria. Boko Haram and its splinter organization, Islamic State West Africa Province, are among the militant groups operating in Nigeria.

A current U.S. official confirmed the aircraft has been flying over Nigeria but declined to provide details given the diplomatic sensitivity of the issue.

A separate administration official said Washington was continuing to work with Nigeria to "address religious violence, anti-Christian attacks, and the destabilizing spread of terrorism."

The former U.S. official and the current administration officials all spoke on condition of anonymity.

In a statement, the Pentagon said the U.S. government held productive meetings with Nigeria following Trump's message about the country, but declined to discuss intelligence matters.

Nigeria's military spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment. Ghana's deputy defense minister also did not respond to a request for comment.

Nigeria's government has said armed groups target both Muslims and Christians and that U.S. claims that Christians face persecution do not represent a complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But it has agreed to work with the U.S. to bolster its forces against militant groups.

The country's population is split between Muslims living primarily in the north and Christians in the south.

A Nigerian security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. agreed in a November 20 meeting between Nigerian National Security Advisor Nuhu Ribadu and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy air assets to gather intelligence. A spokesperson for the Nigerian military did not respond to requests for comment.

The Tenax Aerospace aircraft was seen on November 7 by flight tracking data at MacDill Air Force Base, which is home to the headquarters of the United States Special Operations Command in Tampa, Florida. It flew to Ghana on November 24, just days after the high-level meeting between U.S. and Nigerian security officials, according to flight tracking data.

The data shows the aircraft has flown over Nigeria almost daily since the start of the operation. The aircraft is a Gulfstream V, a long-range business jet often modified for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions, according to the data.

Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu declared a security emergency last month and ordered the army and police to begin mass recruitment to tackle worsening armed violence across the country.

That move followed attacks in multiple Nigerian states where civilians were killed and kidnapped, and the mass abduction of more than 300 schoolchildren in northern Nigeria.

The U.S. meanwhile has taken steps to punish Nigeria for its perceived failure to protect Christians.

In October, Trump added Nigeria back onto a list of countries that the U.S. says have violated religious freedom. This week, Nigeria was added to the U.S. travel ban list of countries facing partial restrictions and entry limitations.

Trump has also asked the Defense Department to prepare for possible "fast" military action in Nigeria if the West African nation fails to crack down on the killing of Christians.

The U.S. and Nigeria have established a joint task force to work on security, according to Republican U.S. Representative Riley Moore, who recently traveled to the African country.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:19:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VNQQIB3TF5IE7GT65BA3PLM55I.jpg?auth=c054701426f305509128eab9230e153023caef0cb25effe670882058ad859e88&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Oil loading in Venezuela slows, more ships make U-turns after new US interceptions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-loading-venezuela-slows-more-ships-make-u-turns-after-new-us-interceptions-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - Tanker loading in Venezuela dwindled on Monday, with most ships moving oil cargoes only between domestic ports following U.S. action against two more ships and as state-run energy company PDVSA struggles to recover from a cyberattack, according to tracking data and sources.

The U.S. Coast Guard this month seized a supertanker under sanctions carrying Venezuelan oil and tried to intercept two more Venezuela-related ships over the weekend, U.S. authorities said. One of them is an empty ship under U.S. sanctions, and the other is an unsanctioned, fully loaded tanker bound for China.

Washington has not provided updated information on the ships. U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced a blockade of all oil tankers under sanctions entering and leaving Venezuela. Trump's pressure campaign on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels the U.S. alleges are transporting drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation. At least 100 people have been killed.

The vessel interceptions have dealt the toughest blow to PDVSA since the U.S. Treasury Department in 2020 imposed sanctions on the company's former oil trading firms, two units of Russia's Rosneft (ROSN.MM) , opens new tab , which forced output and export cuts.

Brent crude futures gained 2.17% to $61.78 a barrel on Monday, while U.S. WTI crude rose 2.2% to $57.77 following the U.S. actions and amid Russia's war against Ukraine, with both developments raising fears of supply disruptions.

As of Monday, PDVSA had delivered a 1.9 million-barrel cargo of heavy crude to the Aruba-flagged sanctioned vessel Azure Voyager at the Jose port, but no other supertanker bound for Asia was scheduled to load soon, internal company documents showed.

The number of loaded tankers that have not departed has increased in recent days, leaving millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil stuck in ships, while customers demand deeper discounts and contract changes to take risky voyages beyond the country's waters.

Some tankers approaching Venezuela's coast, either to load oil for export or to deliver imported naphtha, have also made U-turns or suspended navigation recently until instructions from owners to load are clarified, LSEG monitoring data showed on Monday.

PDVSA is slowly restoring some online systems and resorting to written records after a cyberattack last week. The company has been unable to fully re-establish its centralized administrative system, and many workers have not received their salaries on time, sources said.

PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry have not replied to requests for comment. The country's Foreign Affairs Minister, Yvan Gil, said on Monday the U.S. seizures are against international law and constitute "acts of piracy."

China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday the recent U.S. interceptions were a serious violation of international law.

PDVSA's main joint-venture partner Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab exported a 500,000-barrel cargo of Venezuelan oil on Sunday, bound for the U.S. Gulf Coast on one of its tankers under its U.S. authorization, LSEG ship data showed.

Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez said on Sunday Venezuela had not interrupted deliveries to Chevron, in a social media post that included a video of Venezuela's maritime authority overseeing the ship's departure.

Chevron has exported seven cargoes of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. this month, each carrying between 300,000 and 500,000 barrels, according to monitoring data.

PURSUED BY THE U.S.

The Panama-flagged empty supertanker Bella 1, which the U.S. Coast Guard tried to intercept on Sunday when the ship approached Venezuela, was drifting on Monday northeast of Bermuda in the Caribbean, a satellite image obtained by TankerTrackers.com showed.

A U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday the tanker had not been boarded and that interceptions could take different forms - including by sailing or flying close to vessels of concern.

The loaded vessel Skipper, the first seized by the U.S. this month, reached an area near the Galveston, Texas, port for transferring oil cargoes on Sunday, maritime sources said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:21:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CVBZYQBNINP7VJAMMALLMUNEBQ.jpg?auth=45306d2045731e087a972233966d6b07c02c11dc9ed2faf620353af1e6161c1e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Oil loading in Venezuela slows, more ships make U-turns after new US interceptions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-loading-venezuela-slows-more-ships-make-u-turns-after-new-us-interceptions-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - Tanker loading in Venezuela dwindled on Monday, with most ships moving oil cargoes only between domestic ports following U.S. action against two more ships and as state-run energy company PDVSA struggles to recover from a cyberattack, according to tracking data and sources.

PDVSA is slowly restoring some online systems and resorting to written records after a cyberattack last week. The company has been unable to fully re-establish its centralized administrative system, and many workers have not received their salaries on time, sources said.

PDVSA and Venezuela's Oil Ministry have not replied to requests for comment. The country's Foreign Affairs Minister, Yvan Gil, said on Monday the U.S. seizures are against international law and constitute "acts of piracy."

China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday the recent U.S. interceptions were a serious violation of international law.

PDVSA's main joint-venture partner Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab exported a 500,000-barrel cargo of Venezuelan oil on Sunday, bound for the U.S. Gulf Coast on one of its tankers under its U.S. authorization, LSEG ship data showed.

Oil Minister Delcy Rodriguez said on Sunday Venezuela had not interrupted deliveries to Chevron, in a social media post that included a video of Venezuela's maritime authority overseeing the ship's departure.

Chevron has exported seven cargoes of Venezuelan oil to the U.S. this month, each carrying between 300,000 and 500,000 barrels, according to monitoring data.

PURSUED BY THE U.S.

The Panama-flagged empty supertanker Bella 1, which the U.S. Coast Guard tried to intercept on Sunday when the ship approached Venezuela, was drifting on Monday northeast of Bermuda in the Caribbean, a satellite image obtained by TankerTrackers.com showed.

A U.S. official told Reuters on Sunday the tanker had not been boarded and that interceptions could take different forms - including by sailing or flying close to vessels of concern.

The loaded vessel Skipper, the first seized by the U.S. this month, reached an area near the Galveston, Texas, port for transferring oil cargoes on Sunday, maritime sources said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 17:26:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CVBZYQBNINP7VJAMMALLMUNEBQ.jpg?auth=45306d2045731e087a972233966d6b07c02c11dc9ed2faf620353af1e6161c1e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Barry Manilow shares cancer diagnosis as surgery prompts concert cancellations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/barry-manilow-shares-cancer-diagnosis-surgery-prompts-concert-cancellations-2025-12-22/</link><description>LOS ANGELES, Dec 22 (Reuters) - U.S singer-songwriter Barry Manilow announced on Monday through Instagram that he has been diagnosed with lung cancer, prompting him to pause his scheduled concerts while he undergoes surgery.

"As many of you know I recently went through six weeks of bronchitis followed by a relapse of another five weeks," the 82-year-old Grammy-winner wrote in the Instagram statement.

"Even though I was over the bronchitis and back on stage at the Westgate Las Vegas, my wonderful doctor ordered an MRI just to make sure that everything was OK. The MRI discovered a cancerous spot on my left lung that needs to be removed," he said.

Manilow included the new schedule for his concerts in his post, and said he expects to be feeling better by February since his treatment does not require radiation or chemotherapy.

"Just chicken soup and 'I Love Lucy' reruns," Manilow wrote, referring to a classic U.S. sitcom.

The singer ended his post by urging people to get tested if they have any health concerns.

Manilow, whose hits include songs "Mandy", "Copacabana" and "Can't Smile Without You," has a career spanning over 60 years.

He attended the New York College of Music and the Juilliard School, where he studied musical theatre.

Apart from being a songwriter, Manilow has also worked on numerous films, Broadway shows and television productions.

His acting included roles in the film "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" and the television shows "Family Guy" and "Will and Grace."

Manilow married his high-school sweetheart, Susan Deixler, in 1964, but the marriage was short-lived.

In 2017, he spoke for the first time about being gay and his previously secret, almost 40-year romance with husband Garry Kief, saying he feared he would disappoint his mostly female fan base had he come out decades ago.

Manilow and his manager Kief, whom he met in 1978, had been together for years before marrying quietly in Palm Springs, California, in 2014.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 18:32:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OAXV6KJSMRMINAUKOKD7YYZ3AM.jpg?auth=4df1de7319e938a18ed30cbaa3ea907efb4bfa3da89210e493ba0b7ecbf1e5ce&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanese PM urges swift approval of law aimed at paying back depositors</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanese-pm-urges-swift-approval-law-aimed-paying-back-depositors-2025-12-22/</link><description>BEIRUT, Dec 22 - Lebanese Prime Minister Nawaf Salam urged cabinet to swiftly approve a draft law allowing depositors to gradually recover funds frozen in the banking system since a financial collapse in 2019, a move critical to reviving the economy.

The collapse - the result of decades of unsustainable financial policies, waste and corruption - led the state to default on its sovereign debt and sank the Lebanese pound.

The draft law marks the first time Beirut has put forward legislation aimed at addressing a vast funding shortfall - estimated at $70 billion in 2022 but now believed to be higher.

The cabinet approved several articles on Monday. Discussions would continue on Tuesday, Information Minister Paul Morcos said. Lebanon's divided parliament must pass the law after cabinet approval.

Salam said the law is realistic and its goal is to do "justice to depositors", also spurring recovery in the banking sector.

Finance Minister Yassine Jaber told Reuters implementation of the law would boost the economy, pumping deposits of $3-$4 billion annually into the system.

The draft, published on Friday, foresees repayments to small depositors – those with deposits valued at less than $100,000 – in monthly or quarterly instalments over four years.

Deposits larger than $100,000 will be repaid via tradable, asset-backed securities to be issued by the central bank or Banque du Liban (BdL), with no less than 2% of the value paid annually.

The maturity period will be set at 10 years for deposits valued at up to $1 million, at 15 years for deposits valued from $1 million to $5 million, and at 20 years for deposits valued at more than $5 million.

The securities will be backed by the income, revenues and returns of BdL-owned assets and any proceeds from the sale of assets, if any occur. The draft mentions precious metals, which have soared in value this year, as one possible source of income.

It says commercial banks will bear 20% of the responsibility for payments for the asset-backed securities. It says BdL and commercial banks will jointly finance the payments of the small deposits, with BdL's share not exceeding 60%.

Debt owed by the state to BdL will be converted into a bond whose maturity and interest rate would be agreed between the finance ministry and BdL.

The Association of Banks in Lebanon has objected to the draft, saying on Sunday that the proposals do not reflect banks' ability to meet "their obligations towards depositors" and that the state was not "fulfilling its outstanding debts to BdL".

Mike Azar, an expert on the financial system, said the law appeared to be intentionally vague on politically sensitive but critical questions.

"For example, what happens if the BdL or the banks can’t pay what they owe to depositors," he said.

Swapping deposits for asset-backed securities issued by BdL could imply a big "contingent state debt," he said. The government has yet to provide quantitative analysis underpinning the plan, including deposit repayment amounts, sources of funding, and bank recapitalization needs, he added.

Jaber noted that the value of BdL's gold assets had risen with the price of gold since 2020, which would help provide confidence in the asset-backed securities.

The law requires an international auditing firm to evaluate BdL's assets within one month to determine the size of the funding shortfall. Banks must also conduct an asset quality review and recapitalize.

The law would write off some dollar deposits.

These would include deposits that resulted from funds being converted into dollars from pounds at the official exchange rate long after it had collapsed as well as deposits containing illicit funds, in accordance with a law to counter money-laundering and financing for terrorism.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 18:32:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PPAWP6YO25IZ5O42BJRU3ZYITA.jpg?auth=02a1bec36f13587c3d6084429f9236a2fa98141f11a32cd8bdd2cbd33e568547&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘It was like being under house arrest’: Tanzania’s opposition fears mounting crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/the-observers/20251222-tanzania-opposition-crackdown-fear-elections</link><description>Tanzania marked its Independence Day on December 9 with a security clampdown. Videos from the economic capital, Dar es Salaam, show completely empty streets.

This came after Tanzania’s prime minister urged citizens to stay home on this day of celebration. In the preceding days, calls to protest on December 9 had circulated widely on social media – demonstrations that the Tanzanian Home Affairs Minister labelled "unlawful" and described as an “attempted coup".

The FRANCE 24 Observers team spoke to a resident of Dar es Salaam who's a member of an opposition party. For security reasons, we are identifying her only as “Amina”.

“It was a bad day for everyone. It was like being under house arrest. The police were asking for IDs. If you wanted to go out, you had to prove you had a valid reason.

I call it house arrest because every intersection had six police officers ready to intervene, in riot gear and heavily armed. I saw them when I went out for groceries the day before, on December 8. The whole idea was to prevent us from moving or doing anything. "

Footage captured by local media outlets corroborates Amina’s account, showing armed police officers conducting identity checks in the economic capital.

“The government is afraid because the movement is starting to organise. December 9 could have turned into a very big movement because of the organisation. There would not be enough members of the police. What happened on October 29 never happened in this generation. The movement wasn’t organised, yet people did go out, and it brought international attention.”

The October 29 date mentioned by Amina refers to the Tanzanian general elections. The main opposition party, Chadema, was banned from participating, while the Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM or “Party of the Revolution” in English) – which has held power since independence – won by a landslide according to official figures. Incumbent President and CCM candidate Samia Suluhu Hassan was credited with 97 percent of the vote.

In several cities across the country, mass protests erupted on election day as young voters took to the streets to challenge the projected reelection of Hassan. Protesters criticised her government, which is increasingly viewed as authoritarian in its treatment of political opponents and dissenting citizens.

Authorities responded with violence, cutting off internet access across the country and deploying a massive presence of military and heavily armed police in major cities. This unleashed a bloody crackdown on protesters. Boniface Mwabukusi, president of the Tanganyika Law Society, a legal association that represents people arrested during the protests, told our team:

“We can say it was just a shoot-to-kill exercise. Because some of the people were shot while retreating. Shot in their back, the back of their heads, in their stomach, on their chest.

Also, we have complaints of missing persons. More than 700 people are missing. Their bodies were seen in the morgue. But when their relatives went there trying to retrieve the bodies, they were nowhere to be found.”

Analysis of witness footage confirms the deadly crackdown on election protests. In one clip from Dar es Salaam, uniformed Tanzanian police officers are seen kneeling before opening fire. Two ballistics experts identified the weapons as assault rifles, capable of firing only lethal ammunition.

Further footage of those killed in the aftermath of the protests shows injuries consistent only with gunshot wounds.

After reviewing several videos showing casualties from the post-October 29 protests, an analyst from the defence-focused outlet Army Recognition noted:

“Regarding the various images of injuries, the impact on the victims' bodies leaves little doubt as to their cause. In one video showing a leg wound, for instance, the injury is clearly consistent with the trajectory of a projectile.”

It remains difficult to determine the exact death toll of what appears to be a bloody crackdown on post-election protests, reportedly carried out with military-grade weapons. A report released by Amnesty International on December 19 asserts that at least 80 victims are clearly visible in video footage showing piles of bodies at hospitals in the cities most affected by the unrest.

Mwabukusi told us that these figures are just a fraction of the total casualties:

“This is unprecedented also on the number of casualties. The number of casualties is more than 5,000 and we are receiving complaints of death for about 620 people.

We cannot just say that they were all demonstrators. There was a curfew from October 29, so most people were staying at their houses. Several victims were simply at home or outdoors when they were attacked.”

First-person accounts gathered by Amnesty International and several media outlets suggest that security forces attempted to intervene in hospitals, allegedly seeking to prevent protesters with gunshot wounds from receiving medical care and to conceal the true death toll. Reports indicate that both bodies and living patients were transferred to unknown locations, where they subsequently disappeared. A CNN investigation published on November 21 reveals that ground was broken at a cemetery near Dar es Salaam in early November, pointing to the possible creation of mass graves.

Hassan has announced an inquiry into the killings linked to recent protests. Authorities have yet to release an official death toll.

However, the crackdown did not end as the protests tapered off during the first few days of November. Mwabukusi said:

“There's a systematic cracking and crashing down on the opposition's or dissenting views. Immediately after the October election, tens of people have been arrested. But also there has been the continued arrest of some opposition leaders, including from the Chadema party, who are still in custody. We've been trying to represent these individuals.”

Deogratias Munishi, Chadema’s international secretary, currently based outside Tanzania, specified:

“The wave of arrests did not start only on October 29. In the build-up to October 29, a wave of arrests and incommunicado detentions was rampant in the whole of Tanzania, specifically targeting members of the Chadema party and other government critics.”

For instance, Chadema leader Tundu Lissu has been in custody since April on charges of “treason”, a crime punishable by death in Tanzania.

“Since October 29, up until now, I will say there is a specific political persecution against members of Chadema, because the arrests are still going on. It is very difficult to provide specific figures, as arrests are being made even as we speak. Several of our leaders on the ground – or rather, some of our female leaders, as they are predominantly women – have been arrested. And those who have not been arrested are hiding within the country or in nearby countries.”

For some opposition figures, detention has proven fatal. An official from the ACT-Wazalendo opposition party highlighted the grim fate of local representative Dafroza Jacob, reporting that she died as a result of her imprisonment.

“She was arrested on November 3. By November 4, she was dead. She had gone to the police station to check on those arrested on election day. The police arrested her. By noon the following day, when she was transported to the hospital, she was already dead. When her family went to see her, they found that the body was severely injured, with her teeth and joints broken. So many areas of her body were tortured very much.”

State news agency SANA, citing Aleppo's health directorate, said the civilians were killed in shelling by the SDF on residential neighbourhoods in the city.

The violence came hours after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said during a visit to Damascus that the SDF appeared to have no intention of honouring a commitment to integrate into the state's armed forces by an agreed year-end deadline.

Turkey views the U.S.-backed SDF, which controls swathes of northeastern Syria, as a terrorist organisation and has warned of military action if the group does not honour the agreement.

SANA, citing the defence ministry, reported earlier that the SDF had launched a sudden attack on security forces and the army in the Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafiyah neighbourhoods of Aleppo, resulting in injuries.

The SDF denied this and said the attack was carried out by factions affiliated with the Syrian government, and which resulted in the injury of five civilians.

The defence ministry denied the SDF's statements, saying the army was responding to sources of fire from Kurdish forces.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 19:19:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Panama says Venezuela-related tanker intercepted by US did not follow maritime rules</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/panama-says-venezuela-related-tanker-intercepted-by-us-did-not-follow-maritime-2025-12-22/</link><description>PANAMA CITY, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Panama's foreign minister said on Monday that a tanker recently intercepted by the U.S. that was under Panama's flag did not respect the country's maritime rules and had disconnected its transponder while navigating out of Venezuelan waters carrying a crude cargo.

Foreign minister Javier Martinez-Acha added in a TV interview that Panama would take measures accordingly. He did not elaborate further.

A country providing its flag to a vessel officially added to its registry can cancel the ship's registration if an investigation determines that it did not follow maritime rules.

Speaking at a joint press conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides in Jerusalem, Netanyahu said Israel was aware Iran had been conducting "exercises" recently, without elaborating.

Earlier on Monday, Iranian state media reported Iran had held missile drills in various cities during the day, the second such reported exercise in a month.

Western powers regard Iran's ballistic missile arsenal as both a conventional military threat to Middle East stability and a possible delivery mechanism for nuclear weapons should Tehran develop them. It denies any intent to build atomic bombs.

Relations between eastern Mediterranean neighbours Israel, Greece and Cyprus have grown stronger over the past decade, with shared concerns over Turkey's influence in the region.

ISRAEL NOT SEEKING CONFRONTATION: NETANYAHU

Despite "great achievements" during a 12-day war with Iran in June, Netanyahu said basic Israeli and U.S. expectations of Iran were unchanged, including lowering its uranium enrichment level.

"Obviously it will be an item in our discussions," he said of his meeting with Trump next week, adding, "We are not seeking confrontation with" Iran but rather, "stability, prosperity and peace."

Still, Netanyahu said the focus of his discussions with Trump in Washington will be on moving to the next phase of Trump's Gaza plan as well as dealing with Lebanon's Iran-based Hezbollah militants.

He cited Israel's "desire to see a stable sovereign Lebanon" and efforts to prevent the blocking of international shipping by Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi forces.

Netanyahu, Mitsotakis and Christodoulides agreed to deepen security cooperation, while Netanyahu said the three countries intended to advance an initiative to connect India to Europe via the Middle East by sea and rail.

Christodoulides described the projects as offering a "southeastern gateway connecting Europe with the Middle East and beyond."

The three countries said they would seek to advance an undersea power cable project to integrate their electricity grids with Europe and the Arabian Peninsula.

Mitsotakis said Greece was a gateway for liquefied natural gas. "(It) is a new energy hub in southeastern Europe." Interconnection projects, he said, remained a key priority for the three countries.

Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen told Reuters after the press conference the trilateral meeting was important since it comes when there are “countries that are working to uproot regional stability." He did not identify the countries.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:24:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UX3QMXQJOBOFFG2LMJ2LXGVRPA.jpg?auth=9e5b64b34d77d1249b44e5e45caf0f892b46d02c6061edd58b039bc3a690ad4e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Corruption charges spark protests against Albanian government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/corruption-charges-spark-protests-against-albanian-government-2025-12-22/</link><description>TIRANA, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Protesters in Tirana hurled petrol bombs at the government building housing Prime Minister Edi Rama's office on Monday, demanding the government's resignation after prosecutors indicted the deputy prime minister for alleged corruption.

Political tensions in Albania have escalated in recent weeks after the accusations were made against Deputy Prime Minister Belinda Balluku. Along with several officials and private companies, she has been accused of using state funds to favor some companies in major infrastructure projects.

She referred to the accusations in parliament last month as "mudslinging, insinuations, half-truths and lies," and stated that she would fully cooperate with the judiciary.

The Special Prosecution Office, tasked with combating corruption and organized crime, has requested that parliament lift Balluku's immunity this week and allow her arrest. It is not clear when the parliament, where Rama's ruling party holds a majority, is expected to vote.

As protesters threw petrol bombs on Monday, police in riot gear protected the government building but did not push back the protesters.

"We have had enough because it's a matter of tens and hundreds of millions of euros stolen, and she isn't resigning. This is disgraceful," said protester Arben Sulo.

Balluku also heads the Ministry of Infrastructure, which manages hundreds of millions of euros in projects such as roads, bridges, and tunnels.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 20:26:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UGJKQAW7PJOGXN22WTGNA2RQRU.jpg?auth=8bafee7218d24c72308153d18e584039f66cd3a8b3320147a082494ffee2773d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy says negotiations on war settlement 'close to a real result'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-says-negotiations-war-settlement-close-real-result-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that negotiations conducted with the United States and European nations aimed at ending the nearly four-year war with Russia were "very close to a real result."

Ukrainian negotiators led by senior official Rustem Umerov, along with representatives from Europe, have held a series of meetings with U.S. envoys, including in recent days in Florida.

Russian negotiator Kirill Dmitriev, President Vladimir Putin's investment envoy, has also been holding separate talks with U.S. officials in Florida.

Officials in both Ukraine and Russia said their teams were returning home on Monday to report on the outcome of the discussions.

"It all looks quite worthy ... And here it is important that this is the work of both us (Ukraine) and the United States of America. This suggests that we are very close to a real result," Zelenskiy told a gathering devoted to Ukrainian diplomats.

Zelenskiy said the negotiators had been working on a 20-point plan, put forward by U.S. envoys, which has been under discussion for weeks after an initial draft was criticised by Ukrainians and Europeans as being too slanted towards Russia.

"Not everything is ideal with this, but the plan is there," he said.

Also under discussion were security guarantees Ukraine has been seeking to guard against any future Russian military action once the fighting stops, as well as a plan for Ukraine's economic recovery.

"The basic block of all the documents is ready. It's basic," Zelenskiy said. "There are some matters for which we are not prepared. And I am certain that there are matters for which the Russians are not prepared."

The U.S. team has been led by President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Speaking later in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy said the key issue was to determine whether the United States was able to "get a response from Russia, real readiness on the part of that country to focus on something other than aggression."

He said continued pressure on the Kremlin was vital to reduce Moscow's capacity to wage war.

"Lowering the price of Russian oil, strong global sanctions and continued other forms of pressure are what can persuade even a stubborn person," he said.

"This year, much has already been done to reduce the money available to Russia's war machine."</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:40:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CQOPC53XD5MSNKKJ33BE3GSOUI.jpg?auth=c2bfe439ef3aeba00c3ddb8ef870361cfef0cf63f6a6ae731b63f2e3836fcdd8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moscow car blast kills Russian general, investigators suspect Ukraine involvement</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251222-moscow-car-blast-kills-russian-general-investigators-suspect-ukraine-involvement</link><description>A car bomb killed a Russian general on Monday, the third such killing of a senior military officer in just over a year. Investigators said Ukraine may be behind the attack.

Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, head of the Operational Training Directorate of the Russian Armed Forces' General Staff, died from his injuries, said Svetlana Petrenko, the spokesperson for Russia’s Investigative Committee, the nation's top criminal investigation agency. He was 56.

“Investigators are pursuing numerous lines of inquiry regarding the murder. One of these is that the crime was orchestrated by Ukrainian intelligence services,” Petrenko said.

Since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine nearly four years ago, Russian authorities have blamed Kyiv for several assassinations of military officers and public figures in Russia. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for some of them. It has not yet commented on Monday’s death.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Vladimir Putin had been immediately informed about the killing of Sarvarov, who fought in Chechnya and had taken part in Moscow's military campaign in Syria.

Russia has blamed a series of other apparent assassinations on Ukraine.

Just over a year ago, Lt. Gen. Igor Kirillov, the chief of the military’s nuclear, biological and chemical protection forces, was killed by a bomb hidden on an electric scooter outside his apartment building. Kirillov's assistant also died. Ukraine’s security service claimed responsibility for the attack.

An Uzbek man was quickly arrested and charged with killing Kirillov on behalf of the Ukrainian security service.

Putin described Kirillov’s killing as a “major blunder” by Russia’s security agencies, noting they should learn from it and improve their efficiency.

In April, another senior Russian military officer, Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy head of the main operational department in the General Staff, was killed by an explosive device placed in his car parked near his apartment building just outside Moscow. A suspected perpetrator was quickly arrested.

Days after Moskalik's killing, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said he received a report from the head of Ukraine’s foreign intelligence agency on the “liquidation” of top Russian military figures, adding that “justice inevitably comes", although he didn't mention Moskalik's name.

Ukraine, which is outnumbered by Russia’s larger, better-equipped military, has frequently tried to change the course of the conflict by attacking in unexpected ways. In August last year, Ukrainian forces staged a surprise incursion into Russia’s Kursk region even as they struggled to stem Russian offensives on many parts of the front line. Moscow's troops eventually drove them out, but the incursion distracted the Russian military resources from other areas and raised Ukrainian morale.

Ukraine has also launched repeated attacks on the Russian navy in the Black Sea with sea drones and missiles, forcing it to relocate its warships and limit the scale of its operations.

And in June, swarms of drones launched from trucks targeted bomber bases across Russia. Ukraine said over 40 long-range bombers were damaged or destroyed, although Moscow said only several planes were struck.

Meanwhile, Western officials have accused Russia of staging a campaign away from the battlefield, accusing it of orchestrating dozens of incidents of disruption and sabotage across Europe as part of an effort to sap support for Ukraine. Moscow has denied the claims.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:43:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ab83cce2-df7c-11f0-8b19-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-22T093327Z-962868736-RC2LLIABDOLO-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-BOMB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Freed Nigerian schoolchildren handed over to government</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/eye-on-africa/20251222-freed-nigerian-schoolchildren-handed-over-to-government</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 21:43:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1c770606-df7a-11f0-9cc8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL251222-2146-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Justice Department handling of Epstein file release sparks backlash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-handling-epstein-file-release-sparks-backlash-2025-12-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Bipartisan anger over the U.S. Department of Justice's slow release of Jeffrey Epstein documents grew on Monday as lawmakers threatened to launch an effort to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt of Congress and former President Bill Clinton sought the immediate release of any documents involving him.

"The DOJ needs to quit protecting the rich, powerful, and politically connected," Representative Thomas Massie, a maverick conservative Republican from Kentucky, said in a posting on X.

The Justice Department released thousands of documents on Friday related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who committed suicide in 2019.

The saga over the Epstein files, which has been dragging on for years, has caused a rift within the Republican Party, with MAGA supporters, who make up President Donald Trump's core voters, clamoring for full disclosure of Epstein documents.

Trump has at times called the episode a Democratic "hoax," but also has signed into law a bill requiring the full disclosure.

Massie and liberal Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California said they are working together, along with other unnamed lawmakers, on an effort to dislodge documents surrounding investigations of convicted sex offender Epstein.

The two lawmakers said in an interview on MS Now that if necessary they would seek contempt of Congress charges in the House of Representatives for Bondi next month. They said that if their demands were not met following a "30-day grace period," they would work to have Congress seek fines of up to $5,000 per day until the documents are dispatched.

Also on Monday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer introduced legislation that would instruct Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, to undertake "appropriate" legal steps to gain Congress' access to all the documents covered by legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump. It was not clear whether his effort might advance in the Senate when it returns on January 5 from a holiday recess.

Thune's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, Clinton spokesman Angel Urena issued a statement urging Bondi to immediately release any remaining materials in the Epstein case that refer to Clinton in any way, including photographs. "Someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this," Urena said, adding, "We need no such protection."

Urena said there is "widespread suspicion" the Justice Department is "using selective releases to imply wrongdoing about individuals who have already been repeatedly cleared by the very same Department of Justice." He did not detail who else harbored that suspicion.

The Justice Department and White House had no immediate comment.

The Justice Department on Friday and Saturday sent to Congress two batches of Epstein documents, which failed to silence critics' attacks on how the effort was being handled.

The agency failed to meet its deadline of last Friday for complying with a "transparency" law requiring broad release of remaining Epstein files.

On Monday, a group identifying itself as survivors of abuse by Epstein complained in a statement that the public so far has received "a fraction of the files" and that those were "riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation." They added that some victim identities were left unredacted.

The Justice Department has said that it is working to clear more documents for release to Congress.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:21:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3BNGBY2E6VKDJEWYNH6Q56KWWA.jpg?auth=73143817ffb7ffdea69f762b46ee28dea876fdc87b55852a9eaea070c628fe93&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kilmar Abrego appears in court following release from ICE detention</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/kilmar-abrego-appears-court-following-release-ice-detention-2025-12-22/</link><description>GREENBELT, Maryland, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Kilmar Abrego, the Salvadoran migrant whose wrongful deportation became a flashpoint, appeared in court on Monday as a federal judge extended an order temporarily barring U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from taking him back into immigration custody.

Abrego, 30, attended a hearing in Greenbelt, Maryland before U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who earlier this month ordered his immediate release from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility. It marked the first time Abrego has appeared at the courthouse as his lawyers have waged a months-long legal battle first to have him returned from El Salvador and later to end his immigration detention.

Abrego, who entered the United States illegally, became a symbol of the Trump administration's drive for mass deportations when he was sent to a megaprison in El Salvador in March despite a prior court order barring him from being returned there because of a risk of persecution.

Abrego linked arms with his wife, Jennifer Vasquez Sura, outside the courthouse and looked upward while a group of supporters chanted "si, se puede" or "yes, you can."

"It has been a tremendous rollercoaster of emotions," said his lawyer, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg. Abrego did not address reporters.

Inside the courthouse, Xinis ordered lawyers for the Trump administration to provide more information by Friday on their plans for Abrego. The Trump administration has indicated it may seek to take Abrego back into ICE custody under different legal authority.

Xinis said her temporary order halting that action will remain in effect while she weighs arguments for a more permanent block.

The Trump administration brought Abrego back to the U.S. in June after the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the government to facilitate his return. His return came only after prosecutors secured a criminal indictment charging Abrego with human smuggling.

Abrego has pleaded not guilty.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:21:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EAMGRMYXSVJMDGL7A4V6AJ75JY.jpg?auth=02b3f952fcdfd9a02c381f43c30979f021578a571b86eed61d2522e38e5939bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian forces attack Odesa, governor says, in second regional strike in less than 24 hours</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russian-attack-ukraines-odesa-region-causes-fire-port-power-outages-2025-12-22/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Russian forces struck Ukraine's Black Sea port of Odesa late on Monday and damaged port facilities and a ship, the regional governor said, the second attack on the region in less than 24 hours.

Governor Oleh Kiper, writing on Telegram, said emergency crews were tackling the aftermath of the latest attack but provided no further details. He said no casualties were reported.

An earlier overnight attack hit port and energy infrastructure in Odesa region, causing a fire at a major port and disrupting electricity supplies to tens of thousands of people.

Ukraine's Black Sea ports are crucial for its export-driven economy and their security and functionality have been vital for the country's economic survival throughout nearly four years of war in Ukraine since Russia's invasion in February 2022.

"Russia is attempting to disrupt maritime logistics by launching systematic attacks on port and energy infrastructure," Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on the Telegram app. "Last night, ports and energy facilities were targeted again."

Kuleba said that following the attacks, a fire had broken out in the port of Pivdennyi and about 30 containers of flour and vegetable oil were on fire. Port workers and emergency services were tackling the blaze.

Because of damage to the energy infrastructure, electricity supplies were disrupted to more than 120,000 customers in the Odesa region, he said. One person had been hurt in the attack, the interior ministry said.

Russia did not immediately comment on either attack.

In the past few weeks, Russia has increased attacks on Odesa port and the surrounding region, trying to limit Ukraine's access to the Black Sea and disrupt critical logistics routes to the border with Moldova, Ukrainian officials said.

Ukraine also targets Russia's maritime logistics, increasingly focusing on shadow-fleet oil tankers that are used to bypass sanctions imposed on Russia over the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:21:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says weekend Ukraine peace talks not breakthrough, Izvestia reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-weekend-ukraine-peace-talks-not-breakthrough-izvestia-reports-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Talks between Russia and the United States in Miami on ways to resolve the conflict in Ukraine should not be seen as a breakthrough, the Izvestia news outlet cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying in remarks published on Tuesday.

"This is a working process," Peskov said, when asked whether the negotiations that took place in Miami on December 20-21 could be seen as a turning point.

Over the weekend, U.S. officials held parallel meetings in Miami on possible terms to end Russia's war in Ukraine, now nearing its four-year anniversary. The talks involved Ukrainian and European counterparts and separate meetings with Kirill Dmitriev, a Kremlin envoy who heads Russia's sovereign wealth fund.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff has described the discussions as “productive and constructive,” though key issues including territory and security guarantees remain contentious.

Peskov told Izvestia the discussions were expected to continue in a "meticulous" expert-level format and that Russia’s priority was to obtain from the United States details of Washington’s work with Europeans and Ukrainians on a possible settlement.

He said Moscow would then judge how far those ideas matched what he called the “spirit of Anchorage."

In August, U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, where they discussed possible parameters including territory and security guarantees and agreed to keep experts engaged and channels open as efforts continued to end the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:46:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BJGMP3QM7VND7ENNLWTSRLUTCE.jpg?auth=9be40d1290361328b027fa8ed96c47de28eab4b73f6f435895a712de3f010574&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump announces plan for new class of more powerful US battleships</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-plan-new-class-more-powerful-us-battleships-2025-12-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced plans for the Navy to begin building a new class of battleship that he said would be larger, faster and 100 times more powerful than the biggest of any previous U.S.-built warship.

Syria 's state news agency SANA, citing the defence ministry, said the army’s general command had issued an order to stop targeting the SDF’s sources of fire. The SDF said later in a statement that it had issued instructions to stop responding to attacks by Syrian government forces following de-escalation contacts.

The Syrian health ministry said two people were killed and several were wounded in shelling by the SDF on residential neighbourhoods in the city. The injuries included two children and two civil defence workers.

The violence erupted hours after Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said during a visit to Damascus that the SDF appeared to have no intention of honouring a commitment to integrate into the state’s armed forces by an agreed year-end deadline.

Turkey views the US-backed SDF, which controls swathes of northeastern Syria, as a terrorist organisation and has warned of military action if the group does not honour the agreement.

Integrating the SDF would mend Syria’s deepest remaining fracture, but failing to do so risks an armed clash that could derail the country’s emergence from 14 years of war and potentially draw in Turkey, which has threatened an incursion against Kurdish fighters it views as terrorists.

Both sides have accused the other of stalling and acting in bad faith. The SDF is reluctant to give up the autonomy it won as the main US ally during the war, which left it with control of Islamic State prisons and rich oil resources.

SANA, citing the defence ministry, reported earlier that the SDF had launched a sudden attack on security forces and the army in the Sheikh Maqsoud and Ashrafiyah neighbourhoods of Aleppo, resulting in injuries.

The SDF denied this and said the attack was carried out by factions affiliated with the Syrian government. It said those factions were using tanks and artillery against residential neighbourhoods in the city.

The defence ministry denied the SDF’s statements, saying the army was responding to sources of fire from Kurdish forces.

“We’re hearing the sounds of artillery and mortar shells, and there is a heavy army presence in most areas of Aleppo,” an eyewitness in Aleppo told Reuters earlier on Monday. Another eyewitness said the sound of strikes had been very strong and described the situation as “terrifying”.

Aleppo’s governor announced a temporary suspension of attendance at all public and private schools and universities on Tuesday, as well as government offices within the city centre.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 22:47:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/34de7d44-a313-11f0-8ab4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AFP-20250212-36XK872-v1-MidRes-SyriaConflictSecurityGraduation.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian state set to pass tougher gun laws after Bondi attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-state-set-pass-tougher-gun-laws-after-bondi-attack-2025-12-22/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state is set to pass tougher gun laws, ban the display of terrorist symbols and curb protests after the state parliament's lower house cleared a bill late on Monday in an emergency sitting following the Bondi mass shooting.

The terrorism and other legislation amendment bill won support from the opposition Liberal Party in New South Wales state, and is expected to clear the upper house on Tuesday.

The ruling centre-left Labor government has proposed capping most individual gun licences at four firearms and allowing up to 10 for farmers.

Fifteen people were killed and dozens injured in the mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Bondi on December 14, a shock attack that has prompted calls for tougher gun laws and stronger action against antisemitism.

Police said one alleged gunman, Sajid Akram, 50, who was shot dead by officers, owned six firearms. His 24-year-old son Naveed faces 59 charges including murder and terrorism.

Although Australia tightened gun laws after a 1996 shooting that killed 35 people, a police firearms registry showed more than 70 people in New South Wales, which includes Sydney, each own over 100 guns. One licence holder has 298 guns.

A Sydney Morning Herald poll on Tuesday found three-quarters of Australians want tougher gun laws. The rural-focused Nationals Party opposed the gun reforms in New South Wales, saying the amendments would disadvantage farmers.

The federal government has also pledged reforms including tighter gun controls and a gun buyback plan but has resisted calls to set up a royal commission, the most powerful type of government inquiry, into the attack.

Instead, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who is facing mounting criticism from opponents who argue his government has not done enough to curb a rise in antisemitism, has announced an independent review of intelligence and law enforcement agencies.

"We need to get to these answers quickly, and we cannot be waiting around for years, which is what a royal commission would take," Defence Minister Richard Marles told ABC News on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 23:20:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6L4OTZJPRLCHFGJ57PBYPTEF4.jpg?auth=061784eee9124f830de3bb5be1df19a3cbf0c8d930f66c375c604dd549287dee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US has to have Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-us-has-have-greenland-2025-12-22/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said the United States needs to have Greenland, not for critical minerals but for national security.

Zelenskiy, addressing reporters at an event honouring Ukraine's diplomats, confirmed media reports that residents of Hrabovske village straddling the border in Sumy region and home to 52 people, were taken away by Russian troops .

"These 52 people who lived there and did not leave naturally carried on a dialogue of some sort with those on Russian territory," Zelenskiy said.

"They lived like this for many years. And I think they simply didn't expect Russian troops to simply walk in and take them away as prisoners. But that's what happened."

The Kremlin has not commented on the situation.

Zelenskiy said 13 Ukrainian servicemen were among those taken away.

"They could have killed the enemy right there from a distance with artillery or drones, but they didn't," he said. "They didn't because there were civilians there. They didn't want to kill civilians."

Ukrainian forces, he said, would restore their positions in the village.

"What we do next to have those people return, that is another matter," he said.

Russian forces have gained a foothold in Sumy region in recent months, seizing several villages near the border. Many areas of the region are subjected to frequent Russian shelling.

The head of the Sumy region military administration, Oleh Hryhorov, said on Sunday that authorities had begun evacuating residents of border villages who had earlier refused to be moved.</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 23:20:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NFKAV6CM5BPNNHDXJYBYKTGNOI.jpg?auth=dc84c1ada42e2b578f14e8e7e4c5046669d74fb2544ee70faef4743c152a97d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Heritage Foundation thinktank staff quit amid antisemitism controversy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-heritage-foundation-thinktank-staff-quit-amid-antisemitism-controversy-2025-12-22/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - Over a dozen employees have left jobs at the Heritage Foundation or were fired in recent days, according to the influential right-wing U.S. thinktank, as it grapples with allegations from former supporters that it has aligned itself with those accused of antisemitism.

In a statement about the resignations and firings on Monday, Heritage Foundation Chief Advancement Officer Andy Olivastro said a handful of staff had chosen "disruption" and "disloyalty."

He said the think tank "has always welcomed debate, but alignment on mission and loyalty to the institution are non-negotiable."

The foundation has been caught up in a firestorm of accusations and counter-accusations that began when former Fox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed Nick Fuentes , a self-described Christian nationalist, in October. The interview focused on their mutual opposition to U.S. support of Israel, a view at odds with that of many conservatives.

Some supporters of the foundation have said it should distance itself from Carlson, characterizing the journalist's views as antisemitic. But Kevin Roberts, the foundation president, has continued to personally back Carlson, who he says is a friend. Carlson strongly rejects accusations of antisemitism.

One of those who resigned this week was Josh Blackman, a law professor who contributed to Project 2025, a hard-right policy initiative overseen by the Heritage Foundation. In a resignation letter posted online, he blamed Roberts for making Heritage's brand "toxic."

"You aligned the Heritage Foundation with the rising tide of antisemitism on the right," said Blackman, who edited the group's Guide to the Constitution publication.

In an October 30 video defending Carlson, Roberts said a "venomous coalition" was attacking the prominent podcaster over his interview with Fuentes. Roberts said conservatives should feel no obligation to support any foreign government no matter how great the pressure from "the globalist class."

He later apologized for his use of the term "venomous coalition," which he said Jewish colleagues understood to be an antisemitic trope. But he said he refused to "cancel friends" like Carlson.

Speaking at a November 5 townhall meeting of foundation staff, Roberts said his intention was not to endorse Fuentes, who he called "an evil person," but to "convert" some of his audience of several million people, without giving further details.

In a leaked video of the townhall, one Heritage staffer said Roberts was right to support Carlson, as Gen-Z had an increasingly unfavorable view of Israel. Two others said Carlson was an "antisemite" who the foundation should disavow.

Three Heritage Foundation board trustees have already resigned over the issue.

Robert George, a Princeton law professor, resigned in November over Roberts' refusal to retract his October 30 video. Shane McCullar, a former McDonald's Corp executive, resigned earlier this month, along with Abby Spencer Moffat, CEO of the Diana Spencer David Foundation, one of Heritage's largest donors. Both cited the foundation's failure to condemn antisemitism, according to resignation statements reported by Mediaite.

Advancing American Freedom, a conservative advocacy group critical of U.S. President Donald Trump's dominant MAGA movement and led by former Vice President Mike Pence, said in a statement on Monday that 13 former Heritage staffers had joined it.

For some remaining Heritage staff, recent staff departures were driven more by Republican Party jockeying than antisemitism or Israel.

"These resignations have a lot more to do with 2028 than it does with anything else," Heritage fellow Robby Starbuck posted online. "One group wants a return to the Pence/Ryan GOP and the rest want to MAGA with @KevinRobertsTX."</description><pubDate>Mon, 22 Dec 2025 23:42:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7NE6M4TKFOUFNNKJCPR7HQPRM.jpg?auth=bc76cd13f05101f3a78448138e00a7a00ab34b4352d7bda9aa3095b680ef832e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge orders return of 137 Venezuelans deported to El Salvador, Bloomberg News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-judge-orders-return-137-venezuelans-deported-el-salvador-bloomberg-news-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge has ruled that the administration of President Donald Trump must urgently arrange the return of about 137 Venezuelan men who were deported to El Salvador and jailed in the Central American nation over alleged ties to criminal gangs, Bloomberg News reported on Monday.

The men were deported to a prison in El Salvador in March under the Alien Enemies Act.

Trump's pressure campaign on Maduro has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels allegedly trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation. At least 100 people have been killed in the attacks.

Asked if the goal was to force Maduro from power, Trump told reporters: "Well, I think it probably would... That's up to him what he wants to do. I think it'd be smart for him to do that. But again, we're gonna find out."

"If he wants to do something, if he plays tough, it'll be the last time he's ever able to play tough," he said.

During the press conference, Trump also took aim at Colombian President Gustavo Petro, who he has also feuded with throughout the year.

"He's no friend to the United States. He's very bad. Very bad guy. He's gotta watch his ass because he makes cocaine and they send it into the U.S.," Trump said when asked about Petro's criticisms towards the Trump administration's handling of the tensions with Venezuela.

In addition to the strikes, Trump has previously announced a "blockade" of all oil tankers under sanctions entering and leaving Venezuela. The U.S. Coast Guard started pursuing an oil tanker in international waters near Venezuela on Sunday, in what would be the second such operation this weekend and the third in less than two weeks if successful.

"Maybe we will sell it, maybe we will keep it," Trump said when asked what would happen with the seized oil, adding it might also be used to replenish the United States' strategic reserves.

Without directly referring to Trump's statements, Maduro said every leader should attend to the internal affairs of their own country.

"If I speak to him again, I will tell him: each country should mind its own internal affairs," Maduro said, referring to an initial phone call between the two leaders last month.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 01:46:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YON3MSPB7RKR7A2YIVK2KUHZP4.jpg?auth=9ad23a71be83270aff5f58ca66767427048ae9f0f3077cff5163acfb3dca8ab1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says it would be 'smart' for Venezuela's Maduro to leave power</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-might-keep-or-might-sell-oil-seized-near-venezuela-trump-says-2025-12-22/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 01:47:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Bipartisan anger grows over slow release of Epstein documents</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251222-bipartisan-anger-grows-over-slow-release-epstein-documents</link><description>Bipartisan anger over the US Department of Justice’s slow release of Jeffrey Epstein documents grew on Monday as lawmakers threatened to launch an effort to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in contempt of Congress, while former President Bill Clinton sought the immediate release of any documents involving him.

“The DOJ needs to quit protecting the rich, powerful, and politically connected,” Representative Thomas Massie, a maverick conservative Republican from Kentucky, said in a post on X.

The Justice Department released thousands of documents on Friday related to Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died by suicide in 2019.

The saga over the Epstein files, which has dragged on for years, has caused a rift within the Republican Party, with MAGA supporters — who make up President Donald Trump ’s core voters — clamouring for full disclosure of the documents.

Trump has at times called the episode a Democratic “hoax”, but has also signed into law a bill requiring full disclosure.

Massie and liberal Democratic Representative Ro Khanna of California said they are working together, along with other unnamed lawmakers, on an effort to obtain documents surrounding investigations of Epstein.

The two lawmakers said in an interview on MS Now that, if necessary, they would seek contempt of Congress charges in the House of Representatives against Bondi next month. They said that if their demands were not met following a “30-day grace period”, they would work to have Congress seek fines of up to $5,000 per day until the documents are released.

Also on Monday, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer introduced legislation instructing Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, to undertake “appropriate” legal steps to secure Congress’s access to all documents covered by legislation passed by Congress and signed into law by Trump. It was not clear whether the effort would advance in the Senate when it returns on January 5 from a holiday recess.

Thune’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meanwhile, Clinton spokesman Angel Urena issued a statement urging Bondi to immediately release any remaining materials in the Epstein case that refer to Clinton in any way, including photographs. “Someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this,” Urena said, adding, “We need no such protection.”

Urena said there is “widespread suspicion” that the Justice Department is “using selective releases to imply wrongdoing about individuals who have already been repeatedly cleared by the very same Department of Justice”. He did not specify who else harboured that suspicion.

The Justice Department and the White House had no immediate comment.

The Justice Department on Friday and Saturday sent two batches of Epstein documents to Congress, but the releases failed to silence critics of how the process was being handled. The agency missed a deadline last Friday to comply with a “transparency” law requiring the broad release of remaining Epstein files.

On Monday, a group identifying itself as survivors of abuse by Epstein said in a statement that the public has so far received “a fraction of the files”, and that those were “riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation”. They added that some victim identities were left unredacted.

The Justice Department has said it is working to clear more documents for release to Congress .</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 01:47:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/27f2b8ec-df8c-11f0-a4aa-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-20T021420Z-1870991774-RC2TJIAZMCQ4-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-EPSTEIN-FILES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON 2025: Mali robbed of win, Egypt take three points against Zimbabwe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251222-afcon-2025-mali-robbed-of-win-egypt-take-three-points-against-zimbabwe</link><description>Today's first game ended with a dramatic last minute equaliser for Zambia in their game against Mali.

Vladimirov did not specify which facility was on fire.

Russian oil major Lukoil (LKOH.MM) , opens new tab runs the Stavrolen petrochemical complex at Budyonnovsk in Stavropol and the region also hosts gas pipeline infrastructure and fuel storage sites that make it part of Russia’s broader energy and chemicals system.

Trump said the new battleships would be larger, faster and “100 times more powerful” than any previously built, forming the centrepiece of what he called an expanded “Golden Fleet” aimed at cementing US naval dominance.

The programme will begin with two vessels and is expected to grow to between 20 and 25 ships, Trump said. The first of the class will be christened the USS Defiant.

The announcement represents the latest example of the president rebranding an aspect of the federal government in his image. Trump, who has previously criticised the appearance of US warships, said he will be personally involved in the designs.

He said the ships will weigh more than 30,000 tonnes, larger than current destroyers, and be equipped with the latest technology, including artificial intelligence and directed-energy lasers.

“We haven’t built a battleship since 1994. These cutting-edge vessels will be some of the most lethal surface warfare ships … other than our submarines,” Trump said.

In addition to carrying conventional naval guns, the new battleships will be equipped with nuclear-armed, sea-launched cruise missiles, US Navy Secretary John Phelan said, appearing with Trump in Florida for the announcement.

Some US officials have warned that a failure to build new battleships in recent years has handed an advantage to economic and military rival China . Trump downplayed China’s influence on the decision, saying the expansion was “a counter to everybody”.

He said the naval expansion would be paired with renewed pressure on defence contractors to speed up production and rein in costs. He said he will meet with major defence firms next week to address delays and overruns, and to examine whether executive compensation, share buybacks and dividends are contributing to missed production targets.

“We don’t want to have executives making $50 million a year, issuing big dividends to everybody, and also doing buybacks,” while production of F-35s and other jets languish, Trump said.

Reuters reported last week that the administration was planning an executive order to limit dividends, buybacks and executive pay for defence contractors whose projects are over budget and delayed.

Trump and the Pentagon have been complaining about the expensive, slow-moving and entrenched nature of the defence industry, promising dramatic changes that would make the production of war equipment more nimble.

Besides the new battleship class, the expanded fleet envisions increasing numbers of other war vessels, including the introduction of a new, smaller class of frigates previously announced by the Navy, Trump said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 03:31:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6925fad8-cfb3-11f0-9c91-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-11-16T214231Z-848259457-RC2VVHAJ8HVY-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-MILITARY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gunmen kidnap 28 en route to Muslim religious event in central Nigeria</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251223-gunmen-kidnap-muslim-religious-event-central-nigeria</link><description>Gunmen ambushed a vehicle in central Nigeria carrying people travelling to a Muslim religious event and kidnapped 28 people, including women and children, a security report showed on Monday.

“On the evening of 21 December, gunmen abducted 28 people, including women and children, while they were travelling to a Maulud gathering,” near Zak village in Bashar district in Plateau state, according to the security report prepared for the United Nations and seen by AFP.

The group were heading to an event marking the birth of Prophet Mohammed when their vehicle was “intercepted”, the report said, adding that police have launched an investigation into the attack.

Plateau state police did not immediately respond to AFP’s request for comment.

It is the latest in a string of mass kidnappings in recent weeks, which has placed an uncomfortable international spotlight on Nigeria’s grim security situation.

The abductions occurred on the same day authorities secured the release of 130 schoolchildren — the final group of more than 250 pupils snatched from their Catholic boarding school in north-central Niger state a month earlier.

The recent spate of kidnappings — mainly involving hundreds of schoolchildren — has prompted the United Nations to warn of a “surge in mass abductions”.

Scores of other people have also been seized from places of worship in separate raids.

Nigeria is under intense criticism from the United States , which has threatened military intervention over what it describes as the mass killing of Christians.

The Nigerian government and independent analysts reject Washington’s framing of the security situation in the country, which is home to multiple conflicts that claim lives across ethnic and religious lines.

Kidnappings in Nigeria are predominantly for ransom, and the crisis has “consolidated into a structured, profit-seeking industry” that raised about $1.66 million between July 2024 and June 2025, according to a recent report by SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based consultancy.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 03:31:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/56b4d68c-c6ba-11f0-8d29-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25321718717228.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says one person killed in strike on suspected drug vessel in Pacific</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-says-one-person-killed-strike-suspected-drug-vessel-pacific-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it killed one person in a strike on a "low-profile vessel" suspected of carrying drugs in international waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Monday.

According to local broadcaster NBC4, the developer and executive died on Sunday while driving his Ferrari on a scenic road north of Los Angeles. His studios created some of the world’s best-selling video games.

“For unknown reasons, the vehicle veered off the roadway, struck a concrete barrier and became fully engulfed,” the California Highway Patrol said in a statement, without identifying the two victims in the crash.

The CHP added that both the driver and a passenger, who was ejected from the vehicle, succumbed to their injuries.

Zampella was best known for co-creating the Call of Duty franchise and founding Respawn Entertainment, the studio behind Titanfall , Apex Legends and the Star Wars Jedi games.

After starting out in the 1990s as a designer on shooter games, he co-founded Infinity Ward in 2002 and helped launch Call of Duty in 2003. Activision later acquired the studio.

He left Activision under contentious circumstances and established Respawn in 2010, which Electronic Arts acquired in 2017.

At EA, he eventually took charge of revitalising the Battlefield franchise, cementing his reputation as one of the most influential figures in modern first-person shooter games.

“This is an unimaginable loss, and our hearts are with Vince’s family, his loved ones and all those touched by his work,” Electronic Arts said in a statement.

“Vince’s influence on the video game industry was profound and far-reaching,” the company added, saying that “his work helped shape modern interactive entertainment”.

A statement by Respawn, posted on the Battlefield X account, praised Zampella “for how he showed up every day, trusting his teams, encouraging bold ideas and believing in Battlefield and the people building it”.

Zampella “championed what he believed was right for the people behind those studios and our players because it mattered.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 04:15:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9ab8db34-df93-11f0-8b18-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/Part-GTY-475443286-1-1-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia launches air attack on Kyiv, Ukraine's military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-launches-air-attack-kyiv-ukraines-military-says-2025-12-23/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Russia launched an early morning air attack on Kyiv on Tuesday, Ukrainian military said, just days after a U.S.-led round of peace talks in Miami ended on Sunday.

Lam is viewed as the leading contender to keep the county's most powerful post, but formal announcements are expected only at the five-yearly party congress scheduled for January 19-25.

Officials who gathered for the party plenum in Hanoi on Monday and Tuesday "voted with a high level of support on the personnel nominated" for key positions, Lam said in a speech closing the plenum, which was published on the government portal.

Lam also said party officials agreed to continue on the reform of the public administration and on expanding the country's infrastructure - both policies that he pushed during his first brief term as party chief.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 04:58:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FLVNETNUVFJCTEGXISU4OUQNLA.jpg?auth=7be744224b9dee18e2c4185fa97d4b7c8fd160ea4c140b23558fc91518ef92cc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>To Lam, reformist risk-taker, seeks to extend his hold on Vietnam</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/lam-reformist-risk-taker-seeks-extend-his-hold-vietnam-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Vietnam's Communist Party chief To Lam, who is seeking a new mandate as the country's top leader, has earned a reputation as an ambitious risk-taker whose brief initial tenure was defined by rapid, sweeping reforms and a commanding leadership style.

Senior officials of the Communist Party, which has ruled Vietnam unopposed for decades, selected this week unnamed candidates for the country's next leadership, which a five-yearly congress in January will formally endorse. Lam, 68, is considered the leading contender to remain as general secretary, although the opaque process leaves room for surprises.

Like China, Vietnam is ruled by a communist party, but unlike its neighbour, it has long relied on collective decision-making and multiple checks on individual leaders. However, Lam has strengthened the role of the party chief, following the path set by his late predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong , a shift that could push Vietnam to more centralised rule.

In roughly 18 months at the helm, Lam pushed through sweeping administrative and economic reforms, which admirers likened to the ambitious agenda of Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei, but that have also spurred discontent.

If confirmed, he "will hit the ground running as he did in August 2024," said Carl Thayer, a senior expert on Vietnam at the Australian Defence Force Academy, noting Lam would further strengthen the managerial role of the party secretariat and push through his bold reform agenda.

Despite not holding the title of head of state, Lam has embarked on a whirlwind tour on the world stage, making international visits to historical communist partners and new capitalist friends alike.

He has continued his predecessor's "bamboo diplomacy", balancing among major powers. However, under pressure from U.S. tariffs, Hanoi has moved closer to Beijing .

Under Lam, the security apparatus has vastly expanded, with the police gaining powers in lawmaking , project approvals and in the corporate world .

Lam has not responded to multiple interview requests.

The son of a senior police officer, Lam studied security , earned a PhD in law and rose through the ranks to become minister for public security in 2016, was promoted to a four-star general nearly three years later and then admitted in 2021 to the party Politburo, the country's most powerful body.

As police chief, he was a key enforcer of Trong's sweeping anti-corruption drive launched in 2017, which led to the dismissal of hundreds of officials, and in 2023-2024 the resignation of two state presidents.

He emerged as the dominant figure of that tumultuous period. He was first appointed president in May 2024, and took the party helm after Trong died the following July.

For a few months, he held both top roles until relinquishing the presidency - reluctantly, according to multiple officials.

But after stepping down, he often acted as de facto head of state, representing the country in multiple overseas trips and in meetings with foreign leaders.

Some officials saw his moves as steps toward a model closer to China's, where Xi Jinping heads both party and state.

It is not clear whether he will push to formally merge the two roles, but officials said that prospect dimmed after disappointing trade talks with the United States, Vietnam's top export destination, and domestic unease over aspects of Lam's reforms.

Soon after becoming party chief, he completed Vietnam's most comprehensive administrative overhaul in decades, cutting layers of local and central government. Nearly 150,000 officials lost their jobs and power structures were redrawn.

Intended to slash red tape and accelerate decisions, the reform has, however, at times produced delays as bureaucracies adjust.

His economic reforms have stressed the role of the private sector, leading enthusiasts to dub them a new Doi Moi, after the 1980s liberalisation that launched decades of growth.

Yet he has also insisted the state will retain a leading role in the economy, nurturing domestic conglomerates with subsidies while setting their targets - nudging them closer to quasi–state-owned status.

The pace has impressed many foreign investors who regularly praise Vietnam's political stability. Supporters see a chance to speed up growth. Vietnam's stock market rose strongly on Monday as speculation about Lam's confirmation gained ground.

However, critics argue the benefits of Lam's reforms are accruing to a narrow group of well‑connected firms.

"When he promotes the 'private sector', he means the private companies that are nicely tied up to the party," quipped a foreign diplomat.

Public sentiment is hard to measure in a country where dissent is outlawed and media are state-controlled.

A father of four from two relationships, Lam loves classical music. As minister of public security, he oversaw approval of a large new opera house, Hanoi's second, opened in 2023. A third, designed by Italian architect Renzo Piano, is under construction.

He is known to involve himself directly in operations, having led anti-smuggling campaigns earlier in his career. More controversially, he has also been viewed as the architect of the 2017 extraordinary rendition of a Vietnamese national from Germany.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 05:29:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/47XGNF5XWNMGBBEUDEAVA55X5M.jpg?auth=63de4b328f4f2f77f7037615efacda0352702fc58b894c747da6b96717ddba17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland scrambles aircraft after Russia strikes Ukraine, Polish armed forces say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/poland-scrambles-aircraft-after-russia-strikes-ukraine-polish-armed-forces-say-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Polish and allied aircraft were deployed early on Tuesday to ensure the safety of Polish airspace after Russia launched airstrikes targeting western Ukraine near the border with Poland, the armed forces of the NATO-member country said.

Touadera, 68, a mathematician, is relying on a tactic familiar in the region to extend his tenure, having overseen a referendum in 2023 that scrapped the presidential term limit.

But he has been a trailblazer in other respects. In 2018, CAR became the first country in West and Central Africa to bring in Russia's Wagner mercenaries, a move later mirrored by Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.

And in 2022, CAR became the first African nation – and second globally after El Salvador – to adopt bitcoin as legal tender.

Campaigning on his security record and pledging infrastructure investment, Touadera has attended numerous ceremonies, including signing a deal last week to launch Starlink in CAR.

"When I came to power in 2016, you couldn't travel 10 km without being harassed. There was no security, no roads, nothing. We have worked so hard to achieve this result today," he told supporters this month at a rally in Bangui.

Despite close ties with Russia, Touadera has signalled a renewed interest in Western partnerships, telling the Financial Times in September that he would welcome any country willing to develop CAR's lithium, uranium and gold reserves.

Analysts say Touadera is favoured to win, aided by civil servants campaigning for him and the significant resource advantage he enjoys over his opponents.

"The president will win because he has much more financial capacity than the opponents," said Charles Bouessel of International Crisis Group.

CAR has endured repeated cycles of unrest since independence from France in 1960, leaving most of its 5.5 million people in poverty.

Five years ago, Rwanda deployed troops to prevent rebels from disrupting elections and maintains a presence today. Touadera signed peace deals this year with several rebel groups, reducing violence in some regions and helping economic growth rise to about 3%, up from 1.9% in 2024, IMF data shows.

Security remains a top voter concern. "What we want are roads and peace," said Jean-Claude Kolego, a trader in Bangui. But analysts warn gains are fragile: rebels have not fully disarmed, reintegration is incomplete, and incursions by combatants from neighbouring Sudan fuel insecurity in the east.

"There are a lot of ingredients that could lead to a renewed cycle of violence," said Nathalia Dukhan, Central Africa analyst for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Crime.

Government and allied forces "have been using fear and terror" to maintain control, she said. Human Rights Watch has accused Russian mercenaries of executions and torture.

In November, the U.N. Security Council extended the mandate of its peacekeeping mission. The U.S. opposed the decision, calling for a shorter extension and a handover of security to Bangui.

Russian security assistance has come at a cost. The Africa Center for Strategic Studies think tank said in 2023 that Russia had earned over $2.5 billion in African gold , opens new tab through its mercenary missions in CAR, Mali and Sudan.

Touadera has also launched two cryptocurrency ventures to attract investors, which GI-TOC warned could expose state assets to foreign criminal networks.

He is seeking investors for a long-discussed railway project , opens new tab linking CAR to Cameroon and Sudan and has vowed to boost revenue from mining under a new code adopted in 2024.

But illegal mining and criminality remain rampant. China issued a rare warning to citizens last month of the risks of kidnapping, extortion and slavery in the sector.

Touadera's economic initiatives have brought little relief to a country where two-thirds of people lived in extreme poverty in 2023, World Bank data shows.

"We are always promised jobs and schools, but many young people remain unemployed," said Clarisse, a university student in Bangui.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:26:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PVBAOGFIBFLP7FQHCV454ZDKKE.jpg?auth=d1457f6e436033db0741b0b9ca1c1418f2cc56503ef291542ae6cfe5c35a5f0e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jong Un tours hotels with daughter, lauds economic progress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-tours-hotels-with-daughter-lauds-economic-progress-2025-12-23/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 23 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended the opening ceremonies of hotels in a tourist zone of the country with his daughter Ju Ae, as he sought to highlight the country's economic progress before a key party congress due to take place early next year.

Five hotels opened on Saturday and Sunday in North Korea's Samjiyon tourist zone, in the northeast part of the Korean peninsula near the border with China, state media KCNA said on Tuesday.

Kim, who attended the ceremonies on Saturday, toured the upmarket hotels with Ju Ae, state media photographs showed.

Some analysts view Kim's teenage daughter as the frontrunner to become the country's next leader.

Kim said the hotels were "clear proof of the rising status of our people and the development potential of our country," according to KCNA.

The North Korean leader has attended multiple opening ceremonies of facilities in the past month, including three regional factory openings last week alone.

North Korea is expected to hold its first party congress in five years in early 2026, where a new development plan for the next five years is expected to be unveiled. State media such as Rodong Sinmun, have been urging an all-out public effort to complete major projects ahead of the gathering.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:26:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LIG526RBSBK7XI6LMRK5V7X36E.jpg?auth=883e5cbc971701d7e39ece6dfb969bf2a1550c331004454c1927563cf8138ec2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's envoy to Thailand, Cambodia urges ceasefire as soon as possible</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-envoy-thailand-cambodia-urges-ceasefire-soon-possible-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:26:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jong Un tours hotels with daughter, lauds economic progress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-tours-hotels-with-daughter-lauds-economic-progress-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:27:02 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>New US strike on suspected drug-smuggling boat in eastern Pacific kills one</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251223-new-us-strike-on-suspected-drug-smuggling-boat-in-eastern-pacific-kills-one</link><description>The US military said Monday that it had conducted another strike against a boat it said was smuggling drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean , killing one person.

In a social media post, US Southern Command said, “Intelligence confirmed the low-profile vessel was transiting along known narco-trafficking routes in the Eastern Pacific and was engaged in narco-trafficking operations.” Southern Command provided no evidence that the vessel was engaged in drug smuggling.

A video posted by US Southern Command shows splashes of water near one side of the boat. After a second salvo, the rear of the boat catches fire. More splashes engulf the craft and the fire grows. In the final second of the video, the vessel can be seen adrift with a large patch of fire alongside it.

Earlier videos of US boat strikes showed vessels suddenly exploding, suggesting missile strikes. Some strike videos even had visible rocket-like projectiles coming down on the boats.

The Trump administration has said the strikes were meant to stop the flow of drugs into the US and increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro .

At least 105 people have been killed in 29 known strikes since early September. The strikes have faced scrutiny from US lawmakers and human rights activists, who say the administration has offered scant evidence that its targets are indeed drug smugglers and say the fatal strikes amount to extrajudicial killings.

Meanwhile, the US Coast Guard has stepped up efforts to interdict oil tankers in the Caribbean Sea as part of the Trump administration’s escalating campaign against Maduro.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 07:27:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4304d16a-dfc8-11f0-95aa-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25356849560501.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China urges US to fulfill nuclear disarmament responsibility after Pentagon report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/china-urges-us-fulfill-nuclear-disarmament-responsibility-after-pentagon-report-2025-12-23/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 23 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday urged the United States to fulfill its nuclear disarmament responsibilities after a draft Pentagon report said China is likely to have loaded more than 100 intercontinental ballistic missiles and has no desire for arms control talks.

Provincial police said the vehicle was first targeted with improvised explosives before the attackers opened fire, killing four officers and the driver. No group has claimed responsibility for Tuesday's attack.

Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the attack. "Police have always played a frontline role in the war against terrorism," Sharif said.

The attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province's Karak district, a region relatively unscathed by militant attacks, comes as relations between Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan have collapsed after a surge in violence.

The countries have struggled to maintain a truce following their worst border clashes since the Taliban came to power in October with Islamabad blaming the rise in militancy on groups using Afghan soil to plot their attacks. Kabul denies the charges, saying Pakistan's security is an internal problem.

Pakistan's mountainous border regions are home to Islamist militants from the Tehreek-e-Taliban, who have waged a war against the Pakistani state for nearly 20 years.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 08:31:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda restricts imports of Starlink equipment weeks before election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/uganda-restricts-imports-starlink-equipment-weeks-before-election-2025-12-23/</link><description>KAMPALA, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Uganda's government has restricted imports of Starlink satellite internet equipment weeks before a national election at which the opposition fears the government will again impose an internet blackout.

President Yoweri Museveni, 81, will seek to extend his rule in the East African nation to nearly half a century in the January 15 vote, which pits him against pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine, 43, for the second time.

During the 2021 election, the government cut off internet access for days. Wine, who came a distant second to Museveni at the last vote, rejected the results and said he lost because of rigging, which Museveni denies.

The restrictions on bringing Starlink devices into Uganda first came to light in a leaked tax agency memo dated December 19 that circulated on social media.

A spokesperson for the Uganda Revenue Authority later confirmed the memo was genuine.

The memo said any imports of "Starlink technology gadgets, communication equipment and associated components" now needed to be cleared by the head of the military, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son.

The revenue authority tried to downplay the new restrictions, saying many countries seek to control imports of communication technology.

Elon Musk's Starlink does not have a licence to operate in Uganda yet, though many Ugandans have been bringing in Starlink devices and using them anyway.

Opposition leader Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, called the restrictions on Starlink imports ridiculous in a post on X.

"If they're not planning ... electoral fraud, why are they so scared of people accessing (the internet) during the electoral process," Wine wrote.

A former rebel, Museveni has been credited with stabilising Uganda, promoting economic growth and combating HIV/AIDS, while critics have accused his government of suppressing opponents, committing human rights abuses and engaging in corruption.

Museveni and his government have amended the constitution twice to remove age and term limits, allowing him to remain in office.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 08:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NNEKILRPCRJPJMXJVPYEVFPLBA.jpg?auth=6070c64adab2042645353389fbcead86ba751cc3ab109ad6f0fc150d1c539ca7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Off the scales?

Japan's new PM under fire for asking staff to come in at 3am

In the age of the gig economy , 34-year-old Zohran Mamdani was elected mayor of New York thanks to young people, who ask: what's the point of slaving away at a low-paying, high-pressure service sector job when AI is coming for their livelihood and saving up for a home or pension seems like a pipe dream?

One survey has 43 percent of Gen Zers stating they quit a job because it didn't fit their personal lives, compared with 28 percent of baby boomers.

So what makes a good work-life balance? Is it normal for humans to no longer define themselves by the way they earn their keep? In this age of rapid change and growing inequality, what to expect when it comes to our livelihoods and our lives?

The 75-year-old scientist heads a Moscow firm that makes components for a communications device used by tank crews.

As Russian tanks rumbled through Ukraine in 2022, his business was awash with defence orders.

But the orders he landed turned out to be a poisoned chalice, he recounted in a series of interviews with Reuters, the first time he has spoken publicly about his struggles. He had to ramp up production at breakneck speed and deliver to tight deadlines at prices set by the Russian defence ministry.

Failure was no option. Invoking the spectre of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Russia’s government has threatened defence manufacturers with jail time if they don’t meet contractual obligations.

By spring 2023, Arsenyev’s factory was behind schedule on production, and senior executives were feuding, interviews with two key players and court documents show.

Sergei Mosiyenko, a minority shareholder, said he could see the company was going to miss deadlines, so he blew the whistle. “The defence ministry is the customer,” he told Reuters. “They are always right.”

Officials Arsenyev turned to for help ignored him, the factory boss said.

With the company edging toward bankruptcy, Arsenyev walked into Moscow’s Red Square on July 26, 2024. Outside the Kremlin, near the mausoleum of Soviet state founder Vladimir Lenin, he poured gasoline over his body and set himself alight.

He spent weeks in hospital with severe burns, he said.

Speaking to Reuters from the hospital, Arsenyev disputed that the contracts were in trouble, saying people who were trying to undermine him had sent unfounded complaints to the authorities.

“How is it that a company that is getting growing orders and fulfils those orders is dying?” he asked. “That probably means there’s a problem.”

The Kremlin and Russia’s defence ministry did not respond to detailed questions about Arsenyev’s case or their handling of defence contracts more broadly.

The difficulties at Arsenyev’s firm, Volna Central Scientific Research Institute, lay bare the pressures on Russian defence companies, which have faced years of demands to ramp up production.

Arsenyev’s struggles are not unique, a Reuters review of Moscow court rulings found.

At least 34 people have faced criminal charges for disrupting state defence orders since the start of the Ukraine war, according to documents posted on the Moscow courts of general jurisdiction website. They include at least 11 company bosses and two senior executives.

Since Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine in February 2022, the country’s manufacturers have increased output of artillery shells, missiles, tanks and drones, outstripping what Kyiv can produce or source from Western allies . But the sector is also plagued by inefficiency and corruption, resulting in spiralling costs, production delays and unmet quotas, according to Mathieu Boulegue, consulting fellow at London’s Chatham House think tank, and a number of other Western security analysts.

The Kremlin’s response – centralising decisions with the defence ministry and state defence conglomerate Rostec, and imposing rigid rules on contractors – is hurting the ability of companies to innovate and modernise, Boulegue told Reuters.

This likely won’t affect Russia’s ability to remain a threat to Ukraine and the West in the short term, Boulegue wrote in a July paper, but it “will make it harder for Russia to sustain competition with its adversaries”.

Responding to questions from Reuters, Rostec dismissed as “propaganda myths” any assertions by the news agency related to a “degradation” of the Russian defence industry.

“Everything is fine with the Russian defence industry,” Rostec said in a statement on its Telegram account. “Our Western colleagues can only dream of the rate of growth that Rostec is showing.”

Ultimately, the military did not receive the communication devices it needed on time, according to the firm that assembles them, Luch Factory, which is co-owned through a chain of companies by Rostec.

That was in part because Arsenyev’s firm did not supply components when it was supposed to, Luch said in its 2023 annual report, an accusation Arsenyev denies. It was not clear from the report how big the orders were or how long they were delayed. Luch’s director, Andrei Pestryaev, declined to provide details.

A dispute with the government over the price of Volna’s components left the firm short of funds, Arsenyev said.

Its accounts were then frozen for failing to pay taxes, according to Arsenyev and SPARK, a database created by Russia’s Interfax news agency that aggregates information from corporate and state records. Wages went unpaid, leading to lawsuits.

“We suddenly found ourselves close to bankruptcy,” Arsenyev said.

Bailiffs called in to recover debts in September 2024 were unable to find assets they could seize, their website shows.

To meet the military’s needs, Luch had to design and produce its own version of Volna’s components, Pestryaev told Reuters.

As of January, there was a deficit of Luch’s devices, a military equipment trader who supplies them to front-line Russian units said on condition of anonymity. Reuters could not determine if that was still the case. Pestryaev declined to comment.

Rostec did not answer questions about the case or the handling of defence contracts. The military also did not comment.

The tone of how the Kremlin deals with manufacturers was set by Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who deputises for Putin as chair of the Military-Industrial Commission, the body overseeing the defence industry.

At a March 2023 meeting with industry leaders, he read out a World War Two telegram from Stalin stating a manufacturer that failed to deliver weapons on time would be “smashed like criminals”.

“Colleagues, I want you to hear what I’m saying and remember the words of the generalissimo,” Medvedev told the room full of managers, according to a video posted on his Telegram account.

Medvedev did not respond to questions about his remarks sent via the Kremlin.

Underpinning Medvedev’s threat is a 2017 law making it a criminal offence - punishable by up to 10 years in jail - to harm a defence contract in pursuit of personal gain. Just one prosecution was recorded on the Moscow courts website before the war started.

In September 2022, the law was amended to widen the list of missteps that can be prosecuted. It now includes refusal to sign a defence contract or inability to fulfil one, without, in certain circumstances, having to prove defendants were seeking personal gain.

The following January, Putin urged state prosecutors to “strengthen scrutiny” of the timely fulfilment of defence orders.

At least five of the 35 defendants identified by Reuters were sentenced to jail terms of up to six years, and 15 others were detained pending trial.

They include Sergei Kryuchkov, ex-boss of a Russian construction company that was awarded contracts to build a logistics centre for the Federal Agency for State Reserves (Rosrezerv), which manages strategic reserves of food, fuel and equipment for deployment during wars and national emergencies.

His lawyer told a Moscow court in January 2024 that restrictions on his liberty were “creating serious problems” for the firm’s ability to fulfil 12 defence contracts, court documents show.

Kryuchkov was placed under house arrest in August 2023 and sentenced in July to five and a half years in jail on charges of having harmed defence contracts by using money advanced to his company to lease vehicles not mentioned in the agreements, the records show. They include at least three BMW sports utility vehicles.

Kryuchkov argued the cars were for work purposes and said his firm, GES-Montazh, was meeting its contractual obligations. He appealed against his conviction, but the outcome is classified.

The documents do not disclose why he was dismissed last year. His lawyer and GES-Montazh did not respond to questions about the case. Neither did Rosrezerv or the prosecutor-general’s office.

Putin’s former ombudsman for business, Boris Titov, was reported by Russia’s RBC newspaper in April 2023 to have requested that instructions be issued to prosecutors to “exercise particular vigilance” when applying the law, saying a significant portion of cases were for missed deadlines, which can be unavoidable.

The ombudsman’s office told Reuters such guidance was subsequently issued by the prosecutor-general’s office, and since then, it has stopped receiving complaints about the law. The prosecutor-general’s office did not comment.

A few months into Russia’s invasion, its tank crews faced a shortage of radio sets, according to Andrei Morozov, a Russian soldier in eastern Ukraine.

“They’ve run out. There’s no re-supply,” Morozov wrote in an August 2022 blog post.

At the time, Ukrainian forces were destroying many Russian tanks , which had to be replaced along with equipment like the radios crews use to communicate.

Morozov committed suicide in February 2024, according to a Russian lawmaker citing correspondence he said he received from the defence ministry. A suicide note published on his blog said his unit was suffering equipment shortages, which Reuters was unable to independently confirm. The military and defence ministry did not comment.

The communication systems Morozov wrote about connect headsets and microphones built into soldiers’ helmets to a tank’s radio set via a switching device. Volna was then the only firm making electronics modules for the switching devices, according to court records related to its disputes with Luch and documents posted on the Russian state procurement website.

Before the Ukraine war, Volna produced no more than 5,000 modules per year, the court records show. But after Russia’s invasion, many more were needed. In September 2022, Volna signed contracts to deliver more than 50,000 modules to Luch over the following year.

Increasing production tenfold was a huge undertaking, the documents show. The company had to hire staff and revamp production processes.

Volna received advances worth about 80% of some contracts, the records show. But by April 2023, Volna had fallen behind on its production plan, according to documents related to a separate dispute between the company and its chief engineer at the time, Andrei Buchinsky.

An unidentified person at Volna reprimanded Buchinsky for being late with an amended plan, which he argued in a lawsuit was unjustified. The court sided with Volna, saying Buchinsky provided a plan on time but did not submit it in the requested format. Buchinsky declined to comment on the ruling.

Between March and May 2023, Mosiyenko, the minority shareholder, wrote letters to Rostec and the Federal Security Service (FSB), successor to the Soviet KGB, saying the contracts were in trouble.

“As a shareholder, I cannot do nothing,” Mosiyenko told Reuters. “Otherwise, I will be held criminally accountable.”

Mosiyenko’s complaints triggered investigations. He showed Reuters an extract from a letter he said he received from the defence ministry saying military prosecutors were looking into alleged irregularities with fulfiling the contracts. He did not share the whole letter, citing laws protecting military secrets.

Reuters was unable to establish the status of these probes but found no evidence Arsenyev or any of his employees faced criminal charges. The prosecutor-general’s office, Rostec and the FSB did not respond to questions about the case sent via email.

According to Arsenyev, inspections by various authorities disrupted work on the orders, but they were delivered on time.

In September 2023, the defence ministry dropped a bombshell: it told Arsenyev it was cutting by nearly half the amount Luch would pay for Volna’s modules, the documents related to disputes between the companies show.

Luch is now seeking to recover over 65 million roubles ($824,900) in advances paid to Volna, the documents show. That is 7 million roubles more than Volna's total revenue in 2020, the last year for which the firm published accounts.

The ministry told Arsenyev it recalculated the price after Volna automated more of its production process, reducing costs, the documents show.

A defence ministry official who handled the Volna contracts, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Volna failed to communicate with the ministry to resolve the dispute, which Arsenyev denies.

Volna suspended production for six weeks and challenged the decision in court, Arsenyev said.

A judge who ruled in a lawsuit brought by Luch concluded the ministry’s decision to reduce what would be paid for the modules hurt Russia’s supply pipeline in Ukraine.

It led to the “non-fulfilment (disruption) of the 2024 state defence procurement programme for the supply of products that are in particular demand for the SVO,” the judge wrote, using an acronym for Russia’s military operation in Ukraine.

The judge ruled in Volna’s favour, but over a dozen related suits remain unresolved.

After his Red Square protest, Arsenyev said he kept working from hospital to resolve the factory’s financial and legal problems, with little success. His company is still afloat, but it has had to downsize, and its orders are much smaller.

Now back at work, he spends much of his time attending court hearings.

The only sign that officials or prosecutors noticed his desperate act of self-immolation: In October 2024, a court fined him an undisclosed amount for staging an unauthorised demonstration in a sensitive location.

Factory worker Dipu Chandra Das, 27, was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh's Mymensingh district last week by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about the Prophet. At least 10 people have been arrested in connection with his death.

The lynching has worsened relations between India and its neighbour weeks before Bangladesh holds a parliamentary election , and both countries have suspended visa services. Ties have been strained since Bangladesh's former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to New Delhi following deadly protests against her last year.

Tuesday's demonstration, called by Hindu groups, involved people clashing with police personnel as they tried to push through barricades set up near the High Commission, television footage showed.

They also chanted slogans and burnt pictures of Yunus, with some holding posters demanding "boycott Bangladesh".

"We needed to raise the voice of Hindus in Bangladesh in Delhi, and we have done that ... as long as even one Hindu is being harmed there, we will be awake and will not stop," a protester told broadcaster India Today.

Demonstrations were also held in other parts of the country, including Jammu and Kashmir territory.

Bangladesh said it summoned the Indian envoy on Tuesday to express concern over a similar protest near its mission in New Delhi on Saturday and "violent protests" outside other diplomatic missions, urging India to investigate the incidents.

India's foreign ministry said on Sunday that the New Delhi demonstration consisted of "20-25 youths" who were dispersed by police after a few minutes, adding that India was "committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions".

The tensions with India come as Bangladesh struggles to deal with domestic unrest over the death of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi, who was shot in the head while launching his campaign for February's parliamentary election last week.

His killing sparked widespread protests that spiralled into arson and vandalism targeting major media outlets and cultural institutions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 09:49:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Now in their 50s, trans Latinas reclaim a youthful rite of passage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/now-their-50s-trans-latinas-reclaim-youthful-rite-passage-2025-12-23/</link><description>HOUSTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Like teenage girls across the Americas, Kassandra Rivas dreamed of having a quinceañera party, the rite of passage for 15-year-old Latinas.

But Rivas, now a 51-year-old transgender woman, said the idea of her celebrating a quinceañera would have been completely alien in her native state of Coahuila on Mexico's northern border with Texas.

She and other transgender Latina immigrants were recently able to celebrate this year as quinceañeras - literally translated, as 15-year-olds - thanks to the Organización Latina de Trans en Texas, a group promoting rights for LGBTQ+ people including transgender women from Latin America.

Gathering at a Houston ballroom in May, six transgender women in their 40s and 50s from Latin America donned elegant quinceañera dresses and changed into high-heeled shoes.

"Something inside me held a longing to experience this moment as a girl, as a 15-year-old," Rivas said. "I imagined myself standing before the priest in church, wearing a dress like any other woman."

The quinceañera party is similar to a "Sweet 16" for Americans, a cultural coming-of-age event that in Latin America often is preceded by a Roman Catholic mass.

Social taboos would have made it virtually impossible for transgender youth to transition decades ago in Latin America or in U.S. immigrant communities.

In the United States, transgender people face higher mortality risks due to factors such as violence and suicide. More than half the 50 states including Texas have in recent years banned medical treatments such as puberty blockers or hormone therapy for minors amid concerns that youth who may later regret their decisions have been too easily allowed to transition.

Transgender rights advocates and reproductive rights experts dispute that view, citing research showing such policies increase health risks and violate established standards of care endorsed by major medical associations.

The risks are more acute in Latin America.

A recent report by the international transgender rights group TGEU found 68% of 281 murders of transgender people in the world from October 2024 to September 2025 were committed in Latin America. And 80% of the victims were under age 40, underscoring the importance of the life celebration for the retro quinceañeras.

"I never thought I'd get to my 50s," said Vickymar Castrellon, another celebrant in Houston.

Castrellon said that as a teenager she would sometimes wear her friends' quinceañera gowns and pretend to be the girl of honor.

"It's a dream I've always had," she said. "And I feel very happy because achieving it before I leave this world is something very beautiful for me."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:49:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GLNZPEMFXRKMLGHXOXHOROWCNI.jpg?auth=76655edb1f832a8c8bc97fd8c7532f77581b64d62246d007ca04577c77012af0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Opposition candidates in Central African Republic's presidential election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/opposition-candidates-central-african-republics-presidential-election-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - President Faustin-Archange Touadera will face six other candidates in a presidential election to be held in Central African Republic on December 28, after a court rejected attempts to bar his two main rivals .

Here are brief details of Touadera's opponents:

Dologuele, 68, is a former prime minister and one of the incumbent's two main rivals. He served as prime minister in 1999-2001 and ran against Touadera in elections in 2015 and 2020.

Dologuele was the runner-up in the 2020 election, winning 21.6% of the vote. He alleged there were cases of election fraud, though a court upheld Touadera's win.

This year Touadera's supporters filed a complaint to bar Dologuele from running over allegations that he held French citizenship, which is not permitted for presidential candidates under the constitution adopted in 2023. Dologuele renounced his French citizenship this year and the Constitutional Court cleared his candidacy.

He is running without the support of the main opposition party, the Republican Bloc for the Defense of the Constitution of March 30, 2016, known by its French acronym BRDC. The party has boycotted the election - which is also for the legislature and regional and municipal positions - over concerns that the vote will not be fair or transparent.

The other main challenger to Touadera, Dondra, 59, is another former prime minister, who served from 2021-2022. The Constitutional Court cleared him to run in the election after Touadera accused him of holding Congolese citizenship, which he denied.

He started his professional career at the Banque Populaire Maroco-Centrafricaine and later spent 18 years mostly overseas at the Fonds Africain de Garantie et de Cooperation Economique (FAGACE), a financial institution that aims to finance bank loans for public and private sector investment. He climbed the ranks there to become director general.

Dondra returned to Bangui in 2016 to serve as finance and budget minister under Touadera until 2021, when he became prime minister.

Yalemende, 49, is an evangelical pastor running on a pledge to strengthen the rule of law, improve public services and fight corruption.

He has promised to restore the two-term limit on presidential rule after it was controversially scrapped in a 2023 referendum.

Djorie, 49, is a medical doctor specialized in infectious and tropical diseases who has published research with France's Institut Pasteur in Bangui.

He is a former communications minister under Touadera.

Reboas is a former director of intelligence services and minister of youth and sport.

He ran in the 2020 presidential election, winning less than 1% of the vote.

Kparekouti has made the fight against poverty his top issue in the campaign.

A civil engineer, he participated in the drafting of the constitution adopted in 2023.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:50:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SIIVHJRMZBNQJJ3AT35HIPBMUI.jpg?auth=a7fa8c6201791ae1b9ce018519b16117890fd8f0cc7d5f3681aa0933139346fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US justice department releases thousands of new Epstein-linked documents</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251223-us-justice-department-releases-thousands-new-epstein-linked-documents</link><description>At least 8,000 new documents related to the case of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein were available on Tuesday on the US Department of Justice's site (DOJ).

The DOJ has been accused of withholding information and was criticized by Democrats over the slow release and heavy redaction of records from the investigation into Epstein.

The new files include hundreds of videos or audio recordings, notably surveillance footage from August 2019, the month Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

The DOJ posted around 11,000 links to new documents online, but some of them appeared to lead nowhere.

Congress nearly unanimously passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA), which mandated the complete release of the Epstein files by last Friday.

A group of victims earlier complained that only a "fraction" of the files were released and even those were "riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation."

EFTA co-sponsors Ro Khanna, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, threatened to bring contempt charges against Attorney General Pam Bondi for failing to comply with the law.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution on Monday calling for legal action against the administration for failing to release the complete Epstein files.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche blamed the delay on the need to redact the identities of Epstein's more than 1,000 victims, and on Sunday denied allegations of protecting Trump, who was formerly a close friend of Epstein's.

Trump had initially tried to block the disclosure of the files.

But the president, who cut ties with Epstein years before his arrest and faces no accusations of wrongdoing, finally bowed to mounting pressure from Congress and signed the law compelling publication of the files.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:51:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/03dee5c6-dfea-11f0-9329-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25354084546709.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's anti-corporate DEI campaign faces high legal hurdles</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trumps-anti-corporate-dei-campaign-faces-high-legal-hurdles-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's anti-discrimination enforcement agency has a high bar to clear to prove companies' diversity, equity and inclusion policies run afoul of the law, according to interviews with more than a dozen corporate legal and compliance experts.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under new Chair Andrea Lucas is making a sharp pivot towards what she calls "a more conservative view of civil rights", like prioritizing cases of discrimination against white men.

That shift, coupled with the Trump administration’s aggressive campaign to dismantle DEI programs, is set to collide with the boundaries of U.S. discrimination law, long a cornerstone of workplace equality.

The move signals a broader campaign to redefine the meaning of workplace fairness, setting up a potential clash with corporate America, which has widely adopted DEI measures to hire and retain diverse talent.

Lucas plans to open inquiries into corporate DEI practices to find whether employers made race or sex-based decisions, she told Reuters in an exclusive interview last week. Specifically, she called for submissions of possible instances of discrimination against white men by corporate DEI practices.

But a program is not illegal just because the administration says so, said former EEOC Chair Jenny Yang. The agency still has to build a case and convince the courts that a company's programs violate discrimination law.

“In many situations, the work that might fall within the umbrella term of diversity, equity, inclusion is foundational work to prevent discrimination and ensure equal opportunity, which is the employer's obligation under the law,” Yang said.

Still, as chair, Lucas has a full suite of legal options to investigate companies that have DEI programs. She can subpoena for documents, depose executives and sue for any violation of workplace laws.

The EEOC’s looming transformation comes after nearly a year of mostly posturing against companies since Trump issued a pair of anti-DEI executive orders less than 48 hours after he was sworn into office in January, purging the government of DEI initiatives , offices and personnel and mandating every federal agency to discourage private entities from implementing DEI initiatives.

Conservatives like Robby Starbuck, a right-wing anti-DEI influencer, are capitalizing on the moment and trying to get the administration's policies into law.

"I've had a lot of conversations about that with lawmakers because that is a very, very important part of this," he said in an interview. "You have got to codify this into law; it's much harder to kill it than if it's an executive order."

Lucas said she is ready to prove - in court if necessary - that harm has been done to white men as a result of DEI programs.

She cited a widely circulated article in Compact Magazine, known for its array of bipartisan populist writers, alleging individuals were turned down for jobs because of diversity-hiring initiatives, a common conservative refrain that has been vocally criticized by experts and diversity advocates.

"If we have a charge of discrimination against you, we're going to use the full force of the federal government to remedy it," Lucas said. "This is a pro-enforcement, pro-American worker administration."

But there is still a high legal bar to clear, Rutgers law professor Stacy Hawkins said. People alleging discrimination have to demonstrate that a job, promotion, benefits or other compensation were denied because they were male and white, and because an employer preferred the race or sex of someone else.

Most of the time, it is not that white men have been discriminated against, but that the pool of applicants has grown and there is more, legitimate competition from people of color, Hawkins said.

The job market was marked by government-approved exclusion and discrimination for decades before reform, she added, and now white men have to compete against a wider diverse pool of qualified job applicants.

"The thing that has changed is that other people are not (being discriminated against)," Hawkins said.

Many companies and industries have also retooled their DEI programs to stay legally sound.

"The larger automakers are mostly on top of this with legal audits, rebranding and program modifications," said a former Detroit automotive executive, who spoke under anonymity.

The basic tenets of corporate DEI doctrine rest on three core principles: ensuring representation of people from diverse backgrounds across all levels of the workforce; equal compensation for every employee and fostering a sense of belonging, all to eliminate systemic bias in the workplace.

Employers recognize the need to hire and retain a workforce that reflects their customers as a strategic business decision that is crucial to long-term success for their employees and shareholders, said former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.

It explains why the vast majority of companies have kept their DEI programs and will continue to, despite the bluster from the White House, she said.

“DEI is essential for us to ensure that there are pathways to opportunity and that we continue to remove barriers,” said Abrams, who started a nonprofit DEI advocacy and consulting group American Pride Rises in 2023.

“Most people agree with DEI, most companies practice DEI, and most Americans want a democracy that defends DEI.”

WhatsApp's statement followed a repeat warning by Russia's communications regulator that it would completely block WhatsApp if it did not comply with its demands to bring its services into line with Russian law.

"WhatsApp continues to violate Russian law. The messenger is used to organise and carry out terrorist acts on the territory of the country, to recruit their perpetrators and to commit fraud and other crimes against our citizens," Roskomnadzor, the regulator, told Russian state media.

It confirmed it was taking measures to gradually restrict WhatsApp as a result. Thousands of Russians complained about outages and slowdowns on Tuesday, monitoring websites showed.

"In restricting access to WhatsApp, the Russian government aims to take away the right to private, end-to-end encrypted communication from over 100 million people, right before the holiday season in Russia," a WhatsApp spokesperson said.

"WhatsApp is deeply embedded in the fabric of every community in the country – from parent and workplace groups to friends, neighborhood, and extended family chats across Russian regions. We’re committed to fighting for our users because forcing people onto less secure and government-mandated apps can only lead to less safety for Russian people."

Russia in August began limiting some calls on WhatsApp , owned by Meta Platforms (META.O) , opens new tab , and on Telegram, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of refusing to share information with law enforcement in alleged fraud and terrorism cases.

Russian authorities, who also block or restrict social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, are heavily pushing a state-backed messenger app called MAX, which critics say could be used to track users.

The authorities have dismissed those accusations as false and say MAX, which integrates various government-related services into it, is designed to simplify and improve the everyday lives of citizens.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:21:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NMZVAZVVI5OOXEKMOLW4OYNPAI.jpg?auth=be66383f02800295f71caef9933da3f5a04f4548adc51982395aa960e955f8a6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sinkholes in Turkey's agricultural heartland fuel farmers' concerns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/sinkholes-turkeys-agricultural-heartland-fuel-farmers-concerns-2025-12-23/</link><description>KONYA, Turkey, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Hundreds of sinkholes have emerged in Turkey's central agricultural region due to dwindling rainfall and receding groundwaters, causing concern among farmers and environmental experts who see it as a worrying sign of climate change.

Gaping sinkholes pockmark farmland producing maize, wheat and sugar beet in Karapinar in Konya province, with more than 10 packed into a field in places. In mountainous areas, vast, ancient sinkholes previously filled with water have now mostly dried up.

The pace at which sinkholes are forming in the Konya basin has accelerated in recent years, with the total now nearing 700, according to Fetullah Arik, a geology professor studying sinkholes at Konya Technical University.

"The main reason for the increase in numbers is climate change and drought, which have affected the whole world since the 2000s," Arik said. "As a result of this drought, the groundwater level is dropping slightly every year."

He said the pace of receding groundwater levels has reached 4 to 5 metres per year, compared to half a metre per year in the 2000s, adding to concerns in Turkey's major agricultural sector.

Drought and receding groundwater lead local farmers to dig more wells, many unlicensed, further depleting the groundwater and exacerbating the problem.

"There is also an extremely high demand for water in this (Konya) basin," Arik said, adding that there are around 120,000 unlicensed wells, compared to some 40,000 licensed ones.

While the new sinkholes have not caused any casualties so far, their unpredictable nature risks the lives and belongings of locals, he said.

Two sinkholes opened up in the farmland belonging to Mustafa Sik, a farmer in Karapinar, in the past two years. His brother was only a short distance away, working on the farm in August 2024 when the second sinkhole formed with an "extremely loud, terrifying rumbling sound," Sik said.

A survey by geologists in Sik's land found two more areas where sinkholes could form – although it is not possible to predict when it will happen.

"Are we worried? Of course, we are very worried," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:42:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6Z3NKBGY7FPEJMZ57JBCYQ4H6Q.jpg?auth=7faffc317dda9591bb7034e4b2cb08ae1fdd62575326c6ed041e4b5d39f9359a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Justice Department releases new tranche of Epstein files</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-releases-new-tranche-epstein-files-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department released a new trove of documents on Tuesday from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including CCTV videos and legal records.

The latest release comprises around 29,000 pages, with many redactions, and dozens of video clips, including several purporting to be shot inside a prison. Epstein was found dead in 2019 after an apparent suicide in a New York jail.

The latest material comes a few days after the Trump administration published a large cache of Epstein files in an attempt to comply with a new law forcing disclosure on the politically fraught topic.

However the releases on Friday and Saturday contained extensive redactions, angering and doing little to defuse a scandal threatening the party ahead of 2026 midterm elections.

On Monday, Trump downplayed the importance of the Epstein files. Speaking to reporters, he said the material was "just used to deflect against tremendous success" by him and his fellow Republicans.

The new transparency law, overwhelmingly passed by Congress last month, mandated the disclosure of all Epstein files, despite Trump's months-long effort to keep them sealed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:44:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7FI6AAGRNOCZOEXSSA4IQSWMA.jpg?auth=c9b2712bab4fbdaf22ce3594ea0b87292c810d291a6e4b4c9ba876f4bc0b53fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greta Thunberg arrested at pro-Palestinian protest in London, campaign group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greta-thunberg-arrested-pro-palestinian-protest-london-campaign-group-says-2025-12-23/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - British police arrested Swedish activist Greta Thunberg in London on Tuesday at a pro-Palestinian protest, UK-based campaign group Defend Our Juries said.

Kushner's U.S.-based Affinity Global Development told the Wall Street Journal last week it was withdrawing from the project to build a hotel, apartments, shops and offices on the site of the former Yugoslav army headquarters in Belgrade.

The firm signed a 99-year lease with the Serbian government last year but the project has faced opposition.

The plans, which were backed by Serb President Aleksandar Vucic, became embroiled in a corruption scandal and led to protests by Serbs who say the dilapidated site in the centre of Belgrade should be preserved as a tribute to people killed when it was damaged in a 1999 NATO bombing campaign.

The bombing campaign was intended to stop Serbian forces attacking parts of Kosovo, which was part of Serbia at the time.

Last week, Serbia's prosecutor filed an indictment against three officials including a minister over their role in removing the protected status of the buildings this year, a move that had allowed the project to advance but which prosecutors allege was done illegally.

While the Suez Canal provides the fastest link between Asia and Europe, since November 2023, shipping companies have had to take much longer routes because Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi militants attacked commercial vessels, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians during warfare in Gaza.

Before Tuesday's announcement from the Suez Canal Authority, CMA CGM had made limited passages through the Suez Canal when security conditions allowed.

CMA CGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Companies remain cautious, but since a fragile ceasefire in Gaza took effect on October 10, no Houthi attacks on ships have been reported, leading shipping companies to reconsider using the Suez Canal , which Egypt counts on as a major source of foreign currency.

The canal's authority said on Tuesday that the vessel CMA CGM Jacques Saade crossed the canal from the north on its journey from Morocco to Malaysia, while the CMA CGM Adonis passed from the south.

A schedule published on the CMA CGM website showed that the French company will use the passage for its India-U.S. INDAMEX service from January.

On Friday, Maersk said that one of its vessels had navigated the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait between Yemen and the Horn of Africa for the first time in nearly two years.

The Danish company said it had no firm plans to fully reopen the route, but would take a "stepwise approach towards gradually resuming navigation".</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:45:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BI7DNIZ7UVOQVIUDOKFXAE3AWY.jpg?auth=7068e771908064fc18dccb2f0e4a2b615b06193518e6402e99bc70ea4ae61bc8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria detains prominent American Islamist journalist, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/syria-detains-prominent-american-islamist-journalist-sources-say-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - A prominent American Islamist journalist who has been critical of Syria's new government and its nascent partnership with the United States has been detained by Syrian security forces, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Bilal Abdul Kareem, a former stand-up comedian in the U.S. turned war journalist who has lived in Syria since 2012 and worked with many foreign media outlets, was detained in Al-Bab in northern Aleppo province on Monday, they said.

Syria's information ministry, an interior ministry spokesperson and a spokesperson for the U.S. special envoy to Syria did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Abdul Kareem has been a prominent voice among foreign Islamists in Syria, giving air to hardliners who view President Ahmed al-Sharaa - who once commanded Al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria - as compromising too much on Islamic values since taking power.

In August, Abdul Kareem petitioned the Syrian state to give citizenship to foreign jihadists among the rebels who swept to power with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that ousted autocratic President Bashar al-Assad a year ago.

The fate of foreign fighters has loomed large since then, with few countries willing to take back people they often view as extremists and some Syrians wary of their presence.

Al-Sharaa's government has progressively limited their space for expression, detaining several, including some with a significant online presence.

In Abdul Kareem's latest video, he criticised Syria's decision to join the U.S.-led global coalition fighting Islamic State. The video was published a day after a gunman said by the U.S. and Syria to have been a member of Islamic State killed two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter in eastern Syria. IS has not directly claimed responsibility for the attack.

In the video posted on X, Abdul Kareem begins: "I'm not going to sugarcoat this, and it probably is going to get me in trouble, but here is the reality. The Americans have no legitimate reasons to be here."

He adds: "We simply cannot legitimise the presence of the enemy, and I said America is the enemy of the Syrian people."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:45:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Lavrov to meet Syrian counterpart for talks in Moscow, TASS cites foreign ministry</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/russias-lavrov-meet-syrian-counterpart-talks-moscow-tass-cites-foreign-ministry-2025-12-23/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will hold talks with his Syrian counterpart Asaad Al-Shaibani in Moscow on Tuesday, the TASS state news agency reported, citing ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:45:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BU6HN5ZAA5JUBMGAJ7NDMOEXPU.jpg?auth=d344103e5e8e372d83a88fd0215888cb16929a93b6562d8d9b6fd4a98676cb74&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Companies collecting pennies on the dollar in market to recoup some tariff costs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/companies-collecting-pennies-dollar-market-recoup-some-tariff-costs-2025-12-23/</link><description>NEW YORK, Dec  23 (Reuters) - Some U.S. companies are hedging their bets on the Supreme Court case against President Donald Trump's sweeping emergency tariffs by selling their rights to collect potential government refunds of the taxes to outside investors.

Atlanta-based Kids2, which makes 95% of its toys and infant products in China, is one.

Mark Mintman, the company's CFO, calls it a "cost recovery action." He first heard about selling potential refunds during a September meeting with bankers in New York, where one mentioned that a secretive market has emerged for selling the claims.

Under the deals, companies receive a fraction of the refund as an upfront payment. They keep that money if the tariffs are overturned and the government is directed to refund the taxes, but they give up the balance to the investors. They also keep the money if the tariffs are upheld, while investors get nothing.

This is just the latest twist on Wall Street’s keen ability to capitalize on cash flow. Similar markets exist for selling future payments from structured lawsuit settlements and lottery-winning annuities. David Bowie famously sold his royalty cash flow in what became known as "Bowie Bonds."

President Trump has said it would be an "economic disaster" if the tariffs are overturned. It’s not clear when the high court will issue its ruling, and whether companies will be entitled to refunds that could total more than $100 billion if Trump loses.

"We remain confident in the legal merits of the President's lawful use of tariffs," said a White House official in a text response to Reuters.

Mintman said he worked with a division of Jefferies LLC to find the buyer, a Boston-based hedge fund. He declined to identify the buyer because of a nondisclosure in their agreement. A spokesman for Jefferies declined to comment on their work brokering such deals.

There was pressure from the hedge fund to conclude the transaction quickly, said Mintman. The hedge fund required the deal to close before oral arguments at the high court, which took place in early November. The Supreme Court typically takes months to issue rulings after hearing oral arguments. The Trump administration has asked for a quick decision but the timing remains unclear.

Mintman said, among other things, he talked to his legal counsel to get an opinion on the trade and checked Polymarket, the prediction market, to see what the chances were that the tariffs would be ruled unconstitutional. The company, known for brands such as Baby Einstein, received a total of $2 million, a fraction of the $15 million they had paid to U.S. customs through September.

Kids2 received 23 cents on the dollar for tariffs they paid under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The use of this law to impose tariffs has drawn wide criticism, since it doesn’t directly reference tariffs. It does say the president has the authority to regulate imports during a national emergency.

The company got less—nine cents on the dollar—for separate emergency tariffs aimed at stopping fentanyl smuggling. The lower payment reflects the assumption that fentanyl tariffs are more likely to be upheld, said Mintman.

Known as "special situations" trades, these deals are attractive to investors because the assets are uncorrelated to broader markets and offer potential upside if the court strikes down the tariffs as unconstitutional, two legal sources who are working with buyers and sellers in the market told Reuters.

"There's a very well-established market...where there are buyers...who are willing to provide instant liquidity to parties that are uncertain as to when, if ever, they'll be able to monetize these claims," said Raniero D'Aversa, partner and chair of law firm Orrick's restructuring team.

Orrick started seeing demand for refund claims soon after tariffs were implemented in April. Many buyers are currently quoting 16-17% for fentanyl tariff claims and 26-28% for reciprocal tariff claims, said Amy Pasacreta, of counsel, on Orrick's restructuring team.

"Some [are] saying, 'you know what, I'd rather get my 10, 20, 30 cents because Supreme Court could very well say they're constitutional.' And if that's the case, at least I get a little something recouped," said Pasacreta.

That's a good description of Kids2’s motivation. Mintman said it took two years to get fully reimbursed for tax credits the company received under a program that rewarded firms for avoiding layoffs during the Covid pandemic.

"I'd anticipate customs would be inundated if this is overturned," he said, "so not expecting we'd get anything quickly." Given the value of money received now—rather than possibly years from now—the company "thought it was a good deal."

He also liked the odds. Going by the history of this administration’s success with cases before the Supreme Court, Mintman said he estimates a favorable outcome for Kids2 is still only 50-50. "In the back of my mind," he said, "I think I got 2 million bucks for free."

To be sure, many companies are passing up the opportunity to sell their claims. Mark Bissell, CEO of vacuum maker Bissell Inc., said he’s been approached about selling his refund rights but has no interest. He said it reminds him of late-night television ads that offer to buy the rights to payouts under life insurance policies. And he suspects the administration will find a way to keep collecting the taxes.

"My view is that if the Supreme Court finds tariffs illegal, that the administration has plan B or C or D up their sleeve to throw at it next," said Bissell.

Meanwhile, back at Kids2, they are considering another round of hedging—to recoup some of the tariffs paid since September.

Mintman said he just asked Jefferies whether investors are still buying claims, and if so, what they're paying.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:45:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YAWCGD2VMBMEZBF65GZLXPQX3Q.jpg?auth=7c8dd497dfb80a7fbdeb8d333e9f24f58cb99b707292af7df155040a7c75838f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli defence minister vows military to remain in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/israeli-defence-minister-vows-military-remain-gaza-2025-12-23/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said on Tuesday that the military would never fully withdraw from the Gaza Strip for security reasons and that a civilian-military army unit would be established in the Palestinian enclave.

According to a U.S.-backed peace plan signed by both Israel and Hamas in October, the Israeli military will gradually withdraw completely from the coastal enclave and Israel will not re-establish civilian settlements in the coastal territory.

"We are located deep inside Gaza and we will never leave all of Gaza. There will never be such a thing. We are there to protect, to prevent what happened," Katz said in a speech, referring to Hamas' October 7, 2023 raid on Israel.

The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment.

Referring to units of the Israeli military, Katz said: "When the time comes, in northern Gaza ... we will build Nahal units instead of the (Israeli) communities that were displaced. We will do so in the right way at the right time."

"We don't trust anybody else to protect our citizens," he said, pointing to what he said was also a need to be also in Lebanon and Syria.

Katz's mention of displaced communities appeared to refer to Israel's withdrawal of all Jewish settlements from Gaza in 2005.

Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of re-establishing settlements in Gaza throughout the two-year Gaza war, although some ultra-nationalist members of his coalition seek to reoccupy Gaza.

Nahal units in Israel's armed forces are for civilians interested in enlisting in the military, which includes a year of pre-military preparatory and volunteer programmes. These units have had a historic role in creating Israeli communities.

Israel is heading into an election year in 2026 and the issue of settlements is expected to be a key issue.

Katz was speaking at a ceremony in the Israeli-occupied West Bank announcing the establishment of 1,200 housing units in the Israeli settlement of Beit El. The units are being built in place of an Israeli military base that is being shut.

Speaking about the West Bank, Katz said: "Netanyahu's government is a settlements government... it strives for action. If we can get sovereignty, we will bring about sovereignty... We are in the practical sovereignty era," Katz said. "There are opportunities here that haven't been here for a long time."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7OTBCSNLKBLKTGH5TIIYZZTW3Y.jpg?auth=a8024abfa1a7b81a83d89c5bbc72748a25937fd42b1143baea88b633315d90d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany deports criminal to Syria as pressure mounts on migration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/germany-deports-criminal-syria-pressure-mounts-migration-2025-12-23/</link><description>BERLIN, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Germany deported a convicted criminal to Syria on Tuesday for the first time since the start of a 14-year-long civil war there as the government in Berlin tries to show voters it is addressing their worries about migration.

Around a million Syrians live in Germany, a legacy of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy, but migration now tops surveys of voters' concerns and support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has surged.

In response, conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz has taken a tougher line on border security and migration, pledging to speed up deportations. Syria has become a focus since the end of the civil war last year.

The Syrian criminal was handed to authorities in Damascus on Tuesday morning, the interior ministry said, adding that another criminal was sent to Afghanistan, the second deportation there in a week.

"Deportations to Syria and Afghanistan must be possible," said Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt.

"Our society has a legitimate interest in ensuring that criminals leave our country,” he said.

Critics have argued that deporting migrants back to the two countries would put them at excessive risk.

The man sent to Syria had served a prison sentence in north-western Germany for aggravated robbery, bodily harm, and extortion. The Afghan offender had been in prison in southern Bavaria for, among other things, intentional bodily harm.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says several draft documents prepared after 'productive' U.S. talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-several-draft-documents-prepared-after-productive-us-talks-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>K-Pop concert to be held in Hong Kong and aired in mainland China, organisers say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/k-pop-concert-be-held-hong-kong-aired-mainland-china-organisers-say-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>'No other work': Syrian fuel smugglers risk their lives between front lines</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/the-observers/20251223-syria-front-lines-business-fuel-smuggling</link><description>Every morning, along the dusty roads of northeast Syria , convoys of motorcyclists speed by, jerricans of petrol and diesel strapped tightly to their bikes. These smugglers are the faces of a lucrative business that has thrived since the fall of Bashar al-Assad .

The smugglers buy fuel in the areas controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), where petrol and diesel are cheaper. They take it to zones controlled by the new Islamist government.

Most of the oilfields and oil wells in Syria are located in zones controlled by the SDF in the country's east. Meanwhile, the government has to purchase fuel at high prices from intermediaries in Kurdish-controlled regions.

Day Hafir, under SDF control, has become a key supply point for the smugglers, much like the neighbouring town of Maskana.

This is where the smugglers get their supplies. Both ordinary residents and organised traffickers then transport the fuel westward towards Manbij – some carrying just one or two jerrycans, others with small trucks piled high with tanks.

The smugglers unload when they reach their destination. They earn $10 for each jerrycan, a pittance considering the risks involved. The smugglers risk arrest at any moment by the government or the SDF. They also risk being shot at.

In November, a group of smugglers was shot at in Dayr Hafir. Several of them were injured. A pickup truck transporting barrels of fuel was also targeted in an attack that claimed the life of a 32-year-old man.

Our Observer Ali (pseudonym), who is based in the region, told our team:

“I have talked to several smugglers. They tell me that there's no other work. Smuggling is the only way they can make a living. They have no option but to risk their lives.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2174af00-df2f-11f0-95d8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/essence-syrie-2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian PM Albanese to invite Israeli President Herzog following anti-Semitic attack</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251223-australian-pm-albanese-to-invite-israeli-president-herzog-following-anti-semitic-attack</link><description>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday said his government would invite Israel 's president to visit, after a mass shooting in Sydney targeting the Jewish community.

(Yes!) that followed a call to arms for the country, government sources said on Tuesday.

A source close to the matter said the Defence Staff issued official instructions about the tweak in recent weeks, in compliance with a presidential decree published on the official gazette in May that referred to the anthem's original version.

Before the latest change, the "Brothers of Italy" anthem concluded with: "We are ready to die, We are ready to die, Italy has called! Yes!"

News of the removal of the final word, which was not publicised by the government, was first reported by Il Fatto Quotidiano daily on Tuesday, and confirmed by sources in the defence ministry and the office of President Sergio Mattarella.

A presidential office source said the modification was not for any political reason but for the sake of purity, removing an addition to the original lyrics.

"Brothers of Italy", which is also the name of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's party, was penned by poet Goffredo Mameli in 1847, before Italy was unified.

While Mameli's lyrics did not include "Si", the word figures in the original musical score for the anthem, composed in the same year by Michele Novaro.

Reproductions of the original lyrics and score are posted on the government's website.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:23:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7PJGHIHDXJL2NN22XG6LP54QLY.jpg?auth=875f72c6dff34cd1c927b846b511750dbea6e4e023e4f6d3188d823b5b1441ab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two men found guilty of UK plot to kill hundreds of Jews as IS fears grow</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/two-uk-men-found-guilty-over-terrorism-plot-against-jewish-community-2025-12-23/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Two men were found guilty on Tuesday of plotting to kill hundreds in an Islamic State-inspired gun rampage against the Jewish community in England, a planned attack investigators say demonstrates the resurgent risk posed by the militant group.

Police and prosecutors said Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, who went on trial a week after an unrelated deadly attack on a synagogue in the nearby northwest city of Manchester in October, were Islamic extremists who wanted to use automatic firearms to kill as many Jews as they could.

Had their plans come to fruition, it would have resulted in "one of, if not the, deadliest terrorist attack in UK history", said Assistant Chief Constable Robert Potts, in charge of Counter-Terrorism Policing in northwest England.

Their convictions come little more than a week after a mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach in which 15 people were killed .

Islamic State said the Australian attacks were a "source of pride". Although the jihadist group did not claim responsibility, its response has heightened fears of an increase in violent Islamist extremism.

While not posing the same threat of a decade ago when Islamic State controlled vast areas of Iraq and Syria, European security officials caution that IS and affiliated al Qaeda groups are once again looking to export violence abroad, radicalising would-be attackers online.

"You can see signs of some of those terrorism threats starting to grow again and starting to escalate," British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said last week.

British prosecutors told jurors that Saadaoui and Hussein had "embraced the views" of Islamic State and were prepared to risk their own lives in order to become "martyrs".

Saadaoui had arranged for two assault rifles, an automatic pistol and almost 200 rounds of ammunition to be smuggled into Britain through the port of Dover when he was arrested in May 2024, prosecutor Harpreet Sandhu said.

He added that Saadaoui planned to obtain two more rifles, another pistol and collect at least 900 rounds. Unbeknown to him, a man known as "Farouk" he was trying to get the weapons from was an undercover operative, which police said meant his plan never came close to being put into operation.

Sandhu said the assault rifles Saadaoui wanted were similar to those used in a 2015 Islamist militant attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris that killed 130 people. He added that Saadaoui "hero-worshipped" Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who coordinated that attack.

Saadaoui said in a message to "Farouk", whom he thought was a fellow militant, that the Paris attack was "the biggest operation after that of Osama (bin Laden)", an apparent reference to the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States.

"Based on Walid's communications and interactions with the undercover operative, and some of the things he said, that made it very clear that he regarded a less sophisticated attack with less lethal weaponry as not being good enough," Potts said.

"Because, in effect, it was his role and his duty to kill as many Jewish people as he could, and that wasn't going to be achieved via the use of a knife or, for example, potentially a vehicle as a weapon."

Both Saadaoui and Hussein had pleaded not guilty and Saadaoui said that he had played along with the plot out of fear for his life.

Hussein did not give evidence and barely attended his trial after he angrily shouted from the dock on the first day "how many babies?" in an apparent reference to Israel's war in Gaza.

They were convicted in Preston Crown Court on a single charge of preparing terrorist acts.

Walid Saadaoui's brother Bilel Saadaoui, 36, was found guilty of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism but prosectors said he had been reluctant to join the attack.

The foiled plot is the latest in Britain and elsewhere inspired by Islamic State , which emerged in Iraq and Syria a decade ago and quickly created a "caliphate", declaring its rule over all Muslims and largely displacing al Qaeda.

At the height of its power from 2014-17, Islamic State held swathes of the two countries, ruling over millions of people and imposing a strict, brutal interpretation of Islamic sharia law.

Its fighters also carried out or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world, which were often claimed by Islamic State even without any actual connection.

The SITE Intelligence Group said in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack in Australia that IS had encouraged Muslims to take action elsewhere, particularly singling out Belgium.

A European intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said IS was flooding social media with propaganda and while this impacted only a handful of people, it meant there were more terrorism investigations than last year.

Ken McCallum, head of Britain's domestic spy agency MI5, said in October that his service and the police had thwarted 19 late-stage attack plots since the start of 2020, and intervened to counter many hundreds of other terrorism threats.

"Terrorism breeds in squalid corners of the internet where poisonous ideologies, of whatever sort, meet volatile, often chaotic individual lives," McCallum said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:23:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US 'not satisfied' with M23 withdrawal from Congo town, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-not-satisfied-with-m23-withdrawal-congo-town-official-says-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:24:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US plans to impose tariffs on Chinese chips in mid-2027, USTR says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-impose-tariffs-chips-china-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would slap tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports starting in June, 2027 at a rate to be announced at least a month in advance.

Israel’s military said the men were involved in planning attacks against its forces and that two were members of Hezbollah’s air defence unit . It also alleged that one of those killed was serving concurrently in Lebanese army intelligence.

The Lebanese army later confirmed that Warrant Officer Ali Abdullah of the army's Support Brigade and Anti-Tank Regiment was killed when an Israeli air strike hit a vehicle near Sidon on Monday.

The Lebanese defence ministry said suggestions that army personnel were tied to political or armed groups were false, and Defence Minister Michel Menassa said such reports amounted to a “malicious attack” on the institution.

A Hezbollah official also denied to Reuters any link between the group and members of the Lebanese army.

Diplomatic efforts are continuing to try to shore up a fragile truce along the Israel–Lebanon border.

A U.S.-backed ceasefire agreed in November 2024 ended more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and required the disarmament of the Iran-aligned group, beginning in areas south of the river adjacent to Israel.

On Tuesday, the Lebanese army said it was nearing completion of the first phase of its plan and was carefully assessing and planning subsequent stages, taking into account all relevant conditions and developments.

Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of attempting to rebuild military infrastructure in southern Lebanon, saying such activity violates understandings governing the Israel–Lebanon frontier.

A committee overseeing the Hezbollah–Israel truce said last week it was focusing on returning displaced civilians to their homes, amid concerns that tensions could flare if a year-end deadline to disarm Hezbollah is not met.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:22:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G6XXT7BLKVOIND6BNTS5ZUFXIA.jpg?auth=7a6bb98439b70ee73a48864f7f7a68ab07e142f3c563be8aa1d036227b59d5a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he invited Kazakh, Uzbek leaders to G20 Summit next year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-says-he-invited-kazakh-uzbek-leaders-g20-summit-next-year-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he spoke with the presidents of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and invited both leaders to the G20 summit next year in Miami, Florida.

"This is one of the emergency measures decided after the theft," the museum's deputy administrator Francis Steinbock told AFP.

Early in the morning, workers on the gallery balcony helped position a large grille hoisted by a crane to secure it to the gallery's tall French door windows.

"We had committed to doing it before the end of the year," Steinbock said, adding that discussions were ongoing regarding "securing the other windows".

Louvre director Laurence des Cars told lawmakers last week that a grille would be reinstalled "before Christmas", noting that one had been removed in 2003-2004 during restoration work on the Apollo Gallery.

The bars are the latest measure put in place in recent months as the security standards at the world's most visited museum in Paris are facing intense scrutiny following the October heist when thieves stole jewellery worth an estimated $102 million.

A police unit has been deployed at the museum, and a project for increased video surveillance is underway, Steinbock said.

Last week, the Louvre also announced the completion of anti-intrusion measures around the museum.

The October 19 robbery saw thieves park a truck with an extendable ladder below the Apollo Gallery housing the French crown jewels.

They clambered up, broke a window and used angle grinders to cut into glass display booths containing the treasures, which remain missing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:24:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b7790340-ade6-11f0-84e1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25292530722533.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lawsuit challenges Trump administration's ending of protections for South Sudanese migrants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/lawsuit-challenges-trump-administrations-ending-protections-south-sudanese-2025-12-23/</link><description>BOSTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Immigrant rights advocates have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision last month to end the temporary protections from deportation granted to more than 200 South Sudanese nationals.

Four migrants from South Sudan, along with the non-profit African Communities Together, alleged in a lawsuit , opens new tab filed in Boston federal court on Monday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was unlawfully putting them at risk of losing their temporary protected status after January 5.

That status, known as TPS, is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

The lawsuit argues the agency's action violated the statute governing the TPS program, ignored the dire humanitarian conditions that remain in South Sudan, and was motivated by discrimination against migrants who are not white in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment.

"This pattern reveals the administration’s true agenda: stripping protections from immigrant communities of color regardless of the dangers they face," Amaha Kassa, the executive director of African Communities Together, said in a statement.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

South Sudan has faced repeated bouts of violent conflict since 2011, with a civil war between 2013 and 2018 killing 400,000 people. The United States began designating South Sudan for TPS in 2011.

About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications for that same protection, according to the lawsuit.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on November 5, published a notice terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.

She did so after her department moved to similarly end temporary protections extended to foreign nationals from countries including Syria , Venezuela , Haiti , Cuba and Nicaragua, prompting several court challenges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V5LFT476Q5JZNOVS3BRLSKCPJI.jpg?auth=906441d727ca5b076d09678f31f26fc8b76d4ebee263c9ac6220173c19b7f55b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Five killed as Mexican plane carrying burned 2-year-old crashes off Texas coast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/five-killed-mexican-plane-carrying-burned-2-year-old-crashes-off-texas-coast-2025-12-23/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - At least five people, including a 2-year-old burn victim, died when a small Mexican Navy aircraft crashed on Monday off the Texas coast near Galveston during a humanitarian mission to transfer the child for treatment in the United States.

The Navy said that of the eight people on board the aircraft, two survived the crash and one was missing. The flight was carrying the child from the southern Mexican city of Merida.

President Claudia Sheinbaum said the child was among those killed, and that rescue workers were still searching for the missing person.

"My condolences to the relatives ... and those who were travelling in the aircraft," she said during her regular morning press conference. "There were medics, nurses, Navy personnel and relatives of the child."

The sheriff's office in Galveston did not immediately respond to a request for more information.

Local Mexican broadcaster N+ said the 2-year-old had suffered third-degree burns from a boiling water spill and that various hospitals around the family's home city of Escarcega had said they were not able to treat such a serious burn.

N+ reported that at a hospital in Merida, some 320 km (200 miles) away, the child's family was put in touch with the Michou y Mau Foundation, which assists Mexican children with severe burns.

In some cases, the charity takes severely burned children for treatment at a hospital in Galveston.

Sheinbaum said the crash would be investigated, adding her government was working closely with the U.S. to discover what happened during the 10 minutes in which the aircraft lost communication with ground personnel in Galveston.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected," added U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Citing better cooperation, Montenegro lifts visas for Turkish citizens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/citing-better-cooperation-montenegro-lifts-visas-turkish-citizens-2025-12-23/</link><description>BELGRADE, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Montenegro on Tuesday revoked its decision to insist on visas for Turkish citizens and reintroduced a visa-free regime but for a shortened duration, citing improved cooperation with Turkish authorities.

Following violence triggered by the stabbing of a Montenegrin man in the capital Podgorica by a group of Turks, Montenegro in October suspended a regime that had allowed visa-free stays of up to 90 days for Turkish nationals.

"The material considered today states that cooperation with the Turkish authorities has been enhanced, alongside the implementation of strengthened security and migration checks," Montenegro's government said in a statement.

"The decision provides for a reduction of the permitted stay from 90 to 30 days, with a note that the visa regime may be reinstated in the event of an assessment of security risks."

The government said that by lifting visas for Turkish nationals it has aligned its policy with that of the European Union that it aims to join.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/INPHCA4KBFI4ZE6UK7253AP4FM.jpg?auth=9126561a2d21944e6a0a61c6d6a242d3c52e2702163827585853fd773c401dd6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CSG will supply trucks to Slovak army under framework deal worth up to $1.2 billion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/csg-will-supply-trucks-slovak-army-under-framework-deal-worth-up-12-billion-2025-12-23/</link><description>PRAGUE, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Arms and ammunition maker Czechoslovak Group has signed a framework agreement with Slovakia's defence ministry to supply up to 1,289 military trucks in a deal worth potentially as much as 1.03 billion euros ($1.2 billion) over the coming years, CSG said on Tuesday.

The Czech-based company has been rapidly growing due mainly to increased demand for artillery shells and military equipment by Ukraine and European countries following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

It has also expanded its production of heavy military equipment and made acquisitions across Europe and the United States.

CSG, which said in September it was considering an initial public offering , said the contract with the Slovak defence ministry was for long-term supply of various types of trucks based on its Tatra Force platform.

In recent weeks, the company announced orders worth potentially billions of euros including making hulls for Leopard 2A8 tanks for their producer KNDS, a framework deal with the Slovak government for a large-calibre ammunition sales platform for European countries, and supplies of ammunition and 4,000 trucks to Asia.

The urgent public appeal charged that Tabari, a 67-year-old mother, was handed a death sentence in October following "a sham 10-minute trial , held remotely via videoconference without her chosen legal representation".

The letter, which was organised by a London-based association of families of victims called Justice for the Victims of the 1988 Massacre in Iran, said Tabari faced "execution solely for holding a banner bearing the words 'Woman, Resistance, Freedom'".

The banner was an apparent play on "Woman, Life, Freedom", a popular slogan during the 2022 nationwide protests sparked by the death in Iranian custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini .

There was no mention in Iranian official media about her case, nor confirmation that she had been sentenced to death.

Nonetheless, a group of eight independent United Nations rights experts also issued a statement Tuesday demanding Iran "immediately stop the execution" of Tabari, saying she had been found guilty of "baghi", or armed rebellion, based solely on the banner and an unpublished audio message.

"Ms. Tabari's case shows a pattern of serious violations of international human rights law regarding fair trial guarantees and the inappropriate use of capital punishment for broad and ill-defined national security offences," they said.

The experts, who are mandated by the UN Human Rights Council but do not speak on behalf of the world body, stressed that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Iran, restricts use of the death penalty to the "most serious crimes".

"This case involves no intentional killing and contains numerous procedural violations," they said, insisting that "to execute Tabari under these circumstances would constitute arbitrary execution".

Tuesday's joint appeal, signed by the former presidents of Switzerland and Ecuador, as well as the former prime ministers of Finland, Peru, Poland and Ukraine, charged that the case laid bare the "terror" faced by women for decades in Iran, which is "today the world's number one executioner of women per capita".

According to Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), Iranian authorities have executed more than 40 women this year alone.

"In Iran, daring to hold a sign declaring women's resistance to oppression is now punishable by death," said Tuesday's letter, which was also signed by a slew of sitting judges, diplomats and current parliamentarians like US Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace.

"We demand Zahra's immediate release, and we call on governments worldwide to stand with the women of Iran in their quest for democracy , equality, and freedom."

The appeal said Tabari stood accused of collaborating with the opposition organisation People's Mujahedin (PMOI, also known by the Persian acronym MEK), which is banned in Iran.

PMOI told AFP she was one of 18 activists who were currently on death row in Iran for their affiliation with the group.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:31:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4da927c-e016-11f0-a7f2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/6fe1a747-fb66-4918-a9c2-13c4377c9545.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Louvre museum installs security bars on balcony used in October's heist</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/louvre-museum-installs-security-bars-balcony-used-octobers-heist-2025-12-23/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 23 (Reuters) - France's Louvre museum on Tuesday installed security bars on the balcony that burglars used to break in and steal some of the crown jewels.

Four people broke into the world's most visited museum on October 19 and escaped with jewels worth an estimated $102 million, exposing glaring security gaps and revealing its deteriorating state .

They parked a movers' lift outside the museum, jumped on the balcony of the Apollo gallery, smashed a window, cracked open display cases with angle grinders and fled on the back of scooters driven by accomplices in a heist lasting less than 7 minutes.

On Tuesday, a crane lifted the security grille into place to seal the glass door leading to the balcony.

"The Louvre is learning all the lessons from the theft of October 19 and is continuing its transformation and the strengthening of its security architecture," the museum said in a post on X.

It also said a mobile police squad was now present at the roundabout in front of the iconic glass pyramid, and 100 more cameras would be deployed around the museum next year.

Police have identified eight suspects in connection with the heist, though the jewels are still missing.

The break-in raised awkward questions about security at the Louvre, which is home to priceless artworks such as the Mona Lisa.

Louvre officials have admitted there was inadequate security camera coverage of the outside walls of the museum and no coverage of the balcony involved in the break-in.

The heist was one of several woes to hit the museum in recent weeks: another gallery, adjacent to the Apollo, was closed because of structural weakness , a water leak damaged books at the Egyptian antiquities department and the museum was partly closed for several days after its staff went on strike.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:54:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPXP5E4IMVNDTFATAPN7IRWDDI.jpg?auth=73244c65d1c1ff829be7c8e2c2b12b3d3a4600ff77724c6cb0d5400b2ed6976a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police drop probe into Bob Vylan comments about Israeli military</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-drop-probe-into-bob-vylan-comments-about-israeli-military-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:55:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Greta Thunberg released from custody after arrest at UK pro-Palestinian protest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/greta-thunberg-released-custody-after-arrest-uk-pro-palestinian-protest-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:55:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Palestinian farmers in West Bank face rising Israeli settler attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/the-observers/20251223-west-bank-palestinian-farmers-rising-israeli-settler-attacks</link><description>Palestinian villages in the West Bank are facing a surge in attacks by Israeli settlers. According to UN data, there were nearly 260 attacks against Palestinian homes, businesses and farms in October 2025 alone.

Agricultural lands – particularly olive groves – have become primary targets. These farms are the backbone of the local economy and a crucial source of income for many families. World Bank figures indicate that 74 percent of West Bank farmers have lost half of their income since 2023.

Israeli activists often join the farmers to provide what they call a “protective presence”. Yael Moav is one of them. She told the Observers team that these attacks aim to force Palestinians off their land. Moav says that Israeli authorities are supporting settlers and facilitating their presence in the West Bank.

We also spoke with a Palestinian olive farmer whose land is regularly targeted. He reports that settlers from a nearby outpost attack his farm on a weekly basis.

According to the Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din, 94 percent of cases involving offences committed by Israelis against Palestinians are closed with no charges being filed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:55:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/efd14ed2-dff0-11f0-9ea7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/vlcsnap-2025-12-22-17h58m24s736.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police say comedian Russell Brand charged with two more sex offences</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-say-comedian-russell-brand-charged-with-two-more-sex-offences-2025-12-23/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - British police said on Tuesday that comedian Russell Brand had been charged with a new count of rape and another of sexual assault.

The U.S. Coast Guard this month intercepted the Skipper and Centuries tankers in the Caribbean Sea, both fully loaded with Venezuelan crude, and was this week pursuing a third empty vessel that was approaching the OPEC country's shore.

The actions targeting some vessels of a so-called "shadow fleet" of ships carrying sanctioned oil, coupled with President Donald Trump's announced blockade of all vessels subject to U.S. sanctions, has scared many ship owners away and left more than a dozen cargoes stuck in Venezuelan waters waiting to depart.

The emerging backlog, as PDVSA produces about 1.1 million barrels of crude per day, is quickly filling the company's onshore tanks, especially at the Jose terminal, which receives extra heavy oil from the country's main output region, the Orinoco Belt, according to the documents.

PDVSA began draining part of those inventories to oil tankers over the past weekend, shipping and company data showed, a strategy it has resorted to in past years to avoid cutting back oil production.

Since PDVSA's main joint-venture partner Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab has not suspended exports of the crude grades they jointly produce, most inventories at Venezuela's western region, where storage capacity is very limited, are close to normal levels, the documents showed.

Chevron, however, is responsible for only about a quarter of the crude grades produced at blending stations and upgraders in the Orinoco Belt, or about 130,000 bpd. PDVSA typically exports the three other quarters to China, which has been the destination of about 80% of Venezuela's crude exports this year.

As oil exports had stabilized and rose through November, PDVSA's onshore stocks at Jose, including crude and diluents, had reduced to some 9 million barrels last month from a peak of 17 million barrels earlier this year. But by mid-December they had again surpassed 10 million barrels, the documents showed.

PDVSA had been pushing customers to continue receiving oil cargoes bound for China at the Jose port through last week, but convincing them is now growing difficult after the U.S. targeted two more vessels over the weekend, company sources said.

Building floating storage has become necessary as the company negotiates price discounts and contract changes with some customers, while others begin to push to return their cargoes to the terminals, the sources added.

Last week, top officials at PDVSA discussed but then declined to declare force majeure over some crude exports, sources said, in an attempt to negotiate individually with its customers. Under force majeure, a seller frees itself from its delivery commitments for reasons out of its control set in contracts.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday evening said oil cargo deliveries for Chevron to export would continue even amid the dispute with Washington, which is ratcheting up pressure on him to leave power.

"(Under) rain, thunder, or lightning, and regardless of any conflicts, the contract with Chevron will be fulfilled. We are serious, decent people," he said in a televised speech.

Chevron has repeatedly said that its operations in Venezuela "continue without disruption and in full compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its business."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:23:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OWS4RA5TSRNMHDVIFHCVRF56UQ.jpg?auth=526265c7c85d915f40dead2d211126bbbc7f9bad84e604dad8262968dee1705c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Justice Department releases card mentioning Trump, purportedly sent from Epstein to Nassar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/justice-department-releases-card-mentioning-trump-purportedly-sent-epstein-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department released an image on Tuesday of a card that makes a crude reference to President Donald Trump, purportedly written by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar, who is serving a life sentence for sexually abusing hundreds of girls.

Reuters could not determine whether the card is authentic.

The postmark on its envelope is Virginia, not New York where Epstein was jailed, and indicates the envelope was processed three days after his death in August 2019. The return address on the envelope misidentifies the jail where Epstein was being held and does not include his inmate number, which the Bureau of Prisons policy manual requires be included on outgoing mail.

The card features an image of a couple holding hands across a table and says in a handwritten note that "our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls." It was part of some 30,000 pages of documents released to the public on Tuesday.

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the card. There have been no allegations in the Justice Department disclosures of Epstein's files that Trump committed any crime.

Epstein's card also includes the message: "As you know by now, I have taken the 'short route' home," a possible allusion to suicide. Epstein was found dead in his cell on August 10, 2019. The Justice Department has said that he killed himself.

One of Nassar's former lawyers, Shannon Smith, declined to comment. Another former lawyer, Matthew Newburg, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The government obtained the handwritten card when it was returned to the federal detention center in New York as undeliverable after Epstein, an American financier with connections to prominent figures, had died in what authorities ruled a suicide. Another record the government released shows the FBI requested a handwriting analysis to determine whether it was written by Epstein; the results of that assessment, if one was conducted, were not immediately available.

The Justice Department said in a statement on X on Tuesday that "Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false." The statement did not detail which documents it was referring to.

The Associated Press reported in 2023 that a card had been returned to the New York jail addressed from Epstein to Nassar. It was found in the jail's mail room after Epstein died. It was unclear if the two men had any previous relationship.

Nassar, who served as Olympic gymnasts’ team doctor for 18 years, was sentenced in 2017 to 60 years in federal prison for possessing child sex abuse material, and in 2018 received two Michigan sentences totaling up to 300 years for molesting gymnasts under his care.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:23:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3BJFXCZULVNCRD3NTHAM4C4RAU.jpg?auth=4de3dc2fac4a26283796c1652d94ea1de73f6f0c991e8fedb8989a72a025de0f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Congo halts artisanal copper and cobalt processing amid corruption crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/congo-halts-artisanal-copper-cobalt-processing-amid-corruption-crackdown-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has suspended artisanal copper and cobalt mineral processing, according to a decree seen by Reuters, in an effort to improve transparency and prevent illegal exports, a pervasive problem in the mineral-rich nation.

Congo, the world's top cobalt supplier contributing around 70% of global output, has wrestled for decades with illegal, artisanal mining that diverts revenue away from the nation's coffers.

The decree, dated December 19 and signed by mines minister Louis Watum Kabamba, orders all entities that process and market artisanal copper and cobalt to suspend operations and certify the origin of minerals used.

A commission would be set up to carry out compliance and to verify the traceability and legality of supplies, the document said.

Reuters could not determine the likely impact on illegal exports and Congo's government had no figures.

“This suspension will be an opportunity to identify the flow and volume of minerals processed by the processing units," a source at the president's office said.

LICOCO, a Congolese nongovernmental group that aims to fight corruption in the sector said many entities operating illegally paid bribes to obtain their permits to circumvent the requirements laid out in the mining code.

Congo launched its first batch of traceable artisanal cobalt in November to clean up the supply chain and align production with international environmental, social and governance standards.

Artisanal mining is a lifeline for many in Congo, employing an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million people and supporting more than 10 million people indirectly.

But unregulated output is difficult to track, risks being confiscated by the government and pushes up the price of ethically produced, traceable cobalt.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6XYNH4KZLJL57ELMBC57XQ5LNE.jpg?auth=e34016f452dba593f529aaf118b4c1b14c61c1b567057baa44b73b55394029dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian troops withdraw from eastern town of Siversk</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-troops-withdraw-eastern-town-siversk-2025-12-23/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces have pulled out of the embattled eastern town of Siversk, Kyiv's military said on Tuesday, as Russian troops wage a battlefield offensive aimed at threatening key cities critical to Ukraine's defences in the east .

The fall of Siversk comes with Ukraine under U.S. pressure to quickly negotiate peace in the nearly four-year-old war triggered by Russia's invasion, and puts Russian forces closer to the hub of Sloviansk, some 30 km (20 miles) to the west.

Sloviansk is a northern anchor of the so-called "fortress belt" of cities in Ukraine's heavily industrialised Donbas region, which Russia has demanded Kyiv cede before it ends its war.

"The invaders were able to advance due to a significant numerical advantage and constant pressure from small assault groups in difficult weather conditions," Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement.

It said it had withdrawn soldiers to preserve lives and resources, adding that they had, however, inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.

Russia said earlier this month it had captured Siversk, whose pre-war population was around 10,000, a claim Kyiv had denied.

On Tuesday, Ukraine's military said its forces were keeping up pressure on the town and would continue trying to sever logistics for Russian troops inside.

Ukrainian open-source group Deep State showed Russia had made gradual gains around Siversk this month, part of its grinding advances along the sprawling front line.

Fighting is still raging around the former eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk, where Ukrainian forces said this month they had fended off an unusually large Russian mechanised attack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:44:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela passes law against piracy, blockades amid US oil ship seizures</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-passes-law-against-piracy-blockades-amid-us-oil-ship-seizures-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Venezuela's ruling-party controlled National Assembly unanimously approved a law on Tuesday that allows prison sentences of up to 20 years for anyone who promotes or finances what it describes as piracy or blockades.

The law, which includes "other international crimes", comes after recent U.S. actions against Venezuelan oil shipments.

The U.S. Coast Guard seized a sanctioned supertanker carrying Venezuelan crude earlier this month and attempted to intercept two other vessels linked to Venezuela over the weekend, U.S. officials said.

The interceptions mark Washington's toughest blow to state oil company PDVSA since its Treasury Department sanctioned the oil company's former trading partners, two subsidiaries of Russia's Rosneft, in 2020, forcing it to cut production and exports. PDVSA was already under sanctions since 2019.

The draft "Law to Guarantee Freedom of Navigation and Commerce Against Piracy, Blockades, and Other International Illicit Acts" was introduced on Monday by pro-government lawmaker Giuseppe Alessandrello.

National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez said at the end of the session the bill will be sent to the executive for approval and will take effect once published in the Official Gazette.

Washington has increased pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro in recent months, including stepping up a military build-up in the Caribbean and killing dozens of people in strikes on boats it says, without providing evidence, are trafficking drugs off its coasts.

U.S. authorities say the operations are part of efforts to combat sanctions evasion and drug trafficking.

Maduro says the United States is seeking to undermine Venezuela's economy and remove him from power.

Rodriguez also blasted Venezuela's political opposition, whose leader has been in hiding for months but traveled to Oslo earlier December to collect her Nobel Peace Prize.

He accused the opposition of promoting sanctions and said they "stole, plundered, bowed down to U.S. imperialism," adding that "they are happy with the aggressive actions currently taking place in the Caribbean Sea."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:33:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W33SN53HZFOKPGMUOROEBZABWA.jpg?auth=a89a07855e3ad9289669e3ff8bf1b104d16aad4fc5fcf6e92cc05022e701418e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What makes a hit song?

Worse, most listeners can't tell the difference from the real thing. With computers borrowing from real musicians for their inspiration, we weigh the implications. If humans are going to continue to rule artistic creation, then our panel needs to answer one simple question: what makes a hit song?

Sometimes it's a gorgeous melody and a brilliant arrangement; sometimes it's an annoyingly easy-to-remember "brain worm" that will stay in your head long after you wish it had departed.

Either way, what makes a song special?

The two countries held five rounds of nuclear talks prior to a 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, which Washington joined by striking Iranian nuclear sites.

The talks faced major stumbling blocks, notably over uranium enrichment on Iranian soil — a practice Western powers want eliminated to minimize the risk of weaponization, but which Tehran has firmly rejected.

"The United States remains available for formal talks with Iran, but only if Tehran is prepared for direct and meaningful dialogue," Trump's deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus told the Security Council on Tuesday.

"We have been clear, however, about certain expectations for any arrangement. Foremost, there can be no enrichment inside of Iran, and that remains our principle," Ortagus said.

Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the meeting the U.S. was not pursuing fair negotiation by insisting on a zero enrichment policy.

"We appreciate any fair and meaningful negotiation, but insisting on zero enrichment policy, it is contrary to our rights as a member of the NPT, and it means that they are not pursuing the fair negotiation," he said, referring to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

"They want to dictate their predetermined intention on Iran. Iran will not bow down to any pressure and intimidation."

The United Nations reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program in late September, following a process - known as snapback - triggered by European powers. Russia and China disputed the move.

Britain, France and Germany initiated the snapback process at the Security Council over accusations Iran had violated a 2015 deal aimed at stopping it from developing a nuclear bomb.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says its motives are peaceful.

The 2015 nuclear deal is enshrined in a Security Council resolution adopted the same year. The 15-member council has met twice a year since then to discuss implementation of the resolution.

Britain, France, the United States, Denmark, Greece, Slovenia and South Korea requested Tuesday’s briefing. But Russia and China argue that all the provisions in the resolution expired on October 18 and on Tuesday objected to the meeting being held, though it proceeded as planned.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:24:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AZKZMOI3LZAL7PRIWOY5JR3HXA.JPG?auth=6f381da2374514ac7637dfe9d51b01623e67b24070c4cf548e471731ad9fdf8e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo expresses 'much sadness' about Russia refusing Christmas ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-leo-expresses-much-sadness-about-russia-refusing-christmas-ceasefire-2025-12-23/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Pope Leo said on Tuesday that he feels "much sadness" that Russia did not agree to a Christmas ceasefire in its nearly four-year old war with Ukraine.

Bolsonaro is currently serving a 27-year sentence after being convicted of plotting a coup to remain in power following his 2022 re-election loss.

His request was for transfer to a hospital on Wednesday, then surgery on Christmas Day, Thursday.

The approval by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw Bolsonaro's trial , comes after an expert review last week stated that the operation was medically necessary.

The far-right leader has faced repeated health issues since being stabbed in the stomach during the 2018 presidential campaign.

His latest problem is an inguinal hernia, a protrusion in the groin area due to a tear in the abdominal muscles.

The operation is scheduled to be completed at the DF Star, a private clinic in Brazil's capital where Bolsonaro underwent another surgery in April.

The ex-president has been detained since November at federal police headquarters in Brasilia.

In office from 2019 to 2022, he was sentenced by the Supreme Court in September to prison after being found guilty of having led a scheme to prevent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office.

He has maintained his innocence, declaring he was a victim of political persecution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:26:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d80e0e1c-e030-11f0-816a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T152216Z-613812178-RC2V1HAEN3OD-RTRMADP-3-BRAZIL-BOLSONARO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Libyan army chief of staff found dead in plain wreckage, PM says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251223-libyan-army-chief-of-staff-found-dead-in-plain-wreckage-pm-says</link><description>Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah has confirmed the death of Libyan military chief Muhammad Ali Ahmad al-Haddad and four others in a plane crash in Turkey on Tuesday evening.

The justices denied the Justice Department's request to lift a judge's order that has blocked the deployment of hundreds of National Guard personnel in a legal challenge brought by Illinois state officials and local leaders. The department had asked to allow the deployment while the litigation plays out.

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces that answer to state governors except when called into federal service by the president.

Trump ordered troops to Chicago, the third-largest U.S. city, and to Portland, Oregon, following his earlier deployments to Los Angeles, Memphis and Washington, D.C.

The case has been characterized by starkly different portrayals of the protests against Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement in and around Chicago.

Trump and his allies have described Democratic-led cities as lawless, crime-ravaged and plagued with vast, violent protests. His administration has said troops are needed to protect federal property and personnel.

Democratic mayors and governors, along with other Trump critics, have said these claims are a false account of the situation and a pretext for sending troops, accusing Trump of abusing his power.

Federal judges have expressed skepticism over the administration's dire view of protests that local law enforcement officials have called limited in size, largely peaceful and manageable by their own forces - far from the "war zone" conditions described by Trump.

Trump has relied on a law that lets a president deploy state National Guard troops to suppress a rebellion, repel an invasion or if he is "unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States."

Illinois and Chicago sued after the administration federalized 300 Illinois National Guard troops and also ordered Texas National Guard troops into the state, calling the actions unlawful. Officials have since announced the administration was sending home hundreds of National Guard troops who were dispatched to Portland from California, and to Chicago from Texas.

Chicago-based U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the move on October 9, finding that the claims of violence during protests at an immigration facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, Illinois, where a small group of demonstrators had gathered daily for weeks, were unreliable.

Perry, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden, found that there was no evidence of rebellion or that the law was not being enforced, faulting officials for "equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting or doing violence."

A National Guard deployment would "only add fuel to the fire," Perry said.

A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to lift Perry's order blocking the deployment, concluding that "the facts do not justify the president's actions in Illinois." Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Trump.

The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that the assessment by local officials of the protests was "implausibly rosy," and that federal agents "have been forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence."

Lawyers for Illinois and Chicago told the justices that the local protests have "never hindered the continued operation" of the Broadview facility, and that state and local authorities have responded to every request for assistance and contained any sporadic disruption.

Officials from Portland and Oregon are pursuing a separate legal challenge to Trump's planned deployment to that city. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, permanently blocked that deployment in a November 7 ruling. The administration has appealed that ruling.

The Supreme Court in October asked the administration as well as Illinois and Chicago to provide written arguments over how to interpret the words "regular forces" in the law at issue in the case.

In an October 10 written ruling, Perry said that historical sources indicate that "regular forces" means only members regularly enlisted in the military, including the Army and Navy, as opposed to the National Guard.

Trump's administration "made no attempt to rely on the regular forces before resorting to federalization of the National Guard," Perry said, adding that there are other limits on the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

The administration repeatedly has sought the Supreme Court's intervention to allow implementation of Trump policies impeded by lower courts. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has sided with the administration in almost every case that it has been called upon to review since Trump returned to the presidency in January.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:20:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/34IAUOV6CZJQ5AKIEHSAXEWU5A.jpg?auth=c8d46cd0d2aabb164bd5dd85e092e1761aca240d542692fbf6da90d4b7dfc9d9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Libya says its army chief dies in plane crash in Turkey</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/signal-lost-with-jet-believed-be-carrying-libyan-army-chief-over-ankara-media-2025-12-23/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The Libyan army's chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, died in a plane crash on Tuesday after leaving Turkey's capital Ankara, the prime minister of Libya's internationally recognised government said, adding that four others were on the jet as well.

"This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people," Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement.

He said the commander of Libya's ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff's office were also on the aircraft.

Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara's Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT. He said authorities found the plane's wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara's Haymana district.

He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established.

The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.

Turkey's defence ministry had announced Haddad's visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.

The crash occurred a day after Turkey's parliament passed a decision to extend the mandate of Turkish soldiers' deployment in Libya by two more years.

NATO member Turkey has militarily and politically supported Libya's Tripoli-based, internationally recognised government. In 2020, it sent military personnel there to train and support its government and later reached a maritime demarcation accord, which has been disputed by Egypt and Greece.

In 2022, Ankara and Tripoli also signed a preliminary accord on energy exploration, which Egypt and Greece also oppose.

However, Turkey has recently switched course under its "One Libya" policy, ramping up contacts with Libya's eastern faction as well.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:20:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KUALE6CVFJL5PNKLWOSVYFNIFQ.jpg?auth=5b939b23ec88c7154b1ed38959af4d1c5910f1740e8d96bd664b4850a8537164&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo 'disappointed' in Illinois governor over assisted dying law</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-disappointed-illinois-governor-over-assisted-dying-law-2025-12-23/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Pope Leo on Tuesday criticized the governor of the U.S. state of Illinois for signing a bill to allow some adults with a terminal illness to end their own lives with medical help, in an unusual political intervention by the church leader.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, told journalists outside his residence in Castel Gandolfo, Italy, that he was "very disappointed" in Governor JB Pritzker for signing the measure.

"Unfortunately ... he decided to sign that bill," said the pope, responding to a question about the measure. "I'm very disappointed about that."

Leo, originally from Chicago, met at the Vatican with Pritzker last month and said he "very explicitly" spoke with the governor about the bill.

The pope, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, usually refrains from commenting on local political issues.

The Illinois bill, which takes effect next September, gives terminally ill adults with a prognosis of six months or less the option to request a medical prescription to end their lives.

The Catholic Church teaches that life is sacred from conception until natural death. It opposes abortion, capital punishment and assisted dying measures.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:20:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UXG66ZKBBRIPHC6UE7VL4VYWYI.jpg?auth=8a59c552ab07b89882d18afe2b6b4948da3ceb332444fb4581743b348e1f89f1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Florida Catholic bishops urge Trump to halt immigration enforcement until after holidays</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/florida-catholic-bishops-urge-trump-halt-immigration-enforcement-until-after-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Florida's Catholic bishops are calling on U.S. President Donald Trump to halt immigration enforcement activities until after the Christmas holidays.

"Such a pause would show a decent regard for the humanity of these families. Now is not the time to be callous toward the suffering caused by immigration enforcement," the bishops wrote on Monday to Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said on Tuesday, "President Trump was elected based on his promise to the American people to deport criminal illegal aliens. And he’s keeping that promise."

A spokesperson for DeSantis did not immediately comment.

Trump has carried out an aggressive immigration campaign over the last year, apprehending and deporting migrants who he says are dangerous criminals.

His administration has also rescinded policy that limited immigration arrests near sensitive locations, including churches, hospitals and schools, and deployed federal agents across the U.S. to ramp up such arrests.

While the administration insists it is targeting criminals, government data shows that it has been arresting more people who have not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.

Despite signs the public is questioning the crackdown, the administration is planning to expand it in the new year.

The appeal by the Florida bishops comes more than a month after the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a rare condemnation of the Trump administration immigration crackdown and advocated for "meaningful immigration reform." And in October Pope Leo decried mistreatment of immigrants.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:20:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U4XDV6RH5BK2DCJ2SZ7AZA7WGI.jpg?auth=cb51c3f70ee1fa81f26d5e7600ed59ec71514a63d9799203e5edc915f7e33d75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US tells UN it will deprive Venezuela's Maduro, drug cartel of resources</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-tells-un-it-will-deprive-venezuelas-maduro-drug-cartel-of-resources-2025-12-23/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The United States told the United Nations on Tuesday it will impose and enforce sanctions "to the maximum extent" to deprive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of resources as Russia warned other Latin American countries could be next.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has for months waged a campaign of against suspected drug trafficking boats off the Venezuelan coast and the Pacific coast of Latin America. He has threatened strikes on Venezuelan land.

"The single most serious threat to this hemisphere, our very own neighborhood and the United States, is from transnational terrorist and criminal groups," U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz told the U.N. Security Council.

The U.S. has ramped up its military presence in the region and Trump announced a blockade of all vessels subject to U.S. sanctions. So far this month, the U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted two tankers in the Caribbean Sea, both fully loaded with Venezuelan crude. The Coast Guard is also pursuing a third empty vessel that was approaching the OPEC country's shore.

"The reality of the situation is that sanctioned oil tankers operate as the primary economic lifeline for Maduro and his illegitimate regime. The sanctioned tankers also fund the narco-terrorist group Cartel de Los Soles," Waltz said.

Washington designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, as a foreign terrorist organization late last month for the group's alleged role in importing illegal drugs into the U.S. It accuses Maduro of leading Cartel de los Soles. Venezuela's government rejected what it called a "ridiculous" move to designate the "non-existent" group.

"This intervention which is unfolding can become a template for future acts of force against Latin American states," Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council, citing a recent strategy document from Trump that said the U.S. will reassert its dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Waltz spoke after Nebenzia and did not directly respond to his remark.

China urged the United States to “immediately halt relevant actions and avoid further escalation of tensions,” China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Sun Lei told the council.

Venezuela, backed by Russia and China, requested Tuesday's meeting, the second held on the escalating tensions. The Security Council first met in October, when the United States justified its actions as consistent with Article 51 of the founding U.N. Charter, which requires the Security Council to be immediately informed of any action states take in self-defense against armed attack.

"Let it be clear once and for all that there is no war in the Caribbean, there is no international armed conflict, nor is there a non-international one, which is why it is absurd for the U.S. government to seek to justify its actions by applying the rules of war," Venezuela's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada told the council.

"The threat is not Venezuela The threat is the U.S. government," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:20:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AERLROFCTRMB3CJETBGZSCMW5U.jpg?auth=296e73d757da7e942b0018ee2d271d62b87a6ca2687fa7070dd7429615aec129&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion rips through Pennsylvania nursing home</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/explosion-rips-through-pennsylvania-nursing-home-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - An apparent gas explosion caused major damage to a nursing home outside Philadelphia on Tuesday, sending emergency crews to conduct search-and-rescue operations, according to officials and local media reports.

No official information on possible casualties was immediately available.

The Bucks County emergency dispatch center received a report of an explosion with injuries at the Silver Lake Nursing home in Bristol Township, about 21 miles northeast of Philadelphia, shortly after 2 p.m. EST, a county spokesperson said.

"A portion of the building is reported to have collapsed," the spokesperson, Jim O'Malley, said in an email message, adding that emergency personnel from numerous agencies were dispatched.

Video footage posted by a nearby police department showed numerous emergency and law enforcement vehicles converging in the area with lights flashing.

Channel2 Now reported that first-response personnel arriving on the scene found significant structural damage to the facility, prompting immediate search-and-rescue operations for residents and staff.

The news outlet cited authorities as saying that about 15 nursing home patients were initially accounted for outside the building, while "multiple others remained unaccounted for."

It said rescue teams reported "numerous individuals trapped beneath debris on the second floor, as well as additional victims trapped in the basement area."

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted a message on his social media account saying he had been briefed on the incident and that "the scene is still active."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:20:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France probes cyberattack on postal service claimed by pro-Russian hackers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251223-france-probes-cyberattack-on-postal-service-claimed-by-pro-russian-hackers</link><description>France 's DGSI counter-espionage agency on Tuesday took over a probe into a cyberattack on the national postal service after a pro-Russian group of hackers claimed responsibility, prosecutors said.

The attack, which began on Monday, disrupted several of La Poste's online services – including consumer banking and tracking registered mail – during the busy Christmas week.

La Poste said it was still delivering parcels and letters, but that, while things had improved slightly on Tuesday, "the situation remains unstable".

The cyberattack was claimed by Noname057(16), a pro-Russian group of hackers that has previously targeted Ukrainian media websites and government and corporate websites in countries including Poland, Sweden and Germany.

The Paris prosecutors' office told AFP that La Poste had made a criminal complaint, and the DGSI – the General Directorate for Internal Security – was called in to lead the investigation after the hacker group's claim.

The probe, "at this stage", is looking into the crime of a data service's functioning being deliberately disrupted, the office said.

Early Tuesday, when questioned about the cyberattack, French Economy Minister Roland Lescure told the BFMTV/RMC news outlet that "the priority of all priorities" was to make sure that parcels were delivered in time for Christmas .

Noname 57(16) emerged in 2022, the year that Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine.

Experts say that its activities appear to be designed to support pro-Russian information warfare. They say the group appears to be a loose organisation of hacktivists.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:20:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/db208bb8-df4d-11f0-8e1e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25356472268811.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudan's prime minister takes his peace plan to the UN</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/eye-on-africa/20251223-sudan-s-prime-minister-takes-his-peace-plan-to-the-un</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b1bc3a82-e043-11f0-9024-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL251223-2144-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge tosses Trump challenge to New York immigration-related law</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-tosses-trump-challenge-new-york-immigration-related-law-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit the U.S. Department of Justice filed challenging a New York law that President Donald Trump's administration said was impeding immigration enforcement.

U.S. District Judge Anne Nardacci in Albany rejected , opens new tab the Justice Department's arguments a New York law that bars the Democratic-led state from sharing vehicle and address information with federal immigration authorities violated the U.S. Constitution.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the lawsuit at a press conference in February as part of a legal campaign the Republican president's administration has waged over laws adopted by so-called "sanctuary jurisdictions" run by Democrats.

The lawsuit took aim at a state law known as the Driver’s License Access and Privacy Act, or the "Green Light Law," which the state enacted in 2019.

That law directed the state's Department of Motor Vehicles to accept various foreign documents as proof of identification and age for standard licenses and barred the state agency from inquiring about the immigration status of applicants.

The Justice Department under Trump alleged the law was impeding its ability to address a "crisis of illegal immigration" and argued the law interfered with the enforcement of federal immigration laws in New York.

It argued the federal immigration law preempted the state law and that New York's law impermissibly regulates the federal government in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The Justice Department asked the judge to block its enforcement.

But Nardacci, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, said the administration had failed to plausibly allege the law ran afoul of the Constitution.

She said the administration could point to no federal statute requiring New York to provide DMV information for standard license applicants to federal immigration authorities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:44:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RRUJCGGUFVLYVN5G5VVFZBOWLY.jpg?auth=74920569f7f2a8c82ae492a51b7d9e5b9c6488fc830da8b04b8c71b8524be1d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Loaded supertanker returns to Venezuelan waters amid US interceptions, TankerTrackers.com says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/loaded-supertanker-returns-venezuelan-waters-amid-us-interceptions-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Panama-flagged very large crude carrier Kelly, which had departed from Venezuela carrying oil last week, has returned to Venezuelan waters following the U.S. interception of more tankers, monitoring service TankerTrackers.com said on Tuesday.

The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday intercepted the Panama-flagged tanker Centuries, which was carrying some 1.9 million barrels of Venezuelan Merey heavy crude, and is pursuing a separate empty vessel that was on its way to the OPEC country.

Centuries and Kelly departed almost together escorted by Venezuelan navy ships last week, sources said. Kelly is now back fully loaded in Venezuelan waters near state-run oil company PDVSA's Amuay port, TankerTrackers.com said.

More than a dozen loaded vessels are in Venezuela waiting for new directions from their owners after the U.S. seized the supertanker Skipper earlier this month and targeted two additional vessels on the weekend.

U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced a "blockade" of all vessels under sanctions entering or departing from Venezuela in a move to ramp up pressure over Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Guyana's maritime authority said this month that at least one of the ships was flying a false Guyanese flag . Panama's foreign affairs minister said this week that some U.S.-targeted tankers did not follow the country's maritime rules.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:44:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope calls for Christmas Day truce, laments Russia’s rejection</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251223-pope-calls-for-christmas-day-truce-laments-russia-rejection</link><description>Pope Leo XIV on Tuesday called for a global truce on Christmas Day, expressing “great sadness” that “apparently Russia rejected a request” for one.

“I am renewing my request to all people of good will to respect a day of peace — at least on the feast of the birth of our Saviour,” Leo told reporters at his residence in Castel Gandolfo near Rome .

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has repeatedly rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying it would only give a military advantage to Ukraine.

“Among the things that cause me great sadness is the fact that Russia has apparently rejected a request for a truce ,” the pope said.

Referring to conflicts in general, Leo added: “I hope they will listen and there will be 24 hours of peace in the whole world.”

Ukraine on Tuesday pulled troops out of a town in the east of the country after fierce battles with Russian forces, as relentless strikes by Moscow killed three civilians and cut power to thousands in freezing winter temperatures.

There was no sign of an imminent breakthrough after top negotiators from both Russia and Ukraine were in Miami last weekend for separate meetings with US officials seeking a deal to end almost four years of fighting.

Pope Leo met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this month.

Asked whether he would accept Zelensky’s invitation to visit Ukraine, Leo later said, “I hope so,” but cautioned that it was not possible to say when such a trip might take place.

He also said that seeking peace in Ukraine without European diplomatic involvement was “unrealistic” and warned that US President Donald Trump ’s proposed peace plan risked a “huge change” in the transatlantic alliance.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:45:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dec68016-d4e8-11f0-842b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-09T101535Z-778331222-RC2VCIAROZZS-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-POPE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian state passes tougher gun, anti-terror laws after Bondi Beach shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-state-passes-tougher-gun-anti-terror-laws-after-bondi-beach-shooting-2025-12-23/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state on Wednesday passed sweeping new gun and anti-terror laws following the recent mass shooting on Bondi Beach, tightening firearm ownership, banning public display of terrorist symbols and strengthening police power to curb protests.

The New South Wales state parliament passed the terrorism and other legislation amendment bill early morning after the upper house approved the bill by 18 votes to eight.

The bill passed the lower house on Tuesday with support from the governing centre-left Labor and the opposition Liberal party. The rural-focused National Party, the Liberal's junior coalition partner, opposed the gun reforms arguing the ownership caps would unfairly disadvantage farmers.

The legislation follows the December 14 shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach, where 15 people were killed and dozens wounded. The gun attack, Australia's deadliest in almost three decades, prompted calls for stricter gun laws and tougher action against antisemitism.

Under the new laws, most individual gun licences will be capped at four firearms, while farmers will be permitted to own up to 10 guns.

Police will be granted more powers to impose restrictions on public protests for up to three months following a declared terror attack, while public display of symbols of prohibited terror organisations will be banned.

"Globalise the intifada", a chant usually heard during pro-Palestine protests, will also be banned after the government argued it encourages violence in the community.

Police believe the two alleged gunmen were inspired by the militant Sunni Muslim group Islamic State. Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police, while his 24-year-old son Naveed has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism.

Activist groups have condemned the law and signalled plans for a constitutional challenge.

In a statement, the Palestine Action Group, Jews Against the Occupation and the First Nations-led Blak Caucus said it would file a legal challenge against what they described as "draconian anti-protest laws" rushed through the state parliament.

"It is clear that the (state) government is exploiting the horrific Bondi attack to advance a political agenda that suppresses political dissent and criticism of Israel, and curtails democratic freedoms," the groups said.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also vowed a crackdown on hate speech, with his centre-left federal government planning to introduce legislation to make it easier to prosecute those promoting hatred and violence, and to cancel or deny visas to people involved in hate speech.

Facing criticism that his government has not done enough to curb antisemitism, Albanese said he spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Tuesday and invited him to make an official visit to Australia as soon as possible.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 23:20:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7NKYJ53VY5MOFGVQYHK3BFT24I.jpg?auth=d30b9be2abfb9df0bc2a9961cd89a6bf127281ce76a2a67fc88c4dc7bca3f498&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US targets former EU commissioner, activists with visa bans over alleged censorship</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-targets-former-eu-commissioner-activists-with-visa-bans-over-alleged-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 - The Trump administration on Tuesday imposed visa bans on a former European Union commissioner and anti-disinformation campaigners it says were involved in censoring U.S. social media platforms, in the latest move in a campaign aimed at European rules that U.S. officials say go beyond legitimate regulation.

Trump officials have ordered U.S. diplomats to build opposition to the European Union's landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), which is intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation, but which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on U.S. tech companies.

The visa bans come after the administration's National Security Strategy this month said European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk "civilisational erasure" for the continent.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the five people targeted with visa bans "have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose."

"These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states -- in each case targeting American speakers and American companies," Rubio said in an announcement.

Rubio did not name those targeted, but Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of "fomenting censorship of American speech."

The most high-profile target was French former business executive Thierry Breton, who served as the European commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024. Rogers called Breton "a mastermind" of the DSA and said he once threatened Trump ally and X owner Elon Musk ahead of an interview Musk conducted with Trump. Reuters was unable to immediately reach Breton for comment.

Reuters reported in August that U.S. officials were considering sanctions on officials responsible for the DSA.

The visa bans also hit Imran Ahmed, the British CEO of the U.S.-based Center for Countering Digital Hate; and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of the German nonprofit HateAid; and Clare Melford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index, Rogers said. The organizations did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Melford, a former management consultant and TV executive, said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the Global Disinformation Index “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to "choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarizing and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”

Rogers said Melford falsely labeled online comments as hate speech or disinformation and used U.S. taxpayers' money to "exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 23:21:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3TYKGHJ5N5PSVEN2OXHN4IPSHU.jpg?auth=ff0ce3dbb8ae1650712d4249b0228b36bed8967d76c347d85d5daa541a692fff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine withdraws troops from eastern town amid deadly Russian strikes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251223-ukraine-withdraws-troops-deadly-russian-strikes</link><description>Ukraine pulled out troops from a town in the east after fierce battles, it said on Tuesday, as relentless Russian strikes killed three civilians and cut power to thousands in freezing winter temperatures.

Kyiv said it had withdrawn forces from Siversk, a town in the heavily embattled Donetsk region on the route to two of Ukraine’s last remaining strongholds in the area. Russia announced the capture of Siversk almost two weeks ago.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the pre-Christmas strikes showed that the Kremlin had no intention of ending the invasion it launched in February 2022.

The attacks came two days after US-mediated settlement talks in Miami, which lasted several days as the warring sides worked through details of a Washington-proposed plan to end the war. There has been no sign of an imminent diplomatic breakthrough.

The Ukrainian army said that “to preserve the lives of our soldiers and the combat capability of our units, Ukrainian defenders have withdrawn from the settlement” of Siversk, adding that fighting was continuing on the outskirts.

Moscow on Monday reported “slow progress” in talks over the US plan to end the war, as Kyiv and its European allies seek to adjust an initial proposal that adhered to many of Russia’s hardline demands .

A Russian strike could collapse the internal radiation shelter at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine, the plant’s director has told AFP.

In an interview, director Sergiy Tarakanov said fully restoring the shelter could take three to four years and warned that another Russian strike could cause the inner shell to collapse.

“If a missile or drone hits it directly, or even falls somewhere nearby, for example an Iskander, God forbid, it will cause a mini-earthquake in the area,” Tarakanov said.

The Iskander is Russia’s short-range ballistic missile system, capable of carrying a variety of conventional warheads, including bunker-busting munitions.

“No one can guarantee that the shelter facility will remain standing after that. That is the main threat,” he added.

On the battlefield in the east, Russia’s army claimed to have captured settlements in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, in a grinding advance that has accelerated in recent weeks.

Zelensky said a four-year-old child was killed in the central Zhytomyr region after a Russian drone struck a residential building.

Workers were scrambling to repair damaged energy infrastructure, he said, forcing emergency power cuts across several regions during frigid winter weather.

“An attack ahead of Christmas , when people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe. An attack carried out essentially in the midst of negotiations aimed at ending this war,” Zelensky said.

There were also deaths in the Kyiv and Khmelnytskyi regions.

In Russia , one person was killed and three wounded, including a teenage boy, after Ukrainian drone attacks on the border region of Belgorod, its governor said.

Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said energy facilities in the west of the country were the most affected by the strikes.

Russia’s army said it had launched a massive strike using long-range drones and hypersonic missiles at military and energy sites.

The southern Black Sea region of Odesa was again targeted as Russia stepped up attacks on the key port city.

Olena Dolhachova, a 40-year-old maths teacher in Odesa, told AFP she had to rely on candles to continue her work.

“There are attacks every week. Just when power is restored, all our schedules are disrupted again. We are left without electricity , without stability, sitting in the dark for two or three days,” she said.

“It is very difficult.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 23:22:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7a12e9b4-d5da-11f0-a648-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/101225-donetsk-war-m.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's air defence units destroy drone flying towards Moscow, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-air-defence-units-destroy-drone-flying-towards-moscow-mayor-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Russia's air defence units destroyed a drone flying towards Moscow, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:42:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosions heard in southern Moscow at site of general's killing, Russia's Telegram channels say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/explosions-heard-southern-moscow-site-generals-killing-russias-telegram-channels-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Several explosions were heard in southern Moscow on Wednesday at the site where Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday, Baza and SHOT Telegram channels reported.

According to witnesses, a car detonated, Baza and SHOT, which have sources in Russia's law enforcement agencies, reported.

At least two people were seriously injured in the explosions which took place near a police station, SHOT, Baza and other unofficial Russian Telegram news channels reported.

Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. There was no official confirmation from Russian authorities about the incident.

Sarvarov was killed on Monday when a bomb exploded under his Kia Sorento as he left a parking space in southern Moscow, Russian investigators said, adding they were looking at possible involvement by Ukrainian special services.

A string of Russian military figures and prominent backers of the war in Ukraine have been killed since the conflict began, some in car bombings, and Ukrainian military intelligence has said it was behind a number of attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US bars five Europeans over alleged pressure on tech firms to censor speech</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20251224-us-bars-five-europeans-over-alleged-pressure-on-tech-firms-to-censor-speech</link><description>The State Department announced Tuesday it was barring five Europeans it accused of leading efforts to pressure US tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.

The Europeans, described by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations, fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May that restricts the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for the censorship of protected speech in the United States.

“For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,” Rubio posted on X. “The Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.”

The five Europeans were identified by Sarah Rogers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, in a series of social media posts. They include leaders of organizations that address digital hate and a former European Union commissioner who clashed with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with US President Donald Trump .

Rubio’s statement said they advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and US companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States .

The action to bar them from the US is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions.

The five Europeans named by Rogers are Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index; and former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who was responsible for digital affairs.

In her post on X, Rogers called Breton, a French business executive and former finance minister, the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act , which imposes strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including the flagging of harmful or illegal content such as hate speech.

She referred to Breton warning Musk of a possible “amplification of harmful content” by broadcasting his livestream interview with Trump in August 2024, when Trump was running for president.

Breton responded Tuesday on X by noting that all 27 EU member states voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said France condemns the visa restrictions on Breton and the four others. Posting on X, he said the Digital Services Act was adopted to ensure that “what is illegal offline is also illegal online,” adding that it “has absolutely no extraterritorial reach and in no way concerns the United States.”

Most Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, meaning they do not necessarily need visas to enter the country. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security. As a result, it is possible that at least some of the five individuals have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.

Other visa restriction policies were announced this year, alongside bans targeting foreign visitors from certain African and Middle Eastern countries and the Palestinian Authority . Visitors from some countries could also be required to post a financial bond when applying for a visa.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:45:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/951bbd7e-7408-11ef-b79c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_36GE46E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supreme Court blocks Trump’s National Guard deployment in Chicago</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251223-supreme-court-blocks-trump-national-guard-deployment-chicago</link><description>The US Supreme Court dealt a blow to President Donald Trump ’s immigration crackdown on Tuesday by blocking his deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago.

The conservative-dominated court kept in place, for now, a lower court order barring the deployment of troops on the streets of the city in the midwestern state of Illinois.

“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the court said in an unsigned order.

Three conservative justices — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — dissented.

The Republican president has sent National Guard troops to three Democratic-led cities this year — Los Angeles, Washington and Memphis — but his efforts to deploy soldiers in Portland and Chicago have been tied up in the courts.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, reacting to the ruling, said the president “activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property.”

“Nothing in today’s ruling detracts from that core agenda,” Jackson said.

JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, who strongly opposed the deployment along with the Democratic mayor of Chicago, welcomed the ruling, calling it a “big win for Illinois and American democracy.”

“This is an important step in curbing the Trump administration’s consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump’s march toward authoritarianism,” Pritzker said.

After two lower courts blocked Trump from sending troops into Chicago, his administration made an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court .

In his filing with the top court, Solicitor General John Sauer claimed federal agents in Chicago were being “forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence.”

The court order blocking deployment of the National Guard “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property,” Sauer added.

The Supreme Court rebuff of the emergency appeal was a rare defeat for Trump at the top court, where conservatives hold a 6–3 majority.

It was not immediately clear how Tuesday’s decision would affect other cases in which Democratic-led states have challenged Trump’s National Guard deployments.

California and Oregon have both filed legal challenges against the Trump administration’s extraordinary domestic use of the National Guard.

Trump sent troops to Los Angeles earlier this year to quell demonstrations sparked by a federal crackdown on undocumented migrants .

A district court judge ruled the deployment unlawful, but an appeals court panel allowed the Los Angeles operation to proceed.

Some 300 National Guard troops remain activated in the Chicago area but are not engaged in operations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:45:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d8717a32-d16d-11f0-a365-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25328704047319.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: U.S. eyes additional Coast Guard assets to seize fleeing tanker, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-eyes-additional-coast-guard-assets-seize-fleeing-tanker-sources-say-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON/LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Coast Guard is waiting for additional forces to arrive before potentially attempting to board and seize a Venezuela-linked oil tanker it has been pursuing since Sunday, a U.S. official and a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The ship, which maritime groups have identified as the Bella 1, has refused to be boarded by the Coast Guard. That means that the task will likely fall to one of just two teams of specialists - known as Maritime Security Response Teams - who can board vessels under these circumstances, including by rappelling from helicopters.

The days-long pursuit highlights the mismatch between the Trump administration's desire to seize sanctioned oil tankers near Venezuela and the limited resources of the agency that is mainly carrying out operations, the Coast Guard.

Unlike the U.S. Navy, the Coast Guard can carry out law enforcement actions, including boarding and seizing vessels that are under U.S. sanctions.

Trump earlier this month ordered a "blockade" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, in Washington's latest move to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The Coast Guard has in recent weeks seized two oil tankers near Venezuela. After the first seizure , on Dec. 10, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a 45-second video showing two helicopters approaching a vessel and armed individuals in camouflage rappelling onto it.

A Saturday social media post by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Coast Guard, showed what appeared to be Coast Guard officers aboard the Gerald Ford aircraft carrier getting ready to depart and seize the Centuries tanker, the second of the ships boarded by the U.S.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Coast Guard officials on the Ford were from a Maritime Security Response Team and at the time too far from Bella 1 to carry out a boarding operation.

"There are limited teams who are trained for these types of boardings," said Corey Ranslem, chief executive of maritime security group Dryad Global and previously with the U.S. Coast Guard.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Reuters could not determine what, if any other reasons, have led to the Coast Guard not seizing the vessel yet.

The administration could ultimately choose to not board and seize the vessel.

The White House said that the United States was still in "active pursuit of a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela’s illegal sanctions evasion."

The U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the armed forces but a part of the Department of Homeland Security.

The United States has assembled a massive military force in the Caribbean, including an aircraft carrier, fighter jets and other warships. Ospreys and additional MC-130J Commando II aircraft arrived in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico in recent days, according to a separate source.

The Coast Guard has far fewer resources in place.

The service has long said that it lacks the resources to effectively carry out a growing list of missions, including search and rescue operations and drug seizures.

In November, the Coast Guard announced that it had seized about 49,000 pounds of drugs worth more than $362 million in the eastern Pacific.

"The Coast Guard is in a severe readiness crisis that is decades in the making," Admiral Kevin Lunday, who leads the Coast Guard, told lawmakers in June.

For the fiscal year ending September 2026, the Coast Guard requested $14.6 billion in funding. It will receive an additional $25 billion through a sweeping spending and tax legislation, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."

"Our Coast Guard is less ready than in any other time in the past 80 years since the end of World War Two. The downward readiness spiral we are on is not sustainable," Lunday said earlier this year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 03:24:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P2RGNPIEUJN2NJVAEANDIH634I.jpg?auth=4fbfd8dc902772819840f75c51e3a6b0eeb432abb2d197da58a978f56f9db0fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US holds call with Palau on transfer of third-country nationals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-holds-call-with-palau-transfer-third-country-nationals-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. on Tuesday said Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau spoke to Palau President Surangel Whipps about transferring third-country nationals to the Pacific Island nation, even after its lawmakers rejected a previous request from Washington on the matter.

President Donald Trump's immigration policies , including his administration's deportation drive, have been broadly condemned by human rights advocates on concerns about due process. The Trump administration has also sent hundreds of people to third countries to which they have no ties, a tactic that was rarely used in the past.

Trump has said the measures are aimed at improving domestic security.

"The leaders discussed a new U.S.-Palau Memorandum of Understanding regarding the transfer of third-country nationals with no known criminal histories," the State Department said in a statement after Tuesday's call.

In late July, Palau's Congress said it "cannot accept" a U.S. proposal for it to accept asylum seekers from other countries.

Palau, with a population of 17,000, has a compact of free association with the U.S., which provides economic assistance in return for allowing American military access to its territory.

Palau is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.

U.S. Catholic bishops have condemned Washington's immigration enforcement activities and in October, Pope Leo XIV lamented the mistreatment of immigrants.

Last week, a federal judge signaled a willingness to again rule that the Trump administration cannot swiftly deport migrants to countries other than their own without providing meaningful notice and an opportunity for them to raise fears of persecution or torture if they are sent there.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 03:26:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S5UMFJJICNONHEB7B42HMMW5XM.jpg?auth=c6e3d87a45403522d0ef038ce71001a0ed5757da7e3aff2c37dd934a5d17a8a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia cancels British man's visa after charges of displaying Nazi symbol</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/australia-cancels-british-mans-visa-after-charges-displaying-nazi-symbol-2025-12-24/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Australia cancelled the visa of a British national after he was charged with displaying a banned Nazi symbol, the immigration minister said on Wednesday, as the country cracks down on antisemitism in the wake of a mass shooting at Bondi Beach.

The government revoked the visa of a 43-year-old man who was charged on December 8 with displaying a Nazi symbol and advocating for violence against the Jewish community on social media platform X, according to Australian Federal Police.

"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest," Home Affairs Minister Bourke told the Australian Broadcasting Corp, referring to the British citizen.

"If someone comes here for the purposes of hate, they can leave," he said.

Burke and the federal police did not name the British man but the federal police said he displayed the Nazi Hakenkreuz - a type of swastika - and espoused "pro-Nazi ideology with a specific hatred of the Jewish community" from two X accounts from October to November.

After having his visa revoked, the man who was living in the state of Queensland was taken into immigration detention and would be deported unless he voluntarily left first, media reports said.

On December 14, a father and son allegedly opened fire on a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach, killing 15 people and sparking calls for the Australian government to do more to stop antisemitism.

Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead in the attack but his son Naveed Akram is charged with murder and terrorism, with police saying he was recorded saying he was motivated by Islamic text the Koran.

As part of the government's response to the Bondi Beach shooting and calls for heightened action against antisemitism , Burke said he plans to lower the legal thresholds for a person's antisemitic actions to be illegal. He has previously said that antisemitic groups intentionally curb their language to avoid criminal charges while violating Australian community standards.

He also said that for a visa cancellation the authorities needed to prove a person's actions had a harmful impact on the community, but "incitement of hate should be enough".

"We should be able to cancel visas on that basis alone," Bourke told the ABC. "There will...be legislation to increase my powers to make cancellations of exactly this nature."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 03:26:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PTAOA7RIOBOSRD6SRCB46W2AEQ.jpg?auth=81dc23c9ce0fb09516b57fcc9e17a3ae9698f14f4f4ebd5c01e795d850428b5c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US accused of “greatest extortion known in our history” over Venezuela at UN</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251224-us-accused-of-greatest-extortion-known-in-our-history-over-venezuela-at-un</link><description>Russia and China on Tuesday criticized the United States for its military and economic pressure on Venezuela, telling the UN Security Council it amounted to “cowboy behavior” and “intimidation.”

Venezuela , which requested the emergency council meeting with the backing of Moscow and Beijing, accused Washington of “the greatest extortion known in our history.”

The United States has deployed a major military force in the Caribbean and has recently intercepted oil tankers as part of a naval blockade against Venezuelan vessels it considers to be under sanctions.

At Tuesday’s meeting, US Ambassador Mike Waltz responded to the criticism by saying, “The United States will do everything in its power to protect our hemisphere, our borders, and the American people.”

US President Donald Trump accuses Venezuela of using oil , the South American country’s main resource, to finance “narcoterrorism, human trafficking, murders, and kidnappings.”

Caracas denies any involvement in drug trafficking and maintains that Washington is seeking to overthrow its president, Nicolas Maduro , in order to seize Venezuelan oil reserves, the largest in the world.

“The acts by the US side run counter to all key norms of international law,” said Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations , calling the US blockade an “act of aggression.”

“The responsibility of Washington is also evident for the constant catastrophic consequences of such cowboy-like conduct,” he told the council.

“China opposes all acts of unilateralism and bullying and supports all countries in defending their sovereignty and national dignity,” said the Chinese representative, Sun Lei.

Venezuelan ambassador Samuel Moncada told the council: “We are in the presence of a power that acts outside of international law, demanding that Venezuelans vacate our country and hand it over.”

“This is the greatest extortion known in our history,” he added.

Waltz reiterated Trump’s accusations against the Venezuelan leader, saying, “Nicolas Maduro is a fugitive wanted by American justice and the head of the foreign terrorist organization the ‘Cartel de los Soles.’”

Experts say there is no evidence of the existence of an organized group with a defined hierarchy that goes by that name.

The US government has offered a $50 million reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro, a staunch ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Since September, US forces have launched dozens of air strikes on boats that Washington alleges, without showing evidence, were transporting drugs. More than 100 people have been killed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 04:12:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d2f2a06a-e07a-11f0-8c32-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T215017Z-750816989-RC2LMIAYP1KS-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-VENEZUELA-UN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China probe finds Taiwanese smugglers controlled vessel that damaged subsea cables</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-probe-finds-taiwanese-smugglers-controlled-vessel-that-damaged-subsea-2025-12-24/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities on Wednesday said two Taiwanese citizens led a smuggling operation involving a Chinese-crewed vessel that damaged subsea cables earlier this year.

In June, a Taiwanese court sentenced the Chinese captain of a Togo-registered ship, the Hong Tai 58, to three years in jail after finding him guilty of intentionally damaging undersea cables off Taiwan in February, in a case that alarmed officials in Taipei.

On Wednesday, the public security bureau in Weihai, in China's eastern Shandong province, said its investigations into the incident showed that two Taiwanese men were behind a multi-vessel operation that was illegally transporting frozen goods into China. The authorities' findings came after interviewing seven Chinese crew members on the Hong Tai 58.

China previously accused Taiwan of " manipulating " possible Chinese involvement in the case, saying it was making claims before the facts were clear.

The Weihai public security bureau issued a bounty of up to 250,000 yuan ($35,569) for information or assistance regarding the Taiwanese suspects with the surnames Chien and Chen, adding that they have been on a Chinese customs office wanted list since 2014.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office accused Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party of provoking confrontation, saying Taipei had "ignored the facts of the case" and "maliciously hyped up" the situation.

Taipei is "sheltering and condoning smuggling crimes, using the opportunity to carry out political manipulation and undermine cross-strait relations," a spokesperson for the office, Peng Qingen, said at a weekly news briefing.

Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Beijing views Taiwan as its own territory. Taipei rejects that, saying only the island's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 04:57:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine drone attacks target Moscow at night, spark industrial fire in Tula, Russia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-drone-attacks-target-moscow-night-spark-industrial-fire-tula-russia-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainian overnight drone attacks targeted Moscow and sparked an industrial fire in the Tula region, which lies directly south of the Russian capital, regional authorities said on Wednesday.

At least three drones targeting Moscow were downed, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app.

He said emergency services were dispatched to the sites where the drone debris fell, but he did not immediately report any damage.

Two of the four major airports servicing the capital limited operations, Russia's civil aviation authority said on Telegram.

The Russian defence ministry said its air defence units destroyed 172 Ukrainian drones overnight, nearly half of them over regions bordering Ukraine.

Debris from a downed Ukrainian drone sparked a fire at an industrial site in Russia's Tula region, Tula Governor Dmitry Milyaev said on Telegram.

Milyaev did not give details about the industrial facility.

He said that Russian air defence units destroyed 12 Ukrainian drones over the region.

Ukraine has stepped up drone strikes deep inside Russia, saying it is targeting military, energy and logistics sites to disrupt Moscow’s war effort, in response to Russia’s continued strikes on Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:25:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's recall of ambassadors compounds staffing problems at posts in Africa</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/trumps-recall-ambassadors-compounds-staffing-problems-posts-africa-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's mass recall of ambassadors will leave Washington without top-level presence in more than half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, complicating America's efforts to push its agenda in a region that has faced military coups and devastating conflicts in recent years.

Since taking office, the administration has worked to implement its business-focused diplomacy in Africa, shifting the U.S. priority from aid to trade. Trump has sought to broker peace accords and rare-earth deals and has struck bilateral agreements instead of providing direct foreign assistance.

Trump has touted the U.S. as a better partner to African countries than China, saying he was committed to strengthening friendships in the region in the latest effort by successive U.S. administrations to counter perceptions of U.S. neglect of a continent where China has increasingly made economic inroads.

U.S. embassies across Africa and the State Department's Africa Bureau in Washington have chronically been understaffed across several administrations. But now, Trump's ouster of 13 chiefs of mission as reported by the Associated Press will bring the total top-level vacancies in the region to roughly 30. Former diplomats and experts said this number will inevitably have an impact on America's diplomacy.

It was unclear whether the State Department planned to replace those who are being recalled. The department did not provide answers on when they intended to replace them.

The recall of top envoys reflected Trump's "personal style", said Cameron Hudson, a former U.S. official who worked on Africa, given the Republican president has taken an active role in the peace accord between Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda as well as in actions against Nigeria over the killing of Christians.

That approach, Hudson said, misses the point of diplomacy and engagement and undermines efforts by diplomats to shape attitudes and interests.

Trump feels "He doesn't need ambassadors, because he's managing these relationships, even with 54 African countries, himself. So if he's not personally engaged, then that country doesn't merit his engagement. If he is personally engaged, then why does he need an ambassador?," Hudson said.

Aside from Trump himself, Massad Boulos, father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany and senior adviser for Arab and African Affairs, has played a major role in negotiations between Congo and Rwanda. He has also tried to help end the war in Sudan.

Despite former President Joe Biden's repeated pledges to focus more on Africa, U.S. influence in the continent declined during his term. Washington lost a military base in the Sahel region and made little progress breaking China's commercial domination in minerals seen as critical to national security.

Much of Trump's focus in the region has been on mediating a peace deal to end the conflict in eastern Congo, as the Republican president sought diplomatic acclaim for international peacemaking. However, just days after Trump and leaders of Congo and Rwanda reaffirmed a peace deal, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels made their biggest advance in months.

Trump also has feuded with South Africa and added Nigeria to a list of countries of concern, threatening military action if the West African nation fails to crack down on the killing of Christians.

Among U.S. envoys recalled were those serving in Rwanda and Nigeria, according to the AP, as well as Niger, where this year a U.S. pilot working for a missionary agency was kidnapped.

"The Trump Administration is delivering unprecedented success in advancing America’s national interests in Africa," Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the State Department, said.

"Those successes — from commercial and trade deals to historic health and peace agreements — are a direct result of President Trump’s tremendous leadership and the professionalism of American diplomats. That’s the real story."

The State Department did not confirm AP's reporting on the number of ambassadors recalled.

Even after high-level engagement by Boulos, it still falls to the embassy to do the follow-up work, said Tibor Nagy, who was the top Africa official at the State Department during Trump's first term. He said the vacancies were "an extremely high number," though added that assessment was based on his impression rather than data.

In addition to the overseas missions, leadership of the Africa Bureau at the State Department will also be going through personnel changes with Senior Bureau Official for African Affairs Jonathan Pratt retiring.

In an email seen by Reuters, Pratt told staff that when he took on the position, he had agreed to serve in the role through the end of the year. "While historically understaffed, the AF bureau constantly rises to every challenge and takes advantage of every opportunity," he said.

The bureau's Deputy Assistant Secretary Nick Checker will step into the role after Pratt's departure, a State Department spokesperson said. Checker will be the third official to take on the role under Trump's second term, after the retirement of Pratt and Troy Fitrell .

Trump has yet to nominate a candidate for Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, a Senate-confirmed position. The State Department did not address a question on when the administration would make that nomination.

Nagy, who was a key department official in the first months of the current Trump administration, said the lack of a nominee "definitely can hurt the operations of the bureau."

Nagy, who also served as U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia and Guinea, said that while Checker is "qualified, competent ... at some point you really do need to have a Senate-confirmed assistant secretary."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 06:34:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JL6SPVOPARMEDMLJHHIX54HDRM.jpg?auth=4d2af2b73c2f72d344f811a4c7bc9d8a2048b66cc4f825bd174406a7819e1931&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey says electrical failure reported before Libyan military jet crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/turkey-says-electrical-failure-reported-before-libyan-military-jet-crash-2025-12-24/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - A private jet carrying the chief of staff of Libya’s army reported an electrical failure and requested an emergency landing shortly before crashing near Ankara , Turkey’s head of communications said on Wednesday.

The Dassault Falcon 50 jet took off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1717 GMT on Tuesday en route to Tripoli and at 1733 GMT it informed air traffic control of an emergency caused by an electrical malfunction, Burhanettin Duran said in a statement.

Eight people, including three crew members, were killed in the crash, according to Libyan and Turkish officials.

Air traffic control redirected the aircraft back toward Esenboga Airport and emergency measures were initiated, but the jet disappeared from radar at 1736 GMT while descending for landing and contact was lost, he said.

Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya earlier said the aircraft requested an emergency landing while flying over Ankara’s Haymana district, adding that the wreckage was later found near Kesikkavak village in the area.

Search and rescue teams reached the crash site after operations were launched by Turkey's Interior Ministry and investigations into the cause of the crash were continuing with the involvement of all relevant authorities, Duran said.

Libya's internationally recognised government has said the dead included the country's army chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, and four members of his entourage.

Libyan officials have said the jet was leased and registered in Malta, adding that its ownership and technical history would be examined as part of the investigation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 06:34:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EC7FOZJT2JKIREM72PPBJJ2XRM.jpg?auth=30b4ee40a6a7a1c0880e3992e7eb8bef0ec0a472d96d0d1fe60c063b0a3ae30e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea special prosecutor indicts ex-president Yoon over opinion polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-special-prosecutor-indicts-ex-president-yoon-over-opinion-polls-2025-12-24/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 24 (Reuters) - South Korea's special prosecutor has indicted ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol on allegations of violating the political fundraising act by illegally receiving public opinion polls, according to a statement from the special prosecution team on Wednesday.

Less than 100 days after he was elected premier, Anutin dissolved parliament earlier this month when his minority government faced the threat of a no-confidence vote.

Speaking to party members and supporters on Wednesday, Anutin said he and his Bhumjaithai party were ready to return to power, describing the February 8 election as "the most consequential poll" for the conservative political outfit since its formation in 2008.

"Today we are sure and ready to enter the election race to serve Thailand and its people," Anutin said.

"This is the first time the Thai people has high expectations from the Bhumjaithai Party."

If re-elected, Anutin said that key executives of his government will keep their roles, including Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas, Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow and Commerce Minister Suphajee Suthumpun.

Anutin stands to gain from growing nationalist sentiment generated by the conflict with Cambodia, which reignited on his watch. However, analysts say the election could be close and grant no clear majority for any of the parties involved.

Yodchanan Wongsawat , a leading prime ministerial candidate with the Pheu Thai Party, told Reuters in an interview that he is open to join a coalition government.

In a nationwide survey conducted by the National Institute of Development Administration, Bhumjaithai is currently polling at 9.92%, fourth among the major parties competing in the vote.

But the survey also indicated that some 32.36% of voters had yet to decide which party they will back, leaving space for Bhumjaithai to gain ground in the coming weeks.

Bhumjaithai came third in the 2023 election, joining a Pheu Thai-led ruling coalition, with which it stayed until June this year.

The party withdrew its support following a leaked phone call between then Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.

Paetongtarn was later dismissed by the Constitutional Court in August, opening the door for Anutin.

A savvy political operator, Anutin manoeuvred his way to the top job through a parliamentary vote in September after striking a deal with the opposition People's Party, the largest force in parliament.

That agreement, however, fell through earlier this month, setting the stage for February's earlier-than-expected snap election.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:25:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDMMPYQCLBKQHMMRH7SLRJEO2Q.jpg?auth=fea9f8968d6f5320a7f580f200209a691f454232912b6fceb6b375f25a5248a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Coup leader expected to stay in power in Guinea presidential vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/coup-leader-expected-stay-power-guinea-presidential-vote-2025-12-24/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:26:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France condemns U.S. visa ban imposed on ex-EU commissioner Breton</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-condemns-us-visa-ban-imposed-ex-eu-commissioner-breton-2025-12-24/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The French government condemned on Wednesday a visa ban imposed by the Trump administration on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner who helped drive the EU's Digital Services Act, which has recently targeted top U.S. tech companies.

"France strongly condemns the visa restriction imposed by the United States on Thierry Breton, former minister and European Commissioner, and four other European figures," wrote French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on X on Wednesday.

The Trump administration on Tuesday imposed visa bans on Breton and other anti-disinformation campaigners which it says were involved in censoring U.S. social media platforms, in the latest move in a campaign aimed at European rules that U.S. officials say go beyond legitimate regulation.

Breton, a former French finance minister and the European commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024, was the most high-profile individual targeted by these bans.

The United States' Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers described - when outlining the bans on Tuesday - Breton as a 'mastermind' of the EU's Digital Services Act, which was again defended by Barrot on Wednesday.

"The Digital Services Act (DSA) was democratically adopted in Europe to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online. It has absolutely no extraterritorial reach and in no way affects the United States," wrote Barrot on X.

Breton himself also condemned the visa ban against him.

"Is McCarthy’s witch hunt back? As a reminder: 90% of the European Parliament — our democratically elected body — and all 27 Member States unanimously voted the DSA. To our American friends: 'Censorship isn’t where you think it is.'," wrote Breton on X.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:26:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3TYKGHJ5N5PSVEN2OXHN4IPSHU.jpg?auth=ff0ce3dbb8ae1650712d4249b0228b36bed8967d76c347d85d5daa541a692fff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Ukrainian army loses eastern town of Siversk, three killed by blast in Moscow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251224-live-ukrainian-army-loses-eastern-town-of-siversk-three-killed-by-blast-in-moscow</link><description>Russia attacked Ukraine energy sector with drones and missiles strikes.

"He suggested that during the upcoming election period, voters should choose candidates who can cooperate with the Tatmadaw," state-run media reported, referring to Myanmar's powerful armed forces.

The comments underline the junta's attempts to hold on to power as it uses ballots to do what it couldn't on the battlefield - cement its control over the country in the face of fierce armed resistance that has emerged since the coup, while gaining some international legitimacy for its rule.

But analysts and diplomats say the aim of establishing a stable administration in the Southeast Asian nation is far-fetched since the civil war is still raging, and a military-controlled government with a civilian veneer is unlikely to win many backers overseas.

"A new iteration of indirect military rule will do nothing to resolve the armed conflict or civil resistance, and Myanmar will remain mired in crisis," said Richard Horsey, Senior Myanmar Adviser at Crisis Group.

Voting will be held in two phases , on Sunday and Jan. 11, in only 202 of Myanmar's 330 townships where the military has varying degrees of control.

Dates for a potential third phase, counting or results have not been announced.

The battle-hardened Tatmadaw has long dominated politics in Myanmar, which won independence from Britain in 1948, with a string of military chiefs running the country with an iron grip.

Min Aung Hlaing joined their ranks in February 2021, when he ousted a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on the unproven allegation of electoral fraud by her party, which had won the preceding years' polls by a landslide.

"The military is incapable of anything but cosmetic change that will not threaten their core interests of central control," said David Mathieson, an independent Myanmar analyst.

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, which won the last two general elections in 2020 and 2015 , remains dissolved by the election commission, and many other anti-junta political outfits are not in the running.

Six parties are competing nationwide, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party that has the largest slate of candidates and is tipped to win the polls, creating conditions for the junta chief to take a civilian role.

"The USDP already has established political leaders within its ranks," said political analyst Sai Kyi Zin Soe, suggesting that Min Aung Hlaing's route to presidency may not be straightforward, although the general is expected to remain tremendously powerful.

"While it is likely that a national leader will emerge from the military-aligned USDP, we have to wait and see if that leader will be Min Aung Hlaing," he said.

In a military-managed election in 2010, the Tatmadaw installed a former general as a civilian president, a move intended to oversee a tightly controlled political opening.

President Thein Sein later launched reforms that surprised critics and supporters alike. These included freeing political prisoners, easing long-standing media censorship and overseeing the 2015 election that resulted in a transfer of power to Suu Kyi after his party lost the vote.

But comparisons between the current situation and past processes can be flawed, partly because of the unprecedented violence that has ravaged Myanmar since the coup, as a popular armed resistance has combined with long-standing ethnic armies in the country's borderlands to challenge the Tatmadaw.

"Rather than stabilising the country, military-orchestrated elections are likely to intensify violence while failing to generate durable political or economic stability," said Ye Myo Hein, a senior fellow at the Southeast Asia Peace Institute non-profit.

The elections are also a move by Min Aung Hlaing and his brass to seek foreign legitimacy after being shunned by the international community in the wake of the coup, the analysts said.

Although planned with the backing of key ally China , the junta is seeking to gather broader support for the elections, including from neighbours such as India and Thailand as well as the 11-member ASEAN bloc that has barred the ruling generals from its summits.

Thailand's foreign minister said last month that ASEAN would find it difficult to re-engage with Myanmar because the election was being held without the necessary "inclusive dialogue," and also called for Suu Kyi's release.

The United Nations, human rights groups and many Western nations have been vocal in their criticism of the elections that the junta is carrying out with the help of a law that punishes dissent and under which it has charged hundreds of people.

"Any meaningful election requires an end to violence and dialogue amongst all parties concerned," Britain said at the UN Security Council this week. "And there are no indications that the planned elections will be perceived as free or fair."

The junta insists that the polls have popular support, denying that they are being conducted with coercion, force or suppression.

"The election is being conducted for the people of Myanmar, not for the international community," junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun told reporters this month, according to state-run media.

"Whether the international community is satisfied or not is irrelevant."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:25:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V35DDYV7EZLXVJNQR2M4SQ56KY.jpg?auth=bda6b5e8c00d0f677cec7d69c548b366e1bd0b1ca8137df31468286bee0d3f65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How Israel's hilltop settlers coordinate attacks to expel Palestinians</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-hilltop-settlers-coordinate-attacks-expel-palestinians-2025-12-24/</link><description>DEIR DIBWAN, WEST BANK, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The Jewish settler outpost of Or Meir is small. A handful of prefabricated white shelters, it sits at the end of a short dirt track on a hill leading up from Road 60, a major route that dissects the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Over time, similar modest dwellings have turned into sprawling Israeli housing developments, part of a plan that members of Israel's cabinet acknowledge they have implemented to prevent the birth of a Palestinian state.

The process can be violent. A Bedouin family told Reuters attackers who descended from Or Meir hurling Molotov cocktails drove them off Palestinian-owned land nearby last year. They fear they won't ever be able to return.

Messages posted on Or Meir's channel on the Telegram social media platform celebrate chasing out Bedouin herders and show the new settlers’ determination to secure lasting control over what they call “strategic” territory.

This year ​was one of the most violent on record for Israeli civilian attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to United Nations data that shows more than 750 injuries and the rapid spread of outposts throughout land Palestinians hope will form the heart of a future state.

Israeli NGO Peace Now has recorded 80 outposts built in 2025, the most since the organization started its records in 1991. On December 21, Israel's cabinet approved 19 more settlements, including former outposts. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the goal was to block Palestinian statehood.

For decades, groups of settlers have built outposts on West Bank land without official authorisation from the Israeli state. Israeli authorities in the West Bank sometimes demolish such camps but they often reappear, and in many cases end up being accepted by Israel as formal settlements. Smotrich has pushed efforts to formalise more outposts.

Most of the world considers all Israel's settlement activity in the West Bank illegal under international law relating to military occupations. Israel disputes this view.

"Since establishing our presence on the land, we have driven away nine illegal Bedouin outposts, and returned 6,000 dunams to Jewish hands," the account representing Or Meir's settlers said in a post in September, using the dunam measurement equal to about 1,000 square meters, or a quarter of an acre.

Reuters could not independently confirm all the attacks on the Bedouins or determine who posted on behalf of Or Meir, which was established about two years ago. The settlers there declined to speak to the news agency.

In response to Reuters questions about intensifying settler violence in the West Bank, an Israeli official blamed a "fringe minority" and said Palestinian attacks against Israelis were underreported by the media. The Palestinian Authority did not respond to requests for comment.

Messages on the Or Meir Telegram channel, which is public, suggest a well-organized plan to take land, a finding supported by Reuters examination of a dozen other Telegram and WhatsApp groups representing similar groups, three interviews with settlers and pro-settler groups and on-the-ground reporting around Or Meir and a new settlement.

"The evidence shows that this is a systematic pattern of violence,” said Milena Ansari, a researcher based in Jerusalem for Human Rights Watch whose work includes research on settlements in the West Bank.

The Bedouin Musabah family said they were attacked at night in June from the direction of Or Meir. Charred remains of their home and a barn were still visible to a Reuters team in December.

"We were living here, sitting in God's safety," said Bedouin shepherd Shahada Musabah, 39, now sheltering in the nearby Palestinian village of Deir Dibwan. "They started to set fire and they destroyed everything. They didn't leave us anything at all."

In response to questions about the incident, Israel's military told Reuters dozens of Israeli civilians set fire to property in Deir Dibwan on the night in question. It said all suspects had left by the time security forces arrived. An official in the Deir Dibwan council told Reuters up to 60 settlers were involved, throwing stones and burning the Musabah house and other property, along with cars. Several villagers were injured by stones.

In a telephone call, Or Meir settler Elkanah Nachmani told Reuters reporters not to advance up the track to the outpost from Road 60 and not to make contact again.

Nachmani responded to a Reuters request for comment but did not address the issues raised by the questions. In the Telegram channel, Or Meir settlers accused Palestinians of poisoning their sheep in November 2024, an accusation the Musabah family denies.

Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it documented since October 7, 2023, only 2% resulted in indictments.

Reuters could not confirm the group's findings. Israel's police and military did not respond to requests for comment.

More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 7, 2023 and October 17, 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, according to the U.N. In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.

The Or Meir group has been open about its goals.

In November 2024, the Or Meir account posted that it aimed to settle "a strategic ridge near the settlement of Ofra" seeking to create "a continuous Jewish settlement presence."

Dror Etkes, an Israeli peace activist, said other outposts served the same purpose, fracturing the West Bank and "limiting the possibility of Palestinians to be in these places."

Despite the government's actions to recognise dozens of previously irregular outposts, Israel’s military told Reuters in a statement Or Meir "is illegal and has been evacuated several times by the security forces." It did not provide specifics about why it considered the outpost illegal or why it was "evacuated" - the military's word to describe closure or demolition of outposts in the West Bank.

After the most recent evacuation in March, Or Meir re-emerged with the help of over 100,000 shekels ($30,000) raised by donations, according to the settlement's website. Reuters couldn't independently confirm the donations.

The former outposts Israel has formalised as settlements over the years include ones previously evacuated by the army. Ofra, also on Road 60 just north of Or Meir, started as an outpost and is now a major housing development.

"Why do we continue?" asked a post by the Or Meir Telegram account in March after the evacuation. The post then answered its own question. "All breakthroughs in settlements were accomplished this way. At first, the state refused to accommodate any activity on the ground and fought it fiercely, but due to the persistence of the citizens, it eventually had to accept it."

In December, Smotrich said 51,370 housing units had been approved for West Bank settlements since he became minister in late 2022, part of what the U.N. describes as the fastest expansion of settlements since its monitoring began in 2017. Smotrich's office did not respond to a request for comment.

On September 30, the Oir Meir Telegram account published a map showing the location of the outpost. The map highlighted a large area with a blue boundary stretching to the edge of Deir Dibwan. The group said the marked area was under control of their outpost.

At least four attacks on Palestinians have been reported within the blue boundary, according to the Deir Dibwan council, which said Palestinians could no longer access the area, including about 250 dunams belonging to the council itself.

The map also shows eight black markers, mostly within the blue boundary, listed as “abandoned Arab invasion outpost,” indicating places from which Bedouins had allegedly been ejected.

Road 60 is flanked by settlements. It is intersected by Road 505, running west-east toward the Jordan Valley and also lined with settlements, including Evyatar near the Palestinian town of Beita.

Evyatar began as a tented outpost in 2019. It was evacuated in 2021 but secured Israeli government recognition in 2024. Malkiel Barhai, Evyatar’s mayor, credited Smotrich for the approval.

Speaking in Evyatar with a pistol tucked into his trousers that he said was for protection, Barhai said the settlement was vital to keep Road 505 open “because we have Arab villages, hostile Arab villages, around.”

A member of the Beita municipality told Reuters settlers from surrounding outposts or settlements, including Evyatar, killed 14 people in the area around Beita between 2021 and 2024. Reuters could not verify the deaths or who was responsible.

On November 8, Reuters witnessed an attack by settlers wielding sticks and clubs and hurling large rocks as Palestinians harvested olives close to Beita. Two Reuters employees - a journalist and a security adviser - were among those injured.

Barhai denied settlers were behind attacks, and blamed Palestinians for violence.

Samer Younes Ali Bani Shamsah, a farmer who lives near Evyatar and whose leg was broken in a settler attack, said he would not leave the land no matter the cost.

"This is my place, my home. Where would I go?," he said. A hill over, another outpost stood, above a hill of olive trees.

The military ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in a February 2021 coup, just as it was preparing for its second term in office following a landslide election win months earlier.

The generals accused Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party of electoral fraud , which she rejected. International election monitors reported no irregularities. Suu Kyi and much of the NLD were detained along with thousands of junta opponents.

The junta pledged to hold an election by August 2023 and restore a democratic system but that was pushed back as the military lost control of swathes of the country in its battles with ethnic minority rebels and anti-junta militias.

The NLD was among dozens of parties dissolved for failing to register.

Most analysts see the election as a way for the military, which has governed Myanmar for much of the past six decades, to entrench its rule via proxies in the absence of a viable political opposition, and earn legitimacy at home and abroad.

Voting will be held in phases, on December 28 in 102 townships, and on January 11 in 100 townships. Authorities have said a third phase could be held later in January.

Myanmar has 330 townships altogether and junta chief Min Aung Hlaing has acknowledged polls will not be nationwide.

Dates for counting and results have not been publicised. The military-backed election commission has said its more than 50,000 electronic voting machines will speed up counting.

Seats will be determined by a combination of first-past-the-post, proportional representation and mixed-member proportional systems, the commission has said. Previous elections used a plurality system where candidates with the most votes won seats.

In line with an army-drafted 2008 constitution, 25% of upper and lower house seats are reserved for serving military personnel selected by the armed forces chief.

Only six parties are competing on a national level, with 51 contesting within a single region or state. Many parties that ran in the past two elections have been disbanded and anti-junta rebels have refused to take part.

That has left in the fray only junta-approved parties, including the military's proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party, which won the last election held by a junta in 2010 . The USDP is fielding 1,018 candidates, a fifth of the total registered.

The USDP, led by former generals, was routed by the NLD in landslides in 2015 and 2020 elections, the latter annulled after the coup.

As in 2010, with the armed forces controlling 25% of the legislature and its USDP allies expected to win a large number of seats, the military will have power to influence who becomes president, the formation of a government, plus judicial and civil service appointments.

According to the constitution, parliament must convene within 90 days of the start of the election. Speakers will be elected and at a later date, a president.

To choose a president, three electoral colleges are formed comprising members of the upper and lower houses, which each nominate one candidate for president. Two of the colleges are elected lawmakers while the third is exclusively comprised of military-appointed lawmakers.

A plenary vote of the bicameral legislature will be held and the candidate with most votes becomes president, with the runners up as vice presidents. A cabinet will then be appointed by the president.

The United Nations, many Western countries and human rights groups say the election is a sham exercise aimed at perpetrating military rule.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc, of which Myanmar is a member, has called for a fair and inclusive election and may find it difficult to re-engage even after the polls.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, however, has made a major diplomatic push this year to win support for the polls, including two trips each to key allies China and Russia, which are backing the election, as is India , according to state media.

The military has rejected international criticism, saying the election was not being conducted through coercion or force and has public support.

"The election is being conducted for the people of Myanmar, not for the international community," junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said on December 14.

"Whether the international community is satisfied or not, is irrelevant."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:25:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5RG5TMEB5NPJVJOC2NIHXPTZTM.jpg?auth=de3e5b1ce3bb38b516464eb0d89abbadfc571417d193bca4ad625f0fe696029f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar's decade of turmoil: elections, coup and conflict</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmars-decade-turmoil-elections-coup-conflict-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Nearly five years after it seized power, Myanmar's military is moving ahead with a multi-phase general election starting on Sunday, despite conflict across the country.

Here is a timeline of key moments in Myanmar's recent history:

NOVEMBER 2015: Myanmar holds its second general election since the end of five decades of military rule in 2011. Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party win by a landslide, routing the military-backed ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party.

NOVEMBER 8, 2020: Myanmar holds a nationwide election in which the NLD claims a landslide victory.

NOVEMBER 11, 2020: The main opposition, the army-backed USDP, calls for a re-run of the election, alleging irregularities.

FEBRUARY 1, 2021: As the NLD prepares to start its second term in office, Myanmar's military stages a coup , arresting Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other senior figures from the ruling party. The military-backed Vice President Myint Swe becomes president but immediately transfers power to the military, which forms a junta to administer the country.

FEBRUARY 7, 2021: Protests sweep across Myanmar as tens of thousands of people take to the streets in Yangon and other parts of the country in the biggest demonstrations in years.

MARCH–APRIL 2021: The military violently suppresses demonstrators, prompting many protesters to take up arms against the junta, marking a shift toward a nationwide rebellion.

APRIL 2021: Remnants of Suu Kyi's party and pro-democracy activists establish a parallel civilian administration, the National Unity Government. Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing goes to Jakarta for an emergency meeting of Association of Southeast Asian Nations leaders, who agree a "five-point consensus" roadmap aimed at securing peace in Myanmar.

OCTOBER 2021: ASEAN decides to exclude Myanmar's military leadership from its summits over its failure to take steps to implement the peace plan.

DECEMBER 30, 2022: Suu Kyi is sentenced to 33 years in jail on charges ranging from electoral violations and breaching of coronavirus restrictions to corruption - allegations she denies. The sentence is later reduced to 27 years.

MARCH 2023: The military-appointed election commission dissolves the NLD and dozens of other political parties for failing to re-register under new rules.

OCTOBER 27, 2023: A collection of ethnic minority armed groups launch a coordinated offensive against the military near the Chinese border, taking over swathes of territory and posing the most significant threat to the junta since the coup.

JULY 2025: The military government enacts a controversial law aimed at protecting an upcoming election from obstruction, disruption and destruction, with penalties including the death sentence.

AUGUST 1, 2025: Myanmar forms an interim government after ending a state of emergency lasting more than four years, with Min Aung Hlaing assuming the presidency while also remaining military chief.

AUGUST 18, 2025: Myanmar announces it will hold the first phase of a multi-stage election on December 28, outlining a roadmap for the first national polls since the coup.

OCTOBER 29: Myanmar's junta announces that the second phase of the election will be on January 11, covering 100 more townships across the country.

DECEMBER 14: Junta spokeperson Zaw Min Tun fires back at international criticism of the election, saying the move has public support and is not being conducted with coercion, force or suppression.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:25:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BKGLEL2EPNO2FGQRLHXACEHKZY.jpg?auth=0c8244c53547ae6f19808e70e661a093b2da9235213f88dddff3f80ad90b00fa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh leader seen as likely next prime minister set to return from exile ahead of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-leader-seen-likely-next-prime-minister-set-return-exile-ahead-polls-2025-12-24/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The Bangladesh Nationalist Party aims to gather five million supporters to welcome its leader Tarique Rahman home from nearly 17 years in exile on Thursday, a show of strength as he emerges as a leading contender for prime minister in February elections.

Rahman, 60, is the son of ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and acting chairman of the party that is widely expected to come out on top in the parliamentary vote set for February 12.

His return from London comes as his BNP is on the ascendant following the ouster of its arch foe, long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , in a student-led uprising last year. Apart from brief transition administrations, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina have alternated in power since 1991.

A December survey by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute suggests the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race. Hasina's Awami League party, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could jeopardize the vote.

Rahman’s decision to return is driven by both political developments and personal circumstances. His mother has been seriously ill for months, prompting what party insiders describe as an urgent trip home.

BNP leaders said they are preparing for what they call an “unprecedented” gathering in the capital, aiming to draw more than five million supporters along the route from the airport to the reception venue.

“This will be a defining political moment,” senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said, adding that security arrangements are being closely coordinated with authorities to ensure order.

Rahman has lived in London since 2008 as he faced multiple criminal convictions at home including for money laundering and in a case related to a plot to assassinate Hasina. He was, however, acquitted of all charges after Hasina’s removal, clearing the legal barriers that had delayed his return.

BNP officials said he will travel directly from the airport to the reception venue before visiting his mother.

Rahman's return comes as the Muslim-majority South Asian nation of nearly 175 million people enters a sensitive election period under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. The vote is widely viewed as crucial to restoring political stability after nearly two years of turmoil.

Bangladesh is at a crossroads, with Rahman’s return testing the BNP’s ability to mobilise peacefully and the interim administration’s promise to deliver a credible transfer of power. While the government has pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns about law enforcement.

The National Citizen Party (NCP), which emerged from the youth protest movement that toppled Hasina, said it views Rahman's return positively.

"Tarique Rahman was forced into exile under severe pressure and threats, so his homecoming carries symbolic weight," said Khan Muhammad Mursalin, an NCP spokesperson. "His arrival will undoubtedly energize party leaders and supporters ... On the path to democracy, we will stand with him."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:26:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V3GIWIZVNBOMREEDXWTIPK3VFY.jpg?auth=174a69f1603e56b4c83656a59847e2152042f8ebebb52acafe8d6727881af2af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar's election in numbers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmars-election-numbers-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Myanmar will hold the first round of voting in a general election on Sunday in what its military government says will usher in a return to civilian rule following a 2021 coup.

Following are facts and figures on elections in Myanmar:

- 4 national elections have been held in Myanmar in the past 35 years, but only two - in 2010 and 2015 - resulted in the formation of elected governments. The 2020 election was annulled by a military junta, as was a 1990 ballot - 20 years after it took place and was ignored.

- 4,963 candidates have registered for this election.

- 6 parties will take part nationwide and 51 will vie for seats in a single region or state.

- 40 parties were dissolved in 2023 for failing to register for the election, including the former ruling National League for Democracy, whose government was ousted in 2021.

- 1,018, or one-fifth the candidates running, are from the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party

- 2 rounds of voting are scheduled - December 28 and January 11 - with the possibility of another a few weeks later.

- 202 of Myanmar's 330 townships will hold voting in the first two rounds. It is unclear when the rest will be contested, with a civil war raging in many areas. No dates have been set for counting of votes or announcement of results.

- 664 seats are available in the bicameral parliament, with 440 in the lower house and 224 in the upper house.

- 25 percent of seats in both chambers are allocated to serving military personnel appointed by the armed forces chief, a quota set out in the 2008 constitution under Myanmar's quasi-civilian political system.

- 90 days is the period after the election when a new parliament must convene. Its members will choose speakers, then later elect a president as head of state, who then forms a government.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:26:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A Japanese regional assembly is set to vote by December 22 on restarting nuclear plant</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/japanese-regional-assembly-is-set-vote-by-december-22-restarting-nuclear-plant-2025-12-02/</link><description>KASHIWAZAKI, Japan, Dec 2 (Reuters) - A Japanese regional assembly on Tuesday began deliberations on whether to partially restart the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant, the world's largest, as the nation seeks to bolster its domestic power sources.

The plant, located around 300 kilometers (186 miles) northeast of Tokyo on the coast of the Sea of Japan, was shut down after a powerful tsunami destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi reactor in 2011. Both are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co (9501.T) , opens new tab .

The peaceful coastal area encompassing Kashiwazaki city and Kariwa village, home to around 80,000 people, is gaining attention as the restart of the plant's Unit No. 6 would be the first for TEPCO since the Fukushima disaster.

"The use of nuclear energy is essential in Japan, which has few resources," said TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa on Monday as he gave top delegates from the Japan Business Federation a tour of the plant.

After the Fukushima disaster, Japan shuttered all 54 nuclear reactors in operation at the time, which left it heavily reliant on fossil fuel imports. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has said she supports more nuclear relaunches to strengthen energy security and address the cost of imported energy, which accounts for 60% to 70% of Japan's electricity generation.

TEPCO has been improving safety at its nuclear power business, Kobayakawa said, as around 20 staffers - clad in thick blue hazmat suits - performed safety drills at the plant.

But Yukihiko Hoshino, a member of the Kashiwazaki city assembly, said local residents were concerned about the chances of another nuclear accident.

"The biggest worry is whether they will be able to evacuate," he said.

He said there are still people who cannot return home to the Fukushima plant area.

The Niigata assembly's final session of 2025 runs from Tuesday until December 22. TEPCO plans to restart the 1,356-megawatt Unit No. 6 in January, pending the assembly's vote.

It is not clear when the assembly might vote on the plant's restart. TEPCO was looking to restart Unit No. 7 later and possibly decommission the other five.

Of the 54 reactors that were in operation before the Fukushima incident, Japan has restarted 14 of the 33 that remained operable. On its own, Unit No. 6 could improve the supply situation for the energy-hungry Tokyo area by 2%, according to Japan's industry ministry.

After years of decline, Japan's power demand is set to grow thanks to data center expansions and AI-driven businesses.

TEPCO continues to pay compensation for the Fukushima Daiichi disaster.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:26:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZOTSHTEFLFI7RIQVHJKCJGGJGE.jpg?auth=c591f4dc6cdb37c29dce3b5731d87941a17e2f16880d9717c69d02882d2c8b4d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy seeks meeting with Trump to hammer out issue of territory</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-seeks-meeting-with-trump-hammer-out-issue-territory-2025-12-24/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for a meeting with Donald Trump to hammer out the most sensitive issues in a future peace deal with Russia, such as control of territory, following the latest round of U.S.-Ukrainian talks.

In remarks to reporters released by his office on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian and U.S. delegations had inched closer to finalising a 20-point plan at the talks over the weekend in Miami.

"This is a document referred to as a framework – a foundational document on ending the war, a political document between us, America, Europe, and the Russians," Zelenskiy said.

"We are ready for a meeting with the United States at the leaders’ level to address sensitive issues. Matters such as territorial questions must be discussed at the leaders’ level."

U.S. President Trump has long said he wants to end Europe's deadliest war since World War Two, but has so far failed to win substantial concessions from the warring sides.

Kyiv has been pressing Washington to modify a peace plan that, in a draft unveiled last month, echoed Moscow's main demands that Ukraine cede more territory, renounce future military alliances and accept curbs on its forces. Kyiv says that would leave it defenceless against future attacks by Russia, which invaded in 2014 and again at full scale in 2022.

Zelenskiy said that the latest 20-point framework draft was a considerable evolution compared with the 28-point plan discussed earlier by the United States and Russia.

Ukraine would keep its army at its current strength of 800,000, and additional documents agreed with the United States and European allies would provide robust guarantees of its security.

"...We will be able to see a strong Ukraine – supported by the Coalition of the Willing, with a mechanism to monitor compliance with peace and with specifics on how to respond to any potential renewal of aggression by Russia," Zelenskiy said.

Ukrainian and U.S. officials also worked on several documents related to post-war reconstruction and investment, Zelenskiy said.

However, despite the progress, Ukraine and the United States still have not found common ground on territorial issues.

Zelenskiy said that Kyiv's proposal was "to remain where we are”, halting fighting at current battle lines. Moscow, whose forces have been slowly advancing, wants Kyiv to withdraw troops from all of the eastern Donetsk region, around a quarter of which is still under Ukrainian control.

Zelenskiy said Washington was trying to find a compromise and looking to establish a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone in the area.

There was also no agreement on the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Zelenskiy said. Europe's largest nuclear power plant is located in territory under Russian military control near the front line. Zelenskiy said Kyiv was proposing a small economic zone there.

The new 20-point proposal would be studied by Moscow, Zelenskiy said, and then the next steps would be determined.

"We are saying: if all regions are included and if we remain where we are, then we will reach an agreement," Zelenskiy said.

"But if we do not agree to remain where we are, there are two options: either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:23:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CQOPC53XD5MSNKKJ33BE3GSOUI.jpg?auth=c2bfe439ef3aeba00c3ddb8ef870361cfef0cf63f6a6ae731b63f2e3836fcdd8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How a real photo of Donald Trump linked to Jeffrey Epstein was doctored using AI</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251224-real-photo-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-doctored-artificial-intelligence</link><description>On December 12, Democratic representatives released 19 photos from the files of New York financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , who died in prison. The images show a number of well-known people, including Steve Bannon , Woody Allen and Bill Gates . US President Donald Trump appears in three of the photos. None of the images appear to show these public figures engaging in criminal behaviour.

Still, one of the photos featuring Donald Trump sparked a lot of online discussion. The photo, which was likely taken in the 1990s, shows the future president surrounded by six women wearing Hawaiian leis. Black squares cover the women’s faces in order to protect their identities.

Pro-Trump social media users claim that Democrats blacked out the women’s faces purely to make it impossible to determine their ages, so that viewers would be more likely to interpret the image as further indication that the president may have abused underage girls who were victims of Epstein’s sexual trafficking ring.

On December 14, some of these social media users claimed to reveal an uncensored version of the photo, which would clear up questions about the women’s ages.

One pro-Trump social media user, who shared the photo in a post that garnered more than 4,000 likes on Instagram, said:

“Democrats and their lackeys in the media are circulating a picture of Donald Trump with a bunch of young beautiful women wearing Hawaiian leis with faces blacked out to give the implication that Trump was hanging around with underage women supplied by Epstein.

The truth is that the women in the photo were models representing Hawaiian Tropic, the American suntan lotion brand, at an event at Mar-a-Lago.”

Pro-Trump social media users were right to say that the anonymised photo is not proof that Trump abused underage girls. So far, there has been no evidence for such an accusation.

That said, the photo said to show the faces of the women posing with Donald Trump has been digitally altered. If you run the image through a reverse image search (check out one of our handy guides to find out how), then you can find the original, undoctored image.

There are a few details in the image that are clear indications that it was generated by artificial intelligence (AI). First of all, Donald Trump’s right hand is visibly deformed. This is a clue that artificial intelligence has been used to generate the image, as AI struggles to accurately depict details of human anatomy.

Another clue: the undoctored image has a logo at the bottom right. This diamond-shaped logo represents Google’s AI image generator, Nano Banana, which is integrated in Gemini, the company’s AI chatbot. Google Lens also indicates that the image was “created by Google’s AI”. Images generated by Nano Banana have an invisible watermark, which can be detected by SynthID, a detection tool used by Google Lens.

Finally, the image is supposed to show a group of six women standing with Trump. However, there are only five in the AI-generated image.

US tabloid the New York Post published a photo on December 12 that they said showed the uncensored original image, showing the faces of the six women.

The photo published in the New York Post reveals the face of the sixth woman, who disappeared in the AI-generated image. The brown haired woman is standing to the left of the president.

In the photo created by AI, the woman was replaced by Trump’s deformed-looking hand. The faces of the women in the photo published by the New York Post are completely different to those that appear in the AI-generated image.

So what happened? Well, someone probably asked Google’s AI to uncensor the photo of Donald Trump.

This is a dangerous use of this tool, warns open source analyst Tal Hagin on X :

"This is why using AI to enhance blurred or redacted images is dangerous.

AI does not recover hidden details. It hallucinates them. It fills in gaps based on patterns, not reality. That means it can easily manufacture a completely different person’s face.”

This type of content is even more misleading because it is a fake generated from a real photo connected to an event that really took place.

Just as pro-Trump social media users claimed, the women who appear in the photo were models working for Hawaiian Tropic sun lotion, which was revealed by the British newspaper The Telegraph . The paper interviewed one of the women who appears in the photo. She said that she was 22 when the photo was taken, likely in 1998. She added that Trump behaved like a “gentleman”.

There was not immediate report of damage across Taiwan, the National Fire Agency said.

Taiwan chipmaker TSMC said the quake did not reach the required level for evacuation of factories across the island, which lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes.

Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly complained that ending the Ukraine war - the deadliest in Europe since World War Two - has been the most elusive foreign policy aim of his presidency.

Ukraine and its European allies are worried that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated Ukraine after Russian forces took 12-17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukraine per day in 2025.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that envoy Kirill Dmitriev had briefed Putin on the trip to Miami for contacts with Trump's envoys.

But Peskov refused to be drawn on Russia's reaction to the proposals, or the exact format of the documents, saying that the Kremlin was not going to communicate via the media.

"All the main parameters of the Russian side's position are well known to our colleagues from the United States," Peskov told reporters.

"Now we mean to formulate our position on the basis of the information that was received by the head of state and continue our contacts in the very near future through the existing channels that are currently working."

Putin has said in recent weeks that his conditions for peace are that Ukraine should cede the around 5,000 square km of Donbas that it still controls and that Kyiv should officially renounce its intention to join the NATO military alliance.

Asked about the format of the documents brought back to Moscow by Dmitriev from Miami, Peskov said it was not appropriate to speak to the media about it.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in remarks to reporters released by his office on Wednesday, said Ukrainian and U.S. delegations had inched closer to finalising a 20-point plan at the talks over the weekend in Miami.

But Zelenskiy said Ukraine and the United States had not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas that it still controls - or on the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is controlled by Russian forces.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:19:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XL7LQP2Y4ZKL3MC5EZVHP2SR2Q.jpg?auth=738ef2a259b044ee18a431aa9fae2e30a79ec283865c6accfd215e4f22135b22&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU says it strongly condemns U.S. visa ban on European individuals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-says-it-strongly-condemns-us-visa-ban-european-individuals-2025-12-24/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The European Commission strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose a visa ban on five European individuals, including former EU commissioner Thierry Breton , a Commission spokesperson said on Wednesday, adding that the EU had requested clarifications from the U.S. authorities.

The talks come two days after a special meeting in Kuala Lumpur of Southeast Asian foreign ministers convened to try to salvage a truce first brokered by ASEAN chair Malaysia and U.S. President Donald Trump after a previous round of clashes in July

Thai Defence Ministry spokesman Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri said Wednesday's meeting of the General Border Committee would last three days and could pave the way for an agreement.

The talks were held at a border checkpoint towards the southern end of their 817-km (508 mile) frontier.

"If the secretariat meeting goes smoothly and leads to an agreement, then there will be a meeting between the defense ministers of the two countries on December 27," Surasant told reporters.

Cambodian defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said the talks began at 4.30 pm local time (0930 GMT), led by generals from both sides.

The meeting is the most significant step since fighting re-erupted and follows separate, unsuccessful efforts by Malaysia, China and the United States to bring the two countries to the table.

Cambodia and Thailand have each accused the other of aggression and violations of an enhanced ceasefire reached in October in Malaysia in Trump's presence, during which they committed to demining and withdrawing troops and heavy weapons from areas over which sovereignty has been contested bitterly for decades .

In the run-up to Wednesday's talks, Thailand and Cambodia have continued clashing, with both sides fighting at multiple points since early December, stretching from forested regions near Laos to the coastal provinces of the Gulf of Thailand.

At least 21 civilians have been in killed in Cambodia since the fighting, and more than half a million people displaced, according to national authorities. In Thailand, at least 65 people have lost their lives, with over 150,000 evacuated from their homes.

Cambodia's defence ministry on Wednesday accused Thailand of using fighter jets to drop bombs in its border province of Banteay Meanchey, describing the actions as "brutal" and indiscriminate.

Thailand, on the other hand, said its neighbour continued to fire heavy weapons into civilian areas in Sa Kaeo province on Wednesday, prompting Thai troops to retaliate.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:19:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XOOIJDPVVRL75MRLXXKDF2F7H4.jpg?auth=3ad57bd835d11e2a0844a9f6bc6939329f86ec0e6bfb97091b0361bc88fc4cb7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine unveils 20-point peace proposal under discussion with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-unveils-20-point-peace-proposal-under-discussion-with-us-2025-12-24/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 24 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy outlined for the first time the main points of a draft 20-point framework peace proposal discussed by Ukraine and the United States, which he said could become the basis of future agreements to end war with Russia.

After weeks of talks to modify an earlier 28-point draft seen as supporting many of Russia's main demands, Zelenskiy said that most positions had been brought significantly closer . Ukraine and the United States still had not reached consensus on two main points: control of territory and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Zelenskiy said, calling for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump to resolve them.

Below are the points of the draft proposal as unveiled by Zelenskiy and shared by his office on Wednesday.

1. Ukraine’s sovereignty will be reaffirmed.

2. This point will envisage a full and unquestionable non-aggression agreement between Russia and Ukraine. It specifies that to sustain long-term peace, a monitoring mechanism will be established to oversee the line of contact through space-based unmanned monitoring, to ensure early notification of violations, and to resolve conflicts.

3. Ukraine will receive robust security guarantees.

4. Ukraine will maintain its armed forces at their present strength of 800,000 personnel. The earlier U.S. draft had called for Ukraine to reduce the size of its forces.

5. The United States, NATO, and European countries will provide Ukraine with security guarantees that mirror Article 5, the mutual-defence clause of NATO's founding treaty.

6. Russia will formalise a policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine in all necessary laws and all required documents on ratification, including ratification by an overwhelming majority vote in the State Duma.

7. Ukraine will become an EU member at a specifically defined date. Ukraine will also receive short-term preferential access to the European market.

8. Ukraine will receive a strong global development package, which will be defined in a separate agreement on investment and future prosperity.

9. Several funds will be established to address economic recovery, the reconstruction of damaged areas and regions, and humanitarian issues. The objective will be to mobilize $800 billion to help Ukraine fully realize its potential.

10. Ukraine will accelerate the process of concluding a free-trade agreement with the United States. Zelenskiy said the U.S. position was that if Washington were to grant free trade access to Ukraine, it aimed to offer similar terms to Russia.

11. Ukraine will confirm that it will remain a non-nuclear state, in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

12. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Zelenskiy said no agreement had yet been reached with the United States on the issue of Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, which is located near the front line in territory now controlled by Russian forces. Zelenskiy said the U.S. proposal was for the plant to be operated jointly by Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, each holding equal stakes in a joint enterprise, with the Americans acting as the chief managers. Kyiv's proposal was for the plant to be operated by a 50-50 joint enterprise involving only the United States and Ukraine, with Ukraine receiving half of the energy produced and the United States independently allocating the other half.

13. Ukraine and Russia commit to implementing educational programmes in schools and across society that promote understanding and tolerance toward different cultures and eliminate racism and prejudice. Ukraine will implement European Union rules on religious tolerance and the protection of minority languages.

14. Territory: Zelenskiy said that this was the most complex point, and as yet unresolved. Russia wants Ukraine to withdraw troops from territory Ukraine still controls in the eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv wants fighting to be halted at current battle lines. Washington has proposed demilitarised zones and a free economic zone in the part of the Donetsk region that Kyiv controls.

15. After reaching an agreement on future territorial arrangements, both Russia and Ukraine undertake not to alter these agreements by force.

16. Russia will not obstruct Ukraine from using the Dnipro River and the Black Sea for commercial purposes. A separate maritime agreement and an access agreement will be concluded, covering freedom of navigation and transport. The Kinburn Spit, along the Dnipro's outlet to the sea, will be demilitarized.

17. A humanitarian committee will be established to resolve outstanding issues:

a. All remaining prisoners of war will be exchanged on the principle of All for All.

b. All civilian detainees and hostages will be returned, including children.

c. Provisions will be made to address the suffering of victims from the conflict.

18. Ukraine must hold elections as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement.

19. This agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by a Peace Council, chaired by President Trump. Ukraine, Europe, NATO, Russia, and the United States will be part of this mechanism. Sanctions will apply in case of violations.

20. Once all parties agree to this agreement, a full ceasefire will take effect immediately.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:19:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VASJ5SDZMBID7PAKTMEHP7QYFA.jpg?auth=0fd2fce4ad7b422504504338e1d9a6802b426d41afed5f9fa4450b7401f01d3b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey, Hamas discuss Gaza ceasefire deal's second phase, Turkish source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-hamas-discuss-gaza-ceasefire-deals-second-phase-turkish-source-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday met with Hamas political bureau officials in Ankara to discuss the ceasefire in Gaza and advancing the agreement to its second phase, a Turkish Foreign Ministry source said.

As early as November the avenues are garlanded with lights and the streets are packed with holiday shoppers.

Many traiteurs (delicatessens) and butchers have been busy for weeks taking orders for delicacies that will soon be set out on dinner tables, with people splurging on expensive treats for the end-of-year holidays.

Historically, Christmas Eve dinner was the big, traditional meal served after a nighttime church service that worshippers sat through on a nearly empty stomach. Since the Middle Ages, midnight Mass has been preceded by a meagre meal; it was customary to eat only a little bread, fish or vegetable broth and drink a glass of water.

Though fewer people now attend midnight Mass, the tradition of a big Christmas Eve and New Year’s meal has survived.

Throughout the holiday season, supermarket shelves are stacked to the ceiling with cans and jars of foie gras , a French specialty of fattened duck or goose liver, with pâté often served as a starter on warm toast alongside some jam – or chutney – often made from onion or fig.

Though many have stopped eating foie gras because of the way the birds’ livers are artificially fattened through force-feeding (known as gavage), it remains one of the most popular food items for a Christmas meal and France remains its largest producer by far.

Literally translated as “fat liver”, foie gras originated in ancient Egypt some 4,500 years ago before it spread throughout the Mediterranean and was adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans. In the Middle Ages, the tradition of gavage was continued by the Jewish population, since goose meat was viewed as a good source of nutrition and its cooking fat conformed to religious dietary restrictions.

The popularity of foie gras grew during the Renaissance, when it became associated with the kings of France. The term “ foyes gras ” was coined during the reign of Louis XIV and it was served at royal banquets under Louis XV, but it was Louis XVI who declared it the “dish of kings".

Foie gras is also often served pan roasted, sliced over a cut of meat or as a sauce. It is produced in winter, and its high price makes it a luxurious holiday product for year-end festivities.

For those who do not eat foie gras , other common starters at a French Christmas or New Year’s dinner are smoked salmon, scallops ( coquilles Saint-Jacques ), shrimp or oysters.

The French are among the largest consumers of oysters in the world, eating around 85,000 tonnes each year, a large portion of which are consumed at the Christmas dinner table.

Oysters are easy to find in France, with its long coastline, and are relatively inexpensive for a holiday dish. They are most often served fresh on shaved ice with a red wine and shallot vinaigrette (sometimes known as a mignonette ) or simply a wedge of lemon.

It is a French custom to eat oysters only during months that have an "r" in their names – September through April. This is not only because they taste best during this period but due to habit – long before refrigerated transportation methods were invented, oysters could only be shipped inland from the sea during the cold winter months if they were to stay fresh and not spoil before being served.

Salmon, lobster, crayfish and other seafood are also traditionally eaten in winter for the same reason. But unlike oysters, these are relatively expensive.

Much like in the United States or Great Britain, a traditional staple of a French Christmas dinner is stuffed poultry.

Before the turkey arrived in Europe from the Americas in the 17th century, the French ate stuffed goose. But the turkey has mostly replaced the goose as the holiday bird of choice because it is less expensive, yet larger and meatier than a plain old chicken.

The turkey’s main advantage is its size (one can weigh up to 18 kilogrammes) for big family feasts.

A smaller but succulent fowl that is very popular in France during the holidays is the capon ( chapon in French), a cockerel that was neutered to render its meat fattier and usually weighing 3-4 kilogrammes, or else the even smaller guinea fowl ( pintade ).

Whatever bird is chosen, it is generally roasted and served with a special Christmas stuffing that traditionally includes chestnuts and mushrooms.

Other holiday main dishes in France include roasted meats, such as lamb or beef, and also game such as doe, wild boar, venison or pheasant, which are not usually eaten year-round by French people who are not hunters.

No Christmas meal in France is complete without a bûche de Noël , otherwise known as the Yule log cake.

The bûche is an elaborate creation made of a rolled sponge cake filled with cream – or ice cream – and frosted to look like tree bark on a log.

It is a reminder of an earlier tradition, dating back to the Iron Age, when people in Europe would gather to welcome the winter solstice on December 21, the longest night of the year. Families would burn large logs, usually from fruit trees, anointed with wine and salt and decorated with pine cones, holly or ivy. The log kept the house warm, and its ashes were said to have medicinal benefits and to guard against evil.

Other Christmas desserts in France include gingerbread, served in the form of a spiced loaf cake or soft biscuit called pain d’épices, as well as chocolate. Traditionally, well-behaved children were given chocolate and other sweets on December 6, the day of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children.

Gradually, the tradition of Saint Nicholas disappeared in most French regions except for the east, and the ritual giving of chocolate and pain d’épices was incorporated into Christmas.

While the traditional festive feasts are normally enjoyed at home, there are other treats to enjoy outside at Christmas markets. Chief among them is mulled wine, simply known as vin chaud or "hot wine".

Vin chaud is popular across Europe and was historically the only alcoholic drink served at the Christmas markets in France's eastern Alsace region. It is made with red or white wine gently heated with sugar and spices including cinnamon, cloves and star anise. A non-alcoholic version made with apple juice is also popular.

As the best way to see Christmas decorations that light up French towns and cities is after dark when temperatures drop, a piping hot mug of vin chaud is a great way to stay warm while enjoying the festive atmosphere.

His office said in a statement that Hamas must fully uphold the October agreement , noting that it envisaged the militant group being removed from power in Gaza as well as demilitarisation and deradicalisation of the territory.

"Israel will respond accordingly," the statement added.

The Israeli military earlier said that an explosive device had detonated against a military vehicle in the southern Rafah area of Gaza and that one officer had been lightly injured.

Violence has subsided but not stopped since the Gaza truce took effect on October 10, and the sides have regularly accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Gaza's health ministry says Israel has killed more than 400 people in the territory since the ceasefire went into effect.

A 20-point plan issued by U.S. President Donald Trump in September calls for an initial truce followed by steps towards a wider peace. It ultimately calls for Hamas to disarm and have no governing role in Gaza and for Israel to pull out of the territory, which remains in ruins after two years of war.

The sides have not fully agreed to everything in it. Hamas has said it will only hand over its arms if a Palestinian state is established.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HCKBAHWSPFJDRCBI6FMO4U2JTE.jpg?auth=919ab1fb25fcadb82580462e38cb69cc04f8259dae05f12e73e169699964a00f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US actions will not stop EU from moderating online hate and disinformation, commissioner says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251224-us-actions-will-not-stop-eu-moderating-online-hate-disinformation-commissioner-says</link><description>The European Union 's commissioner in charge of the bloc's single market said Wednesday that US sanctions won't stop him from doing his work after the Trump administration placed a visa ban on his predecessor for trying to regulate big tech companies.

"My predecessor @ThierryBreton acted in the interest of the European general good, faithful to the mandate given by the voters in 2019," Stéphane Séjourné , European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, said on X.

"No sanction will silence the sovereignty of the European peoples. Total solidarity with him and all affected Europeans," he said.

Macron also voiced his support for Breton in a post on X.

"I have just spoken with @ThierryBreton and thanked him for his significant contributions in the service of Europe. We will stand firm against pressure and will protect Europeans.

"We will not give up, and ‌we will protect Europe's independence ‍and the freedom of Europeans," he wrote on the social media platform.

The US State Department said Tuesday it would deny visas to Breton and four activists, accusing them of seeking to "coerce" American social media platforms into censoring viewpoints they oppose.

The President of the European Commission , Ursula von der Leyen , said the EU will keep ⁠protecting freedom of speech following the strong reaction from the French government.

"Freedom of speech ​is the foundation of our strong and vibrant ‌European democracy. We are ‍proud of it. We will protect it," she said on X.

Breton, a Frenchman, was described by the US State Department as the "mastermind" of the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation and other standards on major social media platforms operating in Europe.

Breton, who left the European Commission in 2024, on X slammed the ban as a "witch hunt," comparing the situation to the US McCarthy era when officials were chased out of government for alleged ties to communism.

The DSA has become a rallying point for US conservatives who see it as a weapon of censorship against right-wing thought in Europe and beyond, an accusation the EU furiously denies.

"The Digital Services Act was democratically adopted in Europe. It has absolutely no extraterritorial reach and in no way affects the United States," French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said on X.

The Trump administration in recent days has ordered more than two dozen career diplomats serving across Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America back to Washington to ensure U.S. missions abroad reflect its "America First" priorities.

Calling the abrupt mass recalls an "unprecedented move" that no other administration has done since Congress established the modern Foreign Service a century ago, 10 Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said there was no plan to replace them with qualified candidates.

The removals bring the number of empty U.S. ambassadorial posts to well over 100, about half of all such posts worldwide, the senators said in their letter addressed to Trump and seen by Reuters. The senators said 80 posts had been vacant before the decision.

State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the letter. A senior department official on Monday described the mass recall as "a standard process in any administration."

"As the over 100 U.S. embassies lacking senior leadership await a new U.S. ambassador, China, Russia and others will maintain regular communications with the foreign leaders that we will have effectively abandoned, allowing our adversaries to expand their reach and influence to limit, and even harm, U.S. interests," Democrats said in their letter.

The senators, who included Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Jeanne Shaheen, Chris Murphy and others, provided examples of how Washington would lack top-level U.S. presence in crucial locations as Beijing and Moscow make inroads.

In regions from the Indo-Pacific to Africa and the Balkans as well as Latin America, Washington would be on the back foot countering China's expanding economic reach, the senators said.

"These ambassadors have demonstrated their commitment to faithfully execute the policies of administrations of both parties for decades," the senators said. "We urge you to reverse this decision immediately before more damage is done to America’s standing in the world."

Political appointees leave their posts when a new administration takes office but career diplomats, while serving at the pleasure of the president, are often considered bipartisan and typically serve three to four years in their overseas posts regardless of a change in government.

But Trump has long been suspicious of the bureaucracy and has repeatedly pledged to "clean out the deep state" by firing bureaucrats whom he deems disloyal and placing loyalists in senior roles.

In February, Trump ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the U.S. foreign service to ensure that the Republican president's foreign policy is "faithfully" implemented.

In July, the Trump administration fired more than 1,300 State Department diplomats and civil servants as Washington grappled with multiple crises on the world stage: Russia's war in Ukraine, the almost two-year-long Gaza conflict, and the Middle East on edge due to high tension between Israel and Iran.

The Department's total workforce reduction in the U.S. totaled roughly 3,000 after deferred resignations and early retirements, accounting for more than 11% of its total foreign and civil service officers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:22:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q7DQQFQRUNKTPA2BBT3PNXX6LQ.jpg?auth=ca9c7c733eceab8a2bbf0cbc96aede3089de28d4424bc2b5be36a4676df5ca3a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK government says it backs free speech after US visa bans</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-government-says-it-backs-free-speech-after-us-visa-bans-2025-12-24/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Britain is committed to upholding the right to free speech, a government spokesperson said on Wednesday in response to a decision by the United States to impose visa bans on anti-disinformation campaigners.

The Falcon 50 aircraft requested an emergency landing because of electrical failure minutes after it took off from the Turkish capital Ankara on Tuesday, but contact was lost, Turkish officials said. The plane was returning to Tripoli .

The wreckage was located by Turkish security personnel in the Haymana district near Ankara.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the crash site that the plane's voice recorder and the flight data recorder (black box) had been recovered.

"The examination and evaluation processes of these devices have been initiated," he said.

Turkey's Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said later on X: "The analysis of the voice recorder and flight data recorder to determine the cause of the aircraft's crash will be carried out in a neutral country."

The findings would be shared "with our nation and the entire world with full transparency", he added.

Lieutenant General Mohammed al-Haddad and four other aides were returning to Tripoli after holding talks in Ankara with Turkish military officials. There were eight people aboard the plane including three crew members.

Libya's Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah expressed "deep sadness and great sorrow" over the death of the army chief.

Yerlikaya said the bodies were still at the crash site that covers approximately three square kilometres (one square mile), adding that a 22-member Libyan delegation including five relatives of the deceased had arrived in Ankara.

"We pray for God's mercy upon those who lost their lives in this tragic accident and extend our condolences to their families," he added.

A total of 408 personnel from the government's disaster agency AFAD, police and health services are at the scene, the minister said, while the real-time imagery from the area is being relayed by drones.

Turkish officials said the Ankara prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into the incident.

Tolga Tuzun Inan of Istanbul-based Bahcesehir University said a single electrical failure would not leave an aircraft completely dark.

"When multiple triggering factors combine with meteorological conditions, such a situation may occur," he told the private NTV broadcaster.

He said data from the black box would reveal what happened, but cautioned that the analysis process could take several months.

Haddad had been the army's chief of general staff since August 2020 and was appointed by then-prime minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences over the loss of lives during a phone call with Prime Minister Dbeibah, his office said.

Libya is split between a UN-recognised government in Tripoli, led by Dbeibah, and commander Khalifa Haftar 's administration in the east.

The North African country has been divided since a NATO-backed revolt toppled and killed longtime leader Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.

Turkey has close ties with the UN-backed government in Tripoli, to which it provides economic and military support.

But Ankara has recently also reached out to the rival administration in the east, with the head of Turkey's intelligence agency, Ibrahim Kalin, meeting with Haftar in Benghazi in August.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:25:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/885f13c4-e0d6-11f0-8e55-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25358296781818.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's Macron says he discussed Ukraine with NATO head Rutte</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-macron-says-he-discussed-ukraine-with-nato-head-rutte-2025-12-24/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - France's President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday he had spoken with NATO chief Mark Rutte to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the work undertaken by the Coalition of the Willing.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted calls to establish a state commission to investigate Israel's failures in the run-up to its deadliest day and has taken no responsibility for the attack that sparked the two-year Gaza war .

His ruling coalition voted on Wednesday to advance a bill which grants parliament members the authority to pick panel members for an inquiry and gives Netanyahu's cabinet the power to set its mandate.

Critics say the move circumvents Israel's 1968 Commissions of Inquiry Law, under which the president of the Supreme Court appoints an independent panel to investigate major state failures such as those which preceded the 1973 Yom Kippur war .

Survivors and relatives of those hurt in the Hamas attack have launched a campaign against the proposed probe, saying only a state commission can bring those accountable to justice.

"This is a day of disaster for us all," said Eyal Eshel, who lost his daughter when Hamas militants overran the army base where she served. "Justice must be done and justice will be done," he said at the Knesset, before the vote.

Surveys have shown wide public support for the establishment of a state commission into the country's biggest security lapse in decades.

Netanyahu said on Monday that a panel appointed in line with the new bill, by elected officials from both the opposition and the coalition, would be independent and win broad public trust.

But Israel's opposition has already said it will not cooperate with what it describes as an attempt by Netanyahu's coalition to cover up the truth rather than reveal it, arguing that the investigation would ultimately be controlled by Netanyahu and his coalition.

The new bill says that if the politicians fail to agree on the panel, its make-up will be decided by the head of parliament, who is allied with Netanyahu and is a member of his Likud party.

Jon Polin, whose son Hersh Goldberg-Polin was taken hostage and found slain by his captors with five other hostages in a Hamas tunnel in August 2024, said only a trusted commission could restore security and unite a nation still traumatized.

"I support a state commission, not to see anyone punished and not because it will bring back my only son, no. I support a state commission so that nothing like what happened to my son, can ever happen to your son, or your daughter, or your parents," Polin said on Sunday at a news conference with other families.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin was among dozens of hostages taken in the 2023 attack from the site of the Nova music festival.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:26:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QRJUDNE3CFJYTEYUFBMK7YTZKY.jpg?auth=208567b24f702d3a500b1ad6847eee898fe9e72daa61b19976acf4dae90f3307&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Majority of Russians expect Ukraine war to end in 2026, state pollster says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/majority-russians-expect-ukraine-war-end-2026-state-pollster-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 24 (Reuters) - A majority of Russians expect the war in Ukraine to end in 2026, state pollster VTsIOM said on Wednesday, in a sign that the Kremlin could be testing public reaction to a possible peace settlement as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict intensify.

During the pollster's year-end presentation, VTsIOM Deputy Head Mikhail Mamonov said 70% of the 1,600 respondents saw 2026 as a more "successful" year for Russia than this year, while for 55% that hope was linked to a possible end to what Russia calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine.

"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president," Mamonov said at the presentation.

In its previous year-end polls, VTsIOM emphasised the consolidation of Russian society around President Vladimir Putin and his military goals in Ukraine but gave no figures for the share of the population expecting the war to end.

The Ukraine war, which started in February 2022, is nearing its fifth year, but the real level of Russian public fatigue with the conflict is difficult to measure due to strict state controls on dissent.

Mamonov cited the Russian army's ongoing offensive in Ukraine, U.S. reluctance to finance Ukraine and the European Union's inability to fully replace the United States financially and militarily as the main factors behind the prospects for an eventual peace agreement.

After the end of military hostilities, he added, the reintegration of veterans of the "special military operation" into society and the reconstruction of Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine, as well as Russian border regions, are seen as the main priorities.

Some two thirds of Russians support peace talks, the highest share since the start of the war, according to independent pollster Levada, which has been branded a "foreign agent" under Russian law during the conflict.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Putin has been briefed about his officials' contacts with President Donald Trump's envoys on U.S. proposals for a possible Ukrainian peace deal and that Moscow would now formulate its position.

Putin has said in recent weeks that his conditions for peace are that Ukraine should cede the roughly 5,000 square km of Donbas that it still controls and that Kyiv should officially renounce its intention to join the NATO military alliance.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on December 22 that negotiations conducted with the United States and European nations aimed at ending the war with Russia were " very close to a real result".

On Wednesday, Zelenskiy called for a meeting with Trump to hammer out the most sensitive issues in a future peace deal , including control of territory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:27:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z6NCRVZ3MBNUZFOOX4LKC37PUI.jpg?auth=2d15cc2e61e9c2fcf982cbf52a1a2a5fa5a0b1b99d409ba3aafac5e2705f86f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In Peru, record 34 candidates are presidential hopefuls amid political distrust</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-record-34-candidates-are-presidential-hopefuls-amid-political-distrust-2025-12-24/</link><description>LIMA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - At least 34 candidates have registered to compete in Peru's 2026 presidential election, the electoral office said on Wednesday, a record number for a country that has been defined by political volatility in recent years, with many former leaders imprisoned or ousted.

The candidates for the April 12 election include a comedian, a former soccer player, and Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of late former president Alberto Fujimori, who is planning to run for the fourth time.

In the last presidential election in 2021, 18 candidates participated.

The electoral office will publish the final list of candidates on March 14, said its head Roberto Burneo at a press conference. Any Peruvian can file an objection against a candidate and claim they do not meet legal requirements.

Presidential terms in Peru have often been cut short amid impeachments, resignations or accusations of corruption. Dina Boluarte's midnight removal last October made her the sixth consecutive president in Peru to fail to complete a full term.

The last president to finish a term was Ollanta Humala, who served from 2011 to 2016, but received a 15-year prison sentence for money laundering earlier this year.

The list of registered candidates includes the former right-wing mayor of Lima, Rafael López Aliaga, known as "Porky" for his resemblance to a famous cartoon character.

Conservative Fujimori will try again after attempts in 2011, 2016 and 2021, when she was defeated by leftist Pedro Castillo, who was impeached and arrested in late 2022.

Other candidates include Vladimir Cerrón, a fugitive from justice and leader of the Marxist party Peru Libre that brought Castillo to the presidency, Carlos Álvarez, a popular comedian and impersonator of former presidents, George Forsyth, a former soccer goalkeeper, and Mario Vizcarra, brother of jailed former president Martín Vizcarra.

With distrust high in traditional parties and politicians, an Ipsos Peru poll released last Sunday indicated that almost half of Peruvians (48%) do not know who to vote for, will cancel their ballot or do not have a favorite candidate.

As such, it is likely there will be no outright winner in the election's first round and that it will go to a run-off on June 7, according to analysts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:50:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FRWEP3OSZRLETLOIQZKYEPPO7Y.jpg?auth=b08521fc3e04c3c8017b5e919b34a943b10e3244893e05c89ffa7d6206ca2b45&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Algerian parliament brands French colonisation a crime, demands apology and reparations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251224-algerian-parliament-brands-french-colonisation-state-crime-demands-apology-reparations</link><description>Algeria 's parliament unanimously approved on Wednesday a law declaring France 's colonisation of the country a "state crime" and demanding an apology and reparations.

Standing in the chamber, lawmakers wearing scarves in the colours of the national flag chanted, "Long live Algeria" as they applauded the passage of the bill, which states that France holds "legal responsibility for its colonial past in Algeria and the tragedies it caused".

The vote comes as the two countries are embroiled in a major diplomatic crisis , and while analysts say the move is largely symbolic it is still politically significant.

Parliament speaker Brahim Boughali told the APS state news agency before the vote that it would send "a clear message, both internally and externally, that Algeria's national memory is neither erasable nor negotiable".

The legislation lists the "crimes of French colonisation", including nuclear tests, extrajudicial killings, "physical and psychological torture" and the "systematic plundering of resources".

It states that "full and fair compensation for all material and moral damages caused by French colonisation is an inalienable right of the Algerian state and people".

France's rule over Algeria from 1830 until 1962 remains a sore spot in relations between the two countries. The period was marked by mass killings and large-scale deportations , all the way up to the bloody war of independence from 1954-1962.

Algeria says the war killed 1.5 million people while French historians put the death toll lower, at 500,000 in total, some 400,000 of them Algerian.

French President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged the colonisation of Algeria as a " crime against humanity " but has stopped short of offering an apology.

Asked last week about the vote, French foreign ministry spokesman Pascal Confavreux said he would not comment on "political debates taking place in foreign countries".

Hosni Kitouni, a researcher in colonial history at the University of Exeter in the UK, said that "legally, this law has no international scope and therefore is not binding for France".

But "its political and symbolic significance is important: It marks a rupture in the relationship with France in terms of memory," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 17:19:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ab50486-e097-11f0-9917-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23333627271030.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors drop probe into banking blog</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/swiss-prosecutors-drop-probe-into-banking-blog-2025-12-24/</link><description>ZURICH, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Zurich have ended an investigation into a leading Swiss banking blog whose offices were raided this summer on suspicion it had breached banking secrecy laws.

Police had searched the offices and home of the founder of Zurich-based blog Inside Paradeplatz, confiscating a laptop, a mobile phone and documents in a probe over reporting published in 2016 about a former boss of bank Raiffeisen Switzerland.

Based on later findings by a Zurich court that reasonable suspicion against the founder was not met, and that protection of journalistic sources prohibited use of the evidence gathered, prosecutors for the canton of Zurich decided to drop the probe.

In a statement, prosecutors said the proceedings were discontinued on December 8 after a further review, but noted that the order was not yet legally binding.

There was no immediate word on casualties or official comment.

The blast occurred in a city that has been at the heart of an Islamist insurgency waged by Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) for nearly two decades which has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions across the northeast.

No group has claimed responsibility, but militants have previously targeted mosques and crowded places in Maiduguri in suicide bombings and improvised explosive device attacks.

Boko Haram launched its uprising in Borno state in 2009, seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate. Despite military offensives and regional cooperation, sporadic attacks continue to threaten civilians in the northeast.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why all the running?

Why the trend? Is it a mere post-pandemic fad, or the sign of something deeper?

We think of running as a solitary pursuit, but it's increasingly a social activity. Running clubs are particularly in vogue among the young, who seek a release from a life that's increasingly happening in front of a screen.

Technology is also seeping into the experience, be it with equipment, monitors or apps , to the point that some bemoan the gamification of running.

So what's running about: a pursuit or an escape? Goals to achieve or the experience of the journey?

"We, States of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom condemn the approval by the Israeli security cabinet of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank," said a joint statement released by the French foreign ministry.

"We recall our clear opposition to any form of annexation and to the expansion of settlement policies," it added.

On Sunday, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the authorities had greenlit the settlements, saying the move was aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.

In their statement, the countries stressed such unilateral actions "violate international law" and risk undermining a fragile ceasefire in Gaza as mediators push for the implementation of the second phase of the truce.

The countries urged Israel "to reverse this decision, as well as the expansion of settlements".

They also reaffirmed their "unwavering commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the two-state solution... where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side-by-side in peace and security".

Israel has occupied the West Bank following a war in 1967.

Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents.

President Donald Trump's administration began releasing files related to criminal investigations of Epstein, the late American financier who was friends with Trump in the 1990s, to comply with a law passed by Congress last month.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress passed the law over Trump's objections, requiring that all documents be released by December 19 while allowing partial redactions to protect victims.

Releases so far have contained extensive redactions, angering some Republicans and doing little to defuse a scandal threatening the party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

In a message shared on social media on Wednesday, the Justice Department said more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been uncovered by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, without elaborating on when or how the documents were found.

"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible," the department said. "Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 20:23:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ILFJKU4RBI2JEN73NHPR7JWBE.jpg?auth=9870531b243b02eb90743d6cbd5cb89d9c1eb3be566a5196ab8c69edad16adf1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed in blast at mosque in northeast Nigeria</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251224-several-killed-in-blast-at-mosque-in-northeast-nigeria</link><description>An explosion ripped through a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri and killed at least seven worshippers Wednesday, witnesses and security sources told AFP.

No armed groups immediately claimed responsibility for what anti-jihadist militia leader Babakura Kolo said was a suspected bombing.

Maiduguri is the capital of Borno state, home to a years-long insurgency by jihadist groups Boko Haram and an offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, though the city itself has not seen a major attack in years.

The bomb went off inside a crowded mosque in the city's Gamboru market, as Muslim faithful gathered for evening prayers around 6:00 pm (1700 GMT), according to witnesses.

One of the leaders of the mosque, Malam Abuna Yusuf, put the toll at eight dead, though officials have not yet released a casualty count.

"We can confirm there has been an explosion," police spokesman Nahum Daso told AFP, adding that an explosive ordnance disposal team was already on-site.

Kolo said that seven were killed.

He said it was suspected that the bomb was placed inside the mosque and exploded midway through prayers, while some witnesses described a suicide bombing .

It was not immediately clear how many people were injured, though witness Isa Musa Yusha'u told AFP: "I saw many victims being taken away for medical treatment."

Videos taken in the aftermath and seen by AFP showed a person covered in blood writhing on the ground, and what appeared to be bodies covered by a sheet.

A security alert sent by an international NGO to its staff in Maiduguri, seen by AFP, advised its workers to stay away from the Gamboru market area.

Nigeria has been battling a jihadist insurgency since 2009 in a conflict that has killed at least 40,000 and displaced around two million from their homes in the northeast, according to the UN .

Though the violence has waned since its peak a decade ago, it has spilt into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon .

And concerns are growing about a resurgence of violence in parts of the northeast, where insurgent groups remain capable of mounting deadly attacks despite years of sustained military operations.

Maiduguri itself – once the scene of nightly gun battles and bombings -- has been calm in recent years, with the last major attack recorded in 2021.

But reminders of the conflict are never far off in the state capital, where major military operations are headquartered.

Military pick-ups lumber through town daily, their beds filled with soldiers whose helmets shield them from the hot afternoon sun.

Evening checkpoints are still in effect, even as markets that once closed in the early afternoon throng into the night.

Meanwhile, in the countryside, the insurgency continues to rage, with analysts warning of an uptick in jihadist violence this year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 20:25:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/edad9848-e0fb-11f0-aa07-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25077805366921.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump-backed Asfura wins Honduras presidency after weeks of delays in disputed election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-backed-asfura-wins-honduras-presidency-after-weeks-delays-disputed-2025-12-24/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Dec 24 - Nasry Asfura, the conservative National Party candidate backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, has won Honduras' presidential election, the electoral body said on Wednesday as it finally declared a victor of the November 30 presidential election after weeks of delays, technical problems, and allegations of fraud.

The electoral authority, known as the CNE, said Asfura had won 40.3% of the vote, edging out center-right Liberal Party candidate Salvador Nasralla who garnered 39.5%. Results were so tight and the ballot processing system so chaotic that around 15% of the tally sheets comprising hundreds of thousands of ballots had to be counted by hand to determine the winner.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 21:20:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NTEZFQ35AFIJFIPMWSYIL2Q7TE.jpg?auth=0a0c3957f3fd9919e78e4f9516d0400cb9b73d61760eb4eeb38babc709edeaa0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over a million more documents linked to Jeffrey Epstein discovered, DOJ says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251224-over-a-million-more-documents-linked-to-jeffrey-epstein-discovered-doj-says</link><description>The US Department of Justice said Wednesday that more than a million more documents potentially related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have been discovered and are being reviewed for release.

The DOJ began releasing records last week from the investigation into Epstein, a wealthy financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act passed nearly unanimously by Congress last month and signed into law by President Donald Trump mandated the release of all of the Epstein files by December 19.

The Justice Department failed to meet that deadline, however, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche blaming the delay on the need to painstakingly redact the identities of Epstein's victims from the files.

The DOJ said Wednesday it would need a "few more weeks" to sort and redact the new material.

It said the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI had "uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case."

"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible," the DOJ said on X.

Electoral authorities declared Asfura the victor of the November 30 presidential election after weeks of delays, technical problems and allegations of fraud.

Trump threw his support behind Asfura, a 67-year-old politician and businessman who is the former mayor of the capital Tegucigalpa, writing in a Truth Social post before the election that he was the "only real friend of Freedom in Honduras" and urging people to vote for him.

Trump also threatened to cut off U.S. financial support to Honduras if Asfura did not win. Despite casting himself as a foe of illegal drugs, Trump also pardoned former President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was from Asfura's National Party and had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. after his conviction on drug trafficking and firearms charges.

"The United States urges all parties to respect the confirmed results so that Honduran authorities may swiftly ensure a peaceful transition of authority to President-Elect Nasry Asfura," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

"We look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security cooperation, end illegal immigration to the United States, and strengthen the economic ties between our two countries."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:20:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2W4BRUNMIRN7JMP2T2CVU6MYQ4.jpg?auth=39bd47d32fae6ef33d1494402e83eb82d191538e4c6c3c4b0ef4d1778e89c777&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, Canada, Germany and others condemn Israel's West Bank settlement plan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/uk-canada-germany-others-condemn-israels-west-bank-settlement-plan-2025-12-24/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Countries including Britain, Canada, Germany and others on Wednesday condemned the Israeli security cabinet's approval of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank , saying they violated international law and risked fuelling instability.

"We call on Israel to reverse this decision, as well as the expansion of settlements," said a joint statement released by Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain.

"We recall that such unilateral actions, as part of a wider intensification of the settlement policies in the West Bank, not only violate international law but also risk fuelling instability," the statement said.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rejected the statement by foreign countries in an X post on Wednesday, saying the decision aimed to help address security threats faced by Israel.

"Foreign governments will not restrict the right of Jews to live in the Land of Israel, and any such call is morally wrong and discriminatory against Jews," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KXUYSUG7LVJZVMMI5RYKPSUWSE.jpg?auth=608166132b0197fc8804149d94583381dfe955645c18ac912fdff54acd778bf9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE agents involved in Maryland shooting, injuring two</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-agents-involved-maryland-shooting-injuring-two-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Federal immigration agents were involved in a shooting on Wednesday that left one person shot and wounded and another with injuries, authorities said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees federal immigration officers, said in a statement that ICE agents were carrying out an operation to target two men in the U.S. illegally in Glen Burnie, Maryland, just south of Baltimore.

When the agents approached a van carrying the two men, the driver drove the van into agents' vehicles, and then drove the van directly at ICE officers in an attempt to run them over, DHS said.

The agents then "defensively fired their service weapons, striking the driver," DHS wrote. The van then wrecked between two buildings and injured the passenger. Both men were taken to a hospital.

ABC News, citing the Anne Arundel County Police Department, reported the man who was shot was in stable condition, and the other man did not suffer serious injury.

The Anne Arundel County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maryland Governor Wes Moore, a Democrat, wrote on social media he was "aware of the ICE-involved shooting that occurred earlier today" and his office was working with local officials to learn more and provide support.

Federal immigration officers have been involved in several confrontations with both the subjects of their raids and people witnessing and objecting to their tactics as they work to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation plan.

ICE agents in September shot and killed a man who they said had tried to run them over with a car, though security and body camera footage raised doubts about the situation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo, on Christmas Eve, says denying help to poor is rejecting God</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-christmas-eve-says-denying-help-poor-is-rejecting-god-2025-12-24/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Pope Leo said in a Christmas Eve sermon on Wednesday that the story of Jesus being born in a stable because there was no room at an inn should remind Christians that refusing to help the poor and strangers today is tantamount to rejecting God himself.

Leo, who has made care for immigrants and the poor key themes of his early papacy, said Jesus' birth showed God's presence in every person as the pontiff led the world's 1.4 billion Catholics into Christmas at a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.

"On earth, there is no room for God if there is no room for the human person. To refuse one is to refuse the other," said the pope during the solemn service, attended by about 6,000 inside the basilica.

Leo, the first U.S.-born pope, is celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world's cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis .

The pope, who has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump 's divisive immigrant crackdown, quoted a line from the late Pope Benedict XVI lamenting that the world does not care for children, the poor or foreigners.

"While a distorted economy leads us to treat human beings as mere merchandise, God becomes like us, revealing the infinite dignity of every person," said Leo.

"Where there is room for the human person, there is room for God," he said. "Even a stable can become more sacred than a temple."

Outside the basilica, about 5,000 people watched the service on screens from St. Peter's Square, holding umbrellas and wearing ponchos under a hard rain in Rome.

Leo, 70, came outside to greet them before the start of the Mass. "I admire and respect and thank you for your courage and your wanting to be here this evening," he said, "even in this weather."

On Thursday, the pope will celebrate a Christmas Day Mass and deliver a twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message and blessing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OUEQZTNAUFIN3OPKG7BRQ7CWYQ.jpg?auth=d809ba2fc8531377c6bc4712266a2245b8919b26ee9c13102c5cb106bea5076e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Atmospheric river drenches Los Angeles, triggers widespread flooding</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/atmospheric-river-drenches-los-angeles-triggers-widespread-flooding-2025-12-24/</link><description>LOS ANGELES, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Torrential rains drenched Southern California on Wednesday, unleashing widespread flash flooding as authorities urged motorists to stay off roads and residents living downslope of wildfire-scarred foothills and canyons to evacuate.

Downpours measuring an inch (2.54 cm) or more of rain an hour in some areas were spawned by the region's latest atmospheric river storm, a vast airborne current of dense moisture siphoned from the Pacific and swept inland over the greater Los Angeles area.

The Christmas Eve storm was expected to persist into Friday, posing unsafe driving conditions during what would normally be a busy holiday travel period, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.

"Life-threatening" storm conditions were expected to persist through Christmas Day over Southern California, "where widespread flash flooding is underway," the weather service said.

A flash-flood warning was posted across much of Los Angeles County until 6 p.m. PST, urging motorists: "Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area, subject to flooding or under an evacuation order."

Los Angeles city officials urged residents to heed evacuation orders issued for about 130 homes considered especially vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows in areas where last year's wildfires ravaged the community of Pacific Palisades.

Wednesday's heavy rainfall was accompanied by gusty winds that forecasters said were likely to topple trees and power lines. In upper elevations of the Sierra mountains, the storm was expected to dump heavy snow.

NWS meteorologist Ariel Cohen said 4 to 8 inches of rain had fallen in some foothill areas by 9 a.m. PST, and the Los Angeles City News Service reported numerous rockslides in the mountains. Forecasts called for more than a foot (30.48 cm) of rain falling over some lower-terrain mountain areas by week's end.

Forecasters even issued a rare tornado warning for a small portion of east-central Los Angeles County due to heavy thunderstorm activity over the community of Alhambra.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YYZQMU5PURIE5I6CH2HGH4MIBA.jpg?auth=2044f01af404750e8d34b7ad8632b3acf956a42a53ea14fbd804062c8912db94&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four bodies found believed to be from one Liechtenstein family</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/four-bodies-found-believed-be-one-liechtenstein-family-2025-12-24/</link><description>ZURICH, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Police on Wednesday discovered the bodies of two men and two women believed to belong to a single family from Liechtenstein, authorities in the tiny Alpine principality said.

Local police said at around 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT), the body of a 41-year-old man from Liechtenstein was found on the Swiss side of the bank of the Rhine next to Liechtenstein's capital Vaduz. The cause of death was unclear, Swiss police said.

Subsequent investigations led police to an apartment in Vaduz where they discovered the bodies of a 73-year-old man and two women, aged 68 and 45.

According to initial findings, the three were the parents and sister of the 41-year-old man, Liechtenstein police said in a statement. What caused their deaths is still being determined, a spokesperson for Liechtenstein police said.

The state police's criminal investigation department is investigating the deaths with a large deployment of officers.

"The investigation is proceeding in all directions," the police statement said. "There is no danger to the public."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:44:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin sent a message to North Korea's Kim to celebrate New Year's Day, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/russias-putin-sent-message-north-koreas-kim-celebrate-new-years-day-kcna-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message on December 18 to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to celebrate New Year's Day, North Korean state media KCNA reported on Thursday.

With the exception of votes in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland and the breakaway region of Somaliland, Somalia last held direct elections in 1969, months before military general, Mohamed Siad Barre, took power in a coup.

After years of civil war that followed Barre's fall in 1991, indirect elections were introduced in 2004. The idea was to promote consensus among rival clans in the face of an Islamist insurgency , although some Somalis say politicians prefer indirect elections because they create opportunities for corruption.

Under the system, clan representatives elect lawmakers, who then choose the president. The president, in turn, has been responsible for appointing Mogadishu's mayor.

The vote in Mogadishu, a city of some 3 million people where security conditions have improved in recent years despite continuing attacks by al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants, is seen as a test run for direct elections at the national level.

Around 1,605 candidates are running on Thursday for 390 posts in Mogadishu's district councils, said Abdishakur Abib Hayir, a member of the National Electoral Commission. Council members will then choose a mayor.

"It shows Somalia is standing on its feet and moving forward," Hayir told Reuters. "After the local election, elections can and will take place in the entire country."

A 2024 law restored universal suffrage ahead of federal elections expected next year. However, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud reached a deal in August with some opposition leaders stipulating that while lawmakers would be directly elected in 2026, the president would still be chosen by parliament.

Opposition parties have argued the rapid introduction of a new electoral system would benefit Mohamud's re-election prospects.

They also question whether the country is safe enough for mass voting given al Shabaab's control over vast areas of the countryside and regular strikes on major population centres.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 04:56:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZIGO6H4I2FKOVOP5SJ7IQRDYXM.jpg?auth=892c16cbe0bf0e6db6dbe34252f29c65532c2fd213748eb21a38b6f82843d0d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Christmas celebrations muted at Bondi as Australians grieve after deadly shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/christmas-celebrations-muted-bondi-australians-grieve-after-deadly-shooting-2025-12-25/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Christmas celebrations were muted at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach on Thursday in the aftermath of a terror attack that killed 15 people there more than a week ago, as the community continued to grapple with the country's deadliest mass shooting in nearly three decades.

Police patrolled across the beachfront in Bondi, a traditional Christmas destination, as hundreds of people, many wearing Santa hats, gathered on the sands.

"I think it's tragic, and I think everybody respects and is very sad for what happened, and I think people here are out on the beach, because it's like a celebration but everybody has got it in their memories and everybody is respectful of what happened," British tourist Mark Conroy told Reuters.

"Everyone is feeling for the family and friends who are going through the worst possible thing you could imagine."

The gun attack on December 14 at a Jewish Hannukah celebration has prompted calls for stricter gun laws and tougher action against antisemitism, while public gathering rules in Sydney have been tightened under new laws passed on Wednesday.

Beachgoers were seen taking photos next to a Christmas tree while some posed with lifeguards, although windy weather conditions appear to thin crowds.

"It's not the best conditions for Christmas Day today, it's a bit choppy. ... so not ideal, but people are still here," Surf Life Saving Patrol Captain Thomas Hough said.

Flags flew at half mast outside the heritage-listed Bondi Pavilion building near the site of the attack , which police say was allegedly carried out by a father and son, inspired by the militant group Islamic State.

In Melbourne, a car with a "Happy Chanukah!" sign was set alight on Christmas Day in the city's southeast, with no injuries reported, Australian media reported.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, facing mounting criticism from opponents who argue his government has not done enough to curb a rise in antisemitism, called the firebombing of the car "just beyond comprehension."

"What sort of evil ideology and thoughts at a time like this would motivate someone?," Albanese told reporters on Thursday.

State media praised Peng Peiyun, head of China's Family Planning Commission from 1988 to 1998, as "an outstanding leader" in her work related to women and children.

The reaction on China's social media to Peng's death in Beijing on Sunday, just shy of her 96th birthday, was less positive.

"Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there" in the afterlife, one person posted on China's popular micro-blog Weibo.

China's near-universal mandate of just one child per couple from 1980 through 2015 prompted local officials to compel women to undergo abortions and sterilisations.

Beijing launched the one-child policy as leaders worried about population growth potentially spiralling out of control. But China's population, long the world's highest, later slowed and last year tumbled for the third year in a row.

"If the one-child policy had been implemented for 10 years less, China's population would not have plummeted like this!" a Weibo post said.

After falling behind India's in 2023, China's population declined last year to 1.39 billion. Experts warn the downtrend will accelerate in coming years. Data for 2025 will be released next month.

As population czar, Peng focused her commission's work on the countryside.

In rural China, large families were once seen as a goal for couples looking to ensure that they would be taken care of in their old age. Sons who could carry on the family name were also favoured, leading to unwanted infant girls and even aborted female foetuses.

"Those children, if they were born, would be almost 40 years old, in the prime of their lives," one person posted on Weibo.

By the 2010s, Peng had publicly shifted her views, saying the one-child policy should be eased. Now Beijing is trying to boost the flagging birth rate with childcare subsidies, longer maternity leave and tax benefits.

The shrinking and greying of the population has spurred worries that the world's second-biggest economy will struggle as the number of workers declines. Rising costs from elderly care and retirement benefits will also likely create additional budgetary strains for already indebted local governments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 06:34:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BKRUX7F4BBLZ3DUIXLGHDK5SZQ.jpg?auth=ac6305ac03d49d2f283fe1ed263574565fd6d6bfb5de4d3323b8491ec9eb9c11&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia says Yemen group should withdraw its forces from seized provinces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-says-yemen-group-should-withdraw-its-forces-seized-provinces-2025-12-25/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it remains hopeful that Yemen's main southern separatist group will end an escalation that has given it broad control across the south , deepening uncertainties in a country already divided between two administrations since civil war erupted over a decade ago.

In a foreign ministry statement, the kingdom described the military operations by Yemen's Southern Transitional Council (STC) - through which the group seized the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra earlier this month - as an "unjustified escalation."

"The kingdom remains hopeful that the public interest will prevail through ending the escalation by the Southern Transitional Council and the withdrawal of its forces from the two governorates in an urgent and orderly manner," the statement said.

The UAE-backed STC forces were initially part of the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis. But the STC turned on the government and sought self-rule in the south, including the major port city of Aden where the Saudi-backed administration is headquartered.

A joint Saudi-Emirati military delegation arrived in Aden on December 12 to discuss measures aimed at defusing tensions. Saudi Arabia said the teams were sent to put "the necessary arrangements" to ensure the return of STC forces to their previous positions outside the two provinces.

The kingdom added, however, that these efforts remain in progress to restore the situation to its previous state.

Yemen has been marred by civil war since 2014, through which the Houthis took control of the northern part of the country including the capital, Sanaa, pushing the Saudi-backed government to flee south and headquarter in the port city of Aden.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 06:34:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh leader considered top PM candidate returns from exile ahead of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-leader-considered-top-pm-candidate-returns-exile-ahead-polls-2025-12-25/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting Chairman Tarique Rahman returned from nearly 17 years in exile on Thursday, a homecoming the party hopes will energise supporters with Rahman poised to be the top contender for prime minister in February.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters lined the route from Dhaka’s airport to the reception venue, waving party flags and carrying placards, banners and flowers, while chanting slogans welcoming Rahman, as senior BNP leaders received him at the airport under tight security.

Rahman, 60, the son of ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has lived in London since 2008 and led the BNP as acting chairman since 2018.

Dressed in a light grey, finely checkered blazer over a crisp white shirt, Rahman exited the airport, removed his shoes to step barefoot onto Bangladeshi soil, and picked up a handful of earth in a symbolic gesture marking his return to the South Asian nation.

He was seen standing beside the driver’s seat in a bus taking him to the reception venue, smiling and waving as crowds surged to catch a glimpse of their returning leader.

He had been unable to return while facing multiple criminal cases at home. Rahman was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The rulings were overturned after Hasina was ousted last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to his return.

His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception venue before visiting his mother.

The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasina’s removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda largely alternated in office. A December survey by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race.

Hasina's Awami League party, which has been barred from the February 12 election, has threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote.

Bangladesh is heading into the polls under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. While authorities have pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman’s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:23:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZVVK7HB2BVNZZNTEQBLB2NW2XQ.jpg?auth=c2c6d1a76057ec0a9de023b4e0639c5f163b8e15e86c81dcb729becb1e4bfd84&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia-ally Touadera seeks third term in Central African Republic</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/russia-ally-touadera-seeks-third-term-central-african-republic-2025-12-25/</link><description>BANGUI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera is seeking a third term in an election on Sunday, campaigning on security gains after signing deals with rebel groups and enlisting support from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan forces.

He faces six opposition candidates including Anicet-Georges Dologuele, a former prime minister and runner-up in the 2020 election, but is likely to win in part due to his control over state institutions, analysts say.

Such a result would likely further the interests of Russia, which has traded security assistance for access to resources including gold and diamonds. Touadera is also offering access to the country's lithium and uranium reserves to anyone interested.

The 68-year-old mathematician took power in 2016 after the worst crisis in the chronically unstable country's history, when three years of intercommunal strife forced a fifth of the population to flee their homes, either internally or abroad.

Touadera has signed peace deals this year with several rebel groups, while others have been weakened in the face of Russian mercenaries and troops from Rwanda deployed to shore up Touadera's government as well as U.N. peacekeepers.

"During the 10 years that we have been working together, you yourselves have seen that peace is beginning to return, starting from all our borders and reaching the capital," Touadera told a rally at a stadium in the capital Bangui this month.

His opponents , meanwhile, have denounced a constitutional referendum in 2023 that scrapped the presidential term limit, saying it was proof Touadera wants to be president for life.

They have also accused him of failing to make significant progress towards lifting the 5.5 million population out of poverty.

"The administrative infrastructure has been destroyed and, as you know, the roads are in a very poor state of repair," Dologuele told a recent press conference.

"In short, the Central African economy is in ruins."

The presidential contest is taking place alongside legislative, regional and municipal elections, with provisional results expected to be announced by January 5.

If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, a presidential runoff will take place on February 15, while legislative runoffs will take place on April 5.

A smooth voting process could reinforce Touadera's claim that stability is returning, which was buttressed last year with the U.N. Security Council's lifting of an arms embargo and the lifting of a separate embargo on diamond exports.

"The fact that these measures were lifted, it shows that we're gradually getting back to normal. Or at least that's the narrative," said Romain Esmenjaud, associate researcher at the Institut Francais de Geopolitique.

The peace deals are credited with a decline in violence in some areas and an expected boost in economic growth projections to 3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has said the U.N. should hand security back to the government soon.

But serious security threats remain. Rebels have not fully disarmed, reintegration is incomplete, and incursions by combatants from neighbouring Sudan fuel insecurity in the east.

Pangea-Risk, a consultancy, wrote in a note to clients that the risk of unrest after the election was high as opponents were likely to challenge Touadera's expected victory.

"The election will take place in an atmosphere marked by heightened grievances over political marginalization, increasing repression, and allegations of electoral fraud," said chief executive Robert Besseling.

Dologuele alleged fraud after he was recorded as winning 21.6% of the vote in 2020, when rebel groups still threatened the capital and prevented voting at 800 polling stations across the country, or 14% of the total. A court upheld Touadera's win.

Paul-Crescent Beninga, a political analyst, said voters will be closely scrutinising the voting and counting processes.

"If they do not go well, it gives those who promote violence an excuse to mobilise violence and sow panic among the population of the Central African Republic. So that is why we must ensure that the elections take place in relatively acceptable conditions," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:23:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CEQT5QLT2BLFFEUTM2AXC2BILU.jpg?auth=3677d7c713068f5455e0b677e2e1c92523c7ef56e7c9ee5810c65783fb6b78cf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Helicopter crash on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro kills five, aviation authority says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/helicopter-crash-tanzanias-mount-kilimanjaro-kills-five-aviation-authority-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>DAR ES SALAAM, Dec 25 (Reuters) - A helicopter crashed on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro, killing five people, the civil aviation authority said on Thursday, while local media reported that the aircraft was on a medical rescue mission.

The helicopter crashed near the mountain's Barafu Camp on Wednesday, Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement.

Mwananchi newspaper and East Africa TV, citing Kilimanjaro region's head of police, Simon Maigwa, reported that the helicopter was on a medical rescue mission.

Among the dead were a guide, a doctor, the pilot and two foreign tourists, Mwananchi cited Maigwa as saying, without giving the tourists' nationalities.

Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, is nearly 6,000 meters (20,000 ft) above sea level.

The crash happened between 4670 and 4700 metres, Mwananchi reported.

No group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which comes amid heightened security concerns in Nigeria’s northeast, where Islamist insurgents Boko Haram and its ISWAP faction have waged a 15-year campaign of violence targeting civilians, mosques, and markets.

The blast at the Al-Adum mosque occurred around 6 p.m. local time as congregants gathered for evening worship. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as victims were rushed to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and the State Specialist Hospital.

“Nobody knows what happened. It was during prayers that the bomb exploded. Allah has destined that this will happen but nobody can give details of how it happened,” said Masta Dalori, a market leader.

Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum condemned the attack, calling it “utterly condemnable, barbaric and inhumane”. In a statement, he urged heightened vigilance in places of worship and public spaces during the festive season.

“Attacking a place of worship is a desecration of its sanctity at a time when Muslim faithful are performing acts of worship,” he said, offering condolences to families of the dead and prayers for the injured.

Police confirmed the casualty figures and said bomb disposal teams had cordoned off the area. “Ongoing sweeping operations by police EOD are in progress,” said Kenneth Daso, spokesperson for Borno State Command.

He added that investigations were underway and advised residents to remain calm and vigilant.

Last August, gunmen attacked a mosque and nearby homes in northwest Katsina State killing at least 50, according to local officials and residents.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:24:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XSXZUZAFJVNCROHLDI7GPM2VMY.jpg?auth=f85aa88ca83d523f53960a2b877efdc9f77ee3f10484fe65cfbf74fc95db148a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo to renew call for peace during first Christmas blessing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-pope-leo-to-renew-call-for-peace-during-first-urbi-et-orbi-christmas-blessing</link><description>Pope Leo XIV is expected to renew his calls for peace Thursday when he delivers his first Christmas blessing from St Peter's Basilica at the end of a year overshadowed by conflict, but also marked by hopes for peace in Gaza.

In Bethlehem, the Christian community celebrated its first festive Christmas in more than two years as the occupied West Bank city emerged from the shadow of the war in Gaza .

However, the Pope's call this week for a one-day global truce went unheeded in Ukraine , where fighting continued, as the pontiff prepared to deliver his "Urbi et Orbi" blessing at 12:00 – during which popes usually speak about conflicts around the world and urge peace .

Before the address, the Pope celebrated his first Christmas Mass Wednesday evening where he described the celebration as a feast of "faith, charity and hope".

He also spoke in front of St Peter's Basilica to offer Christmas wishes and thank those who had come to follow the mass on outdoor screens despite rainy weather.

"St Peter's is very large but unfortunately it is not large enough to receive all of you," he told the crowd of around 5,000 people.

Leo will also hold another mass on Christmas Day, renewing a tradition from the times of late pope John Paul II (1978-2005).

Hundreds of worshippers also gathered for mass at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem Wednesday night as the Palestinian city ushered in its first festive Christmas during the Gaza war.

Throughout the conflict that began with Hamas 's attack on Israel in October 2023, a sombre tone had marked Christmases in the biblical birthplace of Jesus Christ.

But celebrations returned Wednesday with parades and music in the West Bank city, as a fragile truce held in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face winter in makeshift tents.

With pews of the Church of the Nativity filled long before midnight, many stood or sat on the floor for the traditional mass to usher in Christmas Day.

At 11:15 pm organ music rang out as a procession of dozens of clergymen entered, followed by Jerusalem 's Latin Patriarch, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, who blessed the crowd with signs of the cross.

In his homily, Pizzaballa urged peace, hope and rebirth, saying the Nativity story still held relevance in the turbulence of modern times.

He also spoke of his visit to Gaza over the weekend, where he said "suffering is still present" despite the ceasefire .

"The wounds are deep, yet I have to say, here too, there too, their proclamation of Christmas resounds," he said. "When I met them, I was struck by their strength and desire to start over."

Hundreds took part in the parade down Bethlehem's narrow Star Street on Wednesday, while a dense crowd massed in the square.

"Today is full of joy because we haven't been able to celebrate because of the war," said Milagros Anstas, 17.

Men dressed as Santa Claus sold toffee apples and toys as families took photographs in front of a nativity scene framed by a giant star.

As darkness fell, multi-coloured lights shone over Manger Square and a towering Christmas tree glittered next to the Church of the Nativity.

The basilica dates back to the fourth century and was built on top of a grotto where Christians believe Jesus was born more than 2,000 years ago.

Bethlehem residents hoped the return of Christmas festivities would breathe life back into the city.

"We need to get the message to the whole world and this is the only way," said George Hanna, from the neighbouring town of Beit Jala.

In Syria , Christmas lights illuminated Damascus's Old City despite the Christian community's fears of violence after a deadly attack in June.

Around the district, home to several important churches, red baubles hung from trees, shopkeepers put up Christmas decorations and street vendors peddled warm chestnuts.

"Syria deserves joy and for us to be happy, and to hope for a new future," said student Loris Aasaf, 20.

In stark contrast to the messages of religious leaders, US President Donald Trump wished a Merry Christmas "to everyone, including the radical left-wing scum", referring to Democrats.

Severe weather disrupted the holiday season in California where authorities, fearing dangerous flooding, have declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles and ordered evacuations.

In Australia , Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had a sombre message after the deadly attack during a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach on December 14.

North Korea and Russia have drawn closer since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, and Pyongyang has sent troops to fight for Russia.

In return, Russia is sending North Korea financial aid, military technology and food and energy supplies, analysts say.

The "heroic" efforts of North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk region "clearly proved the invincible friendship" between Moscow and Pyongyang, Putin said in a message to Kim, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Russian nuclear-capable bombers conducted a "scheduled" flight over the Norwegian and Barents Seas, prompting "fighter jets of foreign countries" to escort them, Russia's Defence Ministry said, according to Russian news agencies.

Neither the date of the Tu-95 flights nor the countries that deployed monitoring aircraft were specified.

"Russian Tu-95MS strategic bombers and missile carriers carried out a scheduled flight over the neutral waters of the Barents and Norwegian Seas," the ministry said, referring to bodies of water north of Scandinavia and northwest of Russia.

"At certain stages of the route, long-range bombers were escorted by fighter jets of foreign countries," it added.

Leo, the first U.S. pope , said the story of Jesus being born in a stable showed that God had "pitched his fragile tent" among the people of the world.

"How, then, can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?" he asked.

Leo, celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world's cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis , has a more quiet, diplomatic style than his predecessor and usually refrains from making political references in his sermons.

But the new pope has also lamented the conditions for Palestinians in Gaza several times recently and told journalists last month that the only solution in the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people must include a Palestinian state.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of intense bombardment and military operations , but humanitarian agencies say there is still too little aid getting into Gaza, where nearly the entire population is homeless .

In Thursday's service with thousands in St. Peter's Basilica, Leo also lamented conditions for the homeless across the globe and the destruction caused by the wars roiling the world.

"Fragile is the flesh of defenseless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds," said the pope.

"Fragile are the minds and lives of young people forced to take up arms, who on the front lines feel the senselessness of what is asked of them and the falsehoods that fill the pompous speeches of those who send them to their deaths," he said.

Later on Thursday the pope will deliver a twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message and blessing, which usually addresses global conflicts.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:23:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MK3CJZ73W5ISDMQX3B42WM33XI.jpg?auth=77baa33446795703f800f4db5a078b0c67fc6d5a88230a7cf2a63f39e6610723&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drones hit oil and gas facilities in Russia, SBU official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drones-hit-oil-gas-facilities-russia-sbu-official-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>Ukrainian long-range drones hit oil product tanks in the Russian port of Temryuk and a gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg, an official at the SBU security service told Reuters on Thursday.

A tradition dating back to the ​Cold War era of 1955, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) tracks Santa's overnight journey around the world, starting from his home base at the North Pole.

NORAD, a joint US-Canadian military command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, has provided images and updates on Santa's worldwide journey for seven decades, along with its main task of monitoring air defenses and issuing aerospace and maritime warnings.

But the details of Santa's mission are known only to him.

"NORAD tracks Santa, but only Santa knows his route, which means we cannot predict where or when he will arrive at your house," a senior NORAD official said in a press statement.

The Santa tracker tradition originated from a ‍1955 misprint in a Colorado Springs newspaper, which attempted to print the telephone number of a department store that children could call to speak with Santa. But the printed number went ​instead to what was then known as Continental Air Defense Command.

An understanding officer took the children's calls and assured them that Santa was airborne and on schedule to deliver presents to good girls and boys, flying aboard his reindeer-powered sleigh.

According to its website , NORAD detects Santa's liftoff with its polar radar network, then follows his journey with the same satellites used to warn of ‍any possible missile launches aimed at North America. As soon as Santa's lead reindeer, Rudolph, switches on his shiny red nose, military personnel can zero in on his location using the satellites' infrared sensors.

US President Donald Trump appeared to be following NORAD's Santa tracker on Wednesday as he sat by a Christmas tree at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida , fielding telephone calls from children around the country. As he spoke to one youngster from Pennsylvania, Trump said, "So Santa right now is in Copenhagen , Denmark , but he's heading toward our country. ‍What would you like from Santa?"

Speaking to another caller, Trump jokingly explained the rationale for tracking Santa in terms of national security, saying, "We want ‌to make sure he's ​not infiltrated, that we're not infiltrating into our country a bad Santa."</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:25:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/514c6c84-e175-11f0-bf80-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/NORAD2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia made a proposal to France on jailed French researcher Vinatier, the Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-made-proposal-france-jailed-french-researcher-vinatier-kremlin-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russia had made a proposal to France regarding Laurent Vinatier, a French researcher jailed for violating Russia's foreign agent laws, and the ball is now in Paris's court, the Kremlin said on Thursday.

Vinatier was sentenced in 2024 to three years in jail for failing to comply with laws requiring individuals deemed "foreign agents" to register and meet a number of stipulations. He is now facing additional espionage charges.

France has said Vinatier was arbitrarily detained and has called for his release. President Emmanuel Macron has denied that Vinatier worked for the French state and has described his arrest as part of a misinformation campaign by Moscow.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that there had been contacts with France on the issue.

"There were indeed relevant contacts between us and the French," Peskov told reporters. "Indeed, an offer was made to the French about this. The ball is in France's court right now."

Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier this month that he would look into the case.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:20:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AA7WQR3YDJKDNDEFLSGNKLIQOU.jpg?auth=0d909142ff294fee0beaeb81adef1026c9b58d866f8609e3991a965ddf642942&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland intercepts Russian plane over Baltic Sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/poland-intercepts-russian-plane-over-baltic-sea-2025-12-25/</link><description>WARSAW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Polish jets intercepted a Russian reconnaissance plane over the Baltic Sea, which was flying close to its airspace, the NATO member country's army said on Thursday.

Countries on NATO's eastern flank have been on high alert for potential airspace incursions since September when three Russian military jets violated Estonia's airspace for 12 minutes just days after more than 20 Russian drones had entered Polish airspace.

"This morning, over the international waters of the Baltic Sea, Polish fighter jets intercepted, visually identified, and escorted from their area of ​​responsibility a Russian reconnaissance aircraft flying near the borders of Polish airspace," the army said.

It also said that at night, objects were observed entering Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus.

"After detailed analysis, it was determined that these were most likely smuggling balloons, moving in accordance with the wind direction and speed," the army said. It added that part of the airspace over northeast Poland's Podlaskie region, which borders Belarus, was temporarily closed to civilian traffic to ensure security.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:20:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Christmas traditions: festivities that continue well into the New Year</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-french-christmas-traditions-festivities-continue-well-into-new-year</link><description>The Christmas season is a time when the French set aside their treasured notions of being a staunchly secular country to revel in holiday traditions, many of them rooted in the religious practices of ancient Rome and continuing into the early part of the year.

Although France shares many Christmas traditions with its European neighbours, others are quintessentially French – like oysters on ice, the bûche de Noël (Christmas log cake) and a decided emphasis on Champagne.

As in countries across Europe, Christmas markets often spring up in France starting in November, with many continuing through the first week of January. Kiosks resembling wooden Swiss chalets sell mulled wine, gingerbread ( pain d’épice ) and various gifts and crafts, continuing a tradition dating from the Middle Ages.

Paris hosts an array of Christmas markets in a typical year with additional "pop-up" markets appearing for just a day or a weekend. Among the most well known of the annual markets are the Villages de Noël near the Eiffel Tower and the largest one at the Tuileries Garden , as well as those at Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) in the Marais, Notre-Dame in the city centre and in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

In the Alsace region bordering Germany , Strasbourg proclaims itself the " Capital of Christmas ". The city is known for its Christmas market, which is the oldest in France (dating from 1570) and one of the oldest in Europe.

Every year, a 30-metre-tall Christmas tree is brought to Place Kléber and decorated with ornaments and lights while merchants and craftsmen offer their wares at the some 300 wooden chalets dotted all over the city centre. For most of December, Strasbourg becomes one of the most illuminated cities in France.

The first day of Advent on December 1 marks the official countdown to Christmas in many Christian traditions. French supermarkets and other stores invariably carry advent calendars ( calendriers de l'avent ) – box calendars with a folding door for each day leading up to Christmas that reveals a chocolate or small trinket when opened.

Advent wreaths (c ouronnes de l’Avent ) may also make an appearance around this time, often adorned with pine cones, bows and four candles. Traditionally, one candle will be lit on each Sunday leading up to Christmas.

In parts of northeastern France and beyond, Père Fouettard is a frightening figure designed to scare children into being well-behaved – traditionally his role is to punish the naughty while Santa Claus rewards the nice. With his black beard, shaggy hair and soot-smeared face, Père Fouettard whips misbehaved children on December 6, the day of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children.

Those who have not been good over the past year may also find their long-awaited Christmas gifts consist of coal, beets or onions, all thanks to Père Fouettard.

Meanwhile, well-behaved children are given chocolate and other sweets on the day of Saint Nicholas.

Gradually, the December 6 tradition has disappeared in most French regions and the ritual giving of chocolate and gingerbread has been incorporated into Christmas.

Papillotes are small gifts of chocolate, wrapped with a little note inside decorative paper with fringed ends. They are thought to have been invented around 1790 by a young apprentice chocolatier in Lyon who fell in love with a girl from the neighbourhood and sent her chocolates wrapped in love notes. When the master chocolatier, Monsieur Papillot, discovered these unique gifts he decided to manufacture and market them, and the papillote en chocolat was born.

Today, the candies often come wrapped in gold foil along with little holiday messages or proverbs and are popular in France around Christmas as well as New Year 's.

Adorning many a Christmas crèche in the southern Provence region are handmade and painted ceramic figurines known as santons , from the Provençal term " santoun " (for little saint).

While Joseph, Mary and Jesus are represented in many a manger scene, the santons often depict a whole village, including craftsmen, farmers and the local baker. An iconic figure among the santons is the Ravi, a man depicted with outstretched arms who is openly marvelling at the miracle of the nativity.

Another Provençale tradition is that of the 13 desserts, which are said to symbolise Christ and the 12 apostles. An array of 13 offerings – including dried fruits, nuts, nougat, marzipan candies and an olive oil cake called Pompe à l’huile – are laid out in the week before Christmas so that holiday visitors will have something to nibble on. Tradition holds that partaking of each of the 13 treats will bring good luck in the coming year.

Christmas would not be complete without a sumptuous feast, and in France that meal is known as the Réveillon de Noël (from réveiller , to rouse or awaken) and often takes place on December 24. The table may be decorated with an Advent wreath and candles, and some advise knotting the ends of the tablecloth so the Devil can't get under the table.

In the Middle Ages, midnight Mass was preceded by a meagre meal; it was customary to eat only a little bread, fish or vegetable broth and drink a glass of water. Christmas dinner was the big traditional meal served to worshippers on December 25 after a long nighttime church service. Though fewer people these days attend midnight Mass, the tradition of a big Christmas Eve or Christmas Day meal has survived.

Throughout December, supermarket shelves are laden with cans and jars of foie gras , a French specialty of fattened duck or goose liver, often served as a starter on warm toast with some jam, often onion or fig.

Though many have stopped eating foie gras because of the way the birds’ livers are artificially fattened through gavage , or force-feeding, it remains one of the most popular food items for a French Christmas meal, and France today remains its largest producer by far.

Literally translated as “fat liver”, foie gras originated in ancient Egypt before it spread throughout the Mediterranean and was adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans. Later, in the Middle Ages, the tradition of gavage was continued by the Jewish population, since goose meat was viewed as a good source of nutrition and its cooking fat conformed to Jewish dietary laws.

The popularity of foie gras grew during the Renaissance, when it became associated with the kings of France. The term “ foyes gras ” was coined during the reign of Louis XIV and it was served at royal banquets under Louis XV, but it was Louis XVI who declared it the “ dish of kings ".

Foie gras is also often served pan-roasted, or sliced over a cut of meat, or as a sauce. It is produced in winter, and its high price makes it a luxurious holiday product that is perfect for year-end festivities.

For those who do not eat foie gras , other common starters at a French Christmas or New Year’s dinner are smoked salmon, scallops ( coquilles Saint-Jacques ), shrimp or oysters.

The French are among the largest consumers of oysters in the world, with more than 85,000 tonnes of oysters served each year, a large portion of which is enjoyed at the Christmas dinner table.

Oysters are easy to find in France, with its long coastline, and are relatively healthy for a holiday dish. They are most often served fresh on shaved ice alongside a red wine and shallot vinaigrette (sometimes known as a mignonette ) or simply a wedge of lemon.

It is customary to eat oysters only during months that have an "r" in their names – September through April. This is not only because they taste best during this period but due to habit – long before refrigerated transportation methods were invented, oysters could only be shipped inland from the sea during the cold winter months if they were to stay fresh and not spoil before being served. Salmon, lobster, crayfish and other seafood are also traditionally eaten in winter for the same reason.

Much like in the United States or Great Britain, a staple of French Christmas dinner is the stuffed turkey, or the dinde de Noël .

Before the turkey arrived in Europe from the Americas in the 17th century, the French ate stuffed goose. But the turkey has mostly replaced the goose as the holiday bird of choice because it is less expensive, yet larger and meatier than chicken and thus fit for a feast.

A smaller, succulent fowl that is very popular in France during the winter holidays is the capon ( chapon ), a cockerel that was neutered to render its meat fattier and usually weighing 3-4 kilos, or the even smaller guinea fowl ( pintade ).

Whatever bird is chosen, it is generally roasted and served with a special Christmas stuffing that traditionally includes chestnuts and often mushrooms.

Other holiday main dishes in France include roasted meats such as lamb or beef and also game, such as wild boar, venison or pheasant, which are not often eaten year-round by French people who are not hunters.

No Christmas in France is complete without a bûche de Noël , otherwise known as the Yule log cake. The bûche is an elaborate creation made of a rolled sponge cake filled with cream and frosted to look like tree bark or a log.

It is a reminder of an earlier tradition, dating back to the Iron Age, when people in Europe would gather to welcome the winter solstice on December 21, the longest night of the year. Families would burn large logs, usually from fruit trees, anointed with wine and salt and decorated with pine cones, holly or ivy. The log kept the house warm, and its ashes were said to have medicinal benefits and to guard against evil.

After a meal of stuffed goose, capon or other roasted meat – not to mention Champagne , good wine and a wide variety of rich desserts and chocolates – it’s not surprising that the French speak of a crise de foie (“liver crisis,” also known as indigestion) at the end of the holiday season.

But a little crise de foie is a small price to pay for a festive meal with family and friends to ward off the winter chill.

While the main event may be over as the year draws to a close, the festivities do not yet stop in France, which carries the holiday season into February.

Les Étrennes is a New Year’s Eve tradition of gift-giving dating back to Roman times, when offerings typically included honey, dates or money as well as laurel leaves or branches. Today in France the day is marked by offering an envelope of money and sometimes a card to those who do work for you all year round, notably garbage collectors, firefighters, mailmen and your building's concierge or gardien(ne) .

Much of France marks Épiphanie on January 6 with a galette des rois (king cake) – a flaky, puffed cake layered with frangipane, a sweet almond paste. The cake has a ceramic bauble (the fève , or bean) baked inside. Whoever receives the slice with the fève becomes king or queen for the day and is given a gold paper crown, sold with the cake.

When the cake is served, the youngest person present traditionally crawls under the table to blindly select who will receive the next slice.

Christian legend holds that Epiphany, or Three Kings' Day, is when the three wise men arrived in Bethlehem. But the tradition of the fève dates from Roman celebrations of Saturnalia in late December and early January, when slaves would dine with the rest of the household. If a slave received the fève they could have anything they wanted for the day.

The Chandeleur is celebrated on February 2 to mark 40 days after Christmas. Known by the Christians as Candlemas, it is another tradition that can be traced back to Celtic and Roman pagans, who celebrated that the days were getting longer around this time.

Today in France it is when Christmas nativity scenes are often taken down and a day for eating crêpes that are round and golden like the sun, to herald the return to longer days. Holding a coin in your left hand while successfully flipping a crêpe with your right is thought to bring prosperity.

Forecasters said Southern California could see its wettest Christmas in years and warned of flash flooding and mudslides. Areas scorched by wildfires in January saw evacuation warnings as heavy rains and gusty winds brought mudslides and debris flows.

Many flood areas were in burn scar zones, which were stripped of vegetation by fire and are less able to absorb water.

San Bernardino County firefighters said they rescued people trapped in cars Wednesday when mud and debris rushed down a road leading into Wrightwood, a resort town in the San Gabriel Mountains about 80 miles (130 kilometres) northeast of Los Angeles. It was not immediately clear how many were rescued.

Firefighters also went door to door to check homes, and the area was under a shelter-in-place order, officials said. An evacuation order was issued for Lytle Creek, also in the San Gabriel Mountains.

Travis Guenther and his family were trapped in Lytle Creek after roaring waters washed out the only bridge in or out of their neighbourhood. More than a dozen neighbours took shelter at a community centre or found hotel rooms.

“Everybody that left to go to work this morning is stuck,” he said. “Half the families are here, and half the families are on the other side of the creek.”

Guenther said he had plenty of supplies and was coordinating with other in the community of about 280 people. Two nurses who live on his street offered to help anyone who may need medical attention.

Janice Quick, president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce and a resident of the mountain town for 45 years, said a wildfire in 2024 left much of the terrain without tree coverage.

The storm also stranded Dillan Brown, his wife and 14-month-old daughter at a rented cabin in Wrightwood with almost no food and only enough diapers for about another day. Roads leading off the mountain and to a grocery store became blocked by rocks and debris, Brown said.

A resident learned of his situation and posted a call for help in a Facebook group. In less than an hour, neighbours showed up with more than enough supplies to ride out the storm, including bread, vegetables, milk, diapers and wipes.

“I think we’re a little sad and upset that we’re not going to be home with our families,” Brown said, but the “kindness shown is definitely an overwhelming feeling.”

Residents around burn scar zones from the Airport Fire in Orange County were also ordered to evacuate.

Areas along the coast including Malibu were under flood warnings until Wednesday evening, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Several roads including a part of Interstate 5 near the Burbank Airport closed due to flooding.

The storms were the result of multiple atmospheric rivers carrying massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.

Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimetres) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimetres) with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said.

Heavy snow and gusts created “near white-out conditions” in parts of the Sierra Nevada and made mountain pass trave treacherous. Officials said there was a “considerable” avalanche risk around Lake Tahoe, and a winter storm warning was in effect until Friday morning.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in six counties to allow state assistance in storm response.

The state deployed emergency resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.

The California Highway Patrol reported a seemingly weather-related crash south of Sacramento in which a Sacramento sheriff's deputy died. James Caravallo, who was with the agency for 19 years, was apparently traveling at an unsafe speed, lost control on a wet road and crashed into a power pole, CHP Officer Michael Harper said via email.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:21:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5836f150-e179-11f0-8958-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25359158594505.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia is analysing US documents on Ukraine peace deal, Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-is-analysing-us-documents-ukraine-peace-deal-kremlin-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Kremlin is analysing the documents on ending the war in Ukraine which were brought to Moscow by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev from the United States, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:41:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z6NCRVZ3MBNUZFOOX4LKC37PUI.jpg?auth=2d15cc2e61e9c2fcf982cbf52a1a2a5fa5a0b1b99d409ba3aafac5e2705f86f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Christmas festivities from across the world</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251225-in-pictures-christmas-festivities-from-across-world</link><description>To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

"There were appropriate contacts between our side and the French. Indeed, a proposal was made to the French regarding Vinatier," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters without providing details.

"The ball is now in France 's court," he added.

Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict mediation NGO and was jailed in June 2024, is serving a three-year sentence for failing to register as a "foreign agent" but faces fresh allegations of spying.

Vinatier's family have rejected the accusations against him, saying he is a victim of tensions between Moscow and Paris over the war in Ukraine .

President Vladimir Putin said last week he would look into the case after a French journalist asked him about it during an end-of-year televised press conference.

"I don't know anything about this case. This is the first I've heard of it," Putin said.

"But I promise you I'll definitely find out what it is. And if there's even the slightest chance of resolving this matter favourably, if Russian law allows it, we'll make every effort," Putin said.

Vinatier is one of several Westerners to have been arrested after Putin launched an all-out offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.

Several US citizens have been arrested and then released in prisoner exchanges brokered by both US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden .

In court hearings on his original case, Vinatier, a veteran Russia expert, said he had not known he was required to register with the authorities under Moscow's "foreign agents" law, which is widely used to target and sideline critics of the Kremlin.

He apologised and said through his work he had always tried to represent Russia's interests in international relations.

Moscow has used alleged breaches of the "foreign agents" law to arrest people before hitting them with more serious charges – as happened to Vinatier.

His family remains “cautiously hopeful” but hopes he will be "released during the holidays” between now and Orthodox Christmas on January 7, his lawyer Frédéric Belot said.

“We have every confidence in French diplomacy, which is doing its utmost,” Belot continued, hoping that Vinatier's fate will be discussed during talks between Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e28dd1b0-e17f-11f0-8a4b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24288449590640.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Daughters of King Charles' brother Andrew join royals for Christmas service</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/daughters-king-charles-brother-andrew-join-royals-christmas-service-2025-12-25/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Britain's Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie attended the royal family's traditional Christmas Day church service on Thursday, while their father Andrew, recently stripped of his titles over ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was absent.

King Charles and Queen Camilla led senior royals to a church in Sandringham in eastern England, about 110 miles (175 km) northeast of London, greeting well-wishers in crisp winter weather.

Charles and Camilla walked ahead while the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, and their three children, followed.

Other family members included Princess Anne and her husband Tim Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh with their children, as well as the king's niece Zara and her husband Mike Tindall.

Now known only as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the king's younger brother has faced mounting pressure over his links to Epstein.

In October, Charles stripped him of all titles, including Duke of York and prince, and ordered him to vacate his Windsor home and move to private accommodation on the Sandringham estate, which has been the royal family's traditional venue for their Christmas Day service since 1988.

Buckingham Palace had said the steps taken against Andrew were necessary to protect the monarchy's reputation, adding that the king's thoughts and sympathies were with victims of abuse.

Andrew has denied allegations that he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre, an American woman who said she was trafficked by the late financier Epstein and forced to have sex with Andrew as a teenager - a claim Andrew settled in a U.S. civil lawsuit in 2022 without admitting liability.

The attendance of his daughters Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, underscores their continuing presence at family events despite the controversy surrounding their father.

"Today we are witnessing complete lawlessness in the Caribbean Sea, where long-forgotten theft of other people's property, namely piracy, and banditry, are being revived," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said of the situation.

"We consistently advocate for a de-escalation," Zakharova said. "We hope that the pragmatism and rationality of US President Trump will allow solutions to be found that are mutually acceptable to the parties within the framework of international legal norms."

Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, 44, has said he wants to consolidate his father's conservative legacy at the October 4 vote where he will try to unseat leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

"With the commitment of not allowing the popular will to be silenced, I make the decision to nominate Flavio Bolsonaro as a pre-candidate for the presidency in 2026," Jair Bolsonaro said in a letter read out by Flavio in front of a hospital in the city of Brasilia where his father was being treated.

He was undergoing scheduled treatment for a hernia, his wife Michelle Bolsonaro said on social media.

Jair Bolsonaro, 70, has a history of hospitalizations and surgeries related to a stabbing he suffered while campaigning in 2018, including a 12-hour procedure for recurring intestinal issues in April this year.

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorized Bolsonaro to leave prison , where he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup, for the surgery.

But police were ordered to stay outside his room where computers and mobile phones were prohibited.

Deemed a flight risk following his conviction, the ex-president was detained in late November and began serving his 27-year sentence three days later.

News of the younger Bolsonaro's presidential candidacy this month rattled financial markets. Investors had bet the ex-president would back a more seasoned candidate such as Sao Paulo Governor Tarcisio de Freitas, his former infrastructure minister.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 14:21:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TINNE5BYCRI3JEXZ64WSAULC6U.jpg?auth=2aec62cb301630369fe93c9d57fae53ab63a44a3e745fd98ceaec9a18b73d5a1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia sees slow but steady progress in Ukraine peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-sees-slow-steady-progress-ukraine-peace-talks-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russia sees slow but steady progress in peace talks with the United States on Ukraine, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday.

"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong," Charles, 77, said in his fourth annual broadcast since becoming monarch.

"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life."

Charles spoke of "journeying" and the importance of showing kindness to people on the move - themes that resonate at a time of intense public concern over migration around the world.

His message, delivered from Westminster Abbey where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066, came at the end of a year marked by tensions in the royal family.

The king's words were followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir, wearing traditional Ukrainian "vyshyvanka" embroidered shirts, and the London-based Royal Opera Chorus.

Charles has frequently expressed his support for Ukraine and has hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at Windsor Castle three times in 2025 alone, most recently in October .

Although constitutionally required to remain above politics, the king has repeatedly spoken out on global crises, voicing concern over the Israel–Gaza conflict and expressing sorrow after violence against Jewish communities including an attack at a synagogue in northern England in October and Sydney's Bondi Beach shooting this month.

In his Christmas Day broadcast - a tradition dating back to 1932 - Charles praised military veterans and aid workers for their courage in adversity, saying they gave him hope.

In an address rich in references to the Biblical Christmas story, he also recalled his state visit to the Vatican in October, where he and Pope Leo prayed together in the first joint worship by a British monarch and a Catholic pontiff since England broke away from Rome in 1534. The British monarch is supreme governor of the Church of England.

Nearly two years after revealing an unspecified cancer diagnosis, Charles said this month that his treatment could be scaled back in the new year.

His daughter-in-law, Kate, Princess of Wales, announced in January that she was in remission after completing chemotherapy the previous September - rare disclosures for a family that traditionally guards its privacy.

Health was not the only challenge for the monarchy.

Charles stripped his younger brother Andrew of his titles as Duke of York and prince after renewed scrutiny of his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

But the year also brought a rare moment of reconciliation when Charles' younger son, Prince Harry, met his father for tea in September, their first meeting in just under two years.

Harry, who is based in the U.S., later said he hoped for healing, calling life "precious" and acknowledging limited time to mend ties.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:21:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WAF5VRVQSJPHRL7A4AXSWGSJIE.jpg?auth=1fbc08ba3aded865abe77eeefa4c948518b9d3ed979b2f00b99180159d705f78&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Forest great Robertson, 'Picasso of our game', dies at 72</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/forest-great-robertson-picasso-our-game-dies-72-2025-12-25/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 25 (Reuters) - John Robertson, the Nottingham Forest winger described by his manager Brian Clough as "a Picasso of our game", has died at the age of 72, the Premier League club said on Thursday.

He was a key member of Clough's all-conquering Forest team, assisting Trevor Francis's winner in their 1979 European Cup final victory over Malmo before scoring himself to sink Hamburg in the 1980 final.

"We are heartbroken to announce the passing of Nottingham Forest legend and dear friend, John Robertson," Forest said in a statement.

"A true great of our club and a double European Cup winner, John’s unrivalled talent, humility and unwavering devotion to Nottingham Forest will never ever be forgotten."

Robertson spent most of his career at the City Ground, making over 500 appearances across two stints at the club.

Clough once described him as a "scruffy, unfit, uninterested waste of time" who became "one of the finest deliverers of a football I have ever seen", usually with his cultured left foot.

Robertson was a stalwart of Forest's meteoric rise from the second division to winning the English first division title the following season in 1978 before the two European Cup triumphs.

He earned 28 caps for Scotland, scoring the winning goal against England in 1981, and served as assistant manager to former Forest teammate Martin O'Neill at several clubs, including Aston Villa.

"Rest in peace, Robbo… Our greatest," Forest said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:21:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swedish police investigating serious incident in Boden, north Sweden</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swedish-police-investigating-serious-incident-boden-north-sweden-2025-12-25/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Swedish police are investigating a serious incident in the northern town of Boden, they said on Thursday, with daily Aftonbladet reporting that a number of injured people had been taken to hospital.

Daily Aftonbladet said it had information that a violent crime had occurred and that the perpetrator had been shot by police.

He turned out to be a senior employee of the municipality of Triesen, south of Vaduz, who had been suspended a few days earlier due to irregularities in the accounts, police said.

Police later found the bodies of a 73-year-old man and two women, aged 68 and 45, in a Vaduz apartment. These were the municipality worker's parents and sister, police said.

"It was a really good conversation: many details, good ideas, that we discussed. There are some new ideas on how to bring the real peace closer, and it concerns formats, meetings, and, certainly, the timeline," Zelenskiy said on the Telegram app.

Trump has been pushing for a deal to end the almost four-year-long war, and in recent weeks peace efforts led by Witkoff and Kushner have been slowly inching forward.

Earlier this week, Zelenskiy presented a 20-point draft peace plan that he described as the main framework for ending the war.

The draft represented a slimmed-down version of an original 28-point plan the U.S. previously discussed with the Russian side that was widely seen as mainly benefiting Moscow as it demanded Kyiv cede territory and put curbs on its army.

However, key territorial questions remain unresolved in the new 20-point draft, Zelenskiy said, adding that a meeting with Trump would be required to solve the most sensitive issues.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Moscow was analysing the documents on ending the war which were brought to Moscow by Russia's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev from the United States.

The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Zelenskiy said that Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov planned to have one more conversation with the U.S. negotiators later in the day.

"We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine and to ensure that all documents and steps are realistic, effective, and reliable," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 18:32:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BRFMIOVEMJLG5C7LGRZ346YKZ4.jpg?auth=db07454891d26ead8ac48691d7398c4998f2a3e60cf75f0fe48a12c0fd8f785c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelensky holds talks with US envoys as Russia sees 'slow but steady' peace progress</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-zelensky-holds-talks-us-envoys-russia-sees-slow-steady-peace-progress</link><description>Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday he had had "very good" talks with US President Donald Trump 's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner , focused on ending the "brutal Russian war".

"We discussed certain substantive details of the ongoing work," he said in a post on social media.

"There are good ideas that can work toward a shared outcome and the lasting peace," he added.

Zelensky thanked the two envoys for their "constructive approach, the intensive work, and the kind words".

"We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine and to ensure that all documents and steps are realistic, effective, and reliable," he added.

They had also agreed during the conversation that Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov would speak with the two envoys again Thursday.

Zelensky's post came a day after having said that Ukraine had won some limited concessions in the latest version of a US-led draft plan to end the Russian invasion.

The 20-point plan, agreed on by US and Ukrainian negotiators, is being reviewed by Moscow . But the Kremlin has previously not shown a willingness to abandon its territorial demands for full Ukrainian withdrawal from the east.

Zelensky conceded on Wednesday that there were some points in the document that he did not like.

But he said Kyiv had succeeded in removing immediate requirements for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk region or that land seized by Moscow's army would be recognised as Russian.

Russia, meanwhile, said talks with the United States were making gradual headway.

"In ​the negotiation process on a settlement of the Ukraine conflict, I mean in the negotiation ‍process with the United States, ​there is slow but steady progress," she said.

Zakharova ‌added that Western European ‍powers were trying to torpedo the progress and suggested that the United States counter such ‍moves.

Kim ratified draft documents for the modernization of major munitions enterprises to be submitted to a key party congress expected to be held in early 2026, KCNA said, which will set a development plan for North Korea for the next five years.

Washington imposed visa bans on Tuesday on Ahmed and four Europeans, including French former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accuses them of working to censor freedom of speech or unfairly target U.S. tech giants with burdensome regulation. Ahmed lives in New York and is believed to be the only of the five currently in the country.

The move sparked an outcry from European governments who argue regulations and the work of monitoring groups made the internet safer by highlighting false information and compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.

For Ahmed, the 47-year-old CEO of the U.S.-based Center for Countering Digital Hate, it also sparked fears of imminent deportation that would separate him from his wife and child, both U.S. citizens, according to a lawsuit he filed on Wednesday in the Southern District of New York.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, when announcing the visa restrictions, said he had determined the presence of the five in the United States had potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States and they could therefore be deported.

Ahmed named Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump officials in his lawsuit, arguing officials were violating his rights to free speech and due process with the threat of deportation.

U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick issued a temporary restraining order on Thursday, which enjoined officials from arresting, detaining or transferring Ahmed before he has an opportunity for his case to be heard, and scheduled a conference between the parties for December 29.

Ahmed, in a statement provided by a representative, praised the U.S. legal system's checks and balances and said he was proud to call the country his home. "I will not be bullied away from my life’s work of fighting to keep children safe from social media’s harm and stopping antisemitism online," he said.

In response to questions about the case, a State Department spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here."

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

Legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, do not need a visa to remain in the U.S., but the Trump administration has attempted to deport at least one already this year.

Mahmoud Khalil, detained in March after his prominent involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, was released by a judge who argued punishing someone over a civil immigration matter was unconstitutional.

A U.S. immigration judge in September ordered Khalil to be deported over claims he omitted information from his green card application, but he appealed that ruling and separate orders blocking his deportation remain in place.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:19:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IIVEYADSFFPBTPSINDLSK3DXEU.jpg?auth=4624682c77119d5b92492184ef8774bacd7d92318f0c58d3c8b1a92b26d9d7a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US launches strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-launches-strikes-against-islamic-state-militants-northwest-nigeria-trump-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 25 (Reuters) - The United States carried out a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government, U.S. President Donald Trump and the U.S. military said on Thursday, claiming the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state at the request of the Nigerian authorities and killed multiple ISIS militants.

The strike comes after Trump in late October began warning that Christianity faces an "existential threat" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.

Reuters reported on Monday the U.S. had been conducting intelligence-gathering flights over large parts of Nigeria since late November.

Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the strikes were carried out as part of ongoing security cooperation with the United States, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups.

"This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West," the ministry said in a post on X.

A video posted by the Pentagon showed at least one projectile launched from a warship. A U.S. defense official said the strike targeted multiple militants at known ISIS camps.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on X thanked the Nigerian government for its support and cooperation and added: “More to come...”

Nigeria's government has said armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and U.S. claims that Christians face persecution do not represent the complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But it has agreed to work with the U.S. to bolster its forces against militant groups.

The country's population is split between Muslims living primarily in the north and Christians in the south.

Police said earlier on Thursday a suspected suicide bomber killed at least five people and injured 35 others in Nigeria's northeast, another region troubled by Islamist insurgents.

In a Christmas message posted on X earlier, Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu called for peace in his country, "especially between individuals of differing religious beliefs."

He also said: "I stand committed to doing everything within my power to enshrine religious freedom in Nigeria and to protect Christians, Muslims, and all Nigerians from violence."

Trump issued his statement on the strike on Christmas Day while he was at his Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago Club, where he has been spending the holiday. He had no public events during the day and was last seen by the reporters traveling with him on Wednesday night.

The U.S. military last week launched separate large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria , after Trump vowed to hit back in the wake of a suspected ISIS attack on U.S. personnel in the country.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:43:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/42VSMAOQ2JNULDBJDEFT27LIMY.jpg?auth=03c0a9c333315216ea77d2436b99f8054a3d03aa47d337026b2907e46458b42a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Political stability at stake as Malaysia's Najib awaits verdict in biggest 1MDB trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/political-stability-stake-malaysias-najib-awaits-verdict-biggest-1mdb-trial-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will hear a verdict on Friday in the biggest trial he faces over the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal , a ruling that could risk deepening tensions within the administration of current premier Anwar Ibrahim.

Investigators have said about $4.5 billion was allegedly stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund co-founded by Najib in 2009, and that more than $1 billion allegedly made its way into his personal bank accounts.

Najib, 72, last year apologised for mishandling the scandal while in office but he has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying he was misled by 1MDB officials and a fugitive financier, Jho Low, on the source of the funds.

In 2020, Najib was convicted of graft and money laundering for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit and began a 12-year prison sentence two years later after losing all his appeals. That sentence was later halved by a pardons board chaired by Malaysia's king, with Najib due for release in 2028.

A Malaysian high court will decide on Friday whether to convict Najib of four more charges of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering involving the illegal transfer of about 2.2 billion ringgit ($539 million) from 1MDB.

If found guilty, he could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.

The implementation of the penalties, however, could be stayed pending further appeals.

The decision will be closely watched after another court this week dismissed a bid by Najib to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.

That ruling reignited tensions in Anwar's ruling administration, which includes Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation.

UMNO campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll ended in a hung parliament.

Several UMNO leaders expressed disappointment with the decision to deny Najib house arrest, saying it risked diluting the powers of Malaysia's rulers, while others were angered by social media posts by some members of Anwar's coalition celebrating the ruling.

Anwar this week called for all parties to handle news of the verdict with patience and wisdom, adding that it was "inappropriate to muddy the atmosphere or add tension" even if there were those who chose not to sympathize with Najib and his family.

A guilty verdict for Najib on Friday could strain ties further, with some UMNO leaders already calling for the party to review its pact with Anwar or withdraw from the government altogether. An acquittal, however, may weaken Anwar, who has been under pressure to uphold his credentials as an anti-graft campaigner.

Anwar has been accused by critics of betraying progressive voters and allies after prosecutors dropped some corruption charges against Najib and other UMNO figures . The premier has repeatedly said he does not interfere in court cases.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5AKU6KBTAFI7RJOEFMTHLNA7R4.jpg?auth=5f6000b76bf2d89b4c69e0e03c632c92c80d8f4a38bd329209fd13a86b2f1303&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar to hold third phase of election voting on January 25, state media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-hold-third-phase-election-voting-january-25-state-media-reports-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Myanmar will hold a third phase of voting in its general election on January 25, according to an announcement in state media on Friday.

Faced with rising government bond yields and a weak yen, the Takaichi administration has stepped up efforts to reassure investors that the government will not resort to irresponsible debt issuance or tax cuts.

The budget for the year starting from April, to be submitted to parliament early next year, will total a record 122.3 trillion yen ($784.63 billion), exceeding this year's initial budget of 115.2 trillion yen.

Still, new government bond issuance will increase only slightly from this year's 28.6 trillion yen to 29.6 trillion yen, with the debt dependence ratio falling to 24.2%, the lowest since 1998.

Higher tax revenues, projected to rise 7.6% to a record 83.7 trillion yen, will help fund increased spending, though they will not fully offset surging debt-servicing costs, along with higher social welfare and defence outlays.

Debt-servicing costs for interest payments and debt redemption will jump 10.8% to 31.3 trillion yen, with the assumed interest rate set at 3.0%, the highest level in 29 years, as the Bank of Japan exits ultra-loose monetary policy.

Japan already has the highest debt burden in the developed world at more than twice the size of its economy, making it highly sensitive to rising borrowing costs and complicating Takaichi's plans to pursue aggressive fiscal stimulus measures.

Takaichi intends to drop the idea of using the annual primary budget balance as Japan's fiscal consolidation goal and set a new goal that extends through several years to allow more flexible spending.

The country's accident investigation board will not be in a position to release the interim update by the first anniversary on Monday of the worst aircraft accident on South Korean soil, the two board officials said. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

On December 29, 2024, the Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 made an emergency belly landing at Muan airport, overshot the runway then slammed into a concrete embankment and erupted into a fireball, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.

The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes .

The pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after the bird strike, investigators said in a July update that was not released publicly due to objections from victims' families.

Some of the family members said investigators appeared to blame the pilots without exploring other factors, such as the concrete structure beyond the end of the runway that likely made the disaster far more deadly.

"It feels like all kinds of doubts are just growing bigger and bigger. In the meantime, a year has gone by, and it feels like the frustration is only continuing to build," said Ryu Kum-Ji, a 42-year-old woman who lost both of her parents in the crash.

She joined other family members who shaved their heads and staged a protest in front of a presidential office, calling for an independent and transparent probe.

Missteps by the transport ministry, which oversees the investigation board, could also be a factor in the accident, Ryu said.

A transport ministry official told bereaved family members this month that it would examine their concerns.

"We take seriously your concerns saying that government's efforts were not sufficient in the process of (finding the truth)," the second vice minister of the transport ministry said. "The government will stand by the bereaved families and take a closer look."

South Korea's parliament will launch an independent probe into the crash on Tuesday.

Under the U.N. aviation body's rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident, and if that is not possible, an interim statement should be made public on every anniversary detailing the investigation's progress and any safety issues raised.

But the investigation board is not planning to release an update yet because of pending legislation designed to ensure its independence, said the two officials.

Lawmakers have proposed replacing board members and transferring oversight from the transport ministry to the prime minister's office.

"We will respect the decision of the newly formed committee regarding the timing of the interim statement's publication," said one of the board officials.

South Korea's anti-corruption body found in a report this week that the concrete embankment at Muan airport violated local and global standards that call for such structures to be "frangible" so they give way in case of impact. That meant it could "cause fatal damage to aircraft and occupants."

The board had planned public hearings in early December, but delayed them at the request of the victims' families and lawmakers. Police are also investigating the accident.

"All we want is for authorities to admit they were wrong if they did wrong, and apologise. Apology and a proper disclosure of the truth...that is what we want," Ryu said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:54:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UBPNCKVRIBNEJNR6C4HVY4DXVM.jpg?auth=65135a25b2e585b14ef141571e0e4e1aa5c4b89a00c082da29f749f0aaefd08f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Kyiv awaits Moscow’s response to the latest US-led plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251226-live-kyiv-awaits-moscow-s-response-to-the-latest-us-led-plan</link><description>Welcome to the France 24 liveblog covering the war in Ukraine and diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.

Yemen's main southern separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is supported by Abu Dhabi, has pushed the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from its headquarters in Aden while claiming broad control across the south earlier this month.

"The UAE reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to supporting all endeavours aimed at strengthening stability and development in Yemen," the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it remains hopeful that STC will end an escalation and withdraw its forces from the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra.

The STC was initially part of the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis. But the group has turned on the government and sought self-rule in the south.

Yemen has already been marred by a civil war since 2014, with the Houthis controlling the northern part of the country, including the capital Sanaa after forcing the Saudi-backed government to flee south.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 07:22:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia court finds ex-PM Najib Razak guilty of abuse of power in biggest 1MDB trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-court-finds-ex-pm-najib-razak-guilty-abuse-power-biggest-1mdb-trial-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was found guilty of abuse of power on Friday in the biggest trial yet in the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal , a ruling that could have significant political repercussions.

The judge had yet to deliver the full verdict and sentencing.

Malaysia and U.S. investigators say at least $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund Najib co-founded in 2009 while in office. More than $1 billion allegedly made its way into accounts linked to Najib, who has consistently denied wrongdoing.

Najib has been charged with four counts of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering for receiving illegal transfers of more than 2.3 billion ringgit ($569.45 million) from 1MDB. He had consistently denied wrongdoing.

"The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him," Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said in an ongoing reading of the verdict.

Najib could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.

Najib, 72, has been in prison since August 2022, when Malaysia's top court upheld a verdict convicting him of corruption for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit. His 12-year jail sentence in that case was halved last year by a pardons board.

Najib last year apologised for mishandling the scandal while in office but had consistently denied wrongdoing, saying repeatedly that he was misled by 1MDB officials and the fugitive financier, Jho Low, about the source of the funds.

Judge Sequerah in reading the verdict had earlier said evidence had revealed Najib had an "unmistakable bond and connection" with Low, who acted as the then prime minister's "proxy and intermediary" in 1MDB affairs.

Low, who has been charged in the United States for his central role in the case, denies all wrongdoing and his whereabouts are unknown.

Najib has maintained he was misled by Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that funds deposited into his account were donations from the Saudi royal family.

But Sequerah said Najib's argument was "implausible" and dismissed letters on the donations produced by Najib that allegedly originated from the Saudi royal family, saying they were not corroborated by evidence and were probably forgeries.

"The irresistible conclusion is that the Arab donation narrative is not meritorious ... the evidence pointed unmistakably to the fact that the monies were, in fact derived from 1MDB funds," Sequerah said.

The verdict came just days after another court denied a bid by Najib to serve his jail sentence under house arrest - a decision that reignited tensions within current Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration.

Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation, campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll ended in a hung parliament.

Some UMNO leaders expressed disappointment with the decision to deny Najib house arrest and others were angered by social media posts by some members of Anwar's coalition celebrating the earlier ruling.

Anwar on Tuesday called for calm, urging all parties to accept the court verdict with "full patience and wisdom".

Andrei Kolesnikov, the Kremlin correspondent for the Kommersant, one of Russia's top newspapers, said that Putin briefed top businessmen on the details of the plan at a late-night Kremlin meeting on December 24.

"Vladimir Putin asserted that the Russian side is still ready to make the concessions that he made in Anchorage. In other words, that 'Donbas is ours,'" Kommersant reported.

In essence, Putin wants the whole of Donbas but outside that area "a partial exchange of territories from the Russian side is not ruled out," Kolesnikov wrote in the newspaper.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in remarks to reporters released by his office on Wednesday, said Ukrainian and U.S. delegations had inched closer to finalising a 20-point plan at the talks over the weekend in Miami.

But Zelenskiy said Ukraine and the United States had not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas that it still controls - or on the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is controlled by Russian forces.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to end the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two and his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been negotiating with Russia, Ukraine and European powers.

The full detail of the U.S. proposals has not been disclosed, though Russian officials have repeatedly referred to unspecified "understandings" reached between Putin and Trump at a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, in August.

Russia controls all of Crimea which it annexed in 2014, about 90% of Donbas, 75% of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on the principles of the conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO.

According to Kommersant, Putin also raised the issue of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, at his meeting with businessmen.

Putin, according to Kommersant, said that joint Russian-U.S. management of the nuclear power station was being discussed.

Putin also said that the United States had expressed an interest in crypto mining near the plant and that the plant should be used to partially supply Ukraine, Kommersant said.

Zelenskiy has said that sensitive issues, including any compromises on territory, should be discussed at the level of heads of state, and Kyiv has been seeking a face-to-face meeting with Trump.

"We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the New Year," he said on X following the latest round of talks between Ukrainian and U.S. negotiators.

Zelenskiy held talks on Thursday with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

He said that some documents, part of a wider framework aimed at ending the conflict and ensuring Ukraine's reconstruction, were "nearly ready" while others were "fully prepared".

Earlier this week, Zelenskiy unveiled a 20-point draft peace plan that he described as the main framework for ending the war.

While the plan outlined Ukraine receiving security guarantees to prevent further Russian aggression, there was no compromise between Ukraine and the U.S. on the issues of territory, which Moscow is demanding Kyiv cede.

Control over the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant also remained the matter of further discussion.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H3YTXAF2KJLLJE6WDUBPND2AOE.jpg?auth=b848ea5fd9bdba0f29bb9c2a4686e72ac82f270c272a99a2c6d23c8c67c37cf6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones damage foreign-flagged vessels in southern ports, Ukraine says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/russian-drones-damage-foreign-flagged-vessels-southern-ports-ukraine-says-2025-12-26/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Russian overnight drone attacks damaged Slovakia-, Palau- and Liberia-flagged vessels in ports in Ukraine's Odesa and Mykolaiv regions, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Friday.

In recent weeks, Russia has escalated attacks on the southern Odesa region, and Ukrainian officials said Moscow aimed to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and sow chaos among civilians.

There were no casualties in Friday's strikes, Oleksiy Kuleba said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app, but the attacks caused power cuts and damaged elevators and civilian warehouses in the Odesa region.

Separately, Kuleba added, drones damaged a locomotive and a freight car at the northwestern Kovel railway station, around 60 kilometres (37.28 miles) from Poland.

"Despite Russia's deliberate terror, Ukraine's logistics system continues to function," Kuleba said.

The Seoul Central District Court cited a "lack of evidence" against the officials, who served in former President Moon Jae-in's administration and included ex-national security advisor Suh Hoon, and returned a verdict of not guilty.

The officials claimed before the trial that fisheries official Lee Dae-jun, who was shot dead by North Korean troops, had sought to defect to the North due to gambling debts, mental health issues and an unhappy life.

Lee's family refuted the allegations.

"The evidence submitted by the prosecutor alone is insufficient to admit that (the defendants) were trying to steer the matter to make it look like a defection to North Korea" beyond a reasonable doubt, the lower court said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear if prosecutors would appeal.

Authorities did not name the vessel or disclose its nationality. They said 16 foreign crew members had been detained on criminal charges. State TV said the tanker was seized on Wednesday.

Iranian news websites published video footage and photographs of what they said was the seized tanker.

Iran said last week it had seized another foreign tanker carrying 6 million litres of what it described as smuggled diesel in the Gulf of Oman without identifying the vessel or its nationality.

Iran, which has some of the world's lowest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and a sharp fall in the value of its national currency, has been seeking to curb widespread fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf states.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seoul court acquits ex-officials of tampering in case of man slain by North Korean troops</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/seoul-court-acquits-ex-officials-tampering-case-man-slain-by-north-korean-troops-2025-12-26/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran says foreign tanker carrying smuggled fuel seized in Gulf</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-foreign-tanker-carrying-smuggled-fuel-seized-gulf-2025-12-26/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korean prosecutors seek ten years in prison for ousted president Yoon</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251226-south-korea-prosecutors-request-10-year-term-for-ex-president-yoon-suk-yeol</link><description>An independent counsel on Friday demanded a 10-year prison term for South Korea’s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol in the first of seven criminal cases related to his ill-fated attempt to impose martial law in 2024 and other allegations that flared when he was in office.

The first of Yoon's trials to wrap up covers charges including his defiance of authorities’ attempts to investigate and detain him. Yoon denies all charges and his lawyers have argued that the detainment warrant was invalid and illegal.

The court is expected to render a verdict as early as next month.

Yoon faces other trials on accusations ranging from corruption and favor trading to rebellion, a grave charge that is punishable by life imprisonment or execution. The rebellion trial is also nearing an end.

Yoon’s martial law enactment brought armed troops into Seoul streets and triggered South Korea 's most serious political crisis in decades.

Martial law lasted only a few hours, as lawmakers managed to enter the National Assembly and voted to lift his decree. Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled parliament later in December 2024 before he was formally dismissed as president upon an Constitutional Court ruling in April.

On Friday, independent counsel Cho Eun-suk’s team requested the Seoul Central District Court to sentence Yoon to 10 years in prison on charges of obstruction of official duties, abuse of power, falsification of official documents and destruction of evidence.

Yoon holed up at his residence and hindered authorities' attempts to execute a warrant for his detention for weeks after his impeachment . The standoff caused worries about physical clashes between Yoon's presidential security service and those attempting to detain him and further deepened a national divide.

Park Eok-su, a senior investigator on Cho’s team, called Yoon's actions “an unprecedented obstruction of official duties” during Friday's court session.

Yoon also faces charges that he sidestepped a legally mandated full Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law, and that he fabricated documents including the martial law proclamation and ordered data deleted from phones used by those involved in his martial law imposition.

Yoon has denied those charges and maintained  that his decree was meant to draw public support of his struggle against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which impeached some of his top officials and obstructed his agenda.

Wrapping up a six-month probe last week, Cho’s team said Yoon plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate his political rivals and monopolize power.

Yoon's other trials deal with charges like the ex-leader ordering drone flights over North Korea to deliberately stoke tensions and justify his plans to declare martial law and committing perjury in the trial of his prime minster. Yoon also faces charges that he tried to manipulate the investigation into a marine’s drowning in 2023 and received free opinion surveys from an election broker in return for a political favor.

Yoon has said he wasn't informed of such drone flights and denied wrongdoing in the influence-peddling scandal.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:56:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bfd8e26c-e234-11f0-b5e4-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360240895524.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion at mosque in Syria's Homs kills three, says local official</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-mosque-syrias-homs-kills-three-says-local-official-2025-12-26/</link><description>DAMASCUS, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Three people were killed and five injured when an explosion struck a mosque in an Alawite neighbourhood in the Syrian province of Homs on Friday, a local official said.

President Donald Trump, in a post on Truth Social, claimed the group had been targeting primarily Christians in Nigeria "at levels not seen for many years".

The Sunni Muslim group emerged in Iraq and Syria and quickly created a "caliphate", declaring its rule over all Muslims and largely displacing al Qaeda.

At the height of its power from 2014-2017 it held swathes of the two countries, ruling over millions of people. It had a base only a 30-minute drive from Baghdad, and also held the city of Sirte on Libya's Mediterranean coast.

On its territory, IS sought to rule like a centralised government, imposing its interpretation of Islamic Sharia law strictly and deploying shocking brutality including public executions and torture.

Its fighters also carried out or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world.

The caliphate eventually collapsed in Iraq and in Syria after a sustained military campaign by a U.S.-led coalition.

After being ousted from its bases in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul, the group took refuge in the hinterlands of the two fractured countries.

It retains a significant presence in Syria and Iraq , parts of Africa including the Sahel region, and in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Fighters are scattered in autonomous cells, IS leadership is clandestine and its overall size is hard to quantify. The U.N. estimates a membership of 10,000 in IS heartlands.

Many foreign fighters have joined Islamic State's Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), named after an old term for the region that included parts of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.

In the Philippines, Islamic State affiliates remain active in southern areas, especially Mindanao, where pro-Islamic State militants controlled the city of Marawi in 2017.

IS has always wanted to spread its extreme form of Islam, but has adopted new tactics since the collapse of its forces and a string of other setbacks in the Middle East.

It is now a disparate group often operating through affiliates and sympathisers.

But it has retained the ability to carry out high-profile attacks, which it claims on its Telegram channels, often posting images as part of its plan to spread terror.

While IS militants operating across several regions share an ideology, there are no signs that they exchange weapons or financing.

The U.S. military believes the group's current leader is Abdulqadir Mumin, who heads the Somalia branch.

The shooting attack at a Jewish Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach has raised questions over whether the group is inspiring lone wolf attacks once again. The police said IS appeared to inspire the gunmen, who killed 15 people.

The men accused of carrying out Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years had spent time in the Philippines, where IS-linked networks are known to operate.

IS continues to strike and plot in Syria, where the government has signed a cooperation agreement with the U.S.-led coalition combatting the group .

This month, two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in Syria , opens new tab by a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathising with IS.

The U.S. military launched large-scale strikes against dozens of IS targets in Syria, after Trump vowed to hit back in the wake of a suspected IS attack on U.S. personnel in the country.

IS has expressed hatred for Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, calling him "Trump's boy" and accusing him of "establishing the worst and darkest chapter of treason in Islamic modern history", two days before the U.S. soldiers and interpreter were killed in Syria.

IS has also carried out attacks in Africa, showing it still has a global reach.

In October, it claimed responsibility for an attack that a U.N. mission said had killed at least 43 worshippers during a night mass at a church in eastern Congo.

In February, a military official said IS had attacked military bases in Somalia's northeastern Puntland state with suicide car and motorbike bombs, triggering airstrikes that killed 70 militants.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:46:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MNEAVZS3KRLWTK23R63WPROJUU.jpg?auth=01b39b01c1bd80819c5e0d2b4f3aa421c443a5ea5e8cb32b60c63fd80fbecacb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to meet Ukraine's Zelenskiy at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, Axios reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-meet-ukraines-zelenskiy-mar-a-lago-sunday-axios-reports-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday at Mar-a-Lago, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on social media platform X, citing a Ukrainian official.

His conviction is likely to heap years onto the six-year term he is already serving for a separate case related to the 1MDB fund.

The nation’s High Court found Najib, 72, guilty on four counts of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering related to more than $700 million channelled into his personal bank accounts from the 1MDB fund.

While Najib, the son of one of the country's founding fathers, was groomed for leadership from a young age, he experienced a spectacular fall from power as public anger mounted over the corruption scandal .

Since Najib's 2018 election loss, investigations under successive governments have ensnared him and wife Rosmah Mansor in graft allegations .

Prosecutors say Najib abused his positions as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chairman to move large amounts of money from the fund into his personal accounts more than a decade ago.

According to investigators, proceeds from the state fund were used to bankroll high-end real estate, a luxury yacht and precious artworks.

Friday's hearing opened around 9:00am (0100 GMT) before the Kuala Lumpur High Court in the country's administrative capital of Putrajaya.

Presiding Judge Sequerah started reading a lengthy verdict, before breaking for Friday afternoon prayers, with the hearing resuming at 3:00pm.

During the morning reading, Judge Sequerah dismissed several of the defence lawyers' arguments, including that Najib was duped by his close associate, the shadowy businessman Low Taek Jho , better known as Jho Low.

"The evidence clearly points to the fact that this was no coincidence but was evident of a relationship in which Jho Low operated as a proxy or agent of the accused with regard to the running of the affairs of 1MDB," Sequerah said.

The defence's argument that Najib was "misled and duped by management and by Jho Low is unmeritorious", the judge said.

Low, who is currently on the run, is seen as the mastermind behind the scheme to plunder the country's investment vehicle.

Sequerah also dismissed arguments that the money flowing into Najib's accounts was "donations" from Middle East funders, calling it a "tale that surpassed even those from the Arabian Nights".

The prosecution presented bank records, testimony from over 50 witnesses and documentary evidence.

Najib "paints himself as a victim of rogue subordinates, when in truth, he was the single most powerful decision-maker", deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib told the court during closing arguments.

"The accused wielded absolute financial, executive and political control," he said.

Najib's lawyers have previously said the politician was unaware that 1MDB's management was working hand in glove with Low to siphon large amounts of money from the fund, ostensibly established to foster economic growth in Malaysia .

Najib's lawyer, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, last week told journalists his client "never got a fair trial".

He again blamed Low for the scandal, which dented Malaysia's image abroad.

Najib has apologised for allowing the 1MDB scandal to happen during his tenure, but he maintains he knew nothing about illegal transfers from the fund.

His legal battle was dealt a blow on Monday after he lost a bid to serve the remainder of his current jail term at home rather than the Kajang Prison outside Kuala Lumpur.

Each count of abuse of power is punishable by up to 20 years in jail and a fine of up to five times the amount of the bribe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:48:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f1502624-22d5-11ed-b6bd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-08-23T095503Z_1851378304_RC272W93MP8B_RTRMADP_3_MALAYSIA-POLITICS-NAJIB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thai defence minister to attend truce talks with Cambodia, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-defence-minister-attend-truce-talks-with-cambodia-pm-says-2025-12-26/</link><description>BANGKOK, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Thailand's defence minister will join ongoing talks with Cambodia on Saturday that could lead to a truce, the Thai premier said on Friday, as border clashes between the two Southeast Asian neighbours continued for a third week.

If the defence minister is able to come to an agreement with his Cambodian counterpart, the two countries will make a deal in line with a previous pact brokered with the help of U.S. President Donald Trump following a previous round of clashes in July, he said.

"What is important is that both of us have to keep the promises that both will not threaten, offend, and instigate, and to reduce hostility between the two countries," Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters in Bangkok, referring to a potential deal.

A Cambodian defence ministry spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Thai and Cambodian officials have been holding parleys at a border crossing since Wednesday as hostilities between the two countries continued. The ceasefire broke down in early December, with at least 98 people killed on both sides and more than half a million on displaced.

Since the conflict restarted, neither Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim - chair of the ASEAN bloc that facilitated the previous ceasefire - nor Trump have been successful in halting hostilities.

The warring sides have also been pressed by Beijing to put an end to the fighting, with China's special envoy for Asian affairs Deng Xijun holding talks in Bangkok and Phnom Penh in recent days.

"I hope that this time will be the last time to sign such an agreement, so that there will be peace in the area and people can return to their homes," Anutin said.

Thailand and Cambodia have accused each other of moves that led to the breakdown of the July truce, which was expanded into a wider agreement in October to help settle the conflict.

The neighbours have long disputed sections of their 817-km (508-mile) land border, and the latest fighting has stretched from forested inland areas near Laos to coastal provinces.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 11:20:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XHWH46WONJLC3MULZK7F3ULCJE.jpg?auth=613076f7f3125a1687bf9e74e03ecbcb0689d4c41836b8afe2deb43e62746d5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli reservist rams vehicle into Palestinian man praying in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-reservist-rams-vehicle-into-palestinian-man-praying-west-bank-2025-12-26/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Dec 26 (Reuters) - An Israeli reservist soldier rammed his vehicle into a Palestinian man as he prayed on a roadside in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, after earlier firing shots in the area, the Israeli military said.

"Footage was received of an armed individual running over a Palestinian individual," it said in a statement, adding the individual was a reservist and his military service had been terminated.

The reservist acted "in severe violation of his authority" and his weapon had been confiscated, the military said.

Israeli media reported that he was being held under house arrest.

The Israeli police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Palestinian man went to hospital for checks after the attack, but was unhurt and is now at home.

Video which aired on Palestinian TV shows a man in civilian clothing with a gun slung over his shoulder driving an off-road vehicle into a man praying on the side of the road.

This year ​was one of the most violent on record for Israeli civilian attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to United Nations data that shows more than 750 injuries.

More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 7, 2023 and October 17, 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, according to the U.N. In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 11:40:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly blast hits Alawite mosque in Syria's Homs province</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251226-blast-alawite-mosque-in-syria-homs-province-kills-least-five</link><description>At least five people were killed in an explosion ⁠at a mosque of the Alawite minority sect in the Syrian city of Homs on Friday, Syrian state news agency ​SANA said.

Kremlin foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, spoke by telephone to several members of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He did not say when the call took place.

Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev brought paper copies of U.S. proposals for peace back to Moscow after a meeting in Miami at the weekend - and the details were being analysed by the Kremlin, Peskov said.

"The information was analysed, and on behalf of President Putin, contact took place between representatives of the administrations of Russia and the United States," Peskov said. "It was agreed to continue the dialogue."

When asked how the Kremlin viewed the documents, Peskov said that he did not want to comment as Russia felt making remarks in public could undermine the negotiations.

Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported that Putin told some of Russia's top businessmen that he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces in Ukraine but that he wanted the whole of Donbas.

Asked about the report, Peskov said that the Ukrainian peace discussions were touched upon "in general" and mentioned at the meeting. He gave no further details on the details of what was discussed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WGFEGIY5PVLWZPRBABY42JPBGU.jpg?auth=25ca3e5ec5e3afc0542aeb91a244bfc00328e0808a553d636926d79a7bbe9831&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON 2025: Morocco eye early qualification against Mali</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/sports/20251226-afcon-2025-morocco-eye-early-qualification-against-mali</link><description>Elsewhere in the sports news, the focus remains firmly on the Africa Cup of Nations .

But security experts say it is unclear whether such strikes can do much to hinder Islamist militants who have long menaced communities in the area.

Trump announced on Truth Social on Thursday that U.S. forces had launched a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government.

Local media reported loud explosions in the village of Jabo in the evening of Christmas Day. Reuters has not been able to confirm whether there were casualties.

Abuja confirmed it had approved the operation. Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said on Friday Nigeria had acted jointly with the U.S., but not targeting any specific religion.

“Nigeria is a multi-religious country, and we’re working with partners like the U.S. to fight terrorism and protect lives and property,” Tuggar told Nigeria's Channels Television.

Nigeria's population of over 230 million people is roughly evenly divided among Christians, who predominate in the south, and Muslims who predominate in the north.

Last month, Trump threatened to order his forces to take military action in Nigeria unless the authorities there acted to stop what he described as the persecution of Christians.

While Nigeria has had persistent security challenges, including violence and kidnappings by Islamist insurgents in the north, it strongly denies that Christians are subjected to systematic persecution.

Its government responded to Trump's threat by saying it intended to work with Washington against militants, while rejecting U.S. language that suggested Christians were in particular peril.

“After Trump threatened to come guns-blazing in Nigeria, we saw a Nigerian delegation visit the U.S.,” Kabir Adamu, managing director of Abuja-based Beacon Security and Intelligence Limited, told Reuters.

“The Attorney General was involved, and agreements were signed. Then we learned of U.S. surveillance missions mapping terrorist locations.”

Participating in the strikes could raise a risk that the government could be perceived as endorsing Trump's language on wider sectarian strife, a sensitive issue throughout Nigeria's history.

"Trump is pandering to domestic evangelical Christian objectives with his ‘Christian genocide’ narrative,” Adamu said.

The northwestern area where Thursday's airstrikes took place has been plagued since 2024 by increasing violence from members of the Lakurawa sect, a strict Sunni Islamist movement that claims affiliation with the Islamic State group.

Formed as a vigilante outfit, the group evolved into a jihadist movement enforcing strict Islamist rule across hundreds of villages in the area. Nigeria declared the group a terrorist organisation early this year.

"It’s very likely this is the group Trump referred to when mentioning U.S. military strikes in Nigeria,” said Confidence MacHarry, senior analyst at Lagos-based SBM Intelligence. “They’ve also been linked to widespread cattle theft, with most of the stolen animals ending up in markets along the Nigeria-Niger border."

But Adamu questioned whether the strikes would do much to counter the insurgents, noting that the particular village hit was not previously known for harbouring militants.

"We were told the Nigerian government okayed the attack, but why Jabo when there is no record of any group there?" he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:35:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WTIZZR45R5K4DFWVYXFDTRPUBI.jpg?auth=dbab212b106daa523fcdd101e0b38d3f2dc9cadd2283e756e21c1623f73c418e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia's ex-PM Najib ordered to serve 15 years in jail in 1MDB case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysias-ex-pm-najib-ordered-serve-15-years-jail-1mdb-case-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Friday sentenced former premier Najib Razak to serve 15 years in prison after convicting him on multiple counts of abuse of power and money laundering over his role in the multibillion-dollar fraud scandal at state fund 1MDB.

Israel's emergency services ​said one man, aged around 68, had been run over and had died. Israel's ‍public broadcaster said a woman, ​aged around 20, had been stabbed to ‌death. Both were pronounced dead at the ‍scene after medics were unable to resuscitate ‌them. A further two people suffered ‍mild injuries, including a teenager, it said.

"Preliminary investigation indicates this was a rolling terror attack that began in the city of Beit Shean, where a pedestrian was run over," the police said in a statement.

"Later, a young woman was stabbed near Road 71, and the suspect was ultimately engaged with gunfire near Maonot Junction in Afula following intervention by a civilian bystander," it said, adding that the attacker was hospitalised with injuries.

Israeli police said the alleged attacker was a Palestinian resident of ‍the occupied West ‌Bank .

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz ‍said he had instructed the military to respond forcefully ​in the West Bank town of Qabaitya, where he said the assailant came from, ‌to thwart any further attacks.

The Israeli military said it was "preparing ‍for an operation" in the area.

The war in Gaza has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and sparked a surge of violence in Israel and the occupied West Bank , with a rise in attacks by Palestinian militants as well as Israeli settler violence against Palestinians.

In September, Palestinian attackers opened fire at a bus stop during the morning rush hour in Jerusalem , killing six people and wounding another 12, according to Israeli officials.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:35:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0351139e-e257-11f0-8357-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25165720583686.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela frees 99 prisoners detained after post-election protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-frees-99-prisoners-detained-after-post-election-protests-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Venezuela freed 99 people jailed after last year’s election protests, the prisons authority said on Thursday, but rights groups said they believed the figure was lower despite growing pressure from Washington on President Nicolas Maduro.

The U.S. has amassed a huge military presence in the Caribbean, killed dozens in strikes on boats near the Venezuelan coast it alleges were carrying drugs, and seized two fully-loaded Venezuelan crude tankers. President Donald Trump has said it would be smart for Maduro to leave power.

Hundreds of people in Venezuela's capital Caracas and other parts of the South American nation took to the streets after the July 2024 presidential election, banging pots and pans and blocking roads, demanding the opposition be declared victors.

At least 2,000 people were arrested in post-election violence, according to the government, whose top prosecutor in the following moments announced the release of several groups of detainees, including dozens aged under 18.

Venezuela's electoral authority and Supreme Court said Maduro had won the election and that the protests sought to undermine his victory for a third six-year term.

Late on Christmas Day, the penitentiary services ministry said on social media that authorities had "decided to evaluate each case individually and grant precautionary measures in accordance with the law, which has led to the release of 99 citizens."

It said the group had been detained "for their participation in acts of violence and incitement to hatred following the 2024 election day."

The Committee for the Freedom of Social Activists, a local NGO, said on X that this "number does not correspond to reality."

Penal Forum, another NGO, said they had only been able to confirm the release of 45 people - 27 men, 15 women and three teenagers, who had been "arbitrarily detained for political reasons."

"We continue to verify other possible cases," it said.

Maduro's government says it does not have political prisoners but rather "imprisoned politicians" who seek to destabilize the country.

Earlier in December, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that repression of civic space in the South American nation had intensified, stifling people's freedoms as journalists, activists, opposition figures and humanitarian workers face threats, harassment and arbitrary detention.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:45:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel recognises Somaliland, Somalia's breakaway region, as independent state</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-recognises-somaliland-somalias-breakway-region-independent-state-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Israel has recognised Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia, as an "independent and sovereign state," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, making Israel the first country to do so.

The Southern Transitional Council, backed by the United Arab Emirates , said the strikes happened in Yemen’s Hadramout governorate. It wasn’t immediately clear if there were any casualties from the strikes that further raise tensions in the war-torn nation and put at risk a fragile Saudi-led coalition that has been battling the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the country’s north for a decade.

The separatists said they would not be deterred by the strikes, but added that they remained open to working with Riyadh.

“The Council affirms that such actions will not serve any path of understanding and will not deter the people of the South from continuing to move forward toward restoring their full rights,” the STC said in a statement.

Still, the group said it was open to “any coordination or arrangements” that guarantee security and unity in the South, prevent the return of security threats and meet both the aspirations of the southern population and shared interests with Saudi Arabia.

Amr Al Bidh, a foreign affairs special representative for the Council, said in a statement that its fighters had been operating in eastern Hadramout on Friday after facing “multiple ambushes” from gunmen. Those attacks killed two fighters with the STC and wounded 12 others, Al Bidh said.

The Saudi strikes happened after that, he added.

The STC later described their operations in the area as seeking a wanted man and trying to cut off smuggling through the area.

Faez bin Omar, a leading member in a coalition of tribes in Hadramout, said he believed the strikes served as a warning to the STC to withdraw its fighters from the area. An eyewitness to the strikes, Ahmed al-Khed, said he saw destroyed military vehicles afterward, believed to belong to forces allied to the STC.

The STC’s satellite channel AIC aired what appeared to be mobile phone footage it described as showing the strikes. In one video, a man speaking could be heard blaming the strike on Saudi aircraft.

Officials in Saudi Arabia did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, the kingdom called on the Emirati-backed separatists in southern Yemen to withdraw.

The Council moved earlier this month into Yemen’s governorates of Hadramout and Mahra . That had pushed out forces affiliated with the Saudi-backed National Shield Forces, another group in the coalition fighting the Houthis.

Those aligned with the Council have increasingly flown the flag of South Yemen, which was a separate country from 1967-1990. Demonstrators rallied on Thursday in the southern port city of Aden to support political forces calling for South Yemen to secede again from Yemen.

Following the capture of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north by the Houthis in 2014, Aden has been the seat of power for the internationally recognised government and forces aligned against the rebels.

The actions by the separatists have put pressure on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the OPEC+ oil cartel, but also have competed for influence and international business in recent years.

The UAE said in a statement Friday that it “welcomed the efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to support security and stability" in Yemen.

“The UAE reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to supporting all endeavours aimed at strengthening stability and development in Yemen, contributing positively to regional security and prosperity,” it added.

There has also been an escalation of violence in Sudan, another nation on the Red Sea, where the kingdom and the Emirates support opposing forces in that country’s ongoing war.

The Iranian-backed Houthis seized Sanaa in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognised government into exile. Iran denies arming the rebels, although Iranian-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen despite a UN arms embargo.

A Saudi-led coalition armed with US weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015. Years of inconclusive fighting have pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine.

The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the globe’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.

The Houthis, meanwhile, have launched attacks on hundreds of ships in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war, greatly disrupting regional shipping.

Further chaos in Yemen could again draw in the United States.

Washington launched an intense bombing campaign targeting the rebels earlier this year that US President Donald Trump halted just before his trip to the Middle East in October. The Biden administration also conducted strikes against the Houthis, including using B-2 bombers to target what it described as underground bunkers used by the Houthis.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:23:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1b4b4586-e262-11f0-a9da-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25359617616473.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone attack kills two soldiers in Chad near Sudan border, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/drone-attack-kills-two-soldiers-chad-near-sudan-border-sources-say-2025-12-26/</link><description>N'DJAMENA, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A drone attack killed two Chadian soldiers at a military camp near the Sudan border before dawn on Friday, local authorities and a security source said, adding it was not immediately clear who was behind the strike.

Two people were killed and one seriously injured in the attack on the border town of Tine, said Hamit Hassan, prefect of the department that includes Tine. He said he had no information on who was responsible.

A Chadian military intelligence officer told Reuters the drone came from Sudan but it was unclear whether it was launched by the country’s army or paramilitary Rapid Support Force.

"We are still in the process of confirming the origin of this drone. If it is a Sudanese military drone, we will exercise our right to retaliate," the officer, who asked not to be named because he wasn't authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters.

"The air force base in (the eastern city) Abeche is already on high alert and ground reinforcements are already in Tine."

Sudan's army and the RSF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tine serves as a transit camp for Sudanese refugees who later move on to safer camps away from the border, though humanitarian sources say a lack of funds to provide water, sanitation and shelter at inland camps has slowed relocation efforts.

The announcement Friday came hours after the United Nations human rights office released South Korea’s response to investigators urging Seoul to spell out concrete plans to address the grievances of adoptees sent abroad with falsified records or abused by foreign parents.

The issue had rarely been discussed at the UN level, even as South Korea faces growing pressure to confront widespread fraud and abuse that plagued its adoption programme, particularly during a boom in the 1970s and 1980s when it annually sent thousands of children to the West.

The country will phase out foreign adoptions over a five-year period, aiming to reach zero by 2029 at the latest as it tightens welfare policies for children in need of care, Vice Minister of Health and Welfare Lee Seuran said during a briefing.

Watch more South Korean adoption scandal: Belgian adoptees seek justice

South Korea approved foreign adoptions of 24 children in 2025, down from around 2,000 in 2005 and an annual average of more than 6,000 during the 1980s.

In the health ministry’s briefing and response to the UN, officials focused on future improvements rather than past problems.

“Adoptions were mainly handled by private adoption agencies before, and while they presumably prioritised the best interests of the child, there may have also been other competing interests,” Lee said.

“Now, with the adoption system being restructured into a public framework, and with the Health Ministry and the government having a larger role in the process for approving adoptions, we have an opportunity to reassess whether international adoption is truly a necessary option,” she added, citing efforts to promote domestic adoptions.

UN investigators, including special rapporteurs on trafficking, enforced or involuntary disappearances and child abuse, raised the adoption issue with Seoul after months of communication with Yooree Kim. The 52-year-old was sent to a French family in 1984 without her biological parents’ consent, based on documents falsely describing her as an abandoned orphan.

Kim said she endured severe physical and sexual abuse by her adopters and petitioned the UN as part of a broader effort to seek accountability from governments and adoption agencies in South Korea and France .

Citing broader systemic issues and Kim’s case, UN investigators criticised South Korea for failing to give adoptees effective access to remedies for serious abuses and for the “possible denial of their rights to truth, reparations, and memorialisation”.

They also voiced concern over the suspension of a government fact-finding investigation into past adoption abuses and fraud, despite reports of grave violations including cases that may amount to enforced disappearances.

In its response, South Korea highlighted past reforms focused on abuse prevention including a 2011 law that reinstated judicial oversight of foreign adoptions, which ended decades of control by private agencies and resulted in a significant drop in international placements.

South Korea also cited recent steps to centralise adoption authority.

However, the government said further adoption investigations and stronger reparations for victims would hinge on future legislation. It offered no new measures to address the vast backlog of inaccurate or falsified records that have blocked many adoptees from reconnecting with birth families or learning the truth about their origins.

Choi Jung Kyu, a human rights lawyer representing Kim, called South Korea’s response “perfunctory”. He noted that promises of stronger reparations, which were meant to reduce the need for victims to litigate, are not clearly spelled out in draft bills proposing a relaunch of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses.

The government also vetoed a bill in April that would have removed the statute of limitations for state-related human rights violations, although that was before President Lee Jae-myung took office in June. Lee issued an apology in October over past adoption problems, as recommended by the truth commission.

Choi, who represents multiple plaintiffs suing the government over human rights abuses under past dictatorships, said they often face prolonged legal battles when authorities dismiss truth commission findings as inconclusive or cite expired statutes of limitations.

Kim, who could not immediately be reached for comment, filed a rare petition for compensation against the South Korean government in August, noting that authorities at the time of her adoption falsely documented her as an orphan despite having a family.

Following a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the US and Australia, the truth commission in March recognised Kim and 55 other adoptees as victims of human rights violations including falsified child origins, lost records and child protection failures.

That was weeks before the commission halted its adoption investigation following internal disputes among commissioners over which cases warranted recognition as problematic. The fate of the remaining 311 cases, either deferred or incompletely reviewed, hinges on whether lawmakers establish a new truth commission through legislation.

The commission’s findings acknowledged state responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption programme rife with fraud and abuse. The programme was driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children’s backgrounds and origins. The findings largely aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press.

The AP investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to send some 200,000 Korean children overseas despite evidence that many were procured through questionable or unscrupulous means.

Seoul’s past military governments passed special laws promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and giving vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment procedures while shipping thousands of children overseas each year.

Western nations largely ignored the abuses and sometimes pressured South Korea to maintain the supply to meet their high demand for babies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:27:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b58e7d0c-e271-11f0-bc30-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360246423921.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New York plans patriotic NYE ball drop to mark USA's 250th birthday</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251226-new-york-plans-patriotic-nye-ball-drop-mark-usa-250th-year</link><description>When the ball drops on New Year’s Eve in New York City, it will sparkle in red, white and blue, ushering in 2026 and kicking off months of celebrations for the nation’s upcoming 250th birthday.

The patriotic touches at this year’s Times Square gathering, including a second confetti drop, will offer an early glimpse of what’s ahead: hundreds of events and programmes, big and small, planned nationwide to mark the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

“I’m telling you right now, whatever you’re imagining, it’s going to be much more than that,” said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the bipartisan commission created by Congress in 2016 to organise the semiquincentennial anniversary. “It’s going to be one for the ages, the most inspirational celebration this country and maybe the world has ever seen.”

Rios and her group worked with the Times Square Alliance business district and One Times Square, the building from which the ball drops, to make the changes to this year’s ceremonies. They're also planning a second ball drop on July 3, the eve of the nation’s birthday, “in the same beautiful style that Times Square knows how to do it", Rios said.

It will mark the first time in 120 years that there will be a ball drop in Times Square that doesn't occur on New Year’s Eve, she said.

A New Year’s Eve ball was first dropped in Times Square in 1907. Built by a young immigrant metalworker named Jacob Starr, the 700-pound (318-kilogramme), 5-foot- (1.5-metre-) diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs.

Last year, the Constellation Ball, the ninth and largest version, was unveiled. It measured about 12 feet (3.7 metres) in diameter and weighs nearly 12,000 pounds (5,400 kilogrammes).

The only years no ball drop occurred were 1942 and 1943, when the city instituted a nightly “dimout” during World War II to protect itself from attacks. Crowds instead celebrated the new year with a moment of silence followed by chimes rung from the base of One Times Square.

This year, the stroke of midnight will also mark the official launch of America Gives, a national service initiative created by America250. Organisers hope to make 2026 the largest year of volunteer hours ever aggregated in the country.

On the following day, America250 will participate in the New Year’s Day Rose Parade in Pasadena, California , with a float themed “Soaring Onward Together for 250 Years". It will feature three larger-than-life bald eagles representing the country’s past, present and future.

“We want to ring in this new year from sea to shining sea. What better way to think about it than going from New York to California,” Rios said. "This has to be community-driven, this has be grassroots. We’re going from Guam to Alaska, from Fairbanks to Philadelphia, and everything in between.”

President Donald Trump has also announced the “Freedom 250” initiative to coordinate additional events for the 250th anniversary.

Rios said she sees the wide range of celebrations and programmes planned for the coming months, from large fireworks displays and statewide potluck suppers to student contests and citizen oral histories, as an opportunity to unite a politically divided nation.

“If we can find something for everyone ... having those menus of options that people can pick and choose how they want to participate," she said. “That’s how we’re going to get to engaging 350 million Americans.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:50:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8b3db77c-e274-11f0-aa0c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25358639593329.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More rain expected in drenched California before drier weekend</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/more-rain-expected-drenched-california-before-drier-weekend-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Storm-hit Southern California was at risk on Friday of more floods hampering millions of motorists traveling after Christmas, but the National Weather Service predicts a drier weekend.

The holiday deluge that started in earnest on Christmas Eve was spawned by the region's latest atmospheric storm, a vast airborne current of dense moisture siphoned from the Pacific, that swept inland over the greater Los Angeles area.

It dumped 6 inches of rain in the Los Angeles area with up to 18 inches of rain in the mountains, washing out some roads, and spurred evacuations and some shelter-in-place orders.

An additional 1-to-3 inches of rain is expected on Friday, said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, a commercial forecasting company.

"Our overall picture is that there's just one more day of this mess, mostly across Southern California, specifically in the LA area," Kines said on Friday. "We still have some issues today with bouts of heavy rain, but this weekend is mainly dry, thankfully."

More than 14.5 million Californians were expected to travel by car over the Christmas holiday, according to AAA. The coming drier weather should make traveling easier, after days of slick or flooded roads, forecasters said.

The atmospheric river that brought the trouble will wind down through Friday across California with lingering heavy rainfall, heavy mountain snow, and gusty winds.

Many of the evacuation warnings issued in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties were lifted on Christmas Day. But the orders remain on Friday in the hard-hit town of Wrightwood, a rural community with a population of about 5,000 in the San Gabriel Mountains on the border between Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.

Aerial video footage posted online on Christmas Eve by the fire department showed rivers of mud coursing through inundated cabin neighborhoods, and mud-covered cars and homes.

Videos posted online on Thursday showed some residents scrambling over washed-out roads, picking through rubble on Christmas Day as streams of water still flowed over mounds of mud and into gullies that were once streets.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:19:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JOKXC5YHOVKINJKC2APJTAS2P4.jpg?auth=eaa7c3f54390f5b93e08cc21058549809215af1ebb84c18604e800d986724aac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio spoke with Honduras President-elect Asfura after election victory</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rubio-spoke-with-honduras-president-elect-asfura-after-election-victory-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Honduran President-elect Nasry Asfura to congratulate him on his victory, the State Department said on Friday.

Throughout his long political career, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had repeatedly singled out the Iranian Republic as Israel’s number one enemy, saying its nuclear program had one goal: the destruction of the Jewish state.

Meanwhile Iran had long called for Israel’s destruction and provided arms for its opponents in Gaza and Lebanon .

What was unclear was how a conflict between the two adversaries – both of which have considerable military might – could play out.

The question was answered in the early hours of June 13, 2025, as explosions were heard in the Iranian capital Tehran and Netanyahu announced that operation “Rising Lion” had begun.

The armed conflict between the two arch enemies drew in neighbouring countries Jordan and Qatar as well as the US , whose President Donald Trump dubbed it the “12-day war”.

Throughout 2024, Iran and Israel had been launching small-scale attacks on each other, with Tehran firing missiles and drones at Israel while Tel Aviv’s fighter jets targeted Iran’s missile launchers and aerial defences.

But the tit-for-tat skirmishes paled in comparison to Israel’s surprise operation launched on June 13. Overnight, 200 planes targeted military sites throughout Iran and the regime’s major nuclear sites at Natanz, Fordo and Isfahan.

Within a few hours, Israel had seized control of Iranian airspace, and in the 12 days that followed, its air force carried out operations across Iran’s territory.

Israel launched 360 attacks in 27 Iranian provinces throughout the 12-day war, with a third striking Tehran, according to US-based monitor ACLED .

Part of the success of operation “Rising Lion” came down to Israel’s use of of First Person View (FPV) drones , which can be operated remotely using an onboard camera. They were flown by Mossad agents working undercover inside Iran to target sensitive infrastructure and high-profile members of the regime from the conflict's first hours.

By the evening of June 13, Israel had overwhelmed Iran’s air defence system, carried out strikes on several Iranian cities and eliminated at least twenty of the regime’s senior officers.

These included Iran’s highest-ranking military officer, Mohammad Bagher, and Revolutionary Guards commander-in-chief Hossein Salami.

Nine of Iran’s top scientists were killed by targeted strikes in what French newspaper Le Monde described as a “decisive blow” to Tehran’s nuclear program.

Over the next 12 days, a total of 16 scientists would be killed by Israel.

Days after first launching the attack, Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was trying to eliminate Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

Trump said on June 17 that the US forces knew “exactly” where Khamenei was hiding but would not try to eliminate him – “at least not for now”.

Ultimately, Israel did not topple Iran’s longtime leader, but its 12-day assault on Iran did considerably weaken the regime’s military might.

“We have set Iran's nuclear project back by years, and the same goes for its missile program,” said Israeli army chief of staff Eyal Zamir on June 25.

Iran's stockpile of 2,500 ballistic missiles was reduced to a maximum of 1,500, and two-thirds of its missile launchers were destroyed, according to figures from the Israeli army.

In the Iranian capital, strikes targeted government buildings, state media outlets, universities and the infamous Evin prison .

They also hit civilians. Iran’s health ministry said that 610 civilians were killed and 4,700 wounded during the 12-day conflict. It did not say how many members of the military had been killed or wounded.

As Israel launched its attack on Iran, Tehran was quick to respond.

Khamenei issued a statement on June 13 assuring Iranians that Israel would “not remain unscathed from the consequences” of its attack and that the Iranian response would “not be half-measured”.

By the evening of June 13, Iran launched Operation Honest Promise 3, firing Shahed drones and hypersonic missiles towards Israel.

Air raid sirens sounded across the country as missiles flew across the sky above Jerusalem and strikes caused fires in buildings in Tel Aviv.

Iran fired least 150 missiles overnight, according to estimates from the Israeli army, most of which were intercepted with help from the United States and Jordan.

Major targets included Israel's “Pentagon”, the Kirya, and the country’s nuclear facilities. At least two people were killed and around 60 wounded, according to emergency services.

Over the coming days, the Israeli army banned the sharing of videos or photos on social media showing the damage caused by Iranian bombing,

But missile salvos caused significant damage in Israeli towns and cities, an oil refinery in Haifa, power plants, water treatment plants, Soroka Hospital in Beer-Sheva and the research centre at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot.

Iran fired some 550 missiles and 1,000 drones, 90 percent of which were intercepted by Israel and its allies, according to the Israeli army.

Some 36 direct hits on populated areas killed at least 28 civilians and injured 3,000, according to ACLED.

Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz mapped the damage caused by Iranian missiles in urban centres, finding that 480 buildings were damaged in Tel Aviv across five separate sites, “obliterating” some neighbourhoods.

In the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, 237 buildings were damaged across three sites, with around ten being severely damaged.

In Bat Yam, another Tel Aviv suburb, 78 buildings were damaged by a single strike, with 22 of them subsequently condemned for demolition.

Israelis submitted 40,000 compensation claims to the authorities for damage caused by Iran’s attacks, but the population as a whole were overwhelmingly supportive of their prime minister's decision to attack Iran.

As Israel and Iran traded strikes, the US delayed joining the war alongside Tel Aviv. “I may do it, I may not do it,”Trump said on June 18 – day five of the conflict. “Nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

In previous months Trump had urged Netanyahu not to attack Iran as he sought to reach a nuclear deal with Tehran, but was quick to praise Israel’s strikes on the first day of the war as “excellent” and “very successful”.

Meanwhile, Israel was pressing Trump to provide it with “bunker buster” bombs to deliver a fatal blow to Iran's nuclear programme.

The US finally deployed its GBU-57 bombs – 13-ton laser-guided munitions designed to destroy underground bunkers – overnight on June 21 as part of operation "Midnight Hammer".

Seven B2 stealth bombers carrying the munitions took off from the US state of Missouri and entered Iranian airspace, where they targeted the two main sites for the production and storage of enriched uranium buried dozens of metres underground at the Fordo and Natanz sites.

Hidden in desert areas in central Iran, defences at the two sites had already been weakened by Israel's air strikes.

At Fordo, 12 bunker-buster bombs were dropped successively on two ventilation shafts, according to the US military . Two other bombs were dropped on the Natanz site, while US Navy submarines fired two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at the Nuclear Technology Center in Isfahan.

Trump announced that Iran's main nuclear sites had been “completely and totally destroyed” by the strikes, although US intelligence later contradicted this claim .

Two days later, Iran retaliated by bombing the largest US base in the Middle East , Al-Udeid in Qatar .

But Tehran had warned Washington in advance of the strikes, and the dozen missiles caused no American casualties.

Claiming the US had achieved its objectives by preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, Trump took to his social media network on June 24 to declare an end to the war.

“It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE… an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Israel and Iran continued to launch attacks on each other for a few hours, with final strikes targeting the Iranian capital and Beer-Sheva in southern Israel, before fighting stopped – and both sides claimed victory.

Netanyahu claimed a "historic" triumph for his country and warned that Israel would “thwart” any future attempts by Iran to revive its nuclear program.

Iran's top security body, meanwhile, said the Islamic Republic's forces had "compelled" Israel to "unilaterally" stand down.

Denmark was also traditionally thought of as a "frugal" member of the EU when it came to common expenditure. But all this has changed with the war in Ukraine and the long shadow that Russia casts over the Baltic and Nordic regions.

Denmark's stated priority for its presidency of the EU in 2025 is "A Competitive and Green Europe". Combining those two objectives has arguably become a strength for the kingdom, as it has long been a pioneer in green energy . Wind power, especially offshore, produces over 50 percent of the country's electricity needs. Danish Green MEP Rasmus Nordqvist joins us as we visit an iconic wind farm just off the coast of the capital Copenhagen .

Despite its small size, Denmark is also a major player when it comes to agriculture – especially on intensive farming. Here again it's a pioneer, becoming the first country in the world to tax livestock methane emissions, also known as a flatulence tax. Our team visit a dairy farm in Jutland to see the impact there.

Economically, Denmark has historically been export-oriented: its modest population and its maritime history mean it has long been outward facing when it comes to trade. Our team heads to the country's second-biggest container port at Fredericia, to discuss the effects of US President Donald Trump 's and China 's international tariffs . We meet MEP Niels Flemming Hansen, from the conservative European People's Party.

Finally, we tackle another key issue: Greenland . It's an autonomous territory in Denmark with a significant independence movement, and its strategic location and its natural resources make it a tempting target for the US president. Greenland was thrust into the international spotlight earlier this year because of Trump's sudden interest in the territory. Our team interview Jens Heinrich, the head of Greenland's representation in Denmark.

From Danish design and from pharma to farmers, our reporter Luke Brown visits some of the most emblematic sectors of the Danish economy, to gauge the impact of the global economic headwinds.

Denmark was also traditionally thought of as a "frugal" member of the EU when it came to common expenditure. But all this has changed with the war in Ukraine and the long shadow that Russia casts over the Baltic and Nordic regions.

We take a closer look at one of the key priorities of Denmark's EU presidency: Europe 's defence policy, in an era marked by the US retreat from Europe and Russia's increasingly aggressive posture. Indeed, Denmark has been dealing with a series of drone incursions over its territory. To discuss these issues, our team meets with one of the vice-presidents of the European Parliament , Danish MEP Christel Schaldemose from the Socialists and Democrats, as well as with the head of the Danish Defence Intelligence Service, Thomas Ahrenkiel.

We also illuminate a specifically Danish phenomenon: a left-leaning, Social Democratic-led government that pursues a very hard line on migration and asylum. It's a strategy that seems to be gaining ground in the EU. This December, EU member states gave the green light to tightening immigration policy, including the setting up of controversial "return hubs" outside the bloc.

At home, Denmark's move to crack down on what the government calls "parallel societies" has faced accusations that it discriminates against people of migrant heritage. To discuss these questions, we meet with former Renew MEP Karen Melchior from the European think tank CEPS (Centre for European Policy Studies), and we visit Nørrebro, a multicultural district of Copenhagen , where we watch local football team Nørrebro United.

Our reporter Charlotte Prudhomme investigates the impact of fake news in Denmark, and the efforts being made to counter them.

And our reporter Luke Brown meets the people most affected by Denmark’s hard line on immigration: two young women who fled Syria a decade ago. We discuss how they cope with the uncertainty of not knowing if they'll be able to stay in Denmark.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, has become Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending much of his adult life in and out of detention due to his activism, and a rare symbol of opposition to a far-reaching crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

The lengthy imprisonment of Abd el-Fattah, who obtained British citizenship through his mother, Laila Soueif, in 2021, and his repeated hunger strikes alongside her prompted widespread international pleas for his release.

She confirmed his return on Facebook: "Praise be to Allah, Alaa reached London safely".

In a longer statement, his family said he flew to Britain on Friday from Cairo after his travel ban was lifted by Egyptian authorities on December 20. The statement said he would shortly be reunited with his 14-year-old son Khaled, who lives in Brighton in southern England with his mother.

"I'm delighted that Alaa Abd el-Fattah is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief," Starmer said on social media platform X.

"I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment."

Despite campaigns calling for Abd el-Fattah's release, notably during the COP27 climate summit that Egypt hosted in 2022 , Sisi pardoned him in September this year, having ordered authorities to study his possible pardon . Abd el-Fattah's name had been removed from Egypt's "terrorism" list months earlier.

On Friday, Starmer also thanked the president for his decision to grant the pardon.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:16:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man arrested after three women stabbed on Paris metro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251226-man-arrested-after-three-women-stabbed-on-paris-metro</link><description>French police on Friday arrested a man suspected of stabbing three women in the Paris metro as the capital's end-of-year festivities were in full swing, prosecutors told AFP.

The man was identified using surveillance-camera footage, and officers tracked the geolocation of his mobile phone to locate and arrest him later in the afternoon in the Val d’Oise region north of Paris.

The researchers' assessment broadly aligns with U.S. intelligence findings, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share information not authorized for public release.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made clear his intention to place intermediate-range Oreshnik missiles, with an estimated range of up to 3,400 miles (5,500 km), in Belarus, but the exact location has not been previously reported.

Deployment of the Oreshnik would underscore the Kremlin’s growing reliance on the threat of nuclear weapons as it seeks to deter NATO members from supplying Kyiv with weapons that can strike deep inside Russia, some experts said.

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Belarus Embassy declined to comment. The state-run Belta news agency quoted Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin on Wednesday as saying that the Oreshnik’s deployment would not alter the balance of power in Europe and was “our response” to the West’s “aggressive actions.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the CIA declined to comment.

Researchers Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in California, and Decker Eveleth of the CNA research and analysis organization in Virginia, said they based their finding regarding the deployment of Oreshniks on imagery from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, that showed features consistent with a Russian strategic missile base.

Lewis and Eveleth said they were 90 percent certain that mobile Oreshnik launchers would be stationed at the former airbase near Krichev, some 190 miles (307 km) east of the Belarus capital of Minsk, and 300 miles (478 km) southwest of Moscow.

Moscow tested a conventionally armed Oreshnik – Russian for Hazel tree - against a target in Ukraine in November 2024. Putin boasts that it's impossible to intercept because of velocities reportedly exceeding Mach 10.

Putin plans to deploy the weapon “in Belarus to extend its range further into Europe,” said John Foreman, an expert with the Chatham House who served as a British defense attache in Moscow and Kyiv.

Foreman said he also sees such a move as a reaction to the planned stationing in Germany next year by the U.S. of conventional missiles that include the intermediate-range hypersonic Dark Eagle.

The Oreshnik’s deployment would come with only weeks left before the expiration of 2010 New START pact, the last U.S.-Russia treaty limiting deployments of strategic nuclear weapons by the world’s biggest nuclear powers.

Putin said after a December 2024 meeting with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, that the Oreshnik could be stationed in Belarus in the second half of this year - part of a revised strategy in which Moscow is basing nuclear weapons outside its territory for the first time since the Cold War.

Lukashenko last week said that the first missiles had been deployed without mentioning a location.

Lukashenko said up to 10 Oreshniks would be based in Belarus. The American researchers assessed that the site is large enough to accommodate only three launchers and that others may be based at another location.

U.S. President Donald Trump works to reach a deal with Moscow to end its war in Ukraine, which has been urging its Western allies to send weapons that can reach deep inside Russia.

Trump for now has rejected Kyiv’s request for Tomahawk cruise missiles, capable of striking Moscow. Britain and France have supplied cruise missiles to Ukraine. Germany in May announced it will co-produce long-range missiles with Ukraine with no limits on their range or targeting.

The American researchers said reviews of the Planet Labs imagery revealed a hurried construction project that began between August 4-12 and showed features consistent with those of a Russian strategic missile base.

One “dead giveaway” in a November 19 photo is a “military-grade rail transfer point” enclosed by a security fence to which missiles, their mobile launchers and other components could be delivered by train, said Eveleth.

Another feature, said Lewis, is the pouring at the end of the runway of a concrete pad that then was covered with earth that he called “consistent with a camouflaged launch point.

Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based expert on Russia’s nuclear forces, said he was skeptical deploying the Oreshnik would provide Moscow with any additional military or political advantages other than reassuring Belarus of its protection.

“I don’t see how this would be seen in the West...as kind of different from these being deployed in Russia,” he said.

But Lewis said deploying the Oreshnik in Belarus underscored how Russia’s stationing of nuclear weapons outside its territory sent a “political message” of its increased reliance on them.

“Can you imagine if we put a nuclear-armed Tomahawk (cruise missile) in Germany instead of just the conventional ones?” Lewis said. “There is no military reason to put the system in Belarus, only political ones.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:38:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WNWMR54JURLYPCLBDGCLPKPVYE.jpg?auth=5eb5dfaab54de26e837db37339f078f74d3ae5a14bbabae893da9718e1aaf367&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's top court orders detention of ex- head of highway police after escape attempt</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-top-court-orders-detention-ex-head-highway-police-after-escape-attempt-2025-12-26/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Brazil Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Friday ordered the preventive detention of the former head of the country's federal highway police, who was captured in Paraguay, according to a court document seen by Reuters and information from two people familiar with the matter.

Silvinei Vasques, who served under former President Jair Bolsonaro, was caught while trying to board a plane at Asuncion airport in neighboring Paraguay, in an attempt to reach El Salvador, after breaking a court-ordered ankle monitor.

Vasques was recently sentenced to 24 years and six months in prison for his role in a 2023 attempted coup , the same incident for which Bolsonaro is now serving a 27-year sentence for orchestrating the plot.

The former cop, who was not yet in jail, apparently broke his electronic ankle monitor while in Brazil's southern state of Santa Catarina, prompting security alerts at border checkpoints, according to the Supreme Court document.

Vasques, caught with a fake Paraguayan passport, planned the escape using a rented car and even took his dog with him, the document said, adding that the attempt to flee warranted converting precautionary measures like the electronic tag into preventive detention.

Reached by Reuters, Vasques' attorney did not comment on his client´s attempt to flee.

Vasques is not the first official convicted over the 2023 coup attempt who has tried to flee Brazil. In November, the Supreme Court ordered the arrest of the former intelligence agency director Alexandre Ramagem, who left the country in September and has since been living in the United States.

That same month, Moraes ordered Bolsonaro be detained after the former president tried to remove his court-ordered ankle monitor using a soldering iron. Bolsonaro was then under house arrest.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:23:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZN6ET5HN5JLR3MXEAP4TLRLU2M.jpg?auth=ca43379f7fb6c688b10b8fb5d0ba8f9726d411caca7631e803788db97aaf2335&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says Russia using Belarus territory to circumvent Ukrainian defences</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/zelenskiy-says-russia-using-belarus-territory-circumvent-ukrainian-defences-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that Russia was using ordinary apartment blocks on the territory of its ally Belarus to attack Ukrainian targets and circumvent Kyiv's defences.

The Kremlin used Belarusian territory to launch its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and Belarus remains a steadfast ally, though longstanding President Alexander Lukashenko has vowed to commit no troops to the conflict.

"We note that the Russians are trying to bypass our defensive interceptor positions through the territory of neighbouring Belarus. This is risky for Belarus," Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram after a military staff meeting.

"It is unfortunate that Belarus is surrendering its sovereignty in favour of Russia's aggressive ambitions."

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian intelligence had observed that Belarus was deploying equipment to carry out its attacks "in Belarusian settlements near the border, including on residential buildings.

"Antennae and other equipment are located on the roofs of ordinary five-storey apartment buildings, which help guide 'Shaheds' (Russian drones) to targets in our western regions. This is an absolute disregard for human lives, and it is important that Minsk stops playing with this."

The Russian and Belarusian defence ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Zelenskiy said the staff meeting also discussed ways of financing interceptor drones, which officials in Kyiv see as the best economically viable means of tackling Russian drone attacks, which have grown in intensity in recent months.

The president said the Ukrainian military's general staff had been charged with working out changes to strategy in fending off air attacks "to defend infrastructure and frontline positions."

Lukashenko this month said Russia's Oreshnik ballistic missile system, described by Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin as impossible to intercept, had been deployed to Belarus and entered active combat duty.

An assessment by two U.S. researchers, reported by Reuters on Friday , said Moscow was likely stationing the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik at a former air base in eastern Belarus, a development that could bolster Russia’s ability to deliver missiles across Europe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 21:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NFKAV6CM5BPNNHDXJYBYKTGNOI.jpg?auth=dc84c1ada42e2b578f14e8e7e4c5046669d74fb2544ee70faef4743c152a97d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelans held in Salvadoran prison look to challenge deportation in US court</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/venezuelans-held-salvadoran-prison-look-challenge-deportation-us-court-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - A group of Venezuelans who were sent to a maximum-security El Salvador prison from the U.S. and then returned to Venezuela called on Friday for the United States to comply with a ruling that would allow them to challenge their deportation in U.S. courts.

U.S. Judge James Boasberg ruled this week that President Donald Trump's administration must urgently arrange for the return of the hundreds of Venezuelans who were deported to El Salvador, saying their expulsion violated their due process rights and that they have the right to challenge their deportation in court.

Under the ruling, the Trump administration must present a plan to allow their return within two weeks.

"The court ruling now orders that we be granted the opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with the law in the United States," Ysqueibel Peñaloza, a former detainee, said on behalf of some 252 former prisoners.

"We call on the governments of the United States and El Salvador to fully comply with the court order. We demand that the authorities of that country create the conditions that will allow us to participate in the hearing."

Peñaloza asked for national and international help in their defense, without specifying what help they needed.

The Venezuelans were sent to El Salvador from the U.S. in March after Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemy Act - a little-used wartime law - to deport people classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, without carrying out hearings or usual migration procedures.

Many lawyers and family members denied the men in question had any links to gangs and said they were often left in the dark about the location of the detainees.

The deportations drew strong criticism from human rights groups and spawned a legal battle with the Trump administration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:20:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q3TXQ7MC7FLMJIDK75YNF4ZIF4.jpg?auth=d2e96fc1946bc602efada3990e4ed15629f4ccffbde29119b44fd87cc1d5ad4f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian capital Kyiv under massive Russian attack, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-capital-kyiv-under-massive-russian-attack-officials-say-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian capital Kyiv came under a massive Russian attack early on Saturday, with explosions sounding in the city, air defences in operation and the Ukrainian military saying missiles were being deployed.

The Russian action took place two days before a meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he is due to hold in the United States with President Donald Trump to work out details of an accord for settling the nearly four-year-old war pitting Russia against Ukraine.

Reuters eyewitnesses said air defences were in action in the city and unofficial Telegram channels reported explosions.

A military Telegram channel said cruise and ballistic missiles were being deployed in the city.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 03:24:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>بيان لوزارة الدفاع الكمبودية: تايلاند وكمبوديا توقعان اتفاقا لوقف إطلاق النار</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-cambodia-sign-ceasefire-agreement-cambodian-defence-ministry-says-2025-12-27/</link><description>بانكوك 27 ديسمبر كَانُون ٱلْأَوَّل (رويترز) - أعلنت وزارة الدفاع الكمبودية في بيان لها أن تايلاند وكمبوديا وقعتا اتفاقا لوقف إطلاق النار اليوم السبت، وذلك بعد ثلاثة أيام من المحادثات بين الجارتين الواقعتين في جنوب شرق آسيا واللتين خاضتا اشتباكات حدودية عنيفة لأسابيع.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:07:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RSJQETYPTFJUVLQBN32DYO7BLY.jpg?auth=2c2c98f52619d096eef373d750b17643b11f7ce79ee1dc3cc88aab04e6a92672&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones, missiles pound Ukraine before Zelenskiy-Trump meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drones-missiles-pound-ukraine-before-zelenskiy-trump-meeting-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Russia attacked Kyiv and other regions of Ukraine with missiles and drones on Saturday, ahead of what President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said would be a key meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to work out a deal to end nearly four years of war.

Before the overnight attacks, Zelenskiy said his talks in Florida on Sunday would focus on the territory to be controlled by each side after a halt to the fighting that began in February 2022 with President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Russia's smaller neighbour, Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

Explosions sounded in Kyiv as Ukraine's air defence units went into action, and the military said on the Telegram messaging app that missiles were being deployed. The air force said Russian drones were targeting the capital and regions in the northeast and south.

An air raid alert remained in effect in the capital some four hours after being introduced. There were no immediate reports of damage or power cuts.

Russia made no immediate comment on the attacks.

On Thursday night, Russia struck Ukraine's energy infrastructure and stepped up attacks on the southern region of Odesa, the site of Ukraine's main seaports.

Amid the continued fierce fighting, territory remains the main diplomatic stumbling block. A 20-point draft in the U.S.-driven campaign to clinch a peace plan is 90% complete, Zelenskiy told journalists in Kyiv.

He said a security guarantee agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. was almost ready - a key element after guarantees in earlier post-Soviet years proved meaningless.

"A lot can be decided before the New Year," Zelenskiy told Politico.

Trump said the United States was the driving force behind the process.

"He doesn't have anything until I approve it," Trump told Politico. "So we'll see what he's got."

Zelenskiy told Axios the U.S. had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to guard against further Russian aggression.

Trump said he believed Sunday's meeting would go well. He also said he expected to speak with Putin "soon, as much as I want."

In addition to territory, a critical point is control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe's largest, seized by Russia in the opening weeks of the war.

Moscow demands that Ukraine withdraw from the areas of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian troops have failed to occupy in their drive to secure all of the Donbas, which also includes the Luhansk region.

Kyiv wants the fighting halted at the current lines.

Under a U.S. compromise, a free economic zone would be set up if Ukraine leaves parts of the Donetsk region, though details have yet to be worked out.

Axios quoted Zelenskiy as saying that if he is not able to push the U.S. to back Ukraine's "strong" position on the land issue, he was willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum - as long as Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold the vote.

He said he wanted more pressure applied to Russia.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Kyiv's version of the 20-point plan differed from what Russia had been discussing with the U.S., according to Interfax-Russia news agency.

But he expressed optimism that matters had reached a "turning point" in the search for a settlement.

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, spoke with members of the Trump administration after Moscow received U.S. proposals about a possible peace deal, the Kremlin said on Friday. It did not disclose how Moscow had viewed the documents.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:07:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ERFF4HEXTNODTFIJFGN5DA4ZCM.jpg?auth=9722bc7db3b121ab7ecea3b5bcceda55c2c25ab22c5caa2b78ef76884fc20368&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar goes to the polls amid civil war and humanitarian crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-goes-polls-amid-civil-war-humanitarian-crisis-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Myanmar heads to the polls on Sunday as it battles a civil war that has ravaged parts of the country as well as one of Asia's worst humanitarian crises.

Already one of Southeast Asia's poorest countries, Myanmar has been hammered by a conflict triggered by a 2021 coup in which the military ousted an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.

Myanmar's humanitarian crisis is one of the most severe in Asia, driven by the intensifying civil war and repeated natural disasters, including a massive earthquake in March.

The ruling junta has previously suppressed information about a severe food crisis gripping the country by pressuring researchers not to collect data about hunger and aid workers not to publish it, Reuters has reported , besides cracking down on journalists since the coup.

Myanmar is one of the world's most under-funded aid operations, with only 12% of required funds received, the United Nations says.

U.S. cuts to humanitarian aid are having a crushing impact on people, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar has said.

The UN estimates that 20 million of Myanmar's 51 million people need aid as soaring inflation and a plunging currency push about half the population below the poverty line.

More than 3.6 million people have been displaced from their homes, with over 6,800 civilians killed in the conflict triggered by the coup, according to UN estimates.

With mounting violence forcing increasing numbers of people to flee, more than 12 million in Myanmar will face acute hunger next year, including 1 million who will need lifesaving support, according to the UN's World Food Programme.

More than 16 million people across Myanmar are acutely food insecure, meaning that their lack of food threatens lives and livelihoods, WFP estimates.

They are the fifth-largest group needing aid anywhere in the world, making Myanmar "a hunger hotspot of very high concern," the agency said.

More than 540,000 children across the country are expected to suffer this year from acute malnutrition - life-threatening wasting that can have severe and lifelong effects – a 26% increase from last year, WFP said.

One in three children under the age of five is already suffering from stunted growth, according to WFP.

Myanmar's economy - once deemed as one of the region's most promising - has struggled in recent years, reeling from the civil war, natural disasters and mismanagement.

But despite the challenges, Myanmar's economy is showing some signs of improvement and its GDP growth is estimated to rebound to 3% in the next fiscal year, the World Bank said this month.

The projected growth is driven by post-earthquake reconstruction and continued targeted assistance for the hardest-hit areas, although inflation is expected to remain above 20%.

With electricity supply deteriorating, exposing millions of people to chronic blackouts, households and businesses are increasingly embracing solar energy for reliable power.

Russia, which has been building ties with the junta, signed an investment agreement with Myanmar in June that it said could open up new opportunities for Russian energy companies in the south Asian country.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:07:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZJDZTPOPFVKG5KQX3IJQR6GURM.jpg?auth=4a0fa285dc22d15abe1793d11eeb79723df381f246ea6ce88a576b166368e753&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Conflict and fear sap campaign energy ahead of Myanmar election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/conflict-fear-sap-campaign-energy-ahead-myanmar-election-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Campaigning ahead of Myanmar's general election that begins on Sunday has been shorn of the energy of previous polls, residents said, as voting is scheduled amid a civil war and a humanitarian crisis as well as wide criticism that it is a sham to help the junta perpetuate power.

Myanmar has been in the throes of a nationwide conflict since the military deposed an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup, alleging poll fraud in a general election held the preceding year.

Although the junta insists the election has popular backing, the vote has been widely criticised by the United Nations, Western governments and human rights groups as an attempt by the military to entrench its rule through political proxies.

Three residents of Myanmar's commercial capital Yangon, parts of which will vote on Sunday, said they remember past campaigns being rife with activity, including lively rallies, noisy road shows and large gatherings.

"This time, the candidates did not really come out on the streets. I only see sign boards on the streets about them," said a 31-year-old from Yangon, who asked not to be named because of security concerns.

"I am someone who goes out the whole day, but I don't see any candidates campaigning even for USDP and for smaller parties," he added, referring to the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party.

After the first phase on Sunday, the military-led administration will hold two more on January 11 and January 25 , covering areas across 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships.

Dates for counting votes and announcing the results have not been declared.

A decade ago, when Myanmar held its second election since the end of five decades of military rule in 2011, streets were awash with sign boards and flags in the signature red of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), creating a carnival-like atmosphere.

Even the 2020 election, subdued by COVID-19 restrictions, had a more visible campaign , four people said.

In the city of Mandalay, about 600 km (370 miles) north of Yangon, the lack of campaigning is palpable, with no sustained canvassing for votes just days ahead of the polls, two residents said.

"The only real activity is the setting up of campaign billboards," 36-year-old Nwe told Reuters, adding that the few rallies being held were under guard.

"When parties campaign in neighborhoods, they don't go alone," she said, "They travel in groups with security."

The USDP, led by former generals from Myanmar's armed forces known as the Tatmadaw, has the most visible campaign presence on the streets, all five voters said.

The United Nations said on Tuesday that civilians were being threatened over their participation in the polls, both by Myanmar's military authorities and by armed groups opposing the Tatmadaw.

"These elections are clearly taking place in an environment of violence and repression," said UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk.

All five residents interviewed by Reuters said they had received no direct instruction from junta officials asking them to vote, although there was fear of the consequences of not casting their ballot.

The shadow National Unity Government, which contains remnants of the NLD and other anti-junta entities, said it was not putting pressure on people to abstain from voting.

Mandalay resident Nwe said people worry that not voting could lead to travel restrictions and other repercussions.

"Rumors are rampant, so even though there is no official news, people are privately terrified," she said.

In Yangon, a 34-year-old resident said his family doesn't want him to vote, fearing that he might be included in a military conscription scheme that the Tatmadaw enacted in 2024.

"For me, I am scared of getting arrested if I don't vote," he told Reuters.

Ahead of the polls, Myanmar's junta has said the election is not being conducted with coercion, force or suppression.

In an opinion piece on Thursday, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar argued that observers were wrong to judge the upcoming polls by Western standards.

"They fail to see that for ordinary citizens, this election – however imperfect – is an exit strategy from the state of emergency and a path back into a legal framework," it said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:09:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LRWZGXWGEBLUNGFQLKXKMXMS3A.jpg?auth=63d5de6a5c6dc1cccabed1f06578fe62e426706a0c710b310117ce35aa3032e7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 7 killed in Vietnam after bus overturns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/least-7-killed-vietnam-after-bus-overturns-2025-12-27/</link><description>HANOI, Dec 27 (Reuters) - At least seven people died on Saturday when a bus carrying 19 passengers overturned on a mountainous road in Vietnam's northern province of Yen Bai, state-run media reported.

The 29-seat bus carrying a charity group was travelling downhill when it flipped and was crushed, according to Vietnam News Agency.

Rescue teams pulled 10 survivors from the wreckage, while others remained trapped as of 10:30 a.m. (0330 GMT) as heavy equipment was deployed to cut through the vehicle, Hoang Anh Tuan, chairman of Phinh Ho commune, told VNA.

Tuan said the crash was likely caused by brake failure.

Calls to authorities of Yen Bai province and Phinh Ho commune went unanswered.

Police, military units, local officials and residents were mobilised for rescue efforts, while authorities said an investigation into the cause of the accident was ongoing, according to VNA.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:52:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S.-backed airstrikes in Nigeria hit two ISIS-linked camps, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-backed-airstrikes-nigeria-hit-two-isis-linked-camps-government-says-2025-12-27/</link><description>LAGOS, Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S.-backed air strikes in Nigeria hit two Islamic State-linked camps in the Bauni forest of Sokoto State, targeting foreign fighters infiltrating from the Sahel, the Nigerian government said.

The strikes carried out on Thursday were approved by President Bola Tinubu and launched from maritime platforms domiciled in the Gulf of Guinea, after extensive intelligence gathering, operational planning, and reconnaissance, the information ministry said in a statement on Friday.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Thursday that U.S. forces had launched a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government. He said the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

"A total of 16 GPS-guided precision munitions were deployed using MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial platforms, successfully neutralising the targeted ISIS elements attempting to penetrate Nigeria from the Sahel corridor," the Nigerian government statement said.

Intelligence indicated the camps were being used by foreign ISIS elements working with local affiliates to plan large-scale attacks inside Nigeria, it added. No civilian casualties were reported, although debris fell in two towns in Sokoto and Kwara states.

Trump described the operation as “numerous perfect strikes” and warned there would be “more to come.”

The operation marks a rare joint action between Abuja and Washington and underscores growing security cooperation as Islamist violence spreads south from the Sahel.

Sokoto State authorities confirmed the strikes and urged residents to remain calm. “The ongoing operations are geared towards securing the state and ensuring the protection of lives and property,” the state government said.

Nigeria has battled Islamist insurgents for more than a decade, but the presence of foreign fighters linked to ISIS signals an escalation in the threat. The Nigerian government said it remains “fully committed to the protection of lives and property” and vowed further action against transnational extremist networks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D2ZJDB7AMVPU5C3YSCUW4ALY3U.jpg?auth=71b3a410e821b269427c5f7412d0e365548ce4741c7aa961fd1997985fa70e06&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's Saudi-led coalition says it will deal with military moves in Hadramout</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-saudi-led-coalition-says-it-will-deal-with-military-moves-hadramout-2025-12-27/</link><description>CAIRO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Yemen's Saudi-led coalition said any military moves by the main southern separatist group STC in the eastern province of Hadramout contrary to de-escalation efforts will be dealt with to protect civilians, the Saudi state news agency reported on Saturday.

The statement from the coalition spokesperson, General Turki al-Malki, was in response to a request from the head of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, to the coalition to take immediate measures to protect civilians in Hadramout from "violations committed armed groups affiliated with the STC".

The STC, which is supported by the United Arab Emirates, has pushed the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from its headquarters in Aden while claiming broad control across the south this month.

On Friday the STC rejected a Saudi call for its forces to withdraw from areas it seized earlier in December, saying it would continue securing the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DHIGYFAPQVIIVGRXLLRZQ4H27I.jpg?auth=24ec9fdc25b80ddfe088ebce9aca7faab43d36ce92e8c08425a1471822207b39&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China passes revised foreign trade law to bolster trade war capabilities</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-revised-foreign-trade-law-bolster-trade-war-capabilities-2025-12-27/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China on Saturday passed revisions to a key piece of legislation aimed at strengthening Beijing's ability to wage trade war, curb outbound shipments from strategic minerals to sex dolls, and further open its $19 trillion economy.

The latest revision to the Foreign Trade Law, approved by China's top legislative body, will take effect on March 1, 2026, state news agency Xinhua reported on Saturday.

The world's second-largest economy is overhauling its trade-related legal frameworks partly to convince members of a major trans-Pacific trade bloc created to counter China's growing influence that the manufacturing powerhouse deserves a seat at the table, as Beijing seeks to reduce its reliance on the U.S.

Adopted in 1994 and revised three times since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, most recently in 2022, the Foreign Trade Law empowers policymakers to hit back against trading partners that seek to curb its exports and to adopt mechanisms such as "negative lists" to open restricted sectors to foreign firms.

The revision also adds a provision that foreign trade should "serve national economic and social development" and help build China into a "strong trading nation", Xinhua said.

It further "expands and improves" the legal toolkit for countering external challenges, according to the report.

The revision focuses on areas such as digital and green trade, along with intellectual property provisions, key improvements China needs to make to meet the standards of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, rather than the trade defence tools the 2020 revamp honed in on following four years of tariff war with the first Trump administration.

Beijing is also sharpening the wording of its powers in anticipation of potential lawsuits from private firms, which are becoming increasingly prominent in China, according to trade diplomats.

"Ministries have become more concerned about private sector criticism," said one Western trade diplomat with decades' of experience working with China. "China is a rule-of-law country, so the government can stop a company's shipment, but it needs a reason."

"It's not totally lawless here. Better to have everything written out in black and white," they added, requesting anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak with media.

China's private exporting firms attracted global attention in November after the French government moved to suspend the Chinese e-commerce platform Shein amid an uproar over childlike sex dolls sold on its marketplace into the French market.

The Chinese government increasingly could also find itself at odds with private enterprise when seeking to carry out sweeping bans, such as Beijing's prohibition of all Japanese seafood imports, as Asia's top two economies continue to feud over Taiwan, trade diplomats say.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4WJ67X4DTNP37H6ZVA2L4FWAK4.jpg?auth=6e6bf242c2950dbe833f407d84c50416c28c8ead098ad6a3e1b1c62f3b6db035&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Poland temporarily closes two airports after Russian strikes on Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251227-live-poland-temporarily-closes-two-airports-after-russian-strikes-on-ukraine</link><description>Several powerful explosions rocked Kyiv on Saturday as authorities warned that the Ukrainian capital was under threat of missile attack.

Yet in 2025, one experience brought them together: protests. Generation Z – born between the late 1990s and early 2010s – shared frustration and anger at elites seen as out of touch, and a determination to be heard.

Across countries separated by thousands of kilometres, similar scenes unfolded, featuring young crowds, hand-painted placards, viral slogans born on platforms like TikTok or Discord and simple demands.

"This is a generation that is not acting only for itself, but so that everyone has access to education, healthcare and housing, and to put an end to corruption in power," said sociologist Michel Wieviorka, director of studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS). “It is a protest driven by universal values.”

The movement began in Indonesia at the end of the summer. In Jakarta, the announcement of housing allowances for MPs – nearly ten times the minimum wage – acted as a trigger, prompting students to take to the streets.

One symbol quickly emerged from the marches: the pirate flag from the world’s best-selling manga, "One Piece", which became the emblem of the Gen Z revolt.

In September, the movement gained dramatic momentum in Nepal. Viral videos on Instagram and TikTok exposed the lavish lifestyles of “nepo-kids”, while the government blocked around twenty digital platforms.

Anger erupted in Kathmandu, where parliament was set on fire . For two days, the country was gripped by violent riots.

The shockwave then reached Africa . In Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo, youth-led protests no longer denounced only water and power cuts but also demanded the resignation of the president.

"We are not asking for luxury, just the means to live with dignity," demonstrators chanted, many of them students or young precarious workers.

In Morocco , mobilisation took a different form. The Gen Z 212 collective – a reference to the country’s telephone code – organised on Discord, coordinating calls to demonstrate and pushing its priorities, including school reform, access to healthcare and social justice.

On the American continent, Peruvian youth mobilised from Lima to Cusco against political instability, corruption and record levels of insecurity.

While demands differed, the broader context was similar.

"These are countries where democracy, if it exists, remains illiberal or weakly liberal," Wieviorka said. "They are also more or less authoritarian regimes, where power responds with repression, fuelling a spiral of violence."

The toll was heavy: a dozen people were killed in Indonesia, at least three in Morocco and five in Madagascar . In Nepal , at least 76 people died and more than 2,000 were injured, according to police.

Despite repression, Generation Z made gains. In Nepal, the protest movement led to the fall of the government.

In an unprecedented move, an interim prime minister – former Supreme Court chief justice Sushila Karki – was appointed following a vote organised on Discord.

A commission of inquiry was tasked with shedding light on the deaths of protesters.

For Nepal’s youth, this marked a victory: for the first time, a mobilisation born online and on the streets resulted in a tangible political transition.

In Madagascar, the outcome left a bitter taste. After several weeks of demonstrations, President Andry Rajoelina was overthrown in a military coup.

The government that followed, however, remained in the hands of a familiar actor in the country’s political life: the army.

"The military hijacked a protest that had failed to constitute itself as a political force," Wieviorka said.

In Morocco, the protest did not shake the monarchy but forced the authorities to respond.

The royal cabinet announced modernisation measures and investments in hospitals and schools, implicitly acknowledging the legitimacy of the demands.

Repression nevertheless tempered the momentum. According to official figures, 1,473 young people remain detained, including 330 minors.

In Nepal, mobilisation has not subsided. Early legislative elections are scheduled for March 2026.

"We are in the second phase of the movement," protester Yujan Rajbhandari told AFP.

The focus has shifted to voter registration and the fight against corruption.

"We won’t stop," he said.

Elsewhere, the future remains uncertain.

"This movement can endure and produce lasting effects, or on the contrary, fade away as a whole," Wieviorka said. "There are no rules."

Recent history urges caution. From the Arab Spring to Spain’s “indignados”, from Occupy Wall Street to France’s Nuit debout , movements have emerged, lost momentum and sometimes left lasting traces, sometimes not.

"Social movements are not eternal," Wieviorka said.

One feature nevertheless distinguishes Generation Z: its ability to organise, impose its themes and extract concessions without immediately seeking to take power.

"They do not have a fully formed political platform,” Wieviorka said. “But they do have a clear horizon: that of profound change."

The issue is one of 20 points laid out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a framework peace proposal.

Here are some of the issues regarding the facility:

Russia took control of the plant in March 2022 and announced plans to connect it to its power grid. Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Zelenskiy stated at the end of December that the U.S. side had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.

Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian proposal envisages Ukrainian-American use of the plant, with the U.S. itself determining how to use 50% of the energy produced.

Russia has considered joint Russian-U.S. use of the plant, according to the Kommersant newspaper.

The plant is located in Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnipro River and the Kakhovka Reservoir, 550 km (342 miles) southeast of the capital Kyiv.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed reactors. They were all built in the 1980s, although the sixth only came online in the mid-1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It has a total capacity of 5.7 gigawatts, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) database.

Four of the six reactors no longer use Russian nuclear fuel, having switched to fuel produced by then-U.S. nuclear equipment supplier Westinghouse.

After Russia took control of the station, it shut down five of its six reactors and the last reactor ceased to produce electricity in September 2022. Rosatom said in 2025 that it was ready to return the U.S. fuel to the United States.

According to the Russian management of the plant, all six reactors are in "cold shutdown."

Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of striking the nuclear plant and of severing power lines to the plant.

The plant's equipment is powered by electricity supplied from Ukraine. Over the past four years these supplies have been interrupted at least eleven times due to breaks in power lines, forcing the plant to switch to emergency diesel generators.

Emergency generators on site can supply electricity to keep the reactors cool if external power lines are cut.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi says that fighting a war around a nuclear plant has put nuclear safety and security in constant jeopardy.

Russia has been preparing to restart the station but says that doing so will depend on the situation in the area. Rosatom chief Alexei Likhachev has not ruled out the supply of electricity produced there to parts of Ukraine.

Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said Moscow intended to use the plant to cover a significant energy deficit in Russia's south.

"That's why they are fighting so hard for this station," he said.

In December 2025, Russia's Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision issued a license for the operation of reactor No. 1, a key step towards restarting the reactor.

Ukraine's energy ministry called the move illegal and irresponsible, risking a nuclear accident.

Russia has been pummelling Ukraine's energy infrastructure for months and some areas have had blackouts during winter.

In recent months, Russia has sharply increased both the scale and intensity of its attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, plunging entire regions into darkness.

Analysts say Ukraine's generation capacity deficit is about 4 gigawatts, or the equivalent of four Zaporizhzhia reactors.

Kharchenko says it would take Ukraine five to seven years to build the generating capacity to compensate for the loss of the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Kharchenko said that if Kyiv regained control of the plant, it would take at least two to three years to understand what condition it was in and another three years to restore the equipment and return it to full operations.

Both Ukrainian state nuclear operator Energoatom and Kharchenko said that Ukraine did not know the real condition of the nuclear power plant today.

In the long term, there is the unresolved problem of the lack of water resources to cool the reactors after the vast Kakhovka hydro-electric dam was blown up in 2023, destroying the reservoir that supplied water to the plant.

Besides the reactors, there are also spent fuel pools at each reactor site used to cool down used nuclear fuel. Without water supply to the pools, the water evaporates and the temperatures increase, risking fire.

An emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel pool caused an explosion in Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.

Energoatom said the level of the Zaporizhzhia power plant cooling pond had dropped by more than 15%, or 3 metres, since the destruction of the dam, and continued to fall.

Ukrainian officials previously said the available water reserves may be sufficient to operate one or, at most, two nuclear reactors.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 10:22:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4G3ZSP2FQJLVJCVJUTH77ISEZU.jpg?auth=d67762e0ceecda8e582464dbdb667325e0464e9babe76e6a28911c25a7900967&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Army chief says Switzerland can't defend itself from full-scale attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/army-chief-says-switzerland-cant-defend-itself-full-scale-attack-2025-12-27/</link><description>ZURICH, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Switzerland cannot defend itself against a full-scale attack and must boost military spending given rising risks from Russia, the head of its armed forces said.

The country is prepared for attacks by "non-state actors" on critical infrastructure and for cyber attacks, but its military still faces major equipment gaps, Thomas Suessli told the NZZ newspaper.

"What we cannot do is defend against threats from a distance or even a full-scale attack on our country," said Suessli, who is stepping down at the end of the year.

"It's burdensome to know that in a real emergency, only a third of all soldiers would be fully equipped," he said in an interview published on Saturday.

Switzerland is increasing defence spending, modernising artillery and ground systems and replacing ageing fighter jets with Lockheed Martin F-35As.

But the plan faces cost overruns, while critics question spending on artillery and munitions amid tight federal finances.

Suessli said attitudes towards the military had not shifted despite the war in Ukraine and Russian efforts to destabilise Europe.

He blamed Switzerland's distance from the conflict, its lack of recent war experience and the false belief that neutrality offered protection.

"But that's historically inaccurate. There are several neutral countries that were unarmed and were drawn into war. Neutrality only has value if it can be defended with weapons," he said.

Switzerland has pledged to gradually raise defence spending to about 1% of GDP by around 2032, up from roughly 0.7% now – far below the 5% level agreed by NATO countries.

At that pace, the Swiss military would only be fully ready by around 2050.

"That is too long given the threat," Suessli said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 10:45:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VBXQOJDH6RPCVC5JX3ONHMLNFQ.jpg?auth=7b73f4696593685ced02fa0e49db175cc19985b628f8514b5d86894a22fac7af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish family missing after boat sinks off Indonesia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/spanish-family-missing-after-boat-sinks-off-indonesia-2025-12-27/</link><description>MADRID, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A Spanish family of four is missing after a boat carrying eleven people sank off the coast of Indonesia in extreme weather, Spanish authorities and an Indonesian news agency said on Saturday.

The strikes carried out on Thursday were approved by President Bola Tinubu and launched from maritime platforms domiciled in the Gulf of Guinea, after extensive intelligence gathering, operational planning, and reconnaissance, the information ministry said in a statement on Friday.

US President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Thursday that his country's forces had launched a strike against Islamic State group militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria 's government. He said the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

"A total of 16 GPS-guided precision munitions were deployed using MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial platforms, successfully neutralising the targeted ISIS elements attempting to penetrate Nigeria from the Sahel corridor," the Nigerian government statement said.

Watch more Nigerians call for government action against worsening insecurity

Intelligence indicated the camps were being used by foreign Islamic State group elements working with local affiliates to plan large-scale attacks inside Nigeria , it added. No civilian casualties were reported, although debris fell in two towns in Sokoto and Kwara states.

Trump described the operation as “numerous perfect strikes” and warned there would be “more to come”.

The operation marks a rare joint action between Abuja and Washington and underscores growing security cooperation as Islamist violence spreads south from the Sahel.

Sokoto State authorities confirmed the strikes and urged residents to remain calm. “The ongoing operations are geared towards securing the state and ensuring the protection of lives and property,” the state government said.

Nigeria has battled Islamist insurgents for more than a decade, but the presence of foreign fighters linked to the Islamic State group signals an escalation in the threat. The Nigerian government said it remains “fully committed to the protection of lives and property” and vowed further action against transnational extremist networks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 11:39:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8c3e567c-e314-11f0-b89a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-26T163203Z-839028605-RC2BOIAF5Q1O-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-NIGERIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 15 dead, 19 injured in Guatemala bus accident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/least-15-dead-19-injured-guatemala-bus-accident-2025-12-27/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Dec 27 (Reuters) - At least 15 people were killed and 19 injured after a passenger bus plunged into a ravine on the Inter-American Highway in western Guatemala, authorities said on Saturday.

Ukraine was embroiled in a string of corruption scandals that led to the resignation of the chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky . They also revealed a $100 million kickback scheme in the battered energy sector, masterminded by an alleged personal friend of the president.

"NABU and SAPO, following an undercover operation, exposed an organised criminal group that included current members of parliament," the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) said.

"Employees of the State Security Department are resisting NABU officers during investigative actions in committees of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine," it added, referring to Ukraine's parliament.

The anti-corruption agency did not reveal details related to the investigation .

Journalists from Ukrainska Pravda media outlet Mykhailo Tkach said in a social media post that detectives were allowed into the government quarters.

The investigation became public as Zelensky departed for talks in the US about efforts to formulate a plan to end the war in Ukraine, and after Russia sent scores of drones and missiles against the capital Kyiv, killing one and wounding dozens.

The reform, presented by Giorgia Meloni's coalition two years ago, limits the powers of Italy's powerful court of auditors, responsible for ensuring compliance with Italian and European Union rules on the use of public funds.

Meloni's right-wing government has clashed frequently with various branches of Italy's judiciary , accusing judges of leftist bias and hampering its initiatives on areas from public works to immigration.

Just two months ago the auditors' court refused to authorise a landmark government plan to build a bridge connecting Sicily to the mainland, a ruling denounced by Meloni as "intolerable interference."

The bill was passed in the upper house Senate on Saturday by 93 votes to 51.

Among the changes introduced, it stipulates that the maximum penalty for administrators who are negligent in the use of public money cannot exceed 30% of the loss caused by their actions, or the equivalent of two years of their salary.

The bill also contains a "silence means consent" clause by which if an administrator requests the court's opinion on a spending authorisation, it must reply within 30 days or else the authorisation is deemed valid and the administrator is shielded from any future sanctions.

The government says the changes will help the economy by speeding up procedures and overcoming a widespread hesitation among politicians to sign off on public works for fear of running foul of the auditors' court.

Members of the court and opposition lawmakers have warned it will lead to wasteful spending and possible malfeasance.

Alfredo Bazoli, a Democratic Party senator, said it showed the government aimed to "demolish controls on those with power."

The reform comes ahead of a more sweeping and contentious overhaul of Italy's justice system to separate the career paths of prosecutors and judges, a move the government says will curb conflict of interest between the two groups and political bias.

That reform faces a national referendum in the spring.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:24:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YOOJMYDPAVIFRALS75XXKR5TNA.jpg?auth=4250de28f6fee788ada883859db76185f83c1452ab224aa156af71cfec24296a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canada to provide $2.5 billion in economic aid for Ukraine, prime minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-provide-25-billion-economic-aid-ukraine-prime-minister-says-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Saturday announced an additional $2.5 billion of economic aid for Ukraine.

Putin said that if Ukraine did not want to resolve the conflict peacefully then Russia would accomplish all goals of its "special military operation" by force, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

Earlier on Saturday, responding to Russia's vast overnight drone and missile attack , Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia was demonstrating its wish to continue the war, while Kyiv wanted peace.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin's remarks.

The Kremlin said earlier that the Russian president, who inspected one of the command posts of the Russian armed forces, received reports from the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, and commanders of the "Centre" and "East" groups of Russian forces.

Russian commanders told Putin that Moscow's forces had captured the towns of Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Artemivka in Ukraine's Donetsk region, as well as Huliaipole and Stepnohirsk in the Zaporizhzhia region, the Kremlin and Russian agencies said on Telegram.

Ukraine’s military said in its regular battlefield update on Saturday that its forces had beaten back Russian attempts to advance in the vicinity of Myrnohrad and Huliaipole.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:51:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3GAORQTQ5ONVOLAY6RL57L5SI.jpg?auth=f76b3678cac1169bd5e133cc3027d3f1598e5c544247204af3575e1c71b5dcff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy arrests nine over alleged Hamas funding through charities</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/italy-arrests-nine-over-alleged-hamas-funding-through-charities-2025-12-27/</link><description>ROME, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors said on Saturday they had arrested nine people on suspicion of financing Hamas through charities based in Italy, in an operation coordinated by anti-mafia and anti-terrorism units.

The suspects are accused of "belonging to and having financed" the Palestinian group, which the European Union designates as a terrorist organisation, prosecutors in the northern Italian city of Genoa said in a statement.

Those arrested allegedly diverted to Hamas-linked entities around 7 million euros ($8.24 million) raised over the last two years for ostensibly humanitarian purposes, prosecutors said. Police seized assets worth more than 8 million euros.

The investigation began after suspicious financial transactions were flagged and expanded through cooperation with Dutch authorities and other EU countries, coordinated through the EU judicial agency Eurojust.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni thanked the authorities for "a particularly complex and important operation" which had uncovered financing for Hamas through "so-called charity organisations."

The Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meloni's support for Israel during its war with Hamas in Gaza has triggered large and repeated street protests in Italy.

Israel's assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 people, according to the enclave's health ministry. It was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.

Bolsonaro, 70, was hospitalized last Wednesday for a separate hernia surgery on the following day which took place uneventfully. At the request of his defense lawyers he was authorized by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to leave prison, where he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup.

In a statement from the hospital, he endorsed his son Flavio's 2026 presidential bid.

The former president has faced health problems since a stabbing he suffered in September 2018, during a presidential campaign event that year in the town of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais state.

Bolsonaro underwent various surgeries in the abdominal region after the stabbing.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 20:22:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JKFT6GXOFVK6DMX3LSBCJJNJSE.jpg?auth=e67473551a9010509c4e820c60d21bd6100771bb7e01811c4488a6d94e49be61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Niger junta orders 'general mobilisation' in fight against jihadists</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251227-niger-junta-orders-general-mobilisation-in-fight-against-jihadists</link><description>Niger 's military rulers have approved a general mobilisation and the requisition of people and goods to fight a long-running jihadist insurgency , according to a government statement  from Saturday.

Since toppling democratically elected president Mohamed Bazoum in a July 2023 coup, the military junta in Niger has been forced to contend with attacks from Islamist militants on multiple fronts.

The country's new rulers adopted the mobilisation and requisition measures at a cabinet meeting on Friday.

"People, property, and services may be requisitioned during general mobilisation to contribute to the defence of the homeland, in compliance with the legislation and regulations in force," said a government statement after the meeting.

"Every citizen is required to respond immediately to any call-up or recall order, to comply without delay with the implementation of measures for the defense of the homeland, and to submit to requisition," it added.

The measures were required by the need to "preserve the integrity of the national territory" and "protect the population", said the statement.

The country has been fighting a deadly jihadist insurgency for a decade now, waged by fighters from Al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad which has left nearly 2,000 people dead, according to ACLED, an NGO that monitors conflicts.

Niger's southeast has also been targeted by Boko Haram and rival militant group ISWAP.

Niger's mobilisation plan comes five years after the country doubled the size of its military to 50,000 troops, and raised the retirement age for ranking officers to 52 years from 47.

The government has also been urging citizens to make "voluntary" contributions to a fund started in 2023 that helps pay for military hardware and agricultural projects.

Soon after taking power, the junta asked French and US soldiers who had been fighting jihadists, notably in the west of the country, to leave Niger.

Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso – all three run by military juntas – have created a joint anti-jihadist force of 5,000 troops.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 22:22:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4850fcb6-e36a-11f0-878e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-36XV4M9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar polls open amid civil war, junta-backed party tipped to win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-polls-open-amid-civil-war-junta-backed-party-tipped-win-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 28 (Reuters) - Overshadowed by civil war and doubts about the credibility of the polls, voters in Myanmar were casting their ballots in a general election starting on Sunday, the first since a military coup toppled the last civilian government in 2021.

The junta that has since ruled Myanmar says the vote is a chance for a fresh start politically and economically for the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.

But the election has been derided by critics - including the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups - as an exercise that is not free, fair or credible, with anti-junta political parties not competing.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, deposed by the military months after her National League for Democracy won the last general election by a landslide in 2020, remains in detention, and the political party she led to power has been dissolved.

Mass protests followed the ouster of Suu Kyi's party, only to be violently suppressed by the military. Many protesters then took up arms against the junta in what became a nationwide rebellion.

In this election, the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party, led by retired generals and fielding one-fifth of all candidates against severely diminished competition, is set to return to power, said Lalita Hanwong, a lecturer and Myanmar expert at Thailand's Kasetsart University.

"The junta's election is designed to prolong the military's power of slavery over people," she said. "And USDP and other allied parties with the military will join forces to form the next government."

Following the initial phase on Sunday, two rounds of voting will be held on January 11 and January 25, covering 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, although the junta does not have complete control of all those areas as it fights in the war that has consumed the country since the coup.

Dates for counting votes and announcing election results have not been declared.

With fighting still raging in parts of the country, the elections are being held in an environment of violence and repression, UN human rights chief Volker Turk said last week.

"There are no conditions for the exercise of the rights of freedom of expression, association or peaceful assembly that allow for the free and meaningful participation of the people," said Turk, the high commissioner for human rights.

The junta maintains that the elections provide a pathway out of the conflict, pointing to previous military-backed polls, including one in 2010 that brought in a quasi-civilian government that pushed through a series of political and economic reforms.

The polls "will turn a new page for Myanmar, shifting the narrative from a conflict-affected, crisis-laden country to a new chapter of hope for building peace and reconstructing the economy," an opinion piece in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said on Saturday.

On the streets of Myanmar's largest cities, there has been none of the energy and excitement of previous election campaigns, residents said, although they did not report any coercion by the military administration to push people to vote.

In the lacklustre canvassing, the USDP was the most visible. Founded in 2010, the year it won an election boycotted by the opposition, the party ran the country in concert with its military backers until 2015, when it was swept away by Suu Kyi's NLD.

The junta's attempt to establish a stable administration in the midst of an expansive conflict is fraught with risk, analysts say, and significant international recognition is unlikely for any military-controlled government - even if it has a civilian veneer.

Myanmar's weakened economy, relentless conflict and a seemingly preordained political route have left some voters dejected, including a 31-year-old man who lives in the commercial capital Yangon.

"No matter who I vote for, the USDP will win," he said, asking not to be named for fear of retribution from junta authorities. "So, I will just vote USDP."</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 23:40:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KN3UVWDGI5OP5JHMDA6XSDKBU4.jpg?auth=5babfb54dca188386b8ac68e5ada7427bb722f6e11ccb64c0368779d9e9569f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African Republic votes, Russia ally Touadera seeks third term</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-votes-russia-ally-touadera-seeks-third-term-2025-12-28/</link><description>BANGUI Dec 28 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera is seeking a third term on Sunday as the chronically unstable country holds national elections, touting security gains made with the help of Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers.

The 68-year-old mathematician oversaw a constitutional referendum in 2023 that scrapped the presidential term limit, drawing an outcry from his critics who accused him of seeking to rule for life.

A Touadera victory - the expected outcome - would likely further the interests of Russia, which has traded security assistance for access to resources including gold and diamonds. Touadera is also offering access to the country's lithium and uranium reserves to anyone interested.

The opposition field of six candidates is led by two former prime ministers, Anicet-Georges Dologuele and Henri-Marie Dondra, both of whom survived attempts by Touadera's supporters to have them disqualified for allegedly holding foreign citizenship.

Though both men remain on the ballot, Touadera is still seen as the favourite given his control over state institutions and superior financial resources, analysts say.

The challenges to the candidacies of Dologuele and Dondra "aligned with an apparent pattern of administrative manoeuvring that has disproportionately impeded opposition politicians while favouring the ruling United Hearts Party," Human Rights Watch said last month.

"Their late admission to the race raises questions about whether voters have been given a genuine choice."

In 2018, CAR became the first country in West and Central Africa to bring in Russia's Wagner mercenaries, a step since also taken by Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.

Two years later Rwanda deployed troops to shore up Touadera's government as rebel groups threatened the capital and tried to disrupt the 2020 elections, ultimately preventing voting at 800 polling stations across the country, or 14% of the total.

The country is more secure now after Touadera signed several peace deals with rebel groups this year.

But those gains remain fragile: Rebels have not fully disarmed, reintegration is incomplete, and incursions by combatants from neighbouring Sudan fuel insecurity in the east.
Beyond the presidential contest, the elections on Sunday cover legislative, regional and municipal positions.

Provisional results are expected by January 5.

If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, a presidential runoff will take place on February 15, while legislative runoffs will take place on April 5.

Pangea-Risk, a consultancy, wrote in a note to clients that the risk of unrest after the election was high as opponents were likely to challenge Touadera's expected victory.

A smooth voting process could reinforce Touadera's claim that stability is returning, which was buttressed last year with the U.N. Security Council's lifting of an arms embargo and the lifting of a separate embargo on diamond exports.

In November, the U.N. Security Council extended the mandate of its peacekeeping mission. The U.S. opposed the decision, calling for a shorter extension and a handover of security to Bangui.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:54:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YR7LFF27BJNFHJZ3GMVLGE56SU.jpg?auth=63f50cc94543c24098e2b7fdff061d68e56de6eafc14bff6d81896ab39a44c2b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo votes in bid to end year-long political impasse</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovo-votes-bid-end-year-long-political-impasse-2025-12-28/</link><description>PRISTINA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Kosovo will hold a parliamentary election on Sunday as nationalist Prime Minister Albin Kurti's party seeks a majority to end a year-long political deadlock that has paralysed parliament and delayed international funding.

The vote is the second this year in Europe's youngest nation after Kurti's Vetevendosje party fell short of a majority in February. Months of failed coalition talks prompted President Vjosa Osmani to dissolve parliament in November and call an early election.

Failure to form a government and reopen parliament would prolong the crisis at a critical time: lawmakers must elect a new president in April and ratify 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in loan agreements from the European Union and World Bank that expire in the coming months.

The Balkan country's opposition parties have refused to govern with Kurti, criticising his handling of ties with Western allies and his approach to Kosovo's ethnically divided north, where a Serb minority lives. Kurti blames the opposition for the impasse.

To woo voters, Kurti has pledged an additional month of salary per year for public sector workers, one billion euros per year in capital investment and a new prosecution unit to fight organised crime. Opposition parties have also focused on improving living standards.

Opinion polls are not published in Kosovo, leaving the outcome uncertain. Many voters say they are disillusioned.

"There wouldn’t be great joy if Kurti wins, nor would there be if the opposition wins. This country needs drastic changes, and I don’t see that change coming," said Edi Krasiqi, a doctor.

Polls open at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) and close at 7 p.m. Exit polls are expected soon after voting ends.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. backing, including a 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbian forces trying to crush an uprising by the 90% ethnic Albanian majority.

Despite international support, the country of 1.6 million has struggled with poverty, instability and organised crime. Kurti's tenure, which began in 2021, was the first time a Pristina government completed a full term.

Tensions with Serbia flared in 2023, prompting the EU to impose sanctions on Kosovo. The bloc said this month it would lift them after ethnic Serb mayors were elected in northern municipalities, but the measures likely cost Kosovo hundreds of millions of euros .

The former special forces commander , believed to be in his early 40s, faces eight other candidates in a fragmented field with no strong challenger. Ousted president Alpha Conde and longtime opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo remain in exile.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou, officially launched last month after years of delay.

Doumbouya has claimed credit for pushing the project forward and ensuring Guinea benefits from its output.

His government this year also revoked EGA subsidiary Guinea Alumina Corporation's license after a refinery dispute, transferring its assets to a state-owned firm.

The turn toward resource nationalism - echoed in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger - has boosted his popularity, as has his youth in a country where the median age is about 19.

"For us young people, Doumbouya represents the opportunity to send the old political class into retirement," said Mohamed Kaba, a mechanic in Conakry. "There is a lot of corruption right now, but I hope these things will be sorted out."

If elected, Doumbouya "will likely utilise his position to further entrench his power and that of the military over Guinea," said Benedict Manzin, lead Middle East and Africa analyst at risk consultancy Sibylline.

"In particular he is likely to position his allies and associates to benefit from the expected economic boom associated with the launch of production" at Simandou, Manzin added.

A transition charter adopted after the coup barred junta members from contesting elections. But in September, Guineans overwhelmingly backed a new constitution removing that clause, extending presidential terms to seven years and creating a Senate.

Provisional results showed turnout at 86.42%, though opposition figures disputed that.

Political debate has been muted under Doumbouya. Civil society groups accuse his government of banning protests, curbing press freedom and restricting opposition activity.

The campaign period "has been severely restricted, marked by intimidation of opposition actors, apparently politically motivated enforced disappearances, and constraints on media freedom," U.N. rights chief Volker Turk said Friday. These conditions "risk undermining the credibility of the electoral process," he added.

The government did not respond to a request for comment.

Doumbouya kept a low profile during the campaign, leaving surrogates to make his case.

At a closing rally on Thursday in Conakry, he skipped a speech although he danced with his wife while Congolese star Koffi Olomide performed.

He wore a white baseball cap and track jacket emblazoned with the name of his movement: "Generation for Modernity and Development."

About 6.7 million people are registered to vote, with provisional results expected within 48 to 72 hours of polls closing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5U7BMFNWMZNBZA43VRCDNIQENA.jpg?auth=ffa2cc9c592e41afaa0cf6c66302c19c2973f8383c92d1ef4fa5ab64dcaa867c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria Super Eagles fly off with 3 points against Tunisia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-nigeria-super-eagles-fly-off-with-3-points-against-tunisia</link><description>Produced by Emily Boyle and Julia Terradot</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0429da76-e379-11f0-8e59-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/WB999021-O-01-20251227-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON big cat fight ends in draw: Senegal 1-1 DR Congo</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-afcon-big-cat-fight-ends-in-draw-senegal-1-1-dr-congo</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d47441c-e378-11f0-9f3a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/WB999022-O-01-20251227-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON Daily Round Up: Super Eagles beat Tunisia 3-2, Big cats Senegal and DRC stay level</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-afcon-daily-round-up-super-eagles-beat-tunisia-3-2-big-cats-senegal-and-drc-stay-level</link><description>Produced by Emily Boyle and Julia Terradot</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20600e62-e375-11f0-be8b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-12856428126950607fcdcfd4-33199485.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia opposes Taiwan independence in any form, FM Lavrov says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-opposes-taiwan-independence-any-form-fm-lavrov-says-2025-12-28/</link><description>Dec 28 (Reuters) - Russia opposes Taiwan’s independence in any form and considers the island an inseparable part of China, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in remarks published on Sunday.

Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelenskiy called it Russia's response to the ongoing U.S.-brokered peace efforts.

Zelenskiy has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine's contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump's Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics.

Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv's control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday's talks might produce.

The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a U.S. proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelenskiy said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote.

Axios said U.S. officials viewed Zelenskiy's willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan.

Zelenskiy's in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States.

Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelenskiy said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90% finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved.

While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.

The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.

Zelenskiy, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of its territory per day in 2025.

Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12% of its territory, including about 90% of Donbas, 75% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO.

Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack NATO members.

The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan , which emerged from talks between U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.

Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and U.S. negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.

Saturday's air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelenskiy said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace "requires a willing Russia."

"The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time," Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83 billion) in additional economic aid to Ukraine.

Then it zeroed in on him.

Ossetchkine immediately threw himself to the ground, as did his family – all of whom managed to survive the September 12 assassination attempt .

One month later, four French residents were charged with trying to kill Ossetchkine , who is the director of an NGO that advocates for human rights in Russian prisons and who has lived in France since fleeing Russia 10 years ago.

Were the Biarritz snipers working on the Kremlin’s orders? Some of those arrested were originally from Dagestan , a Russian republic in the North Caucasus, according to an AFP source. `

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, President Vladimir Putin has been accused of orchestrating a vast hybrid-warfare campaign in Europe, including several assassination attempts.

Assassins operating under the Kremlin’s orders are suspected of trying to kill the CEO of Rheinmetall, a German arms manufacturer sending weapons to Ukraine.

FSB Russian intelligence is suspected of coordinating an attempt by six Bulgarians based in the UK to kidnap investigative journalist Christo Grozev and deliver him to Russian operatives.

Three of the group were found guilty by British courts on espionage charges .

But Russia’s hybrid-warfare strategy makes it difficult to trace operations directly back to Moscow.

“An essential characteristic of a hybrid operation is that it is deniable, that you're not sure who is behind it,” says Bart Schuurman, a specialist in political violence at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who is part of a research group compiling a list of hybrid warfare operations targeting Europe.

Across the European continent, a diverse range of hybrid-warfare attacks garnered headlines in 2025, including drone incursions around airports, the sabotage of Polish railways , pigs’ heads left outside mosques in Paris, anti-Semitic acts and assassination attempts.

Russia’s hybrid-warfare campaign appears focused on punishing Europe for its support of Ukraine by destabilising European society, driving wedges between communities and attempting to fracture support for its battlefield adversary.

Schuurman says Moscow’s hybrid campaign is “an attempt to further divide Europe”.

Sabotage, cyber-attacks, vandalism and influence operations “are all an attempt to undermine public and political support for Ukraine in Europe, ultimately helping Russian soldiers win the war”, he adds.

“Hybrid warfare attempts to support what Russia is doing on the battlefield in Ukraine using irregular or covert operations,” he says.

Threatening the CEO of Germany’s Rheinmetall directly sends the message that there is a price to pay for supporting Ukraine.

The hybrid-warfare attacks began in earnest in 2022, coinciding with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine – which Putin reportedly believed would be complete within 10 days.

As the war dragged on, Schuurman notes, hybrid attacks attributed to Russia became more frequent in 2023 and even more so in 2024. “Initially, Russia had hopes that it could win quite simply on the battlefield alone. And as it got more difficult for them to do so, they were looking for other ways to increase their chances of success.”

Overall, 2025 saw a drop in hybrid-warfare operations, despite headline-grabbing incidents like drones closing down airports around Copenhagen and Oslo.

“If we look at the more classic techniques like influence, sabotage, arson, vandalism and terrorism, we're looking at about half of what we saw last year,” says Schuurman.

But why would Russia scale back such efforts when the war in Ukraine is ongoing?

“Maybe there's less of a need for hybrid warfare,” Schuurman says, noting that Russia may be hoping to achieve what it wants through peace negotiations led by the administration of US President Donald Trump.

Moreover, Europe might be getting better at counter-operations.

“European intelligence services have been facing this Russian hybrid threat for a few years, and they have learned how to adapt to it. They've gotten a lot better at detecting plots before they happen,” Schuurman says.

Three Ukrainians were arrested in Germany in May, accused of trying to send packages of explosives on Moscow’s orders. One year earlier, a similar operation resulted in several packages exploding while they were being transported by postal service DHL.

The success of negotiations between Moscow and Washington are likely to dictate whether the Kremlin expands its hybrid-warfare operations in the months ahead, says Schuurman. “If the whole thing falls apart, I think we will see a return to more hybrid operations.”

An increase in operations is also possible if the US decides to withdraw support for Ukraine, he says, “which seems to be more and more likely” under the new administration.

“Then Europe will be more alone, and I think we can expect more tests by Russia to see if it is an opponent to take seriously or not.”

This could also mean that attacks might become more ambitious in scale – and could continue to test the resolve of Europeans, even if Putin gets what he wants in Ukraine.

A target of particular concern is elections, which Moscow have repeatedly tried to influence in favour of extremist parties.

France faces a key municipal vote in 2026 and a presidential election in 2027, with several European nations also set for elections in the coming year.

A Ministry of Defence statement said the deal would provide the British Army with an early capability demonstrator of the RCH 155 system and two units for Germany to test.

The system is manufactured by Franco-German defence group KNDS and Germany's Rheinmetall.

The system can fire eight rounds per minute on the move, operate with two crew members and travel 700 km without refuelling, the statement said.

Sunday’s election is the culmination of a transition process that began four years ago after President Mamady Doumbouya ousted then president Alpha Condé . There are eight other candidates in the race.

Despite Guinea’s rich mineral resources – including as the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, used to make aluminium – more than half of its 15 million people are experiencing record levels of poverty and food insecurity, according to the World Food Program.

“This vote is the hope of young people, especially for us unemployed," said Idrissa Camara, an 18-year-old resident of Conakry, who said he has been unemployed since graduating from university five years ago. "I’m forced to do odd jobs to survive. I hope this vote will improve the standard of living and the quality of life in Guinea," he added.

The election is the latest such vote among African countries that have seen a surge in coups in recent years. At least 10 countries in the young continent have experienced soldiers forcefully taking power after accusing elected leaders of failing to provide good governance and security for citizens.

A total of nine candidates are contesting the election, and Doumbouya’s closest challenger is the little-known Yero Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea party, who was education minister under Condé.

Two opposition candidates, former Prime Minister Lansana Kouyaté and former government minister Ousmane Kaba, were excluded on technical grounds while longtime opposition leaders Cellou Dalein Diallo and Sidya Toure have been forced into exile.

About 6.7 million registered voters are expected to cast ballots at roughly 24,000 polling stations nationwide, with results expected within 48 hours. There will be a runoff if no candidate wins a majority of the votes.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:21:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6055dc2a-e3cc-11f0-8187-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-25T212635Z-123616946-RC2ONIAQDO8X-RTRMADP-3-GUINEA-ELECTION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brigitte Bardot, icon of French cinema, dies at 91</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/brigitte-bardot-has-died-her-foundation-has-said-2025-12-28/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Actress Brigitte Bardot shot to international fame dancing the mambo barefoot in "And God Created Woman", her tousled hair and fierce energy radiating a sexual magnetism rarely before seen in mainstream cinema.

A global icon was born.

At just 21, she scandalised censors and captivated audiences. Her free-spirited performance in the 1956 film, shot by her husband Roger Vadim, marked a decisive break from the demure heroines of the previous era.

Brigitte Bardot, often referred to in France simply as "B.B." and whose later years were marked by animal rights campaigns and far-right political sympathies, has died at the age of 91, her foundation said on Sunday. The cause was not immediately known.

Born in Paris on September 28, 1934, Bardot grew up in an upper-middle-class household. She described herself as a shy, self-conscious child who "wore spectacles and had lank hair".

By 15, however, she graced the cover of Elle magazine, launching a modelling career that soon led to film.

Bardot’s character in "And God Created Woman" was the embodiment of liberated femininity. The controversy only fuelled her appeal. Bardot became a symbol of 1950s and 60s France.

Her allure extended far beyond French cinema. At 15, Bob Dylan is said to have written his first song about her, the never-released "Song for Brigitte", while Andy Warhol painted her portrait.

Bardot's ability to subvert traditional gender roles made her not just a sex symbol, but a pop culture icon and a touchstone for shifting social attitudes.

In 1959, Simone de Beauvoir penned an article for Esquire magazine in which she lionised Bardot's conspicuous sense of freedom. "B.B. does not try to scandalise," the feminist philosopher wrote. "She follows her inclinations. She eats when she is hungry and makes love with the same unceremonious simplicity.

"Moral lapses can be corrected, but how could B.B. be cured of that dazzling virtue — genuineness? It is her very substance."

De Beauvoir concluded: "I hope she will mature, but not change."

Despite her influence, Bardot found celebrity life isolating. She often spoke of being a prisoner of her own fame, unable to enjoy life’s simple pleasures.

"Nobody can imagine how horrific it was, such an ordeal," she reflected decades later. "I couldn't go on living like that."

Her personal life was shaped by four marriages, widely reported affairs, and well-documented struggles with depression.

On her 26th birthday she was found unconscious at a house on the French Riviera after trying to take her own life. Rumours of another attempted suicide surfaced years later when she mysteriously cancelled a 49th birthday party then appeared in hospital.

Alongside her acting, Bardot enjoyed a successful music career. Her collaborations with singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, including the erotic "Je t’aime ... moi non plus" ("I Love You ... Neither Do I"), drew both acclaim and controversy.

In the late 1960s she modelled for a bust of Marianne, the personification of the French Republic.

But she found little satisfaction in the praise she garnered.

"I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy," she told the magazine Paris Match around the time of her 50th birthday. "I've been let down too often. I've had really terrible disappointments in my life. That is why I've chosen to withdraw, to live alone."

Bardot made the last of her 42 films in 1973. Disenchanted with the industry, she declared the world of cinema "rotten" and left public life.

"I will have given 20 years of my life to cinema, that's enough," she said in a TV interview at the time.

She settled in the fashionable French resort of Saint-Tropez, where she found solace among animals and the Mediterranean landscape.

There, she began a passionate defence of animal welfare. "This is my only battle, the only direction I want to give my life," Bardot said in 2013.

Her devotion to animals became legendary. In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals, auctioning off personal souvenirs the following year to raise funds for her cause.

Bardot supported high-profile activists, such as anti-whaling campaigner Paul Watson, and campaigned vigorously against animal cruelty, at times threatening to leave France over animal welfare disputes.

When actor Gérard Depardieu accepted Russian citizenship after a public spat with French authorities, in 2013, Bardot threatened to follow suit if France euthanised two sick circus elephants.

For much of the latter part of her life, Bardot lived alone behind high walls in Saint-Tropez, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses.

This passion, she often suggested, was an antidote to her disappointing relationships. "I gave my beauty and my youth to men," she once said. "I am going to give my wisdom and experience to animals."

As her advocacy intensified, so too did the backlash to her political statements.

Bardot’s public remarks on immigration, Islam and homosexuality led to a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred.

Between 1997 and 2008, she was fined six times by French courts for her comments, particularly those targeting France’s Muslim community.

In one case, a Paris court fined her €15,000 ($17,000) for describing Muslims as "this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts".

In 1992, she married Bernard d’Ormale, a former adviser to the far-right National Front, and later publicly endorsed the party's successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine Le Pen. Bardot called the latter "the Joan of Arc of the 21st century".

Yet, for all her polarising views, Bardot’s influence endured, whether in fashion - with media noting regular comebacks of her trademark hairstyle - or through regular documentaries and coffee‑table books celebrating her rare impact on French cinema.

Asked by French channel BFM TV in May 2025 if she considered herself a symbol of the sexual revolution, she said: "No, because before me, plenty of wild things had already happened — they didn’t wait for me. Feminism isn't my thing; I like men."

In the same interview, she was asked how often she reflected on her film career. "I don’t think about it," she said, "but I don’t reject it, because it’s thanks to it that I’m known everywhere in the world as someone who defends animals."</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:44:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SQHBFHT33JNS5PSZ42YZAIV6OY.jpg?auth=283044af9db33579d5cee1d1decd9c8c5e5f5bde102903461bb1f8c3895cebbb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's DTEK says power restored to 1 million Kyiv-area households</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraines-dtek-says-power-restored-1-million-kyiv-area-households-2025-12-28/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine's leading private energy provider said on Sunday that it had restored power to more than a million households in and around Kyiv a day after a Russian air attack had forced emergency outages.

A combined missile and drone attack early on Saturday had killed two people and knocked out power across broad swathes of the capital and its surrounding region.

In a statement, DTEK said it had restored electricity to 748,000 households in Kyiv and 347,000 outside the city.

It added that consumers on Kyiv's right bank were back to planned power cuts but that the situation remained "more difficult" on the left bank, where emergency outages were still in force.

Two districts of the Kyiv region were also still experiencing emergency outages, DTEK said.

Below are a selection.

"Her films, her voice, her dazzling fame, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne - Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom. A French existence, a universal radiance. She moved us. We mourn a legend of the century."

(Bardot's face was used as the model for an official bust of Marianne, an allegorical female figure who symbolizes the values of the French Republic, which was installed in town halls across the country from the late 1960s onward.)

THE BRIGITTE BARDOT FOUNDATION

"Mrs Brigitte Bardot (was) a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to give up her prestigious career in order to devote her life and energy to the defence of animals and to her Foundation," it said.

"The Brigitte Bardot Foundation wishes to honour the memory of an exceptional woman who gave everything and gave up everything for a world more respectful of animals."

"The French people today lose the Marianne they so deeply loved and whose beauty astonished the world. Brigitte Bardot was a woman of heart, conviction, and character. A passionate patriot and a lover of animals that she protected throughout her life, she alone embodied an entire era of French history, and above all a certain idea of courage and freedom."

"The SPA pays tribute to Brigitte Bardot, an iconic figure and a passionate advocate for the animal cause. Since the 1970s, and later through her foundation created in the 1980s, she devoted her life to defending those who have no voice. Her unwavering commitment helped change attitudes and achieve major advances in animal protection ... Thank you, B.B., for all that you have accomplished."

"An icon of French cinema and an international figure, Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most radiant ambassador. Through her presence, her personality, and her aura, she left her mark on the history of our town and helped to make Saint-Tropez shine across the world," the city said. "Brigitte Bardot now belongs to the collective memory of Saint-Tropez, which we must preserve. She will continue to inhabit the soul of our town."

"She wasn't just one of the most beautiful women in the world - she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and she still is, in fact," he said.

"She had a courage that men still don't reference, and if she cared so deeply about animals ... it's probably because she had been disappointed by men - all men - and I understand that. We are relatively disappointing; I can speak for my own gender."</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 11:40:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S3WKWUL5ONI6HFWW5WISKOOF6M.jpg?auth=6e61a667dde1d3eaf4280de7556aaf992be92ba2a86fbd474e45901dacb42573&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bardot leaves controversial legacy of activism for France’s far right</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251228-bardot-leaves-controversial-legacy-of-activism-for-france-far-right</link><description>French cinema legend Brigitte Bardot, whose death at the age of 91 was announced on Sunday. During her life, she was a 1960s sex symbol who later became a militant animal rights activist and outspoken supporter of France's far right .

After her film career catapulted her to global stardom and sex-symbol status, she suddenly retreated into a hermit-like existence in the French Riviera resort of Saint-Tropez at the age of just 39.

In 1986 she set up the Brigitte Bardot Foundation dedicated to animal protection. She crusaded for baby seals and elephants , called for the abolition of ritual animal sacrifice and the closure of horse abattoirs.

As her advocacy intensified, so too did the backlash to her political statements. Bardot’s public remarks on immigration , Islam and homosexuality led to a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred.

In one case, a Paris court fined her €15,000 for describing Muslims as "this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts".

In 1992, she married Bernard d’Ormale, a former adviser to the far-right National Front , and later publicly endorsed the party's successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen ‍and his daughter Marine Le Pen . Bardot called the latter "the Joan of Arc of the 21st century".

Jordan Bardella , the head of Le Pen's far-right National Rally party, was among the first to pay hommage.

"Today the French people have lost the Marianne they so loved, whose beauty astonished the world," he wrote on X.

In her final book, "Mon BBcedaire" ("My BB Alphabet"), published weeks before her death, she fired barbs at what she described as a "dull, sad, submissive" France and at her home town of Saint-Tropez, now packed with the wealthy tourists she helped attract. The book also contained derogatory remarks about gay and transgender people.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:42:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ddb28f24-e3e0-11f0-a811-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23108353048742.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Memorable moments from French actress Brigitte Bardot's on-screen career</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251228-memorable-moments-from-french-actress-brigitte-bardot-screen-career</link><description>French 1960s sex symbol Brigitte Bardot , considered one of the major screen sirens of the 20th century, died at the age of 91 , her foundation announced on Sunday.

"And God created Brigitte Bardot" ran the headline in the Financial Times in 2009 when the actress turned 75, capturing the enduring connection between Bardot and the film that catapulted her to stardom as a sexually charged 18-year-old orphan in Saint-Tropez.

The image of a bikini-clad, bronzed Bardot emerging from the sea was the "original epitome of the youthful sexuality that tanned itself on the Cote d'Azur once the austerity of war had worn off", US film historian David Thomson said in his bestselling book "The New Biographical Dictionary of Film" (1975).

Made by her husband at the time, Roger Vadim, the film was a hit both in France and the US, where it took in $4 million at the box office .

It inspired Simone de Beauvoir in 1960 to say, "BB now deserves to be considered an export product as important as Renault automobiles."

Jean-Luc Godard 's arthouse classic set on the island of Capri opened with what would become one of Bardot's most famous scenes but also her most subversive: intercut shots of her body as she lies on a bed in a dark room, asking her husband, "Which part of me do you like best?"

Bardot's full naked figure is never shown as Godard resisted the demands of his producers, and in doing so encouraged a more critical gaze on Bardot's sexualised on-screen body.

Playing a jilted wife whose disdain for her husband swells as the film progresses, "Contempt" was one of Bardot's rare critically acclaimed films, with The New York Times praising it as her best acting performance.

Bardot had a brief and tumultuous affair with legendary French songwriter Serge Gainsbourg .

Their dalliance gave rise to a track based on a poem written by the notorious US outlaw Bonnie Parker, before she and her partner in crime Clyde Barrow were shot dead.

For the video clip of the duet shot in a hay barn, Gainsbourg and Bardot dressed as the legendary pair, with Bardot donning a black beret, dragging on a cigarette and clutching a machine gun around her neck.

The single was from an album of the same name that reached number 12 on the Billboard Top 200.

Gainsbourg also first recorded his famously steamy "Je t'aime... moi non plus" duet with Bardot but she later opposed its release.

He re-recorded the hit with Jane Birkin.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:42:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4d5656e-e3da-11f0-9e06-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23108352888792.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China welcomes Thailand-Cambodia truce ahead of trilateral talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-welcomes-thailand-cambodia-truce-ahead-trilateral-talks-2025-12-28/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 28 (Reuters) - China on Sunday congratulated Cambodia on reaching a ceasefire with Thailand after weeks of deadly border fighting , as officials from the three countries prepared to open a two-day meeting in southwestern China.

Thailand and Cambodia on Saturday ended weeks of fierce border clashes that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million by agreeing their second ceasefire in recent months.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a meeting with his Cambodian counterpart, called the ceasefire "an important step towards restoring peace" and said it was "in line with the shared expectations of countries in the region."

Cambodia's top diplomat, Prak Sokhonn, and his Thai counterpart, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, are both expected to meet Wang in the Chinese province of Yunnan on Sunday and Monday to discuss the border situation.

Cambodia and Thailand should "promote a complete and lasting ceasefire, resume normal exchanges and rebuild mutual trust" Wang said, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

The two countries' diplomats and military officials should use the meeting in Yunnan as an opportunity to "communicate in a flexible manner and enhance understanding," Wang added.

China is willing to provide humanitarian aid to Cambodia for the settlement of those displaced in the border regions, he said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:20:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3T3P6YVJRRKFVBFQQGVYOVYVAE.jpg?auth=0e9d9a7ac152612730c560560e3a8794fb20b12cc874787eb64087ecaa8fe97e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The week in pictures: US strikes on Nigerian jihadists, AFCON 2025 and the death of Brigitte Bardot</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251228-the-week-in-pictures-us-strikes-nigerian-jihadists-afcon-2025-death-brigitte-bardot</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:22:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/435010f4-e32d-11f0-97fb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360683962222.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clashes erupt in Syria as Alawite minority protests deadly Homs mosque bombing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251228-clashes-erupt-syria-alawite-minority-protests-deadly-homs-mosque-bombing</link><description>Clashes broke out on Syria’s coast between protesters from the Alawite religious minority and counter-demonstrators on Sunday, two days after a bombing at an Alawite mosque in the city of Homs killed eight people and wounded 18 others during prayers.

Thousands of protesters gathered in the coastal cities of Latakia and Tartous, and elsewhere. Officials have said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque in Homs, but authorities haven’t publicly identified a suspect yet in Friday’s bombing. Funerals for the dead were held on Saturday.

A little-known group calling itself Saraya Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram channel, in which it indicated that the attack intended to target members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam whom hard-line Islamists consider to be apostates.

Sunday’s demonstrations were called for by Ghazal Ghazal, an Alawite sheikh living outside of Syria who heads a group called the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council in Syria and the Diaspora.

An Associated Press photographer in Latakia saw pro-government counterprotesters throw rocks at the Alawite demonstrators, while a group of protesters beat a counterdemonstrator who crossed to their side.

According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least two people were killed as security forces tried to disperse the protests – and a medical source said two bodies had been taken to a local hospital.

Syrian authorities did not confirm they had opened fire but said they had “contained the situation”. They accused what they called “remnants” of former ruler Bashar al-Assad’ s government of attacking security forces.

Syria’s state-run television also reported that two members of the security forces had been wounded in the area of Tartous after someone threw a hand grenade at a police station. Cars belonging to security forces were also set on fire in Latakia.

The country has experienced several waves of sectarian clashes since the fall of former president Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December 2024 that brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad, an Alawite, fled the country to Russia.

In March, an ambush carried out by Assad’s supporters against security forces triggered days of violence that left hundreds of people dead, most of them Alawites. Since then, although the situation has calmed, Alawites have been targeted sporadically in sectarian attacks. They have also complained of discrimination against them in public employment since Assad’s fall and of young Alawite men detained without charges.

During the rein of the Assad dynasty, Alawites were over-represented in government jobs and in the army and security forces.

Government officials condemned Friday’s attack and promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but have not yet announced any arrests.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:44:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bae6ec84-e3f3-11f0-885d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362464071814.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three dead in Alawite protests on Syrian coast, local officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/three-dead-alawite-protests-syrian-coast-local-officials-say-2025-12-28/</link><description>LATAKIA, Syria Dec 28 - Three people were killed on Sunday when protests in Syria's Alawite heartland of Latakia spiralled into gunfire and other violence, according to the province's media office.

Syria has been rocked by several episodes of sectarian bloodshed since longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who hails from the Muslim Alawite minority, was ousted by a rebel offensive last year and replaced by a Sunni-led government.

Thousands of Alawite protesters gathered on Sunday in Azhari Square in Latakia city to demand a decentralized political system in Syria and the release of thousands of Alawite prisoners.

About two hours into the protest, gunshots rang out from an unidentified location, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene. Security forces then fired in the air and the protest descended into chaos, with demonstrators carrying wounded people away on foot.

A written statement from the Latakia province's media office that was distributed to reporters said three people were killed and more than 40 people wounded. It did not specify if the casualties were all in Azhari Square or in other towns where protests were also taking place.

Syrian state news agency SANA reported that one member of the security forces was killed by gunfire from "armed remnants of the former regime" in Latakia. It said civilians and security personnel were wounded in gunfire by unknown assailants near Azhari Square.

Sunday's rally had been called for by the head of the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council, Ghazal Ghazal.

A similar protest in November lasted barely an hour before being confronted by a rival protest in support of Syria's new government. Syrian security forces used gunfire to break up both.

Protesters on Sunday chanted: "We want federalism!" and, "The Syrian people are one!"

"We came to demand our dignity, a living, we came to demand political federalism just like big states such as America, Germany and the (United Arab) Emirates," one demonstrator, Salman Mansour, told Reuters.

"We came to ask for our right of living after we were killed in our lands," he added. More than 1,000 Alawites were killed in March after a failed insurrection by Assad loyalists sparked revenge killings by government-affiliated forces.

Last week, eight people were killed when a bomb detonated at an Alawite mosque in the nearby city of Homs.

"ًWe will keep asking for federalism for our dignity. They say we hate each other - no!" said another protester, Nisreen Khazem.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:20:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2AH4DIIDZRMMZNEPGZ4E264E5A.jpg?auth=573e4bb098941f45462672bf6d6bfff4e0b22041608dc9c364c0dee1358fd846&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's student-led party allies with Islamists ahead of election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-student-led-party-allies-with-islamists-ahead-election-2025-12-28/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The student-led Bangladeshi party born out of the protest movement that toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has forged an electoral alliance with Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami ahead of February's parliamentary election, stirring internal rifts.

Since last year's uprising, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has cast itself as a centrist, reformist alternative to nepotism and two-party dominance, but as the election nears, it is struggling to turn street power into voter support.

NCP chief Nahid Islam said on Sunday the party had decided to enter into the alliance for greater unity, adding that the final list of candidates would be announced on Monday. Other NCP figures have described the alliance as a pragmatic step in a fragmented political landscape.

But the decision to join forces with Jamaat has already prompted internal ructions.

Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the NCP, becoming a leader in the party, resigned on Saturday and said she would contest the election as an independent candidate. Several other members have also quit.

The alliance has drawn attention because Jamaat has long faced criticism for opposing Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan and its alleged role in 1971 war crimes. Years of trials, leadership bans and political marginalisation have left the party with a limited but loyal support base.

Critics of the NCP's move said it undermined the party's founding ideals.

"The moral support I had for the NCP will no longer exist due to this ideological mismatch," said one university student, asking not to be named.

The partnership comes amid broader political realignments, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) - aligned with ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and effectively led by her son, acting chair Tarique Rahman - regaining momentum following Rahman's return after nearly 17 years in exile.

The February 12 election will be held under an interim administration headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took charge after Hasina's ouster and is seen as crucial to restoring political stability after nearly two years of turmoil.

A December survey by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute showed the NCP in a distant third place with 6% support, behind the BNP at 30% and Jamaat on 26%.

The alliance might shift voting trends but could hurt the NCP's long-term bid to become a dominant force, said Shakil Ahmed, a government and politics professor at Jahangirnagar University.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:26:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LPOIOBCLCVNY3KY4BGOCKTNFKQ.jpg?auth=08719981d0b364fd2c4c5ed0f3ea8cd0a0c3133119dd9ccc5b76ed58829b5f9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian attack damages Kherson heating plant</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russian-attack-damages-kherson-heating-plant-2025-12-28/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Russian forces struck an important heating plant in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, causing "significant damage" to the facility, state oil and gas firm Naftogaz said on Sunday.

In a statement, Naftogaz said an employee was wounded in the latest Russian attack on the facility, which it said had provided heating to tens of thousands of homes in Kherson.

The city has been under intensifying Russian drone, missile and bomb strikes in recent months, making daily life increasingly dangerous .

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said that a call between Putin and Trump lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes and took place at the request of Trump ahead of Trump's meeting in Miami with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

"The main thing is that the presidents of Russia and the United States hold similar views that the option of a temporary ceasefire proposed by the Ukrainians and the Europeans under the pretext of preparing for a referendum or under other pretexts only leads to a prolongation of the conflict and is fraught with renewed hostilities," Ushakov said.

Ushakov said that for hostilities to end, Kyiv needed to make a "bold decision" in line with Russian-U.S. discussions on Donbas.

"Given the current situation on the fronts, it would make sense for the Ukrainian regime to make this decision regarding Donbas."

Russia, which controls 90% of Donbas, wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the 10% of the area that Kyiv's forces still control. Overall, Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine.

Trump has repeatedly promised to end the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two and his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been negotiating with Russia, Ukraine and European powers.

Ukraine and its European allies are worried that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated Ukraine after Russian forces took 12-17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukraine per day in 2025.

"Donald Trump listened attentively to Russian assessments of the real prospects for reaching an agreement," Ushakov said.

"Trump persistently pursued the idea that it was really necessary to end the war as soon as possible, and spoke about the impressive prospects for economic cooperation between the United States and Russia and Ukraine that were opening up," Ushakov said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 18:53:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QQPTBBYEJRPCTFANHMQCYSC5YI.jpg?auth=a0bd6b08fd627fde8e40c68dd0ae9967323347aab1a79d248473703811c5f0d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One dead, two missing in southern Spain as torrential rains cause flash floods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/one-dead-two-missing-southern-spain-torrential-rains-cause-flash-floods-2025-12-28/</link><description>VALENCIA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Torrential rains flooded Spain's southern and eastern provinces over the weekend, with one person dead and two missing on Sunday evening as overflowing riverbeds swept away cars and motorcycles and authorities warned residents to stay indoors.

In Valencia, where deadly floods in October last year killed over 220 people and caused billions of euros in damage, authorities issued red alert warnings to people's phones on Sunday evening urging them to stay indoors and on high ground.

Eight other provinces were on orange alert, warning citizens of serious risks to themselves or property and to be prepared for worsening conditions.

The heavy rains in Valencia last year caught authorities off guard, with many blaming local and national officials for warning people of the danger too late, eventually prompting the leader of the region to resign .

In Malaga, Spain's Civil Guard found the body of a man whose van was swept away by an overflowing riverbed on Sunday, according to a post on their X account. A second passenger of the van was still missing.

Emergency teams were also searching for a young person in Granada who was swept away trying to cross a riverbed on a motorcycle, according to state news agency EFE.

Netanyahu said this month that Trump had invited him for talks, as Washington pushes to establish transitional governance and an international security force for the Palestinian enclave.

Trump has said he could meet with the Israeli leader soon, but the White House has not confirmed details. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the meeting.

Netanyahu, who is expected to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago beach club, said on December 22 that discussions were expected to cover the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, as well as Iran and Lebanon.

Washington brokered ceasefires on all three fronts, but Israel is wary of its foes rebuilding their forces after they were considerably weakened in the war.

All sides agreed in October to Trump's ceasefire plan, which calls for Israel to withdraw from Gaza and Hamas to give up its weapons and forgo a governing role in the enclave.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that Washington wants the transitional administration envisioned in Trump's plan - a Board of Peace and a body made up of Palestinian technocrats - to be in place soon to govern Gaza, ahead of the deployment of the international security force that was mandated by a November 17 U.N. Security Council resolution.

But Israel and Hamas have accused each other of major breaches of the deal and look no closer to accepting the much more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase .

Hamas, which has refused to disarm and has not returned the remains of the last Israeli hostage, has been reasserting its control, as Israeli troops remain entrenched in about half the territory.

Israel has indicated that if Hamas is not disarmed peacefully, it will resume military action to make it do so.

While the fighting has abated, it has not stopped entirely. Although the ceasefire officially began in October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 Palestinians — most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials — and Palestinian militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

In Lebanon, a U.S.-backed ceasefire that was agreed to in November 2024 ended more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and required the disarmament of the powerful Iran-backed Shiite group, beginning in areas south of the river adjacent to Israel.

While Lebanon has said it is close to completing the mission within the year-end deadline of disarming Hezbollah, the group has resisted calls to lay down its weapons.

Israel says progress is partial and slow and has been carrying out near-daily strikes in Lebanon, which it says are meant to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding.

Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, said last week that it had conducted missile exercises for the second time this month. Netanyahu said Israel is not seeking a confrontation with Iran, but was aware of the reports, and said he would raise Tehran's activities with Trump.

The Vetevendosje, or Self-Determination, party won nearly 50% of the ballots, far ahead of the opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo with 21%, and the Democratic League of Kosovo with nearly 14%, state election authorities said after nearly all the ballots were counted.

“Congratulations on the biggest victory in the history of the country,” a cheerful Kurti said after results were announced. “Now we have a lot of work ahead of us.”

The snap ballot on Sunday was scheduled after the Self-Determination party failed to form a government despite also winning the most votes in a February 9 election, which led to a months-long political deadlock.

It was not immediately clear whether the Self-Determination party had won 61 seats in the 120-member parliament to be able to rule alone. Kurti said a new parliament and a government would be formed as soon as possible.

“We don’t have time to lose and must move forward together as quickly as possible,” he said.

Hundreds of ruling party supporters gathered outside the party offices in Pristina in celebration, chanting Kurti’s name.

The previous post-election stalemate marked the first time Kosovo could not form a government since it declared independence from Serbia in 2008 following a 1998–99 war that ended in a NATO intervention.

Kosovo has not approved a budget for next year, sparking concern over the already poor economy in the country of 2 million people. Lawmakers are also set to elect a new president in March, as current President Vjosa Osmani’s mandate expires in early April.

After voting on Sunday, Kurti urged Kosovo’s 1.9 million voters to turn out in large numbers to grant “more legitimacy for our institutions”.

Turnout was around 44%, according to state election authorities.

Under Kosovo’s election laws, 20 parliamentary seats are automatically assigned to ethnic Serb representatives and other minority parties.

Opposition parties have accused Kurti of authoritarianism and of alienating Kosovo’s U.S. and European Union allies since he came to power in 2021. Kurti also briefly served as prime minister in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lumir Abdixhiku from the Democratic League of Kosovo earlier on Sunday urged voters to “move away from the gloom, the deadlock and the division that has accompanied us for these years”.

A former political prisoner during Serbia’s rule in Kosovo, the 50-year-old Kurti has taken a tough stance in talks mediated by the European Union on normalising relations with Belgrade. In response, the EU and the United States imposed punitive measures.

Kurti has promised to buy military equipment to boost security.

Ilmi Deliu, a 71-year-old pensioner from the capital, Pristina, said he hoped the election would bring a change or “we will end up in an abyss”.

“Young people no longer want to live here,” he said.

Tensions with restive ethnic Serbs in the north erupted in clashes in 2023 when scores of NATO-led peacekeepers were injured. In a positive step, ethnic Serb mayors this month took power peacefully there after a municipal vote.

Kurti has also agreed to accept third-country migrants deported from the United States as part of tough anti-immigration measures by the administration of President Donald Trump. One migrant has arrived so far, authorities told The Associated Press.

Kosovo has one of the poorest economies in Europe. It is one of the six Western Balkan countries seeking eventual membership of the EU , but both Kosovo and Serbia have been told they must first normalise relations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:20:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75fc16dc-e0ef-11f0-a6b4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/b2912494762f74dd46eef31671f6149ffd86e550.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump, Zelensky say Ukraine peace deal edging closer but key issues unresolved</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251228-trump-zelensky-say-ukraine-peace-deal-closer-key-issues-unresolved</link><description>US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were “getting a lot closer, maybe very close” to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, though both leaders acknowledged that some of the thorniest details remain unresolved.

The two leaders spoke at a joint press conference late on Sunday afternoon after meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Trump said it would be clear “in a few weeks” whether negotiations to end the war would succeed.

Zelensky said an agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine had been reached. Trump was slightly more cautious, saying they were 95% of the way to such an agreement and that he expected European countries to “take over a big part” of that effort with US backing.

Zelensky has said previously that he hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, a Russian demand that would mean ceding some territory held by Ukrainian forces.

Both Trump and Zelensky said on Sunday that the future of the Donbas had not been settled. “It’s unresolved, but it’s getting a lot closer. That’s a very tough issue,” Trump said.

Just before Zelensky and his delegation arrived at Trump’s Florida residence, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke in a call described as “productive” by the US president and “friendly” by Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov.

Ushakov, speaking in Moscow, said Putin told Trump that a 60-day ceasefire proposed by the European Union and Ukraine would prolong the war. The Kremlin aide also said Ukraine needed to make a decision regarding the Donbas “without further delay”, and that Russia had agreed to establish working groups to resolve the conflict, focusing on economic and security concerns.

Zelensky arrived at Mar-a-Lago early on Sunday afternoon as Russian air raids piled pressure on Kyiv. Russia hit the capital and other parts of Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the city.

Zelensky has described the weekend attacks as Russia ’s response to US-brokered peace efforts, but Trump said on Sunday that he believes both Putin and Zelensky are serious about peace.

The US president said he would call Putin again after meeting with Zelensky. Zelensky had previously told journalists he planned to discuss the fate of the contested Donbas region with Trump, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other issues.

Putin said on Saturday that Moscow would continue waging its war if Kyiv did not seek a quick peace. Russia has steadily advanced on the battlefield in recent months, claiming control over several more settlements on Sunday.

While Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, the question of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved. Moscow insists on gaining all of the Donbas, while Kyiv wants the map frozen along current battle lines.

The US, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, though it remains unclear how such a zone would function in practice.

US negotiators have also proposed shared control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Power line repairs have begun there after another local ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the agency said on Sunday.

Russia controls all of Crimea , which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12% of Ukrainian territory, including about 90% of the Donbas, 75% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and smaller parts of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that any peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024, including Ukraine withdrawing from the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim of joining NATO .

Zelensky’s past encounters with Trump have not always gone smoothly, but Sunday’s meeting followed weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to outline post-war security guarantees for Kyiv with US support.

Ahead of the Mar-a-Lago visit, Zelensky said he held a detailed phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer . Trump said he and Zelensky would also hold a call with European leaders during the Florida meeting.

A 20-point plan emerged from subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators, spun off from a Russian-led 28-point proposal that became public in November following discussions involving US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:20:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/52e02106-e438-11f0-a2a5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-28T215401Z-15833044-RC2XPIAPYRS2-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-TRUMP-ZELENSKIY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to press Netanyahu on stalled Gaza ceasefire, Iran and Lebanon</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251228-trump-to-press-netanyahu-on-stalled-gaza-ceasefire</link><description>US President Donald Trump is expected to push for progress in the stalled ceasefire in Gaza when he meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, for talks that will also include Israel’s concerns over Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran.

Netanyahu said this month that Trump had invited him for talks, as Washington seeks to establish transitional governance and an international security force for the Palestinian enclave.

Trump has said he could meet the Israeli leader soon, but the White House has not confirmed details. It did not respond to a request for comment about the meeting. Netanyahu, who is expected to visit Trump’s Mar-a-Lago beach club, said on December 22 that discussions were expected to cover the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, as well as Iran and Lebanon.

Washington brokered ceasefires on all three fronts, but Israel is wary of its foes rebuilding their forces after they were considerably weakened in the war.

All sides agreed in October to Trump’s ceasefire plan, which calls for Israel to withdraw from Gaza , Hamas to give up its weapons and forgo a governing role in the enclave.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that Washington wants the transitional administration envisaged in Trump’s plan — a Board of Peace and a body made up of Palestinian technocrats — to be in place soon to govern Gaza, ahead of the deployment of the international security force mandated by a November 17 UN Security Council resolution.

But Israel and Hamas have accused each other of major breaches of the deal and appear no closer to accepting the far more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase. Hamas, which has refused to disarm and has not returned the remains of the last Israeli hostage, has been reasserting its control as Israeli troops remain entrenched in about half the territory.

Israel has indicated that if Hamas is not disarmed peacefully, it will resume military action to compel it to do so.

While the fighting has abated, it has not stopped entirely. Although the ceasefire officially began in October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 Palestinians — most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials — and Palestinian militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

In Lebanon , a US-backed ceasefire agreed in November 2024 ended more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and required the disarmament of the powerful Iran-backed Shiite group, beginning in areas south of the river adjacent to Israel.

While Lebanon has said it is close to completing the mission within the year-end deadline for disarming Hezbollah, the group has resisted calls to lay down its weapons.

Israel says progress has been partial and slow, and has been carrying out near-daily strikes in Lebanon, which it says are meant to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding.

Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, said last week that it had conducted missile exercises for the second time this month. Netanyahu said Israel is not seeking a confrontation with Iran but is aware of the reports, and said he would raise Tehran’s activities with Trump.

The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills will involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, in a statement containing a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that will be under sea and air space restrictions for 10 hours from 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT).

This marks China's sixth major round of war games since 2022 after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-governed island, and follow a rise in Chinese rhetoric over Beijing's territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

"This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to 'Taiwan Independence' separatist forces and external interference forces," Shi Yi, a spokesperson for China's Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.

"The exercise focuses on training for maritime and aerial combat readiness patrols, gaining integrated control, sealing off key ports and areas and conducting multi-dimensional deterrence."

The military released a poster titled "Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions," featuring two golden shields emblazoned with the Chinese People's Liberation Army insignia and the Great Wall of China, along with three military aircraft and two ships.

Taiwan's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While the PLA had practiced port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island are aimed at "deterrence" of outside military intervention.

The drills began 11 days after the U.S. announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever weapons package for the island, drawing a protest from China's defence ministry and warnings the military would "take forceful measures" in response.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 01:52:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QUU5URKWYZLEFB3N3RLSMXX43I.jpg?auth=912d85daeae673f9f941cec74ffbda966c0aefd103b4c332dd340e2aa96679df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexican train derailment kills at least 13 people, 98 injured</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/least-13-dead-after-train-derails-mexico-2025-12-29/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Sunday that at least 13 people were killed after an Interoceanic Train carrying 250 people derailed in the southern state of Oaxaca.

The Mexican Navy said the train, which derailed near the town of Nizanda, was carrying nine crew members and 241 passengers.

Of those on board, 139 were reported to be out of danger, while 98 were injured, including 36 who were receiving medical assistance.

President Claudia Sheinbaum said on X that five of the injured were in critical condition, adding that senior officials had been dispatched to the site to assist the families of those killed.

The governor of Oaxaca, Salomon Jara Cruz, expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the accident and said state authorities were coordinating with federal agencies to assist those affected.

Mexico's Attorney General's Office has already opened an investigation into the incident, Attorney General Ernestina Godoy Ramos said in a social media post.

The Interoceanic Train, inaugurated in 2023 under former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, forms part of the broader Interoceanic Corridor project.

The initiative was designed to modernize the rail link across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, connecting Mexico's Pacific port of Salina Cruz with Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf Coast.

The Mexican government has sought to develop the isthmus into a strategic trade corridor, expanding ports, railways and industrial infrastructure with the goal of creating a route that could compete with the Panama Canal.

The train service is also part of a broader push to expand passenger and freight rail in southern Mexico and stimulate economic development in the region.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 01:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven Turkish police wounded in clash with Islamic State militants, media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/seven-turkish-police-wounded-clash-with-islamic-state-militants-media-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Seven Turkish police officers were wounded during a clash with suspected Islamic State militants in Yalova province in northwest Turkey on Monday, state broadcaster TRT Haber reported.

Rapper turned-Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, known as Balen, a popular elected official, joined the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) or national independent party, led by a former TV host-turned politician Rabi Lamichhane on Sunday, party officials said.

They said under the agreement with RSP, 35-year old Balen will become the prime minister if the RSP wins the March 5 elections while Lamichhane will remain the party chief.

Both have vowed to address the demands raised during the "Gen Z" or youth-led protests against widespread corruption in September in which 77 people were killed and led to Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigning.

“It is a very smart and strategic move by the RSP to bring in Balen and his young supporters into its fold,” analyst Bipin Adhikari said.

“Traditional political parties are in pain for fear of losing their young voters to RSP,” he said.

The election commission says nearly 19 million of Nepal’s 30 million people are eligible to vote in the elections. Nearly one million voters – mostly youths – were added after the protests.

Balen was in the spotlight after the protests and was an undeclared leader of the youngsters who led the September protests.

He also helped form the interim government of former Chief Justice Sushila Karki to oversee the vote.

Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) or UML and the centrist Nepali Congress party have shared power between them for most of the past three decades and are most likely to be challenged by Balen.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:49:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OTIX5GVP7JKRPKAC4ZSUWJU6OU.jpg?auth=18f1297836944b44c9843d9c21be3d9e15906fee91282defbd77f3c4140d3a9f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korean president vows to reveal truth on anniversary of Jeju Air crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korean-president-vows-reveal-truth-anniversary-jeju-air-crash-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday apologised to the families of the 179 people who died in a Jeju Air (089590.KS) , opens new tab crash a year ago, vowing to reveal the truth behind the worst aircraft accident on the country's soil.

"As president who has the responsibility to protect the lives and safety of the people, I offer my deepest apologies," Lee said in a message released on Monday.

Relatives of the victims have demanded answers about the accident, after investigators delayed releasing a report on what went wrong on December 29, 2024, when the Jeju Air jet crash-landed and slammed into an embankment at the end of the runway.

It erupted in a ball of flames, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes.

But questions remain about safety lapses, the design of the runway at Muan International Airport where the crash occurred and what actions the pilots took in the last few minutes of the flight.

"The disaster clearly revealed the systematic problems and limitations of our society," Lee said. "What's needed now is not perfunctory promises or empty words but rather real change and action."

Parliament has been reviewing a plan to overhaul the aircraft accident investigation board to ensure independence and greater expertise.

Relatives of the victims are scheduled to hold a memorial service later on Monday at Muan International Airport in the country's southwest to mark the anniversary.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3QWGBPMONLQDJTEYV6WJ2G7IM.jpg?auth=b21b8f6fcc3ee8caf08bbf0f3faa84b1f9bcd1a0753499e75593dd38e6d048f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia says Bondi review to check if terror attack could have been averted</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-says-bondi-review-check-if-terror-attack-could-have-been-averted-2025-12-29/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday an independent review into law enforcement agencies set up after the Bondi mass shooting will assess whether authorities could have taken additional steps to prevent the terror attack.

Albanese said the review will examine whether existing laws or information gaps stopped police and security agencies from acting against the alleged attackers, a father and son, who police say were inspired by the militant group Islamic State.

Fifteen people were killed in the mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach on December 14, shocking a country with strict gun laws and fuelling calls for tougher controls and stronger action against antisemitism.

Families of those killed and injured on Monday urged Albanese to set up a royal commission, the most powerful type of government inquiry, to probe the rise of antisemitism and any intelligence failures tied to the attack, Australian media reported on Monday.

"Announcements made so far by the federal government in response to the Bondi massacre are not nearly enough ... You owe us answers. You owe us accountability. And you owe Australians the truth," said a statement from the families of those involved in the mass shooting, according to media reports.

Reuters could not immediately contact the families for comment.

Albanese, who is facing mounting criticism from opponents who argue his government has not done enough to curb a rise in antisemitism, has been resisting calls to set up a royal commission into the attack. He reiterated it would take years for the inquiry to submit the report.

"The government is committed to making sure that we can't wait years for answers. We need to get on with any changes that are required," Albanese told reporters, while announcing the terms for the review into the attack.

Albanese said the independent committee will submit the report in April and the Parliament will resume as soon as possible next year to consider any legislation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TXRO3KJKURNC7N32SYKIRDAZIY.jpg?auth=3c0a27f5fea00cbf706768d004620fd3ce96e722a4b28437868b278fdc0f5d05&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's ex-First Lady Kim received bribes and meddled in state affairs, prosecutor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/south-koreas-ex-first-lady-kim-received-bribes-meddled-state-affairs-prosecutor-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The wife of former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol interfered in state affairs in return for expensive valuables and money, a special prosecutor said on Monday.

The special prosecutor's investigations, which wrapped up on Sunday, came amid a year-long probe into Yoon's brief imposition of martial law last year and related scandals linked to the once-powerful couple.

The prosecution team earlier this month sought a 15-year prison sentence for former First Lady Kim Keon Hee, who is under detention and currently on trial for suspected acceptance of bribes for mediation and other charges.

Kim has denied any wrongdoing. She apologised to the public for causing concerns during a court hearing earlier this month.

Kim "took advantage of the status of the president's spouse to receive money and expensive valuables, and has been widely involved in various personnel appointments and nominations," special prosecutor Min Joong-ki said at a news conference marking the end of his investigation.

A lower court ruling on Kim is expected on January 28.

The prosecution team has also indicted Unification Church leader Han Hak-ja, now on trial, after the religious group was suspected of giving Kim valuables including two Chanel bags and a diamond necklace as part of its efforts to win influence.

Han has denied that she directed her church to bribe Kim.

"Various people who did not have a common denominator with each other visited Kim Keon Hee, not the president, and asked for what they wanted, and gave money and goods," said assistant special prosecutor Kim Hyeong-geun.

"As a result, their request was realised."

Ousted President Yoon is on trial for suspected masterminding of an insurrection, a charge that could mean a life sentence or even a death penalty. He has denied the charges.

A lower court ruling on Yoon is expected early 2026.

The report, conducted by the country's natural resources ministry, also said that "illegal fishing" and frequent intrusion activities in recent years have threatened the ecosystem around the shoal.

China and the Philippines both claim territorial rights to Scarborough Shoal , one of Asia's most contested maritime features prized for its rich fisheries, its protective lagoon and proximity to major shipping lanes. But sovereignty has never been established.

It is effectively under Beijing's control although Filipino boats continue to operate there.

In September, China approved the creation of a national nature reserve at the shoal, a plan the Philippines condemned as a "clear pretext for occupation".</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China conducts large-scale Taiwan drills amid rising tensions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251229-china-conducts-large-scale-taiwan-drills-amid-rising-tensions</link><description>China 's military moved army, naval, air force, and artillery units around Taiwan on Monday for its "Justice Mission 2025" drills, as the island vowed to defend democracy and mobilised troops to rehearse repelling a potential Chinese attack.

The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills would involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, accompanied by a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that would be under sea and airspace restrictions for ten hours from 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT).

This marks China's sixth major round of war games since 2022, following then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s visit to the democratically governed island, and comes amid heightened Chinese rhetoric over Beijing's territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could prompt a military response from Tokyo .

The drills began 11 days after the US announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan—the largest ever weapons package for the island—drawing a protest from China's defence ministry and warnings that the military would "take forceful measures" in response. Beijing's exercises increasingly blur the line between routine training and what analysts say could be stage-setting for an attack, a strategy designed to give the US and its allies minimal warning of a potential assault.

China's military said it had deployed fighter jets, bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range rockets, and would practise striking mobile land-based targets while simulating a coordinated assault on the island from multiple directions.

"This [the drills] serves as a serious warning to 'Taiwan Independence' separatist forces and external interference forces," said Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.

Taiwan's government condemned the drills. A presidential office spokesperson urged China not to misjudge the situation or undermine regional peace, calling on Beijing to immediately halt what they described as irresponsible provocations.

The island's defence ministry said two Chinese military aircraft and 11 ships had been operating around Taiwan over the past 24 hours, and that Taiwan's military remained on high alert and poised to carry out "rapid response exercises."

The drill is specifically designed to enable rapid troop mobilisation in case China suddenly turns one of its frequent exercises around the island into an attack.

"All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom," the ministry said.

Taiwan's stock markets were largely unaffected by the drills, rising 0.3% to a record high in morning trading.

The Chinese military released two posters titled "Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions" and "Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial", alongside a graphic depicting four locations across the island with targets locking on, following the drill announcement.

China's state broadcaster said the drills would focus on sealing off Taiwan's vital deep-water ports of Keelung to the north and Kaohsiung to the south, the island’s largest port city.

The first poster features two golden shields emblazoned with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army insignia and the Great Wall of China, along with military aircraft and two ships. China is mobilising an armada of civilian ships capable of supporting an attack on Taiwan. Vessels with ramps and open decks similar to military landing craft used in amphibious assaults since World War Two appear in the poster.

"Any foreign interference that touches the shield [of justice] shall perish! Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!" the poster reads.

The second poster shows flaming arrows raining down on Taiwan, spearing green cartoon bugs. Beijing regularly labels Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te a "parasite" and began using the green bug caricature to represent separatist forces during April’s war games.

While the PLA practised port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island aim to deter outside military intervention.

Takaichi's remarks triggered a surge in Chinese messaging emphasising its sovereignty claims. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump in November that Taiwan's "return to China" after World War Two was central to Beijing's vision of the global order.

Taiwan rejects China's claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island's future.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/785e510a-e460-11f0-90fa-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-29T021724Z-670509462-RC22QIATVZGB-RTRMADP-3-CHINA-TAIWAN-DRILLS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
