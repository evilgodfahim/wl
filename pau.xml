The heatwave is the worst seen in Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, since the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires that killed 173 people and is not expected to ease until the weekend, authorities said.

"We are now into day five of the severe to intense heatwave here in Victoria and we are starting to see some of those impacts," said Victorian Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch.

"An extreme heat warning is still in place, and we are expecting to see eight consecutive days of severe to extreme intensity heatwave."

David Crock, a forecaster from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, said the heat was being driven by climate change and called the temperatures "very unusual".

"The severity of this heatwave is comparable to the heatwave in January 2009, and also the heatwave in January 1939," Crock said.

"The data shows a long-term increase in heatwave frequency and intensity, particularly since the year 2000 due to climate change."

Crock said a host of temperature records had been broken in Victoria on Tuesday. "About 20 stations, mostly across western Victoria saw either all-time records or January records fall," he said.

Towns in the Mallee region reached a high of 48.9 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit), the hottest temperature ever recorded in the state.

The conditions in Victoria had eased slightly on Wednesday, while the upper western region of the state of New South Wales and south-western Queensland state recorded temperatures above 48 C (118 F) by the late afternoon.

Around 11,000 properties were without power in Victoria, down from 105,000 a day earlier. Firefighters were also battling six major fires, with three out of control.

A blaze at Carlisle River in the Otways region has burnt more than 11,000 hectares (27,181 acres) and destroyed at least 16 buildings.

"This fire at Carlisle River is a long way from over," said Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management Victoria.

"We are early in the summer. We'll see the heating of the environment and winds come again well before that fire is fully contained."

Many communities in the state are still recovering from large bushfires at the start of the month, also triggered by a severe heatwave. More than 400 homes and 400,000 hectares of land have been lost so far.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 08:33:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CPVEWZJN3JO4JCWOGCJWQT6KH4.jpg?auth=d064b3800463650245864564f731688ce23a0ac83b6f2c4b7b1cc9e7f4dc8e09&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Starmer spoke to Ukraine's Zelenskiy Tuesday afternoon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/britains-starmer-spoke-ukraines-zelenskiy-tuesday-afternoon-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy Tuesday afternoon, a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement.

Albanese, on his first visit as leader to Australia's northern neighbour, struck a new partnership agreement with Gusmao on Wednesday covering deeper defence ties between the two nations, border security and economic development.

The visit comes as the tiny Catholic nation, which is being courted by China, continues its push to build a liquefied natural gas plant on its south coast instead of piping the gas to a plant in the Australian city of Darwin.

After decades of delays, Australia's Woodside Energy (WDS.AX) , opens new tab and East Timor agreed in December to study a 5 million metric ton project for the Greater Sunrise fields, an area containing an estimated 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas that Australia has been discussing, initially with Indonesia, since the 1980s.

A joint statement from the two leaders, distributed by Australia, said the two countries "share an ambition for Greater Sunrise to be developed as soon as possible for the benefit of both states."

Australia said it will establish an infrastructure fund in East Timor, allocating 10% of total state revenue from the project, "funded entirely from Australia’s share of future revenue."

"This commitment will see at least a third of Australia’s revenue from the project being provided to Timor-Leste via the Infrastructure Fund," the statement said.

The statement noted East Timor's preference for the onshore processing of gas.

"Australia will support any commercially viable solution to develop Greater Sunrise proposed by the Sunrise Joint Venture consistent with the Maritime Boundary Treaty," the statement said.

The national oil company Timor Gap owns more than 56% of the field, located about 140 km (87 miles) south of East Timor and more than 400 km from Darwin.

The governments will accelerate negotiations for the project and they urged the Sunrise Joint Venture to present a development concept as soon as possible, the statement said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 08:34:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LURQF3VZYVLXPNU6XK75KYUAJM.jpg?auth=3dca36a16a6fd7a2774454c14104cb4fc7184544e6b7ddf758442679a10ea541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Montenegro could face fuel shortages due to truckers blockade</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/montenegro-could-face-fuel-shortages-due-truckers-blockade-2026-01-28/</link><description>BELGRADE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Montenegro could face fuel shortages due to region-wide protests and a blockade of the Adriatic port of Bar by truck drivers over restrictive EU entry rules that have left them facing deportation for exceeding Schengen visit limits.

The port of Bar is the biggest entry point for overseas fuel imports into Montenegro, which has no oil refining capacity of its own. It also houses the country's largest fuel depots.

Blockades of border crossings in Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and North Macedonia that began on Monday have halted transport along a critical road corridor linking the EU with Turkey and the Middle East.

In a statement late on Tuesday, the Montenegrin Energy Ministry said it asked oil companies for information on stocks, and on the estimated period during which regular fuel supplies could be maintained.

It said current supplies had effectively been reduced to the fuel available at petrol stations, which would allow the market to operate for only a few more days.

The ministry also urged people to avoid purchasing excessive quantities of fuel at petrol stations.

Montenegrin police said earlier the truckers have a permit to protest until midday on Thursday.

The truckers are demanding an extension of the allowed stay in the Schengen free travel area, saying that with the large volumes of freight they transport, they reach the visit limit quickly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:35:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel to hold funeral for last hostage recovered from Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-hold-funeral-last-hostage-recovered-gaza-2026-01-28/</link><description>MEITAR, Israel, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The remains of the last Israeli captive recovered from the Gaza Strip were set to be buried on Wednesday in a funeral that will help Israel turn the page after one of the most tramautising periods in its history.

Ran Gvili, an off-duty police officer, was killed fighting militants during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. He was then seized and taken back into Gaza by the Islamic Jihad militant group, Israeli officials say.

Gvili was among about 250 people abducted during the attack, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and set off the war in Gaza in which Palestinians health authorities say Israel kill more than 71,000 Palestinians.

Many of the hostages were released during two short ceasefires, but dozens died in captivity. Under the terms of an October deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Hamas and other groups agreed to return the remaining hostages, alive or dead, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.

Gvili, who was the last to be released, will be buried in his hometown of Meitar in southern Israel. His casket will be driven there in a procession beginning in Camp Shura, a facility where Israel has identified victims of the October 2023 attack.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog were expected to deliver eulogies at the funeral, expected to began at 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT)

The return of the last hostage and his burial will mark a moment of national healing for Israelis. The Hamas attack, the bloodiest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, was widely seen as the most traumatic event in the country's history.

It also completes a core aspect of the initial phase of Trump's plan to end the war. The second stage, which Washington announced had started earlier this month, includes the reopening of Gaza's Rafah border with Egypt.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:36:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/75BNR334GJNZ3BWSCUCTQLQS2A.jpg?auth=78fdb7deedc05fb3a6f90f3763bb84f8b256bbee7cefad82e2177f0806ed8440&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey urges US to resolve Iran disputes one by one, says Iran ready for nuclear talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-urges-us-resolve-iran-disputes-one-by-one-says-iran-ready-nuclear-talks-2026-01-28/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkey's foreign minister on Wednesday urged the U.S. to resolve its disputes with Iran "one by one" instead of through a sweeping deal, saying this would avoid humiliating Iranian officials, and added that Tehran was ready for talks on its nuclear programme.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that Washington had an "armada" heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

Tehran brutally cracked down on anti-government protests earlier this month, leading to the death and arrest of thousands of people. Officials blamed the unrest on "armed terrorists and rioters" linked to Iran's foes, the United States and Israel. Rights groups describe the protests as the biggest since the 1979 revolution.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan reiterated that Turkey opposed any foreign intervention or attack on Iran, saying it would be "wrong to start the war again."

"My advice always to the American friends: close the files one by one with Iranians. Start with nuclear, close it, then the other, then the other," Fidan said.

"If you put them as a package all of them, it will be very difficult for our Iranian friends to digest," he said. "It sometimes might seem humiliating for them. It will be very difficult to explain to not only themselves, but also to the leadership."

In June, the United States struck Iran's nuclear facilities amid heightened regional tensions with Israel over the war in Gaza. Talks on Tehran's nuclear programme - which it says is for peaceful purposes - have made little progress.

Turkey, a NATO member that shares a border with Iran, has said it reached out to both U.S. and Iranian officials. Ankara has said Tehran must be allowed to handle its domestic issues on its own, warning that any destabilisation would exceed the region's capacity to manage at this time.

Fidan has also said Israel was still looking to attack Iran.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:37:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XSKIDK3U3BJF3HB6YLZUAPFBLE.jpg?auth=7ab0404c755cbcd9068c77a6d0a0d9bb6f508d2355dfa650db17ca39a31cb0de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Post-war recovery agreement with US needs more work, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/post-war-recovery-agreement-with-us-needs-more-work-zelenskiy-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine has identified areas in an agreement with the United States on post-war recovery that need to be worked through in more depth, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday.

The Northern Territory government sold Darwin Port to Chinese company Landbridge for A$506 million in 2015, a move criticised by the United States.

The awarding of the contract came just a few years after the United States posted the first of a rotating group of U.S. Marines in Darwin. The U.S. and Australia are expanding air bases in Australia's north to host U.S. bombers.

Speaking in East Timor on an official visit on Wednesday, Albanese said his government had made it clear it wanted the port returned to Australian ownership .

"We are committed to making sure that that port goes back into Australian hands because that is in our national interest," he said.

The port's owner, Landbridge Australia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said in November the port was in a strong financial position.

China's ambassador in Canberra, Xiao Qian, told reporters at an annual press briefing on Wednesday that Beijing would "take measures to protect the Chinese company's interests" if a sale of the port were forced.

"Should Landbridge be forced to leave that port, I think it might also affect the substantive investment, cooperation and trade between Chinese companies and that part of Australia," the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported Xiao as saying.

It is not the first time Xiao has criticised Albanese's election pledge last year to return the strategically located northern port to local ownership.

"China would like to reiterate that the relevant Chinese enterprise obtained the lease for the Port of Darwin through market means," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular news conference in Beijing.

"Their legitimate rights and interests should be fully protected," he added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:38:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HPIWLG73TNPC5FCONECQDICXRE.jpg?auth=85124917808a08323b84d2526124e69cac29233a829c886e2e70c6a2722b8897&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says it did not request negotiations with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-it-didnt-request-negotiations-with-us-foreign-minister-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requesting negotiations, state media reported on Wednesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday another "armada" is floating toward Iran and that he hopes Tehran would make a deal with Washington.

The U.S. deployed additional military assets in the Gulf following nationwide protests in Iran which led to the country's bloodiest crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

"There was no contact between me and Witkoff in recent days and no request for negotiations was made from us," Araqchi told state media, adding that various intermediaries were "holding consultations" and were in contact with Tehran.

"Our stance is clear, negotiations don't go along with threats and talks can only take place when there are no longer menaces and excessive demands."

Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian told Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday that Tehran welcomes any process, within the framework of international law, that prevents war.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:38:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F6KDDFB74RISTLLRCRHV5M53BY.jpg?auth=937546f4a42c86bd374d38cebdbc01c5cd3975a236de4ae8d173dc689de261b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe no longer Washington's centre of gravity, shift is structural, EU’s Kallas says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe-no-longer-washingtons-centre-gravity-shift-is-structural-eus-kallas-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Europe is no longer Washington's primary centre of gravity and the shift is structural, not temporary, European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Wednesday as European leaders grapple with how to adjust to U.S. President Donald Trump's approach to the transatlantic relationship.

Hamidreza Sabet Esmailpour, who had been convicted of passing information to a Mossad agent, was hanged at dawn, the judiciary's Mizan news agency said.

Rights groups have previously said 12 people have been hanged on similar charges in the wake of Israel's 12-day war with Iran in June.

They have also expressed concern that protesters arrested in the wave of demonstrations this month could also face execution. The judiciary has already indicated some of those arrested could face charges of capital crimes.

Protests erupted in late December sparked by concern over the rising cost of living but turned into a mass movement against the Islamic republic that was followed by a crackdown that has seen at least thousands killed and tens of thousands arrested, according to rights groups.

Mizan said Esmailpour had been convicted of sharing intelligence with Mossad, purchasing equipment with the aim of helping Israel carry out "sabotage operations" at Iranian missile sites and moving vehicles rigged with explosives.

The last execution in Iran on charges of spying for Israel was on January 7 when a man named Ali Ardestani was put to death after being convicted of sharing information with Mossad.

Iran is the world's most prolific executioner after China , according to rights groups. Last year it hanged at least 1,500 people, according to figures from NGO Iran Human Rights.

Since the war, Iran has promised swift trials for those arrested on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.

Iran, which does not recognise Israel, has long accused its foe of conducting sabotage operations against its nuclear facilities and assassinating its scientists.

But the June war exposed Israel's deep intelligence penetration of Iran, with several key Iranian military and security figures killed in targeted strikes based on intelligence over their whereabouts.

However, rights groups have long expressed concern that innocent people are executed on the basis of confessions obtained under torture , while Israeli agents carrying out the fieldwork remain undetected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:44:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8852467a-fc20-11f0-b5fb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-24T070503Z-1523816638-RC2J7JART8LJ-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-TRUMP-USA-MILITARY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court sentences ex-first lady to 20 months in prison for corruption</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-south-korea-ex-first-lady-sentenced-20-months-prison-corruption</link><description>The wife of South Korea’s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to 20 months in prison for corruption Wednesday, as her husband awaits a verdict on high-stakes rebellion charges that could result in the death penalty or life imprisonment .

The presidential couple suffered a spectacular fall from grace after Yoon’s martial law debacle in December 2024 led to his impeachment and eventually his removal from office.

They have been jailed separately for months prior to facing criminal trials, Yoon over his martial law imposition in December 2024 and other allegations and Kim over corruption charges. Investigators say Kim wasn’t involved in Yoon's martial law enforcement.

On Wednesday, Seoul Central District Court sentenced Kim for receiving luxury gifts like a Graff diamond necklace and a Chanel bag from the Unification Church in return for promises of business favours.

“Staying close to a president, a first lady can exert significant influence on him and is a symbolic figure who represents the country together with a president,” the court said in a live broadcast of the verdict. “But the defendant exploited her position to seek personal gains.”

The ruling was still a surprise after independent counsel Min Joong-ki called for a 15-year prison term for Kim on the charges involving bribery, stock price manipulation and political funding law violations. The court acquitted Kim of charges of stock price manipulation and political funding law violations, citing a lack of evidence and other reasons.

Min's team responded that it cannot accept the ruling and will appeal to a higher court. The governing liberal Democratic Party, which led Yoon's ouster, slammed the verdict as sending a wrong signal that “abuse of power like Kim Keon Hee's can be tolerated”.

Kim’s defence team thanked the court for its verdict but said the 20-month prison term for her bribery charges was “relatively high”. Lawyer Choi Ji-woo said Min's investigation was politically driven and his team will discuss whether to appeal.

Kim has been in jail since August when the Seoul court approved a warrant to arrest her, citing the chance she might destroy evidence.

Days before her arrest, Kim apologised for causing public concern but still hinted that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as “someone insignificant”.

The ruling against Kim was made about three weeks before the court delivers its verdict on a rebellion charge against Yoon for imposing martial law briefly in December 2024.

Cho Eun-suk, another independent counsel, has demanded the death sentence for Yoon.

When Yoon was in office, Kim was embroiled in a slew of scandals that severely hurt Yoon’s approval rating and provided relentless political ammunition to his rivals. The scandals included the three charges the court dealt with Wednesday.

Many observers speculated Yoon opted to place the country under a military rule to protect his wife from possible investigations. But after a six-month probe into Yoon’s decree that wrapped up in December, independent counsel Cho's team downplayed conjecture that Kim’s troubles drove Yoon to declare martial law.

Yoon plotted for over a year to declare martial law so he could eliminate his political opponents and monopolise power and there was also no evidence of Kim's involvement, Cho’s team said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:44:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7be40baa-fc1e-11f0-849a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028052283427.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says 'we'll work something out with South Korea' after tariff threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-says-well-work-something-out-with-south-korea-after-tariff-threat-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON/SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States ​and South Korea would work out a solution, in response to a query about his surprise threat a day ‌earlier to step up tariffs to 25% on imports from the Asian ally.

The news rattled officials in Seoul who said Trump caught them by surprise with a social media post on Monday vowing higher duties on autos and other goods because South Korea had not lived up to its part in the trade deal struck last year.

As he left the White House to give a speech in Iowa, Trump told reporters, "We'll work something out with South ‌Korea." But he did not elaborate.

Trump's chief trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, said the U.S. had cut to 15% ​its tariff rate on South Korean goods from 25%, in exchange for Seoul's pledge to invest $350 billion in the United States, allow more U.S. cars into South Korea, and eliminate some non-tariff barriers.

"But, in the meantime, they haven't been able to get a bill through to ‍do the investment ," Greer said on Fox Business Network, adding that the export-heavy economy had not met commitments on agriculture, industry and digital services.

Greer said the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, which had ballooned to $65 billion during the Biden administration, was "not sustainable and it has to change."

South Korea's parliament is not expected to hold ⁠a plenary session until February to vote on bills.

Five bills that would enact the U.S. investment are pending and ruling Democratic Party members ‍have expressed hope to approve them in February.

The United States has also expressed concern that a South Korean law passed last year tightening oversight of digital ‌services ‌and proposed legislation to regulate online platforms could discriminate against U.S. companies.

A source familiar with internal discussions between the countries has said Trump may have been prompted by recent Korean regulatory actions against Coupang (CPNG.N) , opens new tab , a U.S.-listed company that has said the moves are unfair and discriminatory .

On Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Seoul reached out to the U.S. State Department after Trump's vow to raise tariffs, adding, "It is our conclusion ⁠there is no direct link to ⁠Coupang or the (proposed) online platform ​law."

South Korea's policy chief Kim Yong-beom said he hopes parliament will approve bills required to kickstart the investment in February, although outflows could take monthsto begin.

"If we are asked to review a specific (investment project), we can look at what it is," Kim said.

"But conducting a proper review requires some serious manpower and ‍budget, meaning we cannot deep dive on those reviews unless relevant law exists."

Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol told Reuters this month that South Korea plans to adopt the investment package as soon as possible, while warning it could be affected by uncertainty over a U.S. Supreme Court ruling expected soon on Trump's tariffs.

But he highlighted prospects ​for the timeline to be stretched with remarks that the planned investment of $350 billion ‍was unlikely to kick off in the first half of 2026, against a backdrop of weakness in the won currency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:30:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LOFRHYRBGVLJFDNEJVV65EI6M4.jpg?auth=8785324ad13b5699ae2cf3c85b8abd4f9624546438fef3df866f31bee1655282&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo appeals against rising anti-Semitism in weekly audience</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-appeals-against-rising-anti-semitism-weekly-audience-2026-01-28/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Pope Leo appealed against the global rise of anti-Semitism on Wednesday, marking the annual commemoration of the Holocaust during his weekly audience at the Vatican with a prayer for a world without prejudice or racism.

Various people were questioned, the Office of the Attorney General, or OAG, said in a statement, adding that the probes relate to suspected electoral fraud involving about 30,000 signatures flagged as suspicious since 2022.

The signatures were gathered for around 20 so-called popular initiatives, the OAG said.

Such national initiatives, if backed by 100,000 valid signatures within 18 months, are put to public votes under Switzerland's system of direct democracy.

Prosecutors did not say what changes to the Swiss constitution the 20 initiatives were about.

The OAG said investigation are complicated by the fact that signature collectors are not legally required to identify themselves and are often young people living abroad.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:31:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French senator found guilty of drugging lawmaker to assault her</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-french-senator-found-guilty-drugging-lawmaker-assault-her-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A former French senator was found guilty by a Paris court late on Tuesday of having spiked a lawmaker's drink with ecstasy with the intention of sexually assaulting her.

The court, in its ruling, rejected the defence's argument that Joel Guerriau, 68, may have "inadvertently" administered lawmaker Sandrine Josso with "a substance liable to alter her discernment or control over her actions, in order to commit rape or sexual aggression".

Guerriau, who resigned as a senator over the case in October 2025, was also found guilty of possession and use of ecstasy.

The case has resonated in France following the 2024 conviction of Dominique Pelicot , who was found guilty of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, Gisele, and inviting dozens of strangers to assault her while she was unconscious.

The Pelicot trial attracted headlines worldwide and raised awareness about drug-facilitated assaults .

Because of "the particular gravity of the offences committed and the high dose of ecstasy administered to Sandrine Josso without her knowledge", the court sentenced Guerriau to four years in prison, with two-and-a-half suspended, with a deferred detention order - meaning he will not go to jail as he appeals the ruling.

One of his lawyers said Guerriau intended to appeal. "The debate will resume in front of the appeals court, notably on the intention of assaulting, which my client completely contests," Henri Carpentier told Reuters.

Josso had told investigators she felt unwell after drinking a few sips from a glass of champagne offered to her by Guerriau at his apartment to celebrate an electoral win.

She said the champagne did not taste normal and that if she had not managed to leave the flat she was certain Guerriau would have assaulted her.

In its ruling, the court said that the intention to commit a rape or a sexual assault could be inferred from several elements, including Guerriau's insistence that Josso drink the ecstasy-spiked drink, his unusual and inappropriate behaviour, and browser searches on drugs and their effects in the context of sexual assault.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:58:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZDFEK5NLGJJR5LBQTAV2JBWVSY.jpg?auth=bafc58523a0312de61a3e24adced0dc00a8d78c54e732fafe0ef65e9961d29ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US singer Chris Brown in UK court ahead of October assault trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-singer-chris-brown-uk-court-ahead-october-assault-trial-2026-01-28/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. singer Chris Brown appeared in a London court on Wednesday for a brief hearing ahead of his trial later this year on charges of attacking a music producer in a London nightclub.

Brown last year denied attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm, and also a less serious charge of assault causing actual bodily harm, over what prosecutors say was an "unprovoked attack" with a bottle in 2023.

The 36-year-old attended London's Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday and spoke only to confirm his name.

Brown entered the dock and shook hands with his co-defendant Omololu Akinlolu, 39, who has also denied the charges against him. Around a dozen supporters sat in the public gallery behind them and waved as he left the dock.

The pair's trial is due to begin in October. They were both granted bail ahead of a further preliminary hearing in April.

Brown, a two-time Grammy Award winner known for hits such as "Loyal", "Run It" and "Under the Influence", was granted bail in May after paying 5 million pounds ($6.89 million) in order to begin his "Breezy Bowl XX" tour, which ended in October.

The R&amp;B star was arrested at a hotel in Manchester, northern England last year after returning to Britain for the first time since the incident.

In his latest direct intervention in another country’s politics, Trump on Tuesday warned Iraq that if it picked the Iranian-backed Maliki as its prime minister again Washington would no longer help the major oil producer and close U.S. ally.

"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos. That should not be allowed to happen again," Trump wrote, citing what he called Maliki's "insane policies and ideologies".

Trump's comments are the starkest example yet of his campaign to curb the influence of Iran-linked groups in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

They came after Iraq's main alliance of Shi'ite political blocs, which holds a majority in parliament, picked Maliki -- Iraq's first elected prime minister after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 -- as its nominee for the post following an election .

That came as a surprise for many Iraqis who have accused Maliki of pursuing sectarian policies favouring majority Shi'ites, and of driving Sunnis into the arms of ultra-violent Islamic State militants who seized a third of Iraq as security forces crumbled.

A senior figure in the Shi'ite Islamist Dawa Party, Maliki previously served two terms as prime minister from 2006 to 2014, a period marked by sectarian violence, a power struggle with Sunni and Kurdish rivals, growing tensions with the U.S., and poor public services and graft.

Maliki was pressured to step down in 2014 by an unusually broad array of critics -- the U.S., Iran, Sunni leaders and Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric -- after Islamic State's rapid territorial gains.

In 2015, an Iraqi parliamentary panel called for Maliki and dozens of other top officials to stand trial over the fall of the northern city of Mosul to IS.

But Maliki, who is in his mid-70s, remained an influential political player, leading the State of Law coalition and maintaining close ties with powerful Iran-backed factions.

He used shrewd political skills to quietly build influence through ties to armed militias, the security services and the judiciary, analysts say.

Maliki was born in 1950 in Janaja, a southern village among date groves on the Euphrates, into a politically engaged family - his grandfather wrote poetry inciting rebellion against Iraq’s British occupiers and his father was a fervent Arab nationalist.

He was briefly arrested in 1979 and then fled, narrowly escaping Saddam’s police. His family’s land was seized and dozens of his relatives were killed over the next decade. He did not see his home village again until after the U.S.-led invasion.

His political roots stretch back decades, shaped by opposition to Saddam’s authoritarian rule and a long exile that forged his ideological convictions.

Sentenced to death under Saddam for his role in the outlawed Dawa, Maliki spent nearly 25 years in exile, mostly in Syria and Iran, agitating for the dictator’s downfall. Like many exiles, he came back to Iraq after Saddam’s fall — the end of a Sunni-led regime that had long oppressed Shi'ites, and Kurds.

Little-known in Iraq before his return, Maliki was a compromise pick to lead a wobbly coalition government in 2006.

Months after becoming prime minister, Maliki signed Saddam's execution order in red ink, allowing masked gunmen to hang him. He had fulfilled his lifelong goal of wresting power from the country’s Sunnis, but his drive to entrench Shi’ite dominance would later prove his downfall.

Initially seen as a Shi'ite Islamist, Maliki's willingness to put aside sectarianism and quell violence was called into question in a leaked U.S. government memo.

"Despite Maliki's reassuring words, repeated reports from our commanders on the ground contributed to our concerns about Maliki's government," National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley wrote to President George W. Bush in the memo.

He went on to list problems including non-delivery of services to Sunni areas and the removal of Iraq's most effective commanders on a sectarian basis.

Sunni leaders blamed the dour Maliki for not reining in Shi’ite militias and focusing instead on restless Sunni provinces such as Anbar in western Iraq.

Maliki threw down the gauntlet with stunning speed in 2011 when his Shi’ite-led government demanded the arrest of a Sunni Muslim vice president -- seemingly moments after the departure of U.S. troops in December that year.

To detractors, the move called into question Maliki’s commitment to any sort of democracy.

Maliki denied having a sectarian outlook.

"I am not fighting in Anbar because they are Sunnis, as I have also fought Shi’ite militias. Al Qaeda and militias are one - they both kill people and blow them up," he told Reuters in 2014.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:58:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P5LTGA7R3FMYXIT4IJOOFUDTHM.jpg?auth=bff1b54af73c9f8696813aaca094832e628aca0870d73329dd8a1e488432cd59&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Budget slashed for Indonesia's rescue agency despite disaster surge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/budget-slashed-indonesias-rescue-agency-despite-disaster-surge-2026-01-28/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia's main rescue agency had its funding cut by a parliamentary panel on Wednesday as part of a plan to divert government expenditure to other programmes, despite concerns over the number of disasters the agency has to deal with.

Ministries and agencies have been ordered to cut budgets to make room for areas that President Prabowo Subianto has prioritised, such as his flagship free meals programmes and higher defence spending.

The parliamentary panel approved a 69.38 billion rupiah ($4.15 million) - or 4.5% - reduction in rescue agency Basarnas' budget from 1.55 trillion rupiah in the initial allocation to 1.48 trillion rupiah, commission head Lasarus said during a meeting.

Indonesia sits on the "Pacific Ring of Fire", an area of high seismic activity atop multiple tectonic plates, making it susceptible to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

In January alone, the sprawling archipelago was hit by floods and landslides. At least 34 people were killed in landslides in West Java province over the weekend, and the rescue agency is rushing to see if it can rescue 32 others who are missing.

Cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra late last year killed 1,200 people and displaced over one million residents.

The cuts in the rescue agency's budget were proposed by the Finance Ministry and required approval from the parliamentary panel.

The agency's head Mohammad Syafii, who attended the meeting, accepted the decision but said many improvements were needed to optimise his agency's functions and ability to respond quickly.

For example, he said all regions should have their own local office of the rescue agency given the frequent natural disasters in the country.

There are 514 regions in Indonesia. Currently the agency has 38 offices - one in each province.

The committee acknowledged that a series of natural disasters had struck Indonesia last year and the agency required more funds, but went ahead with the cut anyway.

"The work of Basarnas has been outstanding but their capacity to handle the problems will be limited if the budget is not sufficient," the committee's deputy head Ridwan Bae said.

What was once his most potent campaign issue is now driving unease among voters unsettled by the administration’s aggressive tactics in its immigration crackdown , including the targeting of U.S. citizens and violent measures against peaceful protesters.

Illegal immigration and inflation were the twin issues that helped Trump win the election. Now, opinion polls show a growing number of Americans, including key independent voters, are unhappy with Trump's handling of both, putting Republicans on the defensive ahead of the midterms.

The polling shows most Republicans still back Trump’s push for mass deportations, but a sizeable minority are uneasy with a heavy-handed approach by federal immigration agents, which led to the shooting deaths of a mother of three and a nurse in Minneapolis this month.

Just 39% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of immigration, the lowest since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday. While 84% of Republican respondents said they support Trump on the issue, a fifth of them said federal agents had gone "too far" in their crackdown.

If those sentiments persist, they could spell trouble for Republicans in November, when Democrats are aiming to take control of Congress and block the president's agenda.

"This was one of the president's number one advantages and it has become a political liability for him," said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. "The base is still pretty comfortable with what Trump is doing. But it's not just about the base, it's about swing voters."

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration's approach to immigration.

"President Trump wants all Americans to feel safe in their communities. That guiding principle is why the President has promised to remove dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our country, urged local Democrat leaders to work with federal law enforcement, and called for a fact-based investigation into the tragic death of Mr. Pretti," she said in a statement.

Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the December deployment of nearly 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minneapolis and St. Paul provoked a national uproar with the fatal shootings of Renee Good on January 7 and then Alex Pretti on January 24. Both were killed during confrontations with immigration agents at protests.

Trump has taken steps in recent days to ease tensions in Minneapolis, dispatching his border czar to oversee the operation and signaling a willingness to work with state officials.

It remains unclear whether these moves reflect a recognition of the political risks to Republicans in November midterms, or are simply an effort to regain control of an operation that has produced daily images of masked federal agents responding aggressively to protesters confronting them in the streets.

Trump spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers about how to recalibrate his immigration strategy, according to a White House official and a source familiar with the talks. The discussions included a possible reduction of agents deployed to Minnesota and narrowing the focus there to deportations rather than broad enforcement operations, the sources said.

Some Republican strategists warned that a renewed focus on deporting the “worst of the worst,” as Trump promised during the campaign, was necessary to retain support from moderate Republicans and independents in November.

"Americans support secure borders, and they're willing to forgive mistakes when you're cleaning up the previous administration's fiasco - provided you're seen as targeting criminals," said Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican media strategist who worked on Hispanic outreach for Trump's 2020 campaign.

"The margin for error narrows dramatically if you’re perceived as going after gardeners and taco truck ladies."

Trump's softening of his tone and sidelining of Gregory Bovino - a top Border Patrol official and a lightning rod for opponents of the crackdown - followed days of criticism from a number of Republican lawmakers and governors.

A Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, Chris Madel, made headlines for his decision to quit the race over the tactics being used by federal agents in Minneapolis and what he described as indiscriminate arrests.

Zach Duckworth, a Republican state senator who was recently activated in the Minnesota Army National Guard to support local law enforcement, said he was so alarmed by top Trump officials labeling Pretti a "domestic terrorist" that he wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel , Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and others to object to the characterization.

He told Reuters that was a "tipping point," saying many of his constituents in the Minneapolis suburbs are centrists and support removing violent criminals, but are alarmed by the scope and tactics of Trump’s operations, which have also swept up people in the country legally.

Democratic strategists see opportunity for their party, which polls show is not trusted by most Americans to handle immigration, especially after former President Joe Biden's slow reaction to stem immigrants entering the country illegally.

Michael LaRosa, a former Biden White House official, told Reuters the overwhelming opposition by Democrats to Trump's crackdown would help to drive both progressive and moderate voters to the polls in November.

While an increasing number of traditional, moderate Republicans now oppose Trump's immigration crackdown, Democrats are at risk of misdiagnosing the moment and overplaying their hand, said Scott Rasmussen, a veteran pollster.

"Where the left is making a mistake on this issue is they think they're winning a fight to build support for illegal immigrants," Rasmussen said. "Where the right, especially the MAGA right, is wrong, is they are thinking everybody voted for what's happening in Minneapolis."

In interviews with eight Trump supporters in Delano, a Republican-leaning town just 10 miles (16 km) west of downtown Minneapolis, all said they stood squarely behind the president's immigration crackdown and would vote Republican in the midterms.

But they also acknowledged that immigration agents appeared poorly trained and ill-prepared for the task before them, and expressed worries that widespread criticism of ICE's tactics could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.

Jake Blackowiak, 33, worried the controversy could contribute to the party losing at least one chamber of Congress in the midterms.

"The Republicans aren't going to be able to pass any more laws or advance the agenda he promised," he said.

Former Republican Minnesota congressman Gil Gutknecht urged the White House to clarify its enforcement targets.

"To say that all the people who are being rounded up are violent criminals is an exaggeration," Gutknecht said in an interview. "They're not all murderers and rapists."

He said it was too early to tell whether the deaths in Minnesota would impact the midterms, but the White House should continue its immigration enforcement operation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:28:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ILHTO3MIWFLBVH42QPUIGY4SXA.jpg?auth=731e64944482759727adf2644957392d57f47e85848dd92b1a93dae4e326ddf2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio to face former US Senate colleagues on Venezuela policy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rubio-face-former-us-senate-colleagues-venezuela-policy-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to testify in the Senate about President Donald Trump's Venezuela policy on Wednesday, after scrambling to keep his former colleagues from passing a resolution to rein in the administration's war powers.

Rubio, a former Florida senator and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is likely to face a far less friendly reception than he did a year ago, when the Senate approved him unanimously to serve as the nation's top diplomat.

It will be the first time Rubio has publicly faced lawmakers' questions over the January 3 raid to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Two weeks ago, Trump's fellow Republicans narrowly blocked a resolution that would have barred Trump from further military action in Venezuela without Congress' authorization, with Vice President JD Vance forced to break a tie.

Rubio is set to tout the success of the military operation and insist there was no war with Venezuela and no U.S. occupation there, according to prepared remarks submitted to the committee.

"We will closely monitor the performance of the interim authorities as they cooperate with our stage-based plan to restore stability to Venezuela," Rubio said in the remarks. "Make no mistake, as the President has stated, we are prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation if other methods fail."

Several members of Congress, some Republicans as well as Democrats, have expressed frustration with the lack of communication from Trump officials about major operations, including the capture of Maduro and the elimination of many foreign aid programs supported by Congress.

Committee Chairman Jim Risch, a Republican senator from Idaho, was expected to praise Rubio for explaining to him the administration's plans for Venezuela, despite "confusion over how it will be done."

"Today is the opportunity to publicly explain the administration’s plan for the future of Venezuela," Risch will say, according to a copy of his opening remarks shared with reporters. "After our lengthy engagements in the Middle East in years past, many Americans are concerned about so-called 'forever wars'. I know this Administration is laser-focused on avoiding these experiences."

The war powers resolution had appeared to be on track to pass the Senate after five Republicans joined Democrats in voting to advance it, in rare Republican opposition to Trump.

But Trump railed at the five, saying they should never again be elected to public office. He and Rubio made repeated calls encouraging senators to change their votes by insisting there were no U.S. troops in Venezuela, and with promises including Rubio's agreement to come before the Senate committee. Two of them, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana, flipped their positions.

The close vote reflected concern in Congress about Trump's foreign policy and growing support for the argument that Congress, not the president, should take back the power to send U.S. troops to war, as spelled out in the Constitution.

Members of Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, said Rubio had insisted the administration did not plan regime change in Venezuela just days before U.S. troops removed Maduro, and that oil company executives were told about the operation before lawmakers.

Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a senior committee member, said he had "maybe 20 questions" he would like to ask on a range of issues, including Venezuela.

Coons said the administration never presented evidence tying alleged drug trafficking to the United States or to justify acting without consulting Congress.

"No evidence was proffered to explain or justify the Article Two urgent national security concern that would justify an action by the president of the United States without timely consultation with Congress, something the secretary from his 15 years of service in the Senate knows full well should have happened," Coons said on a recent call with reporters.

Trump this month said the U.S. will run Venezuela for years, told Iranians protesting against their government that "help is on the way," and threatened military action to take Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:30:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O3E45AITMZM47A2Z5KFU5ENLSA.jpg?auth=9dcac1a0e48efcb4d28c628446608150bc33624a63f5c13fbf00cabfb668e549&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Eastern German region of Saxony-Anhalt elects new state premier</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eastern-german-region-saxony-anhalt-elects-new-state-premier-2026-01-28/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The parliament of the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt elected Economy Minister Sven Schulze on Wednesday to succeed outgoing premier Reiner Haseloff, who stepped down ahead of elections in September that could see the far-right AfD win control of the state.

Schulze, from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's centre-right Christian Union (CDU), was elected comfortably in the first round of voting, avoiding the need for run-off votes that could have embarrassed the coalition of the CDU, centre-left Social Democrats and the Free Democrats.

Haseloff, 71, had previously announced his intention to step down after 15 years in office to allow his successor time to prepare for the September election, which is expected to test the so-called "firewall" strategy of mainstream German parties that have vowed not to work with the AfD.

Saxony Anhalt, which has lagged many other German regions with a struggling economy and a range of social problems, including a declining population, has seen a surge in support for the AfD, which could win control of a state legislature for the first time in September.

According to an opinion poll published on Tuesday, the AfD stands well ahead of any of the other parties in Saxony-Anhalt with 39% support, followed by the CDU with 26%, the Left Party with 11% and the SPD with 8%.

The small hard-left BSW party, which shares some of the AfD's priorities including restricting immigration and opposition to German support for Ukraine, stood at 6% and may fall under the 5% threshold for entry to parliament, potentially helping the AfD further.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:46:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IXFDX7NOEJLL5IPX4VXB3YSHNI.jpg?auth=897a6be276cfa8111a6b4d35867e3a6ca04cb3538732e02bdd51e53cf5410c17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian-Uzbek billionaire Usmanov wins lawsuit against German newspaper, documents show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/russian-uzbek-billionaire-usmanov-wins-lawsuit-against-german-newspaper-2026-01-28/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Russian-Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov has won a legal complaint against German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung over an article it published about him, court documents obtained by Reuters show.

In a ruling dated January 23, a Hamburg court prohibited FAZ from disseminating several statements, including allegations about Usmanov's links to top Russian officials, from an April 2023 article titled "On the Kremlin's instructions".

Usmanov has a net worth of $18.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and is subject to European Union and U.S. sanctions and a travel ban that were imposed after the start of the war in Ukraine .

He has launched multiple lawsuits in Europe with the ultimate goal of having the sanctions lifted. In some, his lawyers contested statements in the media that were used as the grounds for sanctions.

Usmanov's lawyer, Joachim Steinhofel, said in remarks about the Hamburg court's decision that the statements banned from further dissemination "repeated essential parts of the reasoning behind the sanctions against Mr Usmanov."

"This (the court decision) allows for the legally substantiated assessment that the EU sanctions' reasoning is nothing more than an accumulation of defamatory, groundless, and thus illegal allegations," he added.

Last month, Germany agreed with Usmanov to close an investigation into alleged foreign trade law violations, provided that he pay 10 million euros ($11.98 million). In 2024, German prosecutors dropped a money laundering investigation against him.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:46:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WXXBLI4KFNLOLHOGUV2PACGVNA.jpg?auth=3bfb5fec84ede7dd2692d1eaa16aaf1da8b1dc5cd7e4becc29ffef2de21256b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Kristin knocks out power to 800,000 in Portugal and barrels into Spain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/storm-kristin-knocks-out-power-800000-portugal-barrels-into-spain-2026-01-28/</link><description>LISBON/MADRID, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Storm Kristin left more than 800,000 people across central and northern Portugal without electricity early on Wednesday, toppling trees and utility posts, damaging homes, and disrupting motorway and rail traffic before moving inland to Spain, authorities said.

At least one person died when a tree fell on their car in Vila Franca de Xira, on the outskirts of Lisbon, according to emergency services.

Civil protection authorities reported around 1,500 weather‑related incidents, triggered by wind gusts of up to 150 km/h (93 mph), heavy rain and even snowfall in the country of nearly 11 million people.

Grid operator E-Redes said technical teams were working to reestablish power supplies to some 855,000 clients after their initial efforts were hindered by the severe weather.

The storm then pushed east into Spain, which is still dealing with the impact of a previous system, Storm Joseph. In the coastal town of Torremolinos, strong winds felled a palm tree on Tuesday, killing a woman.

More than 160 roads across Spain were affected by snow on Wednesday, including 27 motorways on the main highway network, such as the A‑6 linking Madrid with the northwest. Snow also blanketed rooftops in parts of central Madrid but caused no major disruptions.

Spain's national weather agency AEMET warned that large areas of the country would face very strong winds, with some gusts reaching hurricane force. Authorities in parts of southern Almeria province issued a red alert due to the intensity of the winds.

Local authorities closed parks, and in some areas outdoor sports and educational activities were suspended.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:47:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DW7VJCD2ARNEZFIWS5RC6UYMRQ.jpg?auth=d8644f68255ad6e8b2aae1264e64dc412d22fd76cb9be1159243ae9c8625a58d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda court releases prominent rights activist on bail</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-court-releases-prominent-rights-activist-bail-2026-01-28/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A Ugandan court on Wednesday released on bail a prominent rights activist whose detention was seen by campaign groups as part of a widespread crackdown on dissent ahead of the country's general election that was held on January 15.

Sarah Bireete, who heads the Centre for Constitutional Governance, a Kampala-based pressure group, was detained on December 30 after questioning the accuracy of the voter register to be used in the poll. She was later charged with offences related to alleged unlawful disclosure of voters' information.

On Wednesday Magistrate Winnie Nankya Jatiko released her on bail saying "the applicant satisfied all the relevant requirements for the grant of bail".

The official results of the poll showed long-ruling incumbent Yoweri Museveni securing 71.6% of the votes. Opposition leader Bobi Wine, who is in hiding and is being sought by the military, has rejected the results.

After Bireete's detention, CCG said she was being persecuted for helping to "amplify the voices of the oppressed and marginalised". International rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been demanding her unconditional release.

The 81-year-old Museveni, already Africa's third longest-ruling head of state, will have been president of the East African country for 45 years by the time his term ends in 2031.

Rights groups and the opposition have long accused his government of using the military to suppress dissent. The government denies those accusations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:47:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PWYQ33IDJBMRBPLFECSGCSVKBM.jpg?auth=daa2f270839708107bf0e2c5c826095b6768985f86ff128d5dc900e3895370a7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli lawmakers to hold initial vote on draft budget as elections loom</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-lawmakers-hold-initial-vote-draft-budget-elections-loom-2026-01-28/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Israel's parliament was expected to take its initial vote on the 2026 state budget draft on Wednesday, in a test of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government at a time when his coalition has been beset by political fractures.

The budget, as well as an accompanying economic plan, faces an uphill battle for approval as the government has become increasingly polarized. By law it must be approved by the end of March or a snap election would be triggered.

For more than two years, parties in Netanyahu's coalition have splintered over the war in Gaza , the ceasefire in October that has halted it, and demands by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties to exempt Jewish seminary students from mandatory military service.

Netanyahu told reporters on Tuesday evening he hoped the budget would pass and was concerned over the prospect of an election ahead of an October 2026 schedule.

"We are in a very sensitive situation and I think the last thing we need right now is elections," he said at a press conference. "We'll have elections later on this year, but I think it's a mistake to have them now, and I hope that people understand that and act sensibly."

A vote was expected later on Wednesday or early Thursday morning, following what is expected to be a long debate on the floor of parliament.

The main issue threatening to topple the coalition is a military conscription bill .

Netanyahu relies on ultra-Orthodox , or Haredi, parties for support and the bill to exempt seminary students from serving has been a thorn in the coalition for months.

Haredi parties have threatened to vote against the budget if a bill is not passed. But Netanyahu's other right-wing coalition partners - as well as the opposition - feel Haredi men must share in the burden, especially after two years of fighting in Gaza and Lebanon where nearly 1,000 Israeli soldiers were killed.

A spokesperson for Moshe Gafni, who heads the United Torah Judaism party, said UTJ had not yet decided whether to support the budget in the vote. Other Haredi parties did not immediately provide comment.

Israeli media reported that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told ultra-Orthodox parties that he would not link the budget vote to the draft law and that if they did not vote for the budget, Israel should have an election.

A spokesman for Smotrich, who has said the Haredi parties would benefit from extra spending this year, did not comment on the reports.

Even if the budget gets preliminary approval, it still needs to pass two more votes by March 31 to become law.

In all, state spending would be 662 billion shekels ($214 billion) excluding debt servicing. The deficit ceiling was set at 3.9% of gross domestic product, a level the Bank of Israel deems as too high since it does not allow for a reduction in the debt burden.

"Despite all my reservations and everything included in the budget ... it must be passed," Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said on Wednesday at a meeting of parliament's finance committee.

"The deficit target must not creep up, especially given the possibility of additional expenditures due to geopolitical developments."

The budget deficit slipped to 4.7% of GDP in 2025 from 6.8% in 2023. A spike in defence costs due to the Gaza war pushed the deficit higher the past two years.

While an October ceasefire has halted most fighting, it has not stopped entirely and both sides have accused each other of violating the deal's provisions.

France, Poland, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands have been invited to take part in the video conference , which follows ridicule from officials in Donald Trump 's administration over the time it takes for the 27-country bloc to make a decision.

The idea of forging ad-hoc coalitions allowing some EU countries to pursue projects without all of them having to agree has long tempted some of its members, and has already been applied to key projects including the euro currency.

It is gaining new momentum as Europe confronts widening insecurity, sluggish growth and deep political divergences.

"Now is the time for a Europe of two speeds," German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said on Tuesday in Berlin ahead of the video conference of finance ministers.

Klingbeil wants the countries invited to the call, which is scheduled for 3 p.m. (1400 GMT), to set a concrete agenda to strengthen the sovereignty, resilience and competitiveness of Europe, a letter seen by Reuters showed.

"To survive in an increasingly unpredictable geopolitical situation, Europe must become stronger and more resilient," Klingbeil wrote in the letter to his counterparts dated Monday, adding that continuing as before could not be an option.

The invitation said it is meant as a "kick-off," and a follow-up meeting in person in the margins of the next Eurogroup should follow.

"Due to the geopolitical situation, the EU simply cannot afford to wait for all 27 members anymore," said Nicolai von Ondarza, European expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).

He pointed to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's toughening stance and willingness to press ahead in Europe without unanimity, be it on the Mercosur trade deal or Ukraine.

The move by Germany's finance minister to include only six countries for Wednesday's call could alienate other EU members, but German officials said the approach was flexible.

The advance-group approach would work in different formats, depending on who wants to join, and will not be restricted to the six countries, they said.

France has long pushed for willing EU countries to go forward without the others and is expected to join the call, as is Italy's Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti.

"An effort is being made to find a framework for discussions to seek solutions to more complex situations in a restricted format," an Italian source said.

Germany's letter includes a four-point plan to push forward an EU capital markets union, strengthen the euro and better coordinate investment in defense and secure raw materials.

Klingbeil said the coalition also needs to move faster on a Savings and Investment Union to create better financing conditions for European businesses.

On the euro, he called for cuts to red tape and enhanced sovereignty in the payment sphere to highlight the currency's role as a safe haven based on predictability and rule of law.

He urged better cooperation on defence, which he said should be firmly embedded as a priority in the next EU multiannual budget, "turning defence into an engine for growth".

Supply chain resilience for critical minerals must also be strengthened, with greater strategic engagement with international partners, he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBOORRBXWBJ27HQYDL3D6P7L5Q.jpg?auth=c47a803347e4618cc940e1cdb193bf6b66b535afbf2f5d781cec5e1658f41e48&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine summons Hungary ambassador over election meddling allegations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-summons-hungary-ambassador-over-election-meddling-allegations-2026-01-28/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine's foreign ministry said it summoned Hungary's ambassador to Kyiv on Thursday to protest over Budapest's allegations of Ukrainian meddling in the upcoming Hungarian parliamentary election.

Nationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has intensified criticism of Ukraine in recent weeks, seeking to associate Hungary's opposition leader Peter Magyar with Kyiv and the European Union executive as the election campaign heats up.

Orban and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have engaged in a public war of words, with Zelenskiy accusing Orban, without naming him directly, of trying to "sell out European interests."

In response, Orban called his counterpart "a man in a desperate position" as Ukraine approaches its fourth anniversary of full-scale war since Russia invaded in February 2022.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto criticised the Ukrainian protest on Facebook on Wednesday.

"Based on what was said at the summoning of the ambassador, we must be prepared for the Ukrainians to continue their open and crude interference in the April elections in the interests of the (opposition) Tisza party."

Orban, in power since 2010, is facing a strong challenger for the first time with most polls consistently showing Magyar's centre-right Tisza party ahead of the premier's right-wing nationalist Fidesz after three years of economic stagnation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brussels greenlights $3.4 billion Spanish state aid for highly efficient power</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/brussels-greenlights-34-billion-spanish-state-aid-highly-efficient-power-2026-01-28/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission has approved a 3.1 billion euro ($3.4 billion) Spanish state aid scheme to support electricity output from highly efficient power plants, it said on Wednesday, amid an EU push to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Support will cover new or substantially refurbished combined heat and power (CHP) plant projects using natural gas, bioliquids, biogas and solid biomass.

Natural gas projects must include equipment enabling the use of at least 10% renewable hydrogen by volume to avoid perpetuating reliance on the fossil fuel.

The European Union has current targets to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and is pushing more broadly to reduce final energy consumption to mitigate the effects of climate change.

The Spanish scheme will run for 10 years and be open to operators of CHP installations that meet the definition of high-efficiency cogeneration under the EU's Energy Efficiency Directive, the Commission said in a statement.

Aid will be granted as a remuneration premium to compensate for investments in bringing CHPs onstream and for operating costs calculated and updated quarterly, the Commission said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QKG6UKCY7BKHHI2UTXKQ5GULFQ.jpg?auth=75029be756b6171ff8146623af2fe7aebc1fb0b4894de0d062788ec5e875d4c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs defence reinforcement in the Arctic, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-backs-defence-reinforcement-arctic-macron-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France supports the reinforcement of the defence position in the Arctic, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, ahead of a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

But what is Nipah virus, and how worried should people be?

Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40% to 75%, depending on the local healthcare system's capacity for detection and management, the World Health Organization says.

However, while it can also spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Candidate vaccines are under development, although none have been approved yet.

Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999. Since then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh. India also sees sporadic outbreaks. According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a group that tracks emerging disease threats and funds the development of medical tools to protect against them, as of December 750 cases had been recorded in all, and 415 of the patients died.

Reuters traced the spread of Nipah in a 2023 series, Bat Lands .

When first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs or contaminated tissues. Since then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its natural host: fruit bats.

More specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products - like raw date palm juice - containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection, the WHO says. Human-to-human spread has been found, mainly after close contact between a sick patient and their family or caregivers.

The initial symptoms of Nipah such as fever, headaches and muscle pain are not specific and can be confused with other diseases. These can then be followed by neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and some people experience severe respiratory problems. Seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to a coma in days. Most people who get better make a full recovery, but some experience long-term neurological problems.

While Nipah is a dangerous disease with a high fatality rate, it has not yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans or spreading easily worldwide, scientists say.

However, it remains a significant public health concern, according to the WHO, particularly in countries where outbreaks are more common. It can also lead to the mass culling of farm animals such as pigs that are susceptible to the virus.

Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally - and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period.

There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although a number of candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Their Nipah vaccine uses the same technology, and began phase II testing in Bangladesh in December in collaboration with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and with funding from CEPI.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:53:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs defence reinforcement in the Arctic, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-backs-defence-reinforcement-arctic-macron-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France supports the reinforcement of the defence position in the Arctic, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, ahead of a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally - and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period.

There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although a number of candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Their Nipah vaccine uses the same technology, and began phase II testing in Bangladesh in December in collaboration with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and with funding from CEPI.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:54:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel steps up evictions of Palestinians from East Jerusalem</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-steps-up-evictions-palestinians-east-jerusalem-2026-01-28/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 28 (Reuters) - In Silwan in East Jerusalem, south of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Kayed Rajabi and his neighbors have been handed eviction orders in favor of an Israeli settler organization which has already taken over parts of the Palestinian district.

Rajabi's home is surrounded by buildings that have raised large Israeli flags - a sign they are owned by settlers , who he said began buying homes in 2004, and have obtained about 40 buildings in Silwan now, many via forced evictions.

Settler group Ateret Cohanim had offered to buy him and other Palestinians out, he said, but most had refused.

He said he was among 32 families in the neighborhood who have now been ordered to leave, with him and his brothers given until the end of Ramadan - mid-March - to depart under an order from Israel's Supreme Court that he showed Reuters.

"They want to force me out of the house I was born in, where my eyes first opened to life," said Rajabi, explaining that his family had lived there since 1967 and bought the land from a Jordanian officer.

Daniel Luria, the executive director of Ateret Cohanim, called Palestinians in Silwan "illegal squatters", saying the land was owned by Yemeni Jews before 1929 and that moving back was rectifying a historical injustice. Rajabi said that account was untrue.

The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Palestinians seek East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war, for a future state and say that leaving their homes there could put an end to their hopes for ever. Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said the aim is to 'bury' the idea of a Palestinian state.

Israel deems all of Jerusalem its capital - a status not recognised internationally - and has encouraged Jewish settlement of predominantly Palestinian areas . Settler incursions, sometimes violent , have ramped up since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 triggered the Gaza war.

Silwan is particularly contentious due to its proximity to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a longtime flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions.

Rajabi said that Ateret Cohanim had offered him a blank check to leave, an offer he refused. "I wouldn't sell them even a grain of soil. They told me, 'Put whatever number you want and we're ready to pay'," he said.

He said that some people in the neighborhood had sold their homes, but that most families had refused.

Luria said that Ateret Cohanim had offered Silwan residents compensation for leaving. "This is part of an unfolding Zionist dream," said Luria of the purchase of homes in Silwan.

Numerous UN Security Council resolutions have called on Israel to halt all settlement activity, but successive Israeli governments have said settlements are critical to the country's security. If Palestinians refuse orders to leave, armed police go in to evict them and diggers demolish their homes.

Rajabi said that with the high prices for rent in Jerusalem, he does not know where he and his family will go.

"People will live in the streets," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HK4GVZSJVBIRNOLOIHRJ6V7KMM.jpg?auth=41b55fb42c9506a21d1d2449e2ec571d40f2af9e592bd12fd5ee425146175eb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland says more surveillance and security needed in region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland-says-more-surveillance-security-needed-region-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Greenland's prime minister said on Wednesday there were red lines that could not be crossed in discussions with the United States, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to boost security in the region in the face of a more aggressive Russia.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen were in Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron to shore up support over U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take over the Arctic island that has been Danish territory for centuries .

Macron said France shared the view that it was necessary to reinforce defence in the Arctic.

"Given Russia's stance in the Far North, China's economic presence, and the strategic consequences of this rapprochement, we agree on the need to strengthen our defence posture in the Arctic," he said.

France also supported increased NATO vigilance and activity in the Arctic, he said. "We are ready to join."

Talks between Greenland, Denmark and the United States are due to take place to try to find a solution to the crisis, but Nielsen said Greenland had some red lines that could not be crossed, even if he hoped to come to some sort of agreement, without elaborating.

"We are under pressure, serious pressure. We are trying to push back from the outside. We are trying to handle our people who are afraid, scared," he said in a joint conversation with Frederiksen at Sciences Po University.

But he also said: "We need to do more surveillance and security in our region because of the way Russia acts now."

The U.S. demand for control of Greenland has shaken transatlantic relations and accelerated European efforts to reduce dependence on the United States, even as Trump last week withdrew tariff threats and ruled out taking Greenland by force.

Frederiksen said that what the crisis had shown was that the majority of Europeans were on the same page and had been able to unite to push back on Trump's demands, notably his threat of additional tariffs on some European states.

"I think there are some lessons learned in the last couple of weeks for Europe," she later said at a press conference with Macron and Nielsen.

Saying the world order had changed forever and questioning what may happen in Washington in the future, Frederiksen said it was vital for Europe to become stronger, but also urged transatlantic unity given it was clear Russia did not want peace.

"If we allow Russia to win in Ukraine, they will continue," she said. "The best way forward for the United States, Europe is to stick together."

The diplomatic rift between Denmark and the United States, both founding members of NATO, had seemed in recent weeks to threaten the future of the military alliance, although the conflict has since been moved to a diplomatic track.

Half of the landmass in the Arctic is Russian territory . Since 2005 Moscow has re-opened and modernised tens of Soviet-era military bases, both on its Arctic mainland and on the islands off its northern coast.

Russia says talk of Moscow and Beijing being a threat to Greenland is a myth to whip up hysteria.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7BKVULUVVZLBLNFI35KW5C24II.jpg?auth=0047a7b8746880b65bb67cc660b628a1fcfae3fce4fef596c0ba4a6110ecb0d7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells Iran to make nuclear deal or next attack will be 'far worse'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-iran-make-nuclear-deal-or-next-attack-will-be-far-worse-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons or the next U.S. attack would be far worse.

"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS - one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!" Trump wrote in a social media post.

The Republican U.S. president, who during his first White House term pulled out of world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, noted that his last warning to Iran was followed by a military strike in June.

"The next attack will be far worse! Don’t make that happen again," Trump wrote. He also repeated that a U.S. "armada" was heading toward the Islamic Republic.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requested negotiations, state media reported on Wednesday.

Trump said a U.S. naval force headed by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, was approaching Iran. Two U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday that the Lincoln and supporting warships had arrived in the Middle East.

The warships started moving from the Asia-Pacific region last week as U.S.-Iranian tensions soared following a bloody crackdown on protests across Iran by its clerical authorities in recent weeks.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations over economic privations and political repression have since abated.

He has said the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear program after the June airstrikes by Israeli and U.S. forces on key nuclear installations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TO3IMSYUEJIKHNQ3CCOCOQ6AWY.jpg?auth=2ca6bd1a9ebae916c0f5e59d3e248ee5738cdb3b50588a0a4a094dd92d5dd8e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey aims to lift trade volume with Nigeria to $5 billion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/turkey-aims-lift-trade-volume-with-nigeria-5-billion-2026-01-28/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkey aims to lift its trade volume with Nigeria to $5 billion from about $2 billion, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday following a meeting with visiting Nigerian President Bola Tinubu.

Turkey exports aircraft, helicopters, machinery, iron and steel, and chemical products to Nigeria, while Nigeria supplies crude oil and agricultural commodities to Turkey.

The two countries signed agreements covering defence cooperation, infrastructure development, trade and investment, as well as joint efforts to tackle insurgency in Africa’s Sahel region.

Erdogan did not give a timeline for reaching the new trade target but said talks had begun.

“We see significant potential in the fields of trade and investment. In today’s meetings, our commitment is to the $5 billion trade volume target, and we discussed the steps needed,” he said.

Tinubu has been promoting foreign investment to spur growth in Africa’s largest economy following reforms introduced shortly after he took office in 2023.

Tinubu said "trade, business, no restrictions, giving opportunities to those who are ready to learn, work and prosper" is critical to his growth ambition. "How do we build an inclusive economy together? How do we involve vulnerable people? How do we ensure peace in the world?" the Nigerian leader asked.

Erdogan said Turkey would support Nigeria’s fight against insurgency, drawing on its own experience combating militant groups.

"Terrorist organisations emerging particularly in Africa’s Sahel region pose a threat to the peace of the entire continent,” he said. “We discussed opportunities for closer cooperation in military training and intelligence, and we are ready to share our country’s significant experience.”

Nigerian officials are expected to hold meetings with leading Turkish defence industry companies during the visit, Erdogan added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SOCUBISPWJLMFM4SWLYXPIPNYU.jpg?auth=ac056a6d1d3d2e6cea1697976ddc0cc4209355ed8eb994a7df88f890cc668464&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia weighs expansion of premium residency program to lure rich</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-weighs-expansion-premium-residency-program-lure-talent-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is drafting plans to extend its premium residency program to a wider selection of desirable individuals, including superyacht owners, those looking to live in the kingdom's flagship development projects and top students, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The deliberations, which have not yet been finalized, are part of efforts to attract foreign capital and visitors under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan to diversify the country's economy away from oil and transform society.

The person said that people purchasing real estate at Vision 2030 construction projects, such as Riyadh's $60 billion Diriyah development, could be eligible.

Potentially offering premium residency to ultra-wealthy individuals who moor superyachts in Saudi Arabia's waters appeared aimed at encouraging visitors to the new luxury Red Sea resorts.

High-achieving students may also be included.

Premium residency is currently available based on varying criteria.

It includes executives earning more than 80,000 Saudi riyals ($21,300) per month and specialized health and science professionals earning more than 35,000 riyals per month, according to an online brochure marketing the program.

Benefits include entry without a visa, the ability to work and the ability to extend premium residency status to family members.

The Saudi Premium Residency program did not immediately respond to emailed questions from Reuters.

The move would be the latest step in trying to make Saudi Arabia more attractive to foreign visitors.

The kingdom has already implemented rules affording premium residency to anyone purchasing a property worth more than $1 million.

Last year, the once ultra-conservative kingdom loosened restrictions on alcohol , allowing non-Muslim premium residents and high-earners to purchase alcoholic beverages at a designated Riyadh store.

Since January 22, non-Saudis have been allowed to own residential and commercial property in certain parts of the kingdom, though regulations have not yet been fully rolled out.

No one was ‍injured in the blaze which started in the attic of the Hotel des Grandes ​Alpes at around 7pm (18:00 GMT) on Tuesday. It was ​still burning and belching thick clouds of smoke late on Wednesday morning, the Prefecture of the Savoie region, where Courchevel is located, said on its website.

Officials said around 200 people were evacuated from the hotel last night, while the nearby Hotel Le Lana, was ‍also being evacuated on Wednesday morning due to risk as the fire was still ​ongoing. Staff and guests took refuge in other hotels, the local government said, while 131 firefighters have been deployed.

"They are working in ‌very difficult conditions," Vanina Nicoli, the prefect of Savoie, told reporters. Four of them were harmed by the ‍smoke, she said.

Firefighters managed to prevent the fire from spreading to other buildings so far and no further evacuations were planned at this stage, Nicoli said.

The Gendarmerie was looking into what caused the fire.

Corneille Nangaa, who leads the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), was referring to a strategic partnership agreement signed in Washington on December 4, under which the United States would obtain greater access to the Democratic Republic of Congo's critical minerals in exchange for investment and security cooperation.

In an interview with Reuters in Goma on Monday, Nangaa said the plan suffered from a lack of transparency and legal shortcomings, citing what he called "the opacity surrounding the negotiations" and "procedural flaws, particularly the violation of the Constitution and the law."

Nangaa's criticism of the deal raises further questions about the feasibility of U.S. investment in war-hit eastern Congo one year after M23 seized Goma, the region's biggest city, as part of a lightning offensive.

Most of eastern Congo’s key minerals, including coltan, lie in areas now held by M23, which has seized major mining zones such as Rubaya in North Kivu.

Mining sites offered to Washington could later become the subject of disputes because they may already have been granted to other partners, Nangaa said.

"The Americans may have signed it, but they should know that they signed it with an illegitimate regime, and a corrupt one at that," he said.

Asked for comment, the Congolese presidency rejected Nangaa's accusations, saying the partnership “fully falls within the constitutional prerogatives” of the elected president and government.

It called concerns over potential disputes with existing contract holders “speculative”, and said any cooperation would respect valid contracts and comply with Congo's mining regulations.

Congo's government has said the partnership will be presented to lawmakers for approval in March. "We have a sound majority in parliament, so we believe that we will get the parliament's approval", Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Economy Daniel Mukoko Samba told Reuters in Davos last week.

In the interview with Reuters, Nangaa said the AFC worked with neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda on security issues but denied receiving support from Kigali.

Rwanda denies backing M23, though a report by a United Nations group of experts in July assessed that it exercised command and control over the rebels.

Last week, Rwanda's ambassador to the United States said in a statement that Kigali engages in "security coordination" with AFC/M23.

The capture of Goma, a city of more than two million people on Congo's border with Rwanda, marked one of the biggest escalations in years of fighting in eastern Congo.

Nangaa told Reuters that security had improved in areas under rebel control since the takeover, adding that schools and hospitals were operating normally and that displaced people had returned home.

The U.N. Human Rights Office says M23, Congolese armed forces and other armed groups have committed serious rights violations , some of which may amount to war crimes. All sides deny wrongdoing.

Nangaa accused Kinshasa of blocking peace efforts, saying ceasefire commitments discussed in talks in Doha, mediated by Qatar with U.S. backing, had not been implemented. The Congolese government rejects those claims, blaming the rebel group for the continued violence.

M23 forces briefly entered the town of Uvira in December saying it sought to stop attacks on civilians, but later withdrew. Nangaa warned that further action could not be ruled out if insecurity continued.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BYNLJ4FIVVMBJKQ7PTAN3OIBHY.jpg?auth=34b3882a35dbf0c5827a7318c75e658a3ba098c655a4c21f2f77a1961ffd5fd0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gunmen kill three policemen in ambush in Nigeria's Katsina state</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/gunmen-kill-three-policemen-ambush-nigerias-katsina-state-2026-01-28/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Three police officers were killed and two others wounded when suspected armed gang members ambushed a routine patrol in northwest Nigeria's Katsina state on Tuesday, the police said on Wednesday.

The incident was part of a surge in attacks , including mass kidnappings by armed gangs operating from forest hideouts who have raided villages, schools and places of worship in the predominantly Muslim northwest.

Tuesday's ambush, the second in a week , highlights the region's persistent insecurity, where gangs known as bandits continue to hit rural communities and security forces despite ongoing military operations.

Katsina police spokesperson Abubakar Sadiq Aliyu said the officers came under heavy fire at about 1144 GMT along the Guga-Bakori road while on patrol. The team "responded bravely,” repelling the assault, but lost three officers in the shootout, Aliyu said in a statement.

Two wounded officers are being treated at a nearby hospital, he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Nigeria of failing to protect Christians. Nigerian authorities say Muslims are targeted as well as Christians and that they are doing their best to stop the violence in difficult circumstances.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nipah virus fears trigger airport checks across Asia after India confirms two cases</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-reports-two-nipah-virus-infections-thai-malaysia-step-up-screening-2026-01-28/</link><description>NEW DELHI/BANGKOK/SINGAPORE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Authorities across Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia have taken urgent steps to stop the highly lethal and epidemic‑prone Nipah virus spreading beyond India, rolling out airport temperature checks and other screening measures.

Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization because of its ability to spark fast‑moving outbreaks, its fatality rate of 40% to 75%, and the fact that there is no approved vaccine or cure.

Two infections were confirmed in India in late December.

The virus, carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can trigger a deadly brain-swelling fever in humans and can also spread directly from person to person through close contact. Several vaccines are in development but remain in testing.

The two people infected in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal in late December were health workers and both are under treatment at a local hospital, a district health officer told Reuters.

Authorities have identified and traced 196 contacts linked to the two cases with none showing symptoms and all testing negative for the virus, the Indian health ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday.

"Speculative and incorrect figures regarding Nipah virus disease cases are being circulated," the statement said. "Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, and field investigations were undertaken ... which ensured timely containment of the cases."

Reports of the infections put authorities on alert in neighbouring Southeast Asian nations as well as Nepal and Hong Kong.

Singapore's Communicable Diseases Agency said on Wednesday that it will set up temperature screening at its airport for flights arriving from areas affected by the infections in India.

The Ministry of Manpower is stepping up surveillance over newly arrived migrant workers from South Asia, and engaging primary care providers to increase vigilance, it said.

"We are also reaching out to our counterparts in South Asia, to better understand the situation. Work is ongoing to establish a global platform for countries to report genome sequencing of detected cases," the agency said in a statement.

A Hong Kong airport authority spokesperson said it was facilitating enhanced health screening measures enforced by the health department at Hong Kong International Airport, including temperature check at gates for passengers arriving from India.

Thailand earlier this week tightened airport screening measures, with neighbouring Malaysia following suit.

Thailand has assigned designated parking bays for aircraft arriving from areas with Nipah infections, its health ministry said, while passengers must complete health declarations before clearing immigration.

Malaysia's health ministry said it was boosting preparedness through health screening at international ports of entry, particularly for arrivals from countries deemed at risk.

"The ministry remains vigilant against the risk of cross-border transmission following sporadic infections in several other countries," it said in a statement on Wednesday.

China's disease control authority said on Tuesday that no Nipah infections had been detected in the country but there were risks of imported cases, state broadcaster CCTV said on Tuesday .

Nepal, which shares a busy border with India, said it was on "high alert" and had tightened screening for travellers. Health ministry officials said border points with India and China had been notified to remain vigilant and check suspected cases.

Nipah was first identified in 1998 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore, although scientists believe it has circulated in flying foxes for millennia and warn that a mutated, highly transmissible strain could emerge from bats.

India regularly reports sporadic infections, particularly in the southern state of Kerala , considered among the world's most at-risk regions for Nipah outbreaks. The virus has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in Kerala since it first appeared there in 2018.

The West Bengal cases are the state's first in nearly two decades, following five fatal infections in 2007, local media reported.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Switzerland to boost defence spending, funded by sales tax hike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/switzerland-boost-defence-spending-funded-by-sales-tax-hike-2026-01-28/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Switzerland plans to inject an additional 31 billion Swiss francs ($40.38 billion) into defence and security spending starting from 2028 and will increase sales tax for a decade to help fund it, the government said on Wednesday.

Citing a deterioration in the geopolitical situation, the governing Federal Council said defence must be strengthened in Switzerland, where spending on the military is not currently scheduled to reach 1% of gross domestic product until 2032.

Under the new plan, sales tax is to be increased by 0.8 percentage points for 10 years starting in 2028, it said.

"The world has become more volatile and insecure, and the international order based on international law is under strain," the government said, noting various European countries have responded by strengthening their defence capabilities.

Swiss officials and lawmakers warn that conflicts including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.S. rivalry with China and tensions in the Middle East pose a risk to the country, through threats such as spying, cyberattacks and even terror attacks.

The government said current financial planning no longer reflected increases in the cost of arms, which have been driven by inflation and greater demand.

The government's plan would need to pass parliament and faces a referendum that could take place next year, it said.

According to the plan, the spending priorities should also encompass investment in IT, cybersecurity and electromagnetic reconnaissance, as well as police and border protection.

In a statement, the Egyptian foreign ministry said four Egyptian crew members were currently on board the Reem alKhaleej vessel at Iran's Bandar Abbas port.

Iran said last month that it had seized a foreign oil tanker carrying 4 million litres of smuggled fuel near the Iranian island of Qeshm in the Gulf. It did not name the vessel or disclose its nationality, but said that 16 foreign crew members had been detained on criminal charges.

Iran, which has some of the world's lowest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and a sharp fall in the value of its national currency, has been seeking to curb widespread fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf states.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Small island states rate China as top development partner as West cuts aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/small-island-states-rate-china-top-development-partner-west-cuts-aid-2026-01-28/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A survey of small island ‌developing nations such as Mauritius and the Maldives showed China rated as the top bilateral development assistance partner amid U.S. aid cuts and Washington's pivot away from climate change, a report by ODI Global found.

Data from an ODI survey to which officials from 29 small island developing states responded found that in the aggregate, governments saw China as the most ‌valued bilateral partner - a view that has geopolitical implications, according to lead author Emily ​Wilkinson.

"These countries are important to different donors for geopolitical reasons," Wilkinson told Reuters.

China's showing among Caribbean countries - where Beijing historically had less involvement than the likes of the United States or the United Kingdom - was surprising, ‍she added.

The survey, conducted between July and November 2025, includes countries spanning from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, including the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Barbados, Cabo Verde, Mauritius and the Maldives.

Nations grouped under the small island developing nations moniker as ⁠defined by the World Bank also include some non-island states such as Belize and Guyana.

While small, some ‍are strategically located for the world's superpowers along key maritime routes.

A breakdown shows a more nuanced picture. The UK topped the ‌list ‌for half of the Caribbean respondents while Australia topped the list in the Pacific. China was number one for the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea island states.

ODI's analysis of finance flows capturing data between 2020 and 2023 shows Beijing provided $6 billion in developmental aid to small island states in the period, outstripping official ⁠development finance from Australia, ⁠at $4.78 billion, the United ​States at $3.17 billion and Japan at $2 billion.

Those figures came before U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office in January 2025, when he largely shuttered USAID - the vehicle for most American aid spending - and has scaled back any funds for climate ‍change.

The survey also found that while donor nations increasingly push innovative financing, such as debt swaps and debt pause clauses when climate disasters strike, there is limited take-up.

"The bigger vulnerability these countries say is the disproportionate impact on the extreme weather events ​have on their economies and the fact that they have, many ‍of them, very limited access to concessional finance," she said, adding the instruments do not get to the root of the problem ​because they don't actually reduce the level of debt.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PLIXCC2MFVOABJRRKV2OPHSUNE.jpg?auth=104db9976a832007a7f79ae43ad09722db166bb73d852964b92099bbe217df97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German police search Deutsche Bank offices in money-laundering probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/business/20260128-german-police-search-deutsche-bank-offices-in-money-laundering-probe</link><description>German prosecutors and police on Wednesday searched Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt and its office in Berlin in an investigation over suspected money laundering offences, officials said.

According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily , the probe is connected to suspected offences in the bank's dealings with companies linked to Russian billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich.

Prosecutors confirmed the raids at the premises of Germany 's biggest bank but did not say who was being targeted.

The Frankfurt prosecutors' office said it was carrying out an "investigation into unknown responsible parties and employees of Deutsche Bank on suspicion of money laundering... and related additional allegations under the Anti-Money Laundering Act".

"In the past, Deutsche Bank maintained business relationships with foreign companies that... are themselves suspected of having been used for the purpose of money laundering," a spokesman for the office said in a statement to AFP.

It said the investigation was being carried out by a specialist economic crime unit along with the federal police.

A spokesman for Deutsche Bank confirmed the searches, and the bank said it was "cooperating fully with prosecutors" but refused to comment further.

News site Der Spiegel said the search in Frankfurt involved around 30 plainclothes investigators.

According to financial sources, the probe relates to alleged offences committed between 2013 and 2018.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Deutsche Bank was being investigated on suspicion of failing to report possible money laundering in a timely manner.

The daily reported that the investigation involves both payments that Deutsche Bank received via a Russian correspondent account and the bank's previous dealings with Abramovich's own companies.

Abramovich has been sanctioned by the EU following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The raids come on the eve of the publication of the bank's results for the fourth quarter of 2025.

Deutsche Bank has faced scrutiny on several occasions in recent years over suspicious transactions.

In 2022, its offices were raided over "suspicious activity reports filed by the bank", again in relation to money laundering.

Media reports at the time said that the investigation centred on a transaction involving Rifaat al-Assad , the uncle of Syria 's then leader Bashar al-Assad .

In 2019, US Congressional committees issued subpoenas for Deutsche Bank's records on US President Donald Trump, including suspicious activity reports.

The bank reportedly lent more than $2 billion to Trump's businesses in the 1990s when other lenders wouldn't, in deals that piqued the interest of regulators .

The Trump family subsequently sued the bank to stop it from complying with the subpeonas.

The Frankfurt-based group also came under scrutiny for its role as a correspondence bank that handled foreign transactions for Danske Bank's Estonian branch, at the centre of a 200-billion-euro ($212-billion) money-laundering affair between 2007 and 2015.

Deutsche Bank subsequently agreed to pay a fine of 13.5 million euros for failing to report suspicious activity quickly enough, after an investigation by Frankfurt prosecutors.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:34:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1eec1a08-fc57-11f0-aacf-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-28T132931Z-1361127052-RC2CAJAD8Q13-RTRMADP-3-DEUTSCHE-BANK-RAIDS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘As in wartime’: Iranian doctors recount deadly crackdown on protesters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-as-in-wartime-iranian-doctors-recount-deadly-crackdown-on-protesters</link><description>One month after Iran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests that has left thousands dead, information and witness accounts are beginning to emerge.

The protests started on December 28 over a rise in the cost of living following a sharp fall in the Iranian rial and rapidly spread nationwide. They were met with a violent response, the full extent of which only began to surface after more than two weeks of an unprecedented nationwide internet blackout.

Several Iranian doctors who have since left the country told FRANCE 24 they were mobilised at the height of the protests, on the evenings of January 8 and January 9.

Their accounts converged, describing scenes of unprecedented chaos that some called "apocalyptic", and injuries resembling those seen in war. Medical facilities were quickly overwhelmed as dozens of wounded patients poured into each department, forcing staff to prioritise treatment according to the severity of injuries, they said.

"Just imagine: It was Thursday evening, there was no internet, communications were cut, and it was extremely difficult to reach doctors and ask them to come urgently to deal with this influx of people shot by bullets," one doctor said.

As the situation worsened, he said there was a wave of solidarity, with private hospitals – usually expensive – opening their doors.

"They were also overwhelmed. They refused no one and treated patients for free. Doctors said they did not want to make money, care had to be accessible to everyone."

Those injured over the two nights came from all age groups. "There was a 70-year-old man shot in the back, but also children and teenagers as young as 14," the doctor said.

Most wounds were concentrated on the head, face, abdomen, lower abdomen and flanks.

From midnight on January 8, the nature of the injuries changed, the doctor said. Live ammunition was now being used. "It was as if [the security forces] had received orders to shoot everyone, as in wartime," he said, adding that he was still operating at 2am.

The following night he was called in again to serve as reinforcement. "On Friday, they called to say a patient had arrived with a live round wound. From that moment on, there were only live rounds."

"The injuries suggested people were trying to flee, that they were hit by shots into the crowd without any specific target, at an angle. These are not the injuries seen in isolated clashes, for example between thieves and the police," he added.

Another doctor, deeply shaken, said he was unable to recover from what he witnessed. “My back is literally bent. I have never seen anything like this in my life,” he said, comparing the scenes to the Holocaust .

Videos authenticated by the France 24 Observers team showed the bodies of patients who died from severe injuries lined up, and in some cases stacked, in hospital corridors, reflecting the high number of fatalities.

According to Amnesty International , which has collected videos, photos and witness accounts, Iranian security forces used a wide array of lethal weapons – assault rifles and automatic or semi-automatic machine guns – firing continuously and indiscriminately into crowds. Evidence collected by the NGO indicated the authorities "committed mass unlawful killings on an unprecedented scale amid the shutdown".

In addition to those who were seriously wounded who flooded into Iranian healthcare centres on those nights, a number of protesters chose to avoid hospitals for fear of being arrested.

Some were treated clandestinely in private homes, "under extremely difficult conditions due to a lack of equipment", while painkillers quickly became unavailable, Iranian health workers told the French daily Libération.

Another witness told FRANCE 24 that an 18-year-old protester shot in the leg was admitted to hospital under a false name. Amid chaos and heightened security, her parents ultimately took her home, where a doctor operated on her.

One of the doctors interviewed by FRANCE 24 said he answered nearly 600 calls in two days, providing remote medical advice without intervening directly.

"It is impossible to know the exact number of deaths," he said. "Many died in the street without reaching hospital. Families took them home to keep them away from the authorities, then buried them secretly, out of sight."

According to a tally published Wednesday by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 6,221 people were killed , including 5,858 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 100 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating. The crackdown has seen more than 42,300 arrests, it added.

The agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran, verifies each death with a network of activists on the ground.

Two senior officials from Iran’s health ministry, quoted by Time magazine , said up to 30,000 people may have been killed in Iranian streets on January 8 and 9 alone.

One doctor said he did not witness direct intervention by security forces during treatment at the public hospital in Tehran where he worked. "But I saw people trying to obtain information about patients operated on during the night."

According to testimonies collected by Le Monde , some doctors deliberately entered false diagnoses – such as "liver surgery" – in medical files to protect patients, while intelligence agents reportedly collected radiology images showing bullet wounds.

In a voice note heard by FRANCE 24, a protester said he feared for his safety after accompanying a severely injured friend to hospital.

"I have never seen anything like this! They brought Dushkas (Soviet-made DShK heavy machine guns) into the street. They fired in continuous bursts, constantly changing ammunition. They spared no one," he said.

"My friend was standing next to me. I suddenly saw him fall. He was shot in the foot," he recounted tearfully. "I used my belt as a tourniquet and said to him, ‘Get up! Stand up!’ But he didn't say anything, he didn't answer me. Then I saw he had been shot again in the chest," he explained.

"We took him to hospital, where they told us it was already over for him and that we should take him away before [the security forces] came to collect his body."

That night haunts him, and he knows he is still not safe.

"The hospital surveillance cameras filmed us," he said, noting that Iranian authorities analyse CCTV footage. "Since then, I shake whenever I step outside. I fear that facial recognition software identified me. I haven't gone home. I'm afraid, and I don’t know what to do."

Security forces were known to target hospitals earlier in the unrest. On January 3, before the peak of the protests, they attacked Khomeini Hospital in Ilam, western Iran, firing teargas inside the building and arresting protesters from their hospital beds, triggering clashes outside.

Many injured protesters are still waiting for care, particularly those shot in the eyes with lead pellets fired from shotguns.

Amnesty International said such weapons were sometimes used at distances of less than two metres with protesters “repeatedly” targeted, particularly in the face.

At Farabi Hospital in Tehran, the capital’s main ophthalmology centre, "We received 55 patients from the provinces – from Qom, Hamedan and Aligoudarz – in recent days,” said hospital director Dr Ghassem Fakhrai in an interview with the official ISNA news agency.

"In the early hours of Friday morning, a large number of patients arrived with eye injuries, some with injuries to both eyes […]. By Saturday, we had treated 700[…]. Including transfers elsewhere, the total is nearly 1,000 patients. They require emergency surgery. This excludes those with just torn eyelids," he said.

"At Kasra Hospital in Karaj, in a single night from Thursday to Friday (January 8-9), around 40 eyes were removed," a first responder told Libération . "Numerous amputations caused by live rounds and crushed bones have also been reported."

Medical workers were also targeted in the crackdown. One doctor told FRANCE 24 that a colleague was killed on his way to the hospital.

Others were reportedly arrested for treating the wounded . Dr Alireza Golchini, a general surgeon at Dehkhoda Hospital in Qazvin in central Iran, was reportedly arrested for providing humanitarian assistance, according to several human rights advocates.

He has now been accused of espionage and faces the death penalty.

"Protocols are prepared, files are complete, and committees are in place to oversee the handover, ensuring a complete transfer of governance in the Gaza Strip across all sectors to the technocratic committee," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told AFP.

The 15-member National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) is a team of Palestinian technocrats created as part of the US-sponsored ceasefire agreement which came into effect on October 10.

It is charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza and will work under the supervision of the "Board of Peace", which US President Donald Trump will chair.

The NCAG, headed by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, is expected to enter the Gaza Strip once the territory's Rafah crossing, on its border with Egypt , reopens.

Hamas spokesman Qassem added that the Rafah crossing "must be opened in both directions, with full freedom of exit and entry to the Gaza Strip, without any Israeli obstacles".

Rafah is Gaza's only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel and is a key entry point for both people and goods.

It has been closed since Israeli forces took control of it in May 2024, except for a limited reopening in early 2025, and other bids to reopen have failed to materialise.

NCAG head Shaath announced last week that Rafah would reopen in both directions the following week.

Qassem told AFP the "independent national committee's announcement of the opening of the Rafah crossing is important".

"What is more important is that we monitor this committee's handling of citizens' departures and entries in full freedom in accordance with the agreement, and not according to Israeli conditions," he added.

Israel has said it would only allow pedestrians to travel through the crossing as part of its "limited reopening" once it had recovered the remains of the last hostage, Ran Gvili.

Israeli forces brought back Gvili's remains on Monday and his funeral was held in the southern town of Meitar on Wednesday.

Qassem said Wednesday that "it is clear that Hamas is committed to the agreement to stop the war on the Gaza Strip", which began after the militant group's deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

"It has carried out everything required of it in the first phase and is ready to enter all tracks of the second phase," he added.

With the technocratic committee's creation and the last hostage held in Gaza returned to Israel, the ceasefire deal's next important milestones will be Hamas's disarmament and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza.

Though Hamas said the return of Gvili's body showed its commitment to the ceasefire deal, it has so far not surrendered its weapons.

The group has repeatedly said disarmament is a red line, but it has also suggested it would be open to handing over its weapons to a Palestinian governing authority.

Neither Israel nor Hamas have committed to a clear date or strategy for withdrawal or disarmament.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:38:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7ab58472-fc5d-11f0-9113-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-28T123002Z-1752778568-RC2AAJALUHY0-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainians face tough weeks as Russia targets power sector during freeze</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainians-face-tough-weeks-russia-targets-power-sector-during-freeze-2026-01-28/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Life will be particularly tough for Ukrainians over the next three weeks due to plunging temperatures and intense Russian attacks on the energy system that have already deprived millions of light and heat, a senior lawmaker said on Wednesday.

Despite progress in peace talks that has led to trilateral negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the United States for the first time, Russia has stepped up bombardments beyond the front line that stretches across eastern and southern Ukraine.

Temperatures of below -20 degrees Celsius (-4°F) are expected in the northern and eastern part of Ukraine next week, according to official forecasts, extremely low for the country.

"The bad news is that there will indeed be frosts, and it will be difficult," Andriy Gerus, the head of the parliament's energy committee, told the national TV channel, Marathon.

"The good news is that we need to hold out for three weeks, and then it will get easier," he added, citing predicted warmer temperatures and increased solar power from longer days.

The last two Russian missile and drone attacks on the capital Kyiv in January left about a million people without electricity and 6,000 apartment buildings without heating. After weeks of repairs, about 700 buildings still lack heat.

That picture is replicated across the country, with northern and eastern Ukraine, home to major cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, regularly targeted, resulting in power restrictions for industry and power cuts for consumers.

Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector have long been key elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.

The head of Ukraine's largest private power producer DTEK told Reuters last week that Ukraine is nearing a "humanitarian catastrophe" due to the damage to its energy systems amidst the freezing temperatures, calling for a ceasefire on attacks on energy assets. Kyiv has targeted Russian oil processing infrastructure to reduce state revenues funding the war.

Ukraine's solar energy association said around 1.5 gigawatts of new solar capacity was commissioned by Ukraine in 2025 and the total installed solar capacity in Ukraine exceeded 8.5 gigawatts, including residential installations.

The volume is higher than the installed capacity of all three Ukrainian-controlled nuclear power plants of 7.7 gigawatts - and helped the country cope during repairs to those plants last summer - but output depends on the weather.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said this month Ukraine's damaged energy system was meeting only 60% of the country's electricity needs this winter, with electricity generation capacity of 11 gigawatts against a need of 18 gigawatts.

Maximum electricity imports from EU countries, combined with power cuts across entire regions, are allowing the system to remain balanced nevertheless.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:33:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K2L3XBF3PZM5XLZMI4K2WF6WVA.jpg?auth=1e9f0fcf49017741f01a6180eb4af3b75a356148ec12100281c02e4d4ae310dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French PMs Philippe and Attal favoured centrist candidates for next presidential election -poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-french-pms-philippe-attal-favoured-centrist-candidates-next-presidential-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Former French Prime Ministers Edouard Philippe and Gabriel Attal are the favoured candidates to lead the centrist challenge in next year's presidential election, said an Elabe/BFM TV poll on Wednesday.

The centrist French political bloc close to President Emmanuel Macron lost its grip in the lower house of parliament after Macron called a snap parliamentary election in 2024, and it has faced unyielding pressure from both the far-right National Rally (RN) and far-left France Unbowed (LFI) parties.

Philippe - Macron's first prime minister - has consistently portrayed himself as a 2027 presidential candidate .

He has also increasingly criticised Macron in recent years, as Macron's attempts to get a budget through parliament has faced consistent challenges from opposition parties.

The Elabe/BFM TV poll added that former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was seen as the favoured candidate from the traditional, conservative right-wing camp for the 2027 election.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:35:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AHFQNP6MCJNRNPECF4MUWEX6UI.jpg?auth=930138880960deabab0a0983df94381b65430cfd8f59f84b07e08c53497d9296&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US tells UN: Gaza demilitarization to include internationally funded buyback program</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-tells-un-gaza-demilitarization-include-internationally-funded-buyback-program-2026-01-28/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The demilitarization of Gaza will include decommissioning weapons through an agreed process "supported by an internationally funded buyback" program, the United States told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday.

Palestinian militant group Hamas retains control of just under half of Gaza following an October ceasefire deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump . The agreement ties further Israeli troop withdrawals to Hamas giving up its weapons.

The United States - along with the 26 countries who have so far joined Trump's so-called Board of Peace and in consultation with the Palestinian National Committee that it oversees - will apply pressure on Hamas to disarm, according to the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz.

"Hamas must not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly or indirectly, in any form, period," he told the 15-member council. "All military terror and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt.

"International, independent monitors will supervise a process of demilitarization of Gaza to include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning and supported by an internationally funded buyback and reintegration program," he added.

Waltz did not elaborate and the U.S. mission to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for more detail on the independent monitoring and proposed buyback program.

Hamas recently agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions and with mediators, sources have said. However, two Hamas officials told Reuters that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday Washington believes disarmament by Hamas militants would come with some sort of amnesty for the Islamist group.

Hamas remains heavily armed, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told the Security Council.

"It still holds thousands of rockets, anti-tank missiles, and tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles. In total, Hamas still holds roughly 60,000 assault rifles," Danon said. "These weapons are used not only against Israel but against Gazans who oppose Hamas rule."

The Security Council in November mandated Trump's Board of Peace through 2027 and solely focused on the Gaza Strip. Russia and China abstained, complaining the U.S.-drafted resolution did not give the United Nations a clear role in Gaza's future.

The resolution described the board as a transitional administration "that will set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza" under Trump's peace plan until the Palestinian Authority has satisfactorily reformed. It also authorized the board to deploy a temporary International Stabilization Force in Gaza.

"We salute and thank our friends who have agreed to contribute to the international stabilization force," Waltz said. The United States has not yet announced which countries have agreed to contribute.

"The ISF will begin to establish control and stability, so that the Israeli Defense Forces can withdraw from Gaza based on standards, milestones and time frames linked to demilitarization," said Waltz.

He added that these would be agreed upon by the Israeli military, the ISF and the guarantors for the ceasefire agreement - the United States, Egypt and Qatar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:39:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2PXLTPH2YZLPDGMS27MGBRNP4E.jpg?auth=7dab38a281158cbd5ab12cf2dd1bc646dc6d60d15bb99afceb68ff894d62ca08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump warns Minneapolis mayor over lack of cooperation with immigration agents</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-warns-minneapolis-mayor-over-lack-cooperation-with-immigration-agents-2026-01-28/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday he was "playing with fire" after the Democratic leader reiterated that his city would not help federal agents enforce immigration law, a day after the president said his administration would "de-escalate a bit" in the city.

Tensions remained high in Minneapolis, where observers and activists say immigration raids appear to have been more targeted and less confrontational over the last 24 hours. The city has been convulsed by unrest after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by federal officers, including Saturday's killing of nurse Alex Pretti.

Trump's administration has signaled it will soften its approach, dispatching border czar Tom Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism.

A senior administration official said Homan's arrival would mark a shift to more traditional targeted operations rather than the broad sweeps Bovino has led in multiple cities. Yet it remained unclear how much would change in a city where federal agents have regularly clashed with protesters.

Observers and activists told Reuters that Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity appeared to slow somewhat on Tuesday before resuming in full on Wednesday. They said there did now appear to be more of an emphasis on targeted exercises.

On Wednesday, ICE agents were seen in several parts of the city rolling up to homes and businesses in caravans of three vehicles with six to eight agents in total, then knocking on doors and looking around, seemingly for a specific person.

If that person was not found, observers said, the agents were seen leaving. In past weeks, agents might have begun randomly stopping people and demanding to see proof of legal status, a practice that has enraged community members and led to heated encounters.

It is difficult to know precisely how many raids are taking place. Authorities do not share that information, and volunteers who track ICE and Border Patrol vehicles say many of their encrypted communication chats have broken into atomized, hyper-local groups, partly to avoid infiltration by federal agents.

"They definitely shift around," said Patty O'Keefe, a community ICE observer in south Minneapolis. "Let up for a few days so people let their guard down, I think."

One observer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe the change in tone from Trump meant there would be a meaningful slowdown in detentions.

"Like everybody out here, though, we can hope that maybe the change of having Homan come in could mean that ICE will shoot and kill less, that they won't attack people like us keeping watch on them," he said.

In one sign that political tensions remain heated, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat and a frequent Trump target, was sprayed with a foul-smelling liquid by a man with a syringe during a Tuesday town hall, where she called for the abolition of ICE.

Omar was unharmed, and Minneapolis police arrested the suspect, Anthony Kazmierczak, 55, for third-degree assault. It was not clear whether Kazmierczak, who was booked into Hennepin County Jail, had an attorney.

Separately, Ecuador's foreign ministry sent a note of protest to the U.S. embassy in Quito after the ministry said an ICE agent tried to enter its Minneapolis consulate on Tuesday.

Under mounting political pressure, Trump had dialed back his attacks on Frey and Governor Tim Walz after speaking with both Democrats in the wake of Pretti's killing, vowing to work with them to lower the temperature.

But on social media on Wednesday, Trump faulted Frey for saying the city would not enforce immigration laws: "Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!"

Trump has threatened to cut off funding for states that include so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, which limit how much cooperation they give federal immigration authorities.

In response, Frey wrote on social media, "The job of our police is to keep people safe, not enforce fed immigration laws."

Pretti, 37, was shot dead during protests near his home on Saturday, and some administration officials immediately accused him of planning to kill law enforcement officers, citing the handgun he was carrying.

But video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot a restrained Pretti in the back.

The killing, coupled with the earlier fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer, has become a major political crisis for Trump. A growing number of Republicans in Congress, who rarely buck Trump, have called for independent investigations into the shooting.

Stephen Miller, the White House adviser widely seen as the architect of Trump's immigration policy, said in a statement reported by CNN that agents "may not have been following" protocol before Pretti was shot. Miller had previously described Pretti as an "assassin" and "terrorist" immediately after the shooting.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:40:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DTBLHQTWSZNTHNII6SD2R5YPW4.jpg?auth=79bdba2327cca2703c042a05e029124203472784dfbdf4c17a275f75f320af4b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio says territorial issue over Donetsk yet to be bridged between Russia, Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rubio-says-territorial-issue-over-donetsk-yet-be-bridged-between-russia-ukraine-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Territorial issues over Donetsk are the remaining item that still require a bridging of views at U.S.-mediated talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday, describing the issue as "a very difficult one."

FBI agents were searching the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in Union City, the agency said in a statement, a facility that state officials opened in 2023.

Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, including winning in Georgia. Trump returned to the White House for a second term last year after winning the 2024 election.

Representatives for Fulton County's election office referred queries to the county's external affairs office, which did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The U.S. Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The Democratic-leaning county is home to Atlanta, Georgia's biggest city, and backed Biden by a wide margin in the 2020 election.

Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn the election result, pressuring the state's top election official to "find" him votes that would allow him to claim victory. Earlier this month he asked a state court for $6.2 million in legal fees he said he spent fighting criminal charges of election interference filed by the county's chief prosecutor, District Attorney Fani Willis.

The prosecution of Trump by Willis for alleged racketeering foundered after revelations that she had a romantic relationship with one of the lawyers she hired, and the case was dismissed last year. The New York Times reported last year that the U.S. Justice Department has issued subpoenas for records related to Willis.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has also sued several states, demanding that they turn over large volumes of voter data. States have challenged the demands as an unconstitutional infringement on their authority to manage elections. A few judges have tossed out the lawsuits, most recently this week in Oregon.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:30:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RL4IF645XNI6VN4DDDZWXMGEFA.jpg?auth=64d39b0c201f633bfa965b9164f971e0dd0046fb45033b2807f4b7f5fda768af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fall of top Chinese general stirs US uncertainty about China's military</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/fall-top-chinese-general-stirs-us-uncertainty-about-chinas-military-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON/BEIJING, Jan 28 (Reuters) - With the downfall of China's top general, the United States has lost an important contact on Beijing's top military body and now faces a People's Liberation Army that increasingly lacks steady, experienced commanders, said former U.S. officials and analysts.

China's defense ministry said on Saturday that Zhang Youxia, second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), is under investigation. It is the latest and highest-profile purge of the country's top military leadership amid Xi's crackdown on corruption in the armed forces.

For Washington, Zhang's surprising demise removes a respected and well-known figure within China's military at a time when successive U.S. administrations have worked to build senior-level contacts to avoid mishaps between the world's two most powerful militaries.

Several former senior U.S. officials told Reuters that Zhang's dismissal came as a shock.

Xi allowed Zhang to communicate with the U.S. during the Biden administration after a 17-month-long period during which China had cut off nearly all military-to-military communications following a visit to Taiwan by then-Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.

Such a senior-level connection - in China's political system, Zhang outranks the defense minister - was seen as an important relationship and a channel that remained viable for further talks.

One of just a few leading officers with combat experience from China's invasion of Vietnam in the late-1970s, Zhang was seen in the U.S. as a competent adviser to Xi, who sits atop the Central Military Commission, now staffed by only one general, a career political commissar Zhang Shengmin.

"Who does Xi Jinping convene in a crisis if there's only one person on his commission?" said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore who engaged with Zhang as a former U.S. defense official.

Thompson said he believed Zhang was the one active-duty PLA officer who could give Xi objective advice about China's military capabilities and shortcomings, as well as the human cost of conflict.

"There's a risk that Xi Jinping is given bad advice by sycophants who tell him what he wants to hear," he said. "That creates a risk of miscalculation."

A senior U.S. administration official said the White House had nothing to share regarding "reports of palace intrigue" in China, adding that the Trump administration is "building a military capable of denying aggression anywhere in the First Island Chain."

The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Washington also did not respond.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held talks multiple times with China's Defense Minister Dong Jun - who does not sit on the CMC - since September, part of U.S. efforts to improve communications with China over its military modernization, nuclear weapons build-up, and more aggressive posture toward U.S. allies and actions in the Indo-Pacific.

But American officials have long prized contact with vice chairs of the CMC over the country's Defense Ministry, which lacks command authority over China's armed forces.

Among senior Chinese generals, Zhang was a known quantity to U.S. officials, having joined a week-long military delegation to the U.S. in May 2012 when he was a lower-level general.

David Stilwell, a former U.S. Air Force General who served as the State Department's top diplomat for East Asia in the first Trump administration, recalls that Zhang was the only Chinese officer who wanted to fly in one of the U.S. military's Osprey aircraft on that trip.

"He is very different from his fellow PLA brothers. He could have fit in very well in the U.S. military," Stilwell said, noting that he was keen to talk to U.S. soldiers and try out U.S. weapons, and struck the Americans as a professional rather than political soldier.

Still, Stilwell said senior-level engagement with CMC generals was typically perfunctory. Without Zhang to advise Xi, his main concern was that the PLA was more likely to believe a self-constructed narrative that they were ready for a "Taiwan adventure."

"I think what you lose with Zhang Youxia gone is a voice of reason," Stilwell said.

U.S. interactions with senior CMC generals have been an infrequent feature of bilateral diplomacy over the past two decades.

Biden administration national security advisor Jake Sullivan was the last known senior U.S. official to meet Zhang when the two held talks in August 2024 in Beijing.

Eric Hundman, a Chinese military expert at Washington-based security consultancy BluePath Labs, said military-to-military exchanges under Xi, even at the CMC level, tended to be scripted.

"The PLA knows its capabilities fairly well and is not interested in moving on Taiwan before they think they're ready. My question mark has always been how much Xi Jinping listens to them on that point," Hundman said.

"To the degree that he's getting worse advice, that would worry me," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:30:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E5SXHVYSAZK5HBSIUT4UETO55Y.jpg?auth=49e9f03fcb0a818bf53e5ac0587f24992b2e6b7290d5ec3e2ac040a00862f117&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In U-turn, France backs move to put Iran's Guards on EU terrorism list</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/u-turn-france-backs-move-put-irans-guards-eu-terrorism-list-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France will now support the inclusion of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the European list of terrorist organisations, a move that Paris has always been hesitant to back for fear that it could cut ties with Iran.

European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were already due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests that has seen thousands killed and thousands more arrested.

But even until earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU's terrorist organisation list following the United States.

"The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain," Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X, adding that France would now back the listing.

The French presidency had earlier announced the decision.

Set up after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.

With France, Italy and Germany now in favour, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday.

While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU's terrorist list, others, led by France have been more cautious.

They have feared that it could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, but also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons.

Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year.

Anti-government protests that swept across Iran since December have triggered the bloodiest crackdown by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, drawing international condemnation.

Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal given the IRGC's role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said was tantamount to terrorist activity.

"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it’s probably a duck and it’s good to call that out," said one senior EU diplomat.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:30:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2JQPB2T3MRKJ5HDX62DU5ME5UQ.jpg?auth=411f96352a3bcc0d77a34294b8d38c343c9139497aedaed9489cf9439cbf4f1b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs push to put Iran's Revolutionary Guards on EU terrorism list</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-france-backs-push-eu-list-iran-revolutionary-guards-terrorist-group</link><description>France is to back a move led by Italy for the European Union to list the Iran 's Revolutionary Guards as a "terrorist organisation", the French presidency said Wednesday, after the force was accused of taking a leading role in a deadly crackdown on protests .

France "supports the inclusion of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the European list of terrorist organisations," the Élysee Palace said.

"The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered," Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot added in a post on X, confirming that France would back the listing.

"The extraordinary courage (the Iranian people) have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain," Barrot said.

France had previously been hesitant to back such a move for fear it could cut all ties with Tehran.

The IRGC is seen as Iran's ideological army with the mandate to ensure the survival of the 1979 Islamic revolution. It is already listed as a terror group by Australia, Canada and the United States but not yet by the EU or UK.

A terrorist group designation by the EU would subject IRGC members to travel bans, asset freezes and "a prohibition on making funds or economic resources available to those listed", according to rules established by the European Council.

Iran's latest protests started on December 28 over a rise in the cost of living and rapidly spread nationwide . They were met with a violent response , the full extent of which only began to surface after more than two weeks of an unprecedented nationwide internet blackout.

According to a tally published Wednesday by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 6,221 people were killed , including 5,858 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 100 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:32:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/767ea0f2-7980-11ef-b008-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24265261045326.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador raids leftist politicians' homes over alleged Venezuela campaign funds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-raids-leftist-politicians-homes-over-alleged-venezuela-campaign-funds-2026-01-28/</link><description>QUITO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ecuador's prosecutor's office raided homes of politicians from former President Rafael Correa's leftist party on Wednesday, investigating alleged illicit money from Venezuela used to finance the 2023 presidential campaign.

The raids targeted presidential candidate Luisa Gonzalez and other members of the Citizens' Revolution party as part of a probe into alleged organized crime and money laundering, the prosecutor's office said.

• Prosecutors allege cash from Venezuela was used to finance the campaign, without providing further details.

• President Daniel Noboa recently said money linked to ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro entered Ecuador through local party campaign financing. The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

• Maduro was captured in Venezuela this month in a U.S. military raid and faces federal drug trafficking charges.

• "Citizens' Revolution and Luisa Gonzalez have not received a single cent from Venezuela, from any cartel, or from anyone," Gonzalez told reporters, calling it political persecution.

• Gonzalez said her party submitted campaign expenses to electoral authorities and accused the prosecutor's office of lacking evidence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:55:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US agents involved in fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis placed on leave</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260128-us-agents-involved-in-fatal-shooting-of-alex-pretti-in-minneapolis-placed-on-leave</link><description>Two immigration agents involved in the fatal shooting of a protester in Minneapolis have been placed on leave, a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said Wednesday, as President Donald Trump battles backlash over the incident.

"The two officers involved are on administrative leave. This is standard protocol," the spokesperson told AFP in a statement.

Intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti was shot multiple times on Saturday after being forced to the ground by camouflaged officers in a scuffle captured on video.

His death, which followed the deadly shooting of another female protester by an immigration officer earlier in January, sparked nationwide and bipartisan outrage.

Trump has called for an "honorable and honest investigation" into Pretti's death and suggested he would "de-escalate a little bit" the administration's immigration crackdown in the city in the northern state of Minnesota.

Stephen Miller – a powerful figure who leads Trump's hardline immigration policy – told AFP Tuesday that the agents may have breached "protocol" before the shooting.

The White House later said Miller was referring to "general guidance" to immigration agents operating in Minnesota, not the specific incident involving Pretti.

Foreign nationals with clean criminal records who arrived before the end of 2025, and who can prove they’ve lived in Spain for at least five months, will soon be eligible for renewable one-year residence permits. People who applied for asylum in the country before December 31 will also be able to apply. Migration Minister Elma Saiz said Tuesday that she expects applications to open April through June.

This extraordinary mass regularisation – the first in Spain in more than 20 years – was born from a citizen-backed proposal signed by some 700,000 people and supported by hundreds of civil society groups, including the Catholic Church .

While most immigrants in Spain have legal status, the country’s booming economy has also drawn hundreds of thousands of largely working-age people from across the world to work in the country’s underground economy. Undocumented migrants work on construction sites, on farms, in shops and restaurants or in people's homes, cooking and cleaning and caring for children.

The bulk of these workers come from the country’s former colonial holdings across Latin America and North Africa such as Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador and nearby Morocco .

And while footage of migrants scrambling over the barbed-wire fences surrounding Spain’s North African exclaves or lurching towards the Canary Islands in flimsy dinghies weigh heavily on the public imagination, the reality is usually less dramatic.

Most undocumented migrants are people who entered Spain legally , going on to overstay their visas and find cash-in-hand work in what has become known as the country’s “black economy”.

The decision sits in stark contrast to a hardening approach to irregular immigration that has flourished across Europe and the US in recent years as the far right gains ground.

Despite declining numbers of irregular arrivals, European Union states in December last year backed harsher migration measures that would allow rejected asylum seekers to be deported to offshore “return hubs” or countries with which they have no connection.

In France, last year’s figures show rising numbers of deportations paired with fewer cases of undocumented migrants being granted legal pathways to work.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has maintained that – far from being a drain on the country’s social services as critics claim – migrants play a crucial role in keeping the country’s welfare state standing. Bringing half a million workers into the formal economy, he argues, will only strengthen the country’s social security system.

Migration Policy Institute Europe deputy director Jasmijn Slootjes said that Spain’s decision was partly in response to fears that the ageing native-born population won’t be capable of sustaining the kind of workforce the country needs to thrive.

“If you look at the demographic decline, the fertility rate in Spain is the lowest in Europe – so it's really, really low,” she said.

“There were a lot of skill shortages, labour shortages, and de facto a lot of irregular migrants are working, although in informal work. And through regularising you can, of course, get more tax payments, and you also get better matching [to] their skills – because people can actually work at their skill level. So it’s a very pragmatic approach.”

She said that the Sanchez government – which announced this decision as part of a deal struck with its erstwhile coalition partners, the leftist PODEMOS party – was championing migration as a fundamental driver of the country’s flourishing economy.

Official data released on Tuesday indicated that 52,500 of the 76,200 people who raised employment numbers in the final quarter of 2025 were born overseas, with that same quarter marking Spain's lowest unemployment rate in 18 years.

“That’s really something that's being mentioned time and again – this link to the economy, maintaining social welfare access and a healthy, competitive country. That is really a core argument in all of this, and the evidence is indeed pointing that way,” Slootjes said.

“I think one quote of [Sanchez's] is very clear in clarifying their approach – he says, ‘Spain needs to choose between being an open and prosperous country, or a closed-off and poor country’,” she said.

Since the last mass regularisation in 2005 – the sixth such amnesty since the fall of the Franco dictatorship – Spain has pursued a less dramatic approach to undocumented migrants, offering them a step-by-step pathway over several years towards gaining a legal right to live, work and eventually become a Spanish citizen.

Despite a turbulent 20 years of boom and bust as Spain weathered the 2008 global financial crisis and then the Covid-19 pandemic, the country has largely avoided the rising anti-immigration sentiment that has pushed far-right parties into prominence – and sometimes power – across Europe and beyond.

That changed in 2018 with the arrival of Vox on the political scene. Born out of a broader backlash to Catalan separatism, the far-right party won the third-most seats in parliament in 2019 on an increasingly anti-immigration platform.

Unsurprisingly, Vox party leader Santiago Abascal was incensed by the announcement.

“The tyrant Sanchez hates the Spanish people. He wants to replace them ,” he posted on social media, adding that Sanchez wants to " accelerate the invasion ”, echoing oft-repeated right-wing narratives.

Abascal instead called for “remigration” – another far-right rallying cry that champions the mass deportation of people born overseas, sometimes including naturalised citizens .

Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the conservative People’s Party – which oversaw several of the amnesties in previous decades – has also criticised the decision, as the party struggles to head off rising support for the anti-immigration Vox.

Slootjes said that while Spain was not immune from the rising tide of nativist sentiment, levels of anti-immigration feeling had not reached the same heights as in other parts of Europe.

“Spain is also witnessing similar trends that we’ve been seeing in other countries in Europe and also across the Atlantic, of course, which is this increasing restrictive narrative around migration and a rise of support for the far right,” she said.

“This is really a moment where Vox is very vocal and really pushing this issue. So for those who are anti-migrant and agree with them, of course this can bolster their support."

Spanish think-tank Funcas in May last year found that local support for immigration was among the highest in Europe , with just 28 percent of respondents favouring restricted immigration in 2024. Those attitudes appeared to endure even as the country reeled from mass unemployment in the wake of the 2008 crash.

"Even during years when unemployment exceeded 25 percent, support for immigration remained largely stable," the report said.

And with more and more countries across Europe facing similar demands for workers, giving those people already practicing their livelihoods without legal protections a pathway out of precarity could well be a way forward, she noted.

“It's food for thought for policymakers across Europe and across the world, especially as this competition for talent and skill shortages, and ageing and demographic decline are plaguing our economies and societies, and it will all ramp up,” she said. “So it's going to be interesting to see how this may become more of a tool in the future, maybe if the tides are shifting and Spain is really testing it out and really creating this evidence to build future policies on how to do it – and how to do it well.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:57:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0610f774-fc66-11f0-a4e9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25295334634240.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian police fire tear gas, protester injured in Lagos floating slum protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-police-fire-tear-gas-protester-injured-lagos-floating-slum-protests-2026-01-28/</link><description>LAGOS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Nigerian police fired tear gas to disperse residents protesting in Lagos on Wednesday over demolition work in one of Africa's largest floating slums that has displaced thousands of people, with one protester reportedly injured.

Lagos state officials, with the help of armed police and excavators, have been demolishing homes in the Makoko slum on the edge of the commercial capital, arguing that residents illegally built their houses - mostly wooden shacks built on stilts above the water - near high-voltage power lines.

On Wednesday, more than 1,000 angry residents and affected families marched to the Lagos State House of Assembly to express their outrage over the demolitions.

The demonstrators refused a police order to disperse and instead demanded to be addressed by the Lagos state governor, whose office is nearby.

Police fired tear gas to disperse the gathering. One person sustained a leg injury and was taken to hospital.

"We were tear-gassed at Alausa. Look at this person, he left his house and now he has become disabled," protester Yawo Gburo said, referring to the injured demonstrator.

Lagos police did not immediately comment.

Makoko, which is home to thousands of mostly poor Nigerians, began life as a fishing village more than 100 years ago. There is no official data on its population, with estimates ranging between 80,000 and 200,000 residents, according to nonprofit groups.

The megacity of Lagos, with an estimated population of more than 20 million, has suffered from a serious shortage of housing, leading to the development of many informal and illegal settlements.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 20:38:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EXQ5CELYPZMVVM7PMXXUMDGOLY.jpg?auth=72d71605256bf511a264b696526644657f23099d41dd259ecc213be709189dda&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Greenland and Denmark start diplomatic talks to ease Trump tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-greenland-denmark-start-diplomatic-talks-ease-trump-tensions-2026-01-28/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Talks between the United States, Greenland and Denmark began on Wednesday, the Danish foreign ministry said, as the three parties seek to resolve a diplomatic crisis over President Donald Trump's threats against the Arctic territory.

The diplomatic talks come after months of tensions between Denmark and the United States, both founding NATO members.

Denmark's foreign ministry said in a written comment to Reuters that senior officials from Denmark, Greenland and the United States had met to "discuss how we can address American concerns about security in the Arctic while respecting the Kingdom's red lines."

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier on Wednesday said that the United States now has in place a process regarding Greenland and that there will be technical level meetings with officials from Greenland and Denmark on the issue.

"Flight NSE 8849, covering the Cucuta-Ocana route, which took off at around 11:42 a.m. and was scheduled to land at around 12:05 p.m., reported its last contact with air traffic control at 11:54 a.m. today," Satena said in a statement.

Newspaper El Tiempo reported that lawmaker Diogenes Quintero and Carlos Salcedo, a candidate to Congress ahead of elections in March, were aboard the aircraft.

Representatives for Quintero said in a statement that they had not had contact with the politician or his assistant, Natalia Acosta Salcedo, since the plane took off.

"We are praying for our friends right now," the statement said.

Colombia's Transportation Minister Mafe Rojas said protocols were put into place aimed at tracking down the plane.

The plane lost contact in a mountainous area planted with coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine, and where illegal armed groups such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) and a dissident faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) operate.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:30:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio details Trump administration's plan to control sale of Venezuelan oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260128-rubio-details-trump-administration-plan-to-control-sale-of-venezuelan-oil</link><description>The Trump administration soon will allow Venezuela to sell oil now subject to US sanctions, with the revenue initially dedicated to basic government services such as policing and health care and subject to Washington's oversight, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday.

The United States will retain control in the short term to ensure the oil revenue is used to stabilize Venezuela , Rubio said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. He noted that the interim leaders of the South American country will submit “a budget” every month of what they need funded.

“The funds from that (oil sales) will be deposited into an account that we will have oversight over,” Rubio said, adding that the US Treasury would control the process. Venezuela, he said, “will spend that money for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.”

Rubio offered new insight into how the US is planning to handle the sale of tens of millions of barrels of oil from Venezuela, which has the largest proven reserves of crude in the world, and oversee where the money flows. After the US raid that captured then-President Nicolas Maduro this month, the US is working to influence the next steps in the South American country through its vast oil resources.

The US will not subsidize oil industry investments in Venezuela, Rubio said, and is only overseeing the sale of sanctioned petroleum as an “interim step.”

“This is simply a way to divide revenue so that there isn’t systemic collapse while we work through this recovery and transition,” Rubio said.

Democrats and some Republicans on the committee pressed Rubio for more details about Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked for assurances from Rubio that the sale of Venezuelan oil will be fair and open, not rigged to benefit oil companies allied with Trump.

“You are taking their oil at gunpoint, you are holding and selling that oil … you’re deciding how and for what purposes that money is going to be used in a country of 30 million people,” Murphy said. “I think a lot of us believe that that is destined for failure.”

Under Maduro, Rubio said Venezuela's oil industry benefited the country's corrupt leaders and countries such as China, which purchased Venezuelan oil at a discount. Now, Venezuela's interim leaders are assisting the US in seizing illegal oil shipments, he said.

The US will give Venezuela's current leaders instructions on how the money can and cannot be spent and conduct audits to ensure it is used as intended, Rubio said. He said Venezuela could use the money to pay for policing or to buy medicine.

The fund was initially set up in Qatar to avoid having the proceeds seized by American creditors and because of other legal complications that stem from the US not considering Maduro’s government legitimate, Rubio said.

Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been set aside and as much as $3 billion more is anticipated, he said.

“It’s an account that belongs to Venezuela, but it has US sanctions as a blocking mechanism,” Rubio said. “We only control the dispersal of the money, we don’t control the actual money.”

Earlier this month, acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez said cash from oil sales would flow into two sovereign wealth funds: one to support crisis-stricken health services and a second to bolster public infrastructure, including the electric grid.

The country’s hospitals are so poorly equipped that patients are asked to provide supplies needed for their care, from syringes to surgical screws. They also must pay for lab and imaging tests at private hospitals.

On Tuesday, during a televised event to announce the revamping of various health care facilities, Rodriguez said her government and the US administration “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication” since Maduro was captured.

Neither Rodriguez nor her government’s press office immediately comment on Rubio’s remarks Wednesday.

At Rodriguez’s request, Venezuelan lawmakers last week began debating an overhaul of the country’s energy law. The proposed changes are meant to create conditions to attract much-needed private foreign investment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:56:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/223dac42-fc90-11f0-9d77-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028576651081.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US handing over seized tanker to Venezuela, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-handing-over-seized-tanker-venezuela-officials-say-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The United States is handing over a tanker to Venezuela that it seized this month, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday, the first known instance in which President Donald Trump's administration has returned such a tanker.

The United States has been carrying out a months-long effort to seize oil tankers linked to Venezuela - carrying out seven apprehensions since late last year.

The officials, who were speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the tanker that is being handed to Venezuelan authorities was the Panama-flagged supertanker M/T Sophia. They did not say why the tanker was returned.

The U.S. Coast Guard, which leads interdiction and seizure operations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Sophia was interdicted on January 7 by the Coast Guard and U.S. military forces. At the time, the administration said the Sophia, which is under sanctions, was a "stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker."

Trump has focused his foreign policy in Latin America on Venezuela, initially aiming to push Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power. After failing to find a diplomatic solution, Trump ordered U.S. forces to fly into the country to grab him and his wife in a daring overnight raid on January 3.

Since then, Trump has said the U.S. plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry in a $100 billion plan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 22:56:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNFG5IQXXRJ2HE2BCXK6NWYA54.jpg?auth=3efbdd55dc7e06047a8e334ee4b3a3f652b32a42fd944d8d360811fe53a78265&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE role at Winter Olympics in Italy to be advisory only, US ambassador says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260128-ice-winter-olympics-italy-advisory-us-ambassador</link><description>A branch of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sent to Italy for the Winter Olympics will not carry out patrols and will have only an "advisory" role, Washington's ambassador to Rome said on Wednesday.

News of its deployment for the February 6-22 Games in Milan-Cortina has sparked anger in Italy, after the agency's involvement in an often brutal crackdown on immigration in the United States.

But US ambassador to Italy Tilman J. Fertitta said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit will be "strictly advisory and intelligence-based, with no patrolling or enforcement involvement".

"At the Olympics, HSI criminal investigators will contribute their expertise by providing intelligence on transnational criminal threats, with a focus on cybercrimes and national security threats.

"All security operations will remain the responsibility of Italian authorities, " he said after meeting Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi.

ICE operations in a number of US cities have triggered large-scale protests, and the recent killings of two demonstrators have caused outrage.

Agents accused of violence there are from a different division than that earmarked for the Olympics.

Fertitta said the HSI focuses on "cross-border criminal activity, ranging from investigating human smuggling, narcotics trafficking, child exploitation, financial crimes, intellectual property right theft, to recovering stolen art and antiquities".

The Italian authorities initially denied speculation that ICE would be present at the Games, then played down their role, suggesting that they would only be helping with security for the US delegation.

US Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected at the opening ceremony at Milan's San Siro stadium on February 6.

Italy's political opposition has asked the government to refuse the deployment, and protests are expected in the coming days in Rome and Milan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 22:57:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ad4268f2-fba3-11f0-8975-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-26T142529Z-798936652-UP1EM1Q0VXAL9-RTRMADP-3-OLYMPICS-2026-PREVIEW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US says Brooklyn man sentenced to 15 years in Iran-backed plot to kill dissident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-says-brooklyn-man-sentenced-15-years-iran-backed-plot-kill-dissident-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A Brooklyn man was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Wednesday for taking part in what prosecutors called a failed Iran-backed murder-for-hire plot against Masih Alinejad , a prominent Iranian dissident living in the U.S., the Justice Department said.

Carlisle Rivera, also known as "Pop," previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and one count of conspiracy to commit stalking before U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman for the Southern District of New York, who imposed Wednesday's sentence, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Alinejad, who fled Iran in 2009, is a longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws and a journalist. She has promoted videos of women violating those laws to her millions of social media followers. She was living in Brooklyn at the time of the alleged plot on her life.

The case was part of a crackdown by the Justice Department on what it calls transnational repression: the targeting by authoritarian governments of political opponents on foreign soil.

Prosecutors said Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps and its intelligence officials have repeatedly tried to target Alinejad.

Iran has dismissed as baseless allegations that its intelligence officers sought to kidnap or kill her.

Other people have also been convicted in the U.S. and sentenced in relation to the alleged plot.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 23:28:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A7WECWVOX5ODHMTVFT3EH2BC3Y.jpg?auth=43df1a9f8e337e808e6e8232868f6c5ff7ff3dbb9178c7a1d6984df28b4f2165&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi's party seen gaining lower house majority in election, Nikkei poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichis-party-seen-gaining-lower-house-majority-election-nikkei-poll-2026-01-28/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party is likely to increase seats and gain a majority in the lower house in a general election on February 8, a preliminary survey by the Nikkei newspaper showed on Thursday.

Takaichi called the snap general election to seek a mandate to gear up her expansionary fiscal policy, a move that triggered a spike in bond yields on market concerns Japan may be forced to issue additional debt.

While still early in the race, the LDP is gaining momentum and likely to see its seats exceed the 233 majority of 465 up for grabs in the lower house, up from 198 seats it holds before the election, the Nikkei said.

The LDP currently forms a ruling coalition with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, which together narrowly hold a majority in the powerful lower house. It is a minority in the upper house.

The survey combined the paper's reporting and findings of a poll conducted jointly with the Yomiuri newspaper on January 27-28, the Nikkei said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 23:28:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D7F3RDTWPRPOJOGKHFJFWOTWFU.jpg?auth=8f03e0cd57e0235d448122638e7c8e9d0da567802f6b0cb407ff4ae42926f881&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French lawmakers approve bill to end ‘marital duty’ after consent concerns</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260128-french-lawmakers-bill-end-marital-duty</link><description>French lawmakers on Wednesday unanimously approved a bill seeking to end "marital duty", after criticism from women's rights groups about its use to ignore sexual consent in marriage and marital rape.

The text -- backed by more than 120 MPs in the lower house National Assembly -- clarifies in the civil code that cohabitation does not create any obligation for spouses to have sexual relations.

The cross-party bill will now have to go through the Senate upper chamber.

The French civil code lists four duties attached to marriage -- fidelity, support, assistance and cohabitation -- but it does not mention sexual obligation.

However, older court rulings sometimes interpreted cohabitation as implying a "shared bed", allowing the idea of a "marital duty" to persist in practice.

In 2019, a man obtained a divorce in France on the grounds that his wife had stopped having sex with him.

Last year, Europe's top rights court ruled in favour of his ex-wife, saying a woman who refuses to have sex with her husband should not be considered "at fault" by courts in the event of divorce.

France last year adopted the principle of consent into the definition of the crime of rape, following other European countries like the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 23:30:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/efd20604-f61d-11f0-ba0a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T161325Z-1705529737-RC245JA65JXM-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: Trump weighs Iran strikes to inspire renewed protests, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-weighs-iran-strikes-inspire-renewed-protests-sources-say-2026-01-29/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.

Two U.S. sources familiar with the discussions said Trump wanted to create conditions for "regime change" after a crackdown crushed a nationwide protest movement earlier this month, killing thousands of people .

To do so, he was looking at options to hit commanders and institutions Washington holds responsible for the violence, to give protesters the confidence that they could overrun government and security buildings, they said.

One of the U.S. sources said the options being discussed by Trump's aides also included a much larger strike intended to have lasting impact, possibly against the ballistic missiles that can reach U.S. allies in the Middle East or its nuclear enrichment programmes.

The other U.S. source said Trump has not yet made a final decision on a course of action including whether to take the military path.

The arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East this week has expanded Trump's capabilities to potentially take military action, after he repeatedly threatened intervention over Iran's crackdown.

Four Arab officials, three Western diplomats and a senior Western source whose governments were briefed on the discussions said they were concerned that instead of bringing people onto the streets, such strikes could weaken a movement already in shock after the bloodiest repression by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, said that without large-scale military defections Iran's protests remained “heroic but outgunned.”

The sources in this story requested anonymity to talk about sensitive matters. Iran's foreign office, the U.S. Department of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Israeli Prime Minister's office declined to comment.

Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons, warning that any future U.S. attack would be more severe than a June bombing campaign against three nuclear sites. He described the ships in the region as an "armada" sailing to Iran.

A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was "preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels." However, Washington was not showing openness to diplomacy, the official said.

Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue "based on mutual respect and interests" but would defend itself "like never before" if pushed, Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday.

Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration's previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran's network of armed proxies in the Middle East.

A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington's goal.

“If you're going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would "have a new leader that will replace him."

Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said.

The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests.

Multiple U.S. intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion, that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said.

The Western source said they believed Trump's goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than "topple the regime," an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where U.S. intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government.

Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.”

U.S.-based rights group HRANA has put the unrest-related death toll at 5,937, including 214 security personnel, while official figures put the death toll at 3,117. Reuters has been unable to independently verify the numbers.

At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said.

Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran's security network and big parts of the economy.

However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy - meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei.

In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said.

But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions.

Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said.

Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse - not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran's borders.

A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint.

The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources.

Gulf states - long‑time U.S. allies and hosts to major American bases- fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran.

“The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.”

Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said the U.S. deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium.

The most likely outcome is a "grinding erosion - elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession - that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 02:02:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WASHNY53ERPTHDEC2S3V2XHLNA.jpg?auth=a5d588496ea8d938b9a9bdbf0f1c786c0f42fcccfdbc7072e5daac2b32e28e62&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Starmer to meet China's Xi in bid to reset strained ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-starmer-meet-chinas-xi-bid-reset-strained-ties-2026-01-29/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday for talks he hopes will deepen their economic relationship, signalling a breakthrough in ties after years of distrust and acrimony.

On the most important day of his four-day visit to China, Starmer is due to have a 40-minute meeting with Xi at the Great Hall of the People before they have lunch together. Starmer will also hold meetings on Thursday with Premier Li Qiang and China's top legislator, Zhao Leji.

Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, has made improving relations with China one of his priorities in the hope it can yield business opportunities.

The visit to China, the first by a British prime minister since 2018, comes amid tension between Britain and its longstanding close ally the United States over President Donald Trump's recent remarks, including threats to take control of Greenland.

Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King's College London, said he expected that a number of deals between Britain and China would be announced to show how their relationship has improved.

"This must look like it’s been a success,” he said. “For both sides, they don’t want a meeting which is going to be arguing about things they disagree on."

European and other Western countries have engaged in a flurry of diplomacy with China as they hedge against unpredictability from the United States under Trump.

Starmer's visit immediately follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who signed an economic deal with Beijing to tear down trade barriers, drawing Trump's ire .

Starmer has adopted a new policy of engagement with China after relations deteriorated for years under previous Conservative governments when London restricted some Chinese investment over national security worries and expressed concern over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong.

Speaking to a delegation of business leaders hours after arriving in the country on Wednesday, Starmer said it was time for a “mature” relationship between Britain and the world’s second-biggest economy.

In a sign of how the countries can work together, Downing Street said Starmer and Xi would announce that Britain and China would work together to tackle the gangs involved in trafficking illegal migrants.

The deal will be focused on reducing the use of Chinese-made engines for small boats being used to transport people across Europe to claim asylum.

British and Chinese officials will share intelligence to identify smugglers’ supply routes and work with Chinese manufacturers to prevent legitimate businesses from being exploited by organised crime, Downing Street.

Starmer told reporters on the plane to China that he will “raise the issues that need to be raised” on human rights with Xi when asked if he will bring up the case of Jimmy Lai, the former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen who was convicted in December of national security crimes.

But the presence of more than 50 business leaders accompanying Starmer and his itinerary shows the priority for this trip is economic ties.

A video shared on social media platform X appeared to show the city's night skyline illuminated by gunfire, though Reuters has not independently verified the footage.

A spokesperson for Niger's military government, which seized power in a July 2023 coup, was not immediately available for comment.

The US has held significant sway over Iraqi politics since leading the 2003 invasion that ousted long-time ruler Saddam Hussein.

"We categorically reject the blatant American interference in Iraq's internal affairs," said Maliki, the only former Iraqi prime minister to have served two terms since the invasion.

"We consider it a violation" of Iraq's "democratic system", in place since 2003, he added on X.

In response to Trump's threat, several hundred people protested in the evening near the US embassy in Baghdad, chanting "Yes for Maliki", while some burned a poster bearing the image of Trump and an American flag, an AFP journalist said.

Maliki fell out with Washington during his premiership (2006-2014) over growing ties with Iran and accusations that he pushed a sectarian agenda.

But the 75-year-old shrewd politician has remained a central figure in Iraq's politics and a powerbroker whose approval is considered indispensable to any governing coalition.

On Tuesday, Trump said that Iraq would make a "very bad choice" if Maliki were selected for the top post.

He warned that because of Maliki's "insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq".

Maliki was endorsed as Iraq's next prime minister by the Coordination Framework, an alliance of Shiite groups with varying links to Iran that has emerged in recent years as the main ruling coalition.

Since the invasion, Iraq has long been a proxy battleground between the US and Iran, with successive governments negotiating a delicate balance between the two foes.

But Iraq's new prime minister is set to return to power at a time of seismic changes in the Middle East, as Tehran's regional influence wanes and as Washington threatens possible military intervention in Iran.

In his post on Wednesday, Maliki said the US involvement "infringes upon the Coordination Framework's decision to nominate" its candidate.

He added that, in line with that decision, he "will continue to work until the end, in a way that achieves the higher interests of the Iraqi people".

Several Iraqi political sources told AFP that the coalition is set to meet soon to discuss Trump's ultimatum.

It is "a complicated situation", said a source close to the Framework, adding that there had been internal divisions within the coalition over supporting Maliki, but that a majority vote ultimately settled the issue.

Maliki's backers are now pushing to maintain his candidacy and "not back down", he added.

Trump's statement came days after Secretary of State Marco Rubio voiced similar concerns in a telephone call with outgoing Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.

Sudani's parliamentary bloc said on Wednesday that choosing a prime minister is an "Iraqi affair", while stressing the need "for positive, balanced relations with friendly and allied countries, especially the United States, based on mutual respect".

The US had also sent a letter to Iraqi politicians saying that Washington views Maliki negatively, political sources told AFP.

Iraq's new premier will be expected to address Washington's longstanding demand that Baghdad disarm Tehran-backed factions, many of which are designated terrorist groups by the United States.

Two US-sanctioned armed groups that are part of the Coordination Framework on Wednesday slammed Trump's meddling in Iraq's affairs.

"We reject all attempts to interfere in our country's internal affairs or influence the peaceful transfer of power, and we refuse any external dictates," said the Asaib Ahl al-Haq faction, while Kataeb Sayyid al-Shuhada also expressed its rejection of Trump's remarks.

Last month, Iraqi officials and diplomats told AFP that Washington demanded that the incoming government exclude Iran-backed armed groups.

Before Trump's call, an Iraqi political source said that the Coordination Framework was set on moving forward with the nomination, believing that Maliki could eventually allay Washington's concerns.

Maliki "thinks differently today", an Iraqi politician told AFP.

After decades of conflicts and chaos, Iraq has recently regained a sense of stability.

But it is struggling with weak economic growth and cannot risk punitive measures by the US, which has already sanctioned several Iraqi entities, accusing them of helping Tehran evade sanctions.

Political scientist Renad Mansour warned that the US might use its leverage over Iraq.

"Sanctions, access to US dollars... and of course, the military threat is there," he said, referring to strikes against pro-Iran groups.

"Iraq is now in a very precarious moment... and there's a lot of concerns over the relatively newfound stability."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 02:03:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8fca78d2-fc75-11f0-891d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/f9998926394aac9470c641bc334f7e41af948d4c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: ICE officers in Minnesota directed not to interact with 'agitators' in new orders</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ice-officers-minnesota-directed-not-interact-with-agitators-new-orders-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - ICE officers in Minnesota were directed on Wednesday to avoid engaging with "agitators" as they carry out President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, according to internal guidance reviewed by Reuters.

The new guidance, offering the most detailed look so far at how operations would change after two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens protesting in Minneapolis, also orders U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers only to target immigrants who have criminal charges or convictions.

That would mark a departure from the broad sweeps that have provoked backlash and legal challenges in Minneapolis and other U.S. cities.

"DO NOT COMMUNICATE OR ENGAGE WITH AGITATORS," said an email disseminated by a top ICE official. "It serves no purpose other than inflaming the situation. No one is going to convince the other. The only communication should be the officers issuing commands."

In response to a request to the White House for comment, an administration official said, "There are ongoing conversations on how to most effectively conduct operations in Minnesota. No guidance should be considered final until it is officially issued."

The operational shift comes after Trump said this week that he aimed to “de-escalate” tension in Minneapolis and St. Paul after federal immigration officers killed two U.S. citizens there this month. In both cases, Trump officials swiftly portrayed the deceased as aggressors, an assertion undercut by video evidence .

Trump tasked border czar Tom Homan to take over operations in Minnesota, in what a senior official told Reuters would be a shift to a more “targeted” approach to enforcement. Border Patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino - who led confrontational sweeps in Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities - was demoted and will soon retire, Reuters reported.

Under the new guidance outlined in the email, ICE officers will receive megaphones so that they can issue commands to the public and "need to verbalize every step of the arrest process."

The guidance does not describe what sort of actions would trigger commands or what officers should do if commands were not followed.

The updated guidance came from Marcos Charles, the top official in ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division, the email said. It said officers could only target immigration offenders who had a previous criminal history.

"We are moving to targeted enforcement of aliens with a criminal history," it read. "This includes arrests, not just convictions. ALL TARGETS MUST HAVE A CRIMINAL NEXUS."

Under former President Joe Biden, ICE officers were required to focus on serious criminals, but the Trump administration rescinded that policy, allowing officers to arrest non-criminals without restrictions.

ICE officers can run license plate checks for possible targets and should make an arrest if the registered owner of the vehicle is an immigrant with a criminal history, the guidance said.

ICE will run the Minnesota operation with Border Patrol in a support role, it said, a reversal after months of Bovino-led clashes in city streets.

The guidance states that ICE has been getting more cooperation from state and local officials in Minnesota, and that the agency could have more opportunities to pick up immigrants released on parole or probation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 04:18:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RZ3UIPONTJJP7PSQ5WGU2PLJTQ.jpg?auth=861b205979304565a97e5663fb86652b74460767231cb53d5205845533af190c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea industry minister to visit Washington on Thursday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-industry-minister-visit-washington-thursday-2026-01-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 29 (Reuters) - South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan will visit Washington on Thursday to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of plans to raise tariffs on South Korean goods, the ministry said.

Kim is also scheduled to meet the U.S. Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, according to a ministry press release.

Trump in a social media post on Monday said he would hike tariffs from 15% to 25% because Seoul had not enacted legislation linked to last year's trade deal, prompting alarm in Seoul.

On Tuesday he signaled a softer tone, telling reporters, "we'll work something out with South Korea," without offering details.

Trump's trade negotiator Jamieson Greer said the U.S. lowered tariffs to 15% last year in exchange for South Korea's pledge to invest $350 billion in the U.S. and expand market access, but that Seoul had yet to pass the required bills.

South Korean lawmakers expressed hope the bills would be approved in February, when they are expected to hold a plenary parliamentary session. Officials also stressed they have reached out to the U.S. through multiple channels to prevent further escalation.

Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo is also expected to visit Washington for talks with Greer.

The foreign ministers' retreat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations aims to set the bloc's agenda for the year under the chairmanship of the Philippines.

Philippine Foreign Minister Ma. Theresa Lazaro told her ASEAN counterparts that the global security environment has become more "challenging" and "more complex and interconnected".

She vowed that Manila would continue to uphold the international rules-based order, and maintain ASEAN's adherence to the principles of restraint, dialogue and international law.

"Across our region, we continue to see tensions at sea, protracted internal conflicts and unresolved border and humanitarian concerns," Lazaro said in her opening remarks.

"Our meeting today allows us to collectively take stock of ASEAN's priorities and exchange views on regional and global developments that directly affect us," she added.

The Philippines recently hosted a dialogue among opponents of Myanmar's ruling junta in a bid to facilitate dialogue and humanitarian aid.

A 2021 coup in Myanmar triggered widespread protests that were brutally suppressed by the junta, unleashing a civil war involving a loose alliance of rebel groups.

Manila is also aiming this year to finish a long-delayed code of conduct for the South China Sea, where tensions have escalated over the past three years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 04:20:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OEUFQO4TERO5RNFQ7H2IQIWEJA.jpg?auth=274df6b1c4bf9d9da2e852dba91f5d0775687cdbfdb5dfe05ffeaae0ed57204d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protesters rally at Texas facility holding Minneapolis child in immigration clampdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260129-protesters-texas-minneapolis-child-immigration</link><description>Texas state police officers on Wednesday used tear gas to disperse a demonstration outside a US immigration detention facility where protesters demanded the release of a 5-year-old Ecuadoran boy among others swept up in the Trump administration's immigration clampdown.

About 100 protesters gathered at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley on Wednesday, carrying signs accusing the federal agents of terrorising communities.

"We want Kristi Noem impeached. We want the US Senate to defund ICE, to not give it any more money. And we need people to pay attention to the midterm elections this year," local elected official Christina Morales told AFP.

Texas state law enforcement responded to the protest in riot gear, deploying tear gas cannisters, including one that landed near two AFP journalists, striking and temporarily incapacitating one of them.

Earlier, Democratic congressmembers Joaquin Castro and Jasmine Crockett conducted an inspection to visit the child, Liam Conejo Ramos, and 1,100 others detained there.

"His dad said that he hasn't been himself, and he's been sleeping a lot because he's been depressed and sad," Castro said in a video message posted to X, in which the congressman insists Ramos and his family were "legally in the United States."

National outcry followed images of the apparently terrified preschooler, dressed in a fluffy blue bunny hat and wearing his school backpack, being held by immigration officers who were seeking to arrest the boy's father in Minneapolis.

The child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias -- both asylum seekers -- were taken from their driveway as they arrived home on January 20, after the child was used as "bait" by officers to draw out those inside his home, according to the superintendent of the boy's school, Zena Stenvik.

A federal judge temporarily blocked their deportation Tuesday.

Castro also demanded the release of everyone else being held at the privately-run facility, saying "there are no criminals in Dilley. Donald Trump said this was about arresting illegal criminal 'aliens' -- that's his language. There isn't a single criminal over there."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 04:20:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fc4f0e8c-fcc5-11f0-a6ce-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028775823569.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan braces for more heavy snowstorms as midwinter election nears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/japan-braces-more-heavy-snowstorms-midwinter-election-nears-2026-01-29/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Northern and western parts of Japan face more heavy snowstorms later this week, the weather agency said on Thursday, as lawmakers campaign in the first winter election in 36 years, with the risk of lower voter turnout due to the freezing weather.

Heavy snowfalls of up to 70 centimetres (27.56 inches) in the Hokuriku region of northwestern Japan and 60 centimetres (23.6 inches) in south-central Kinki, particularly along the Sea of Japan, is forecast through Friday, the Meteorological Agency said.

The agency urged caution due to potential traffic disruptions and the risk of avalanches.

Heavy snowfall last week brought northern Japan’s Hokkaido to a standstill, leaving thousands stranded at its main airport overnight after several dozen flights were grounded.

Japan is set to host the lower house election on February 8, and heavy snowfalls blanketing northern Japan could depress voter turnout and disrupt campaigning, particularly in rural areas, adding another layer of uncertainty to the snap election.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party is likely to increase its number of parliamentary seats and gain a majority in the lower house, a preliminary survey by the Nikkei newspaper showed on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:30:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YOMWJADS4JPNHGY3FIBEHA2AVQ.jpg?auth=679a72a5ca7583a8d08690628d8b41574c16ede20c1c9046adc674ae5439f961&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam hails upgrade of diplomatic ties with EU as 'historical milestone'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-hails-upgrade-diplomatic-ties-with-eu-historical-milestone-2026-01-29/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Vietnam and the European Union said on Thursday they elevated diplomatic relations, as both sides seek to expand international partnerships amid global disruptions.

The largely diplomatic move entails no binding commitments but carries political weight at a time when the EU and Vietnam are seeking to deepen international ties as they both face up to higher levies on their exports to the United States.

The upgrade is "a historical milestone underlining the great achievements that the two sides have made," Vietnam's President Luong Cuong said at the start of a meeting in Hanoi with European Council President Antonio Costa.

A free trade agreement between Vietnam and the 27-country EU entered into force in 2020.

Costa, who arrived in Hanoi after the EU struck a major trade deal with India on Tuesday, said the upgraded partnership "highlights the importance we attach to the region and to Vietnam's growing role".

"At a moment when the international rules-based order is under threat from multiple sides, we need to start to stand side by side as reliable and predictable partners," Costa added.

The elevation of ties to Vietnam's highest level, the same as the United States, China and Russia, usually involves more frequent high-level meetings.

It is also expected to generate a stronger partnership, according to a joint statement adopted on Thursday, which says the two sides will explore and deepen cooperation in multiple sectors, including defence, critical minerals, semiconductors, transport and "trusted communications infrastructure", confirming a Reuters report on Wednesday.

Costa acknowledged different views with Vietnam, a long-time Russian partner, over the war in Ukraine and human rights.

But he added that the two countries agree on their support of multilateralism and "the principles of independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:30:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DJGCOK5VEZIAZMFHAI4XRER4RM.jpg?auth=7e22d64453d8fd7d5d90c34444019c1b12a37ee955816b08bf9ce5c84d745bb6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China executes 11 criminals linked to Myanmar-based gangs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-executes-11-criminals-linked-myanmar-based-gangs-2026-01-29/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China executed 11 criminals from gangs based in northern Myanmar that included key members of telecom fraud groups, state news agency Xinhua said on Thursday.

The 11 were sentenced to death in September and the executions were carried out by a court in Wenzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, Xinhua said without giving more details about the criminals.

In recent years, China has stepped up collaboration with Southeast Asian neighbours Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia to crack down on rampant "scam centre" operations in the region.

As a result, tens of thousands of criminal suspects have been repatriated, transnational organised crime experts say.

Last year, China's Public Security Ministry said more than 7,600 Chinese nationals suspected of online gambling and telecom fraud were repatriated from Myawaddy, a town on the southeastern Myanmar border with Thailand.

State-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would "achieve the flight operation of suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism," as well as "build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure", state broadcaster CCTV reported.

China and the U.S. are competing as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a "world-leading space power" by 2045.

Beijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and it is also used for orbital space tourism.

Reusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.

However, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.

In late December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.

CASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.

The new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on the inauguration.

"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration," Xinhua wrote.

Thursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies such as small celestial resource exploration and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.

China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.

The U.S. faces intense competition this decade from China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. Apollo mission in 1972.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 06:08:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YKWHYCQTD5J5LMBIMMJ7FWVSMQ.jpg?auth=53e3d2ab73cf00dd50635d5ef03c8ae3c5ab5d3dd67b1118aa59f743dc527daf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: New malaria vaccines helped Ghana slash child deaths. Then Trump, others cut aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/new-malaria-vaccines-helped-ghana-slash-child-deaths-then-trump-others-cut-aid-2026-01-29/</link><description>LONDON/ACCRA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - New vaccines are helping Ghana approach a long-sought goal of ending child deaths from malaria, demonstrating the potential of the shots to drive back a disease that kills nearly half a million young children every year in Africa, according to the international vaccine aid group Gavi and the country’s health service.

But aid cutbacks by the Trump administration and other wealthy governments could mean fewer children benefit on the continent where malaria hits hardest, Gavi told Reuters.

Ghana is among the countries that had already made significant progress reducing malaria mortality by scaling up interventions such as the distribution of bed nets treated with insecticides and improving access to both preventive drugs and prompt treatment.

Two new vaccines - one developed by British drugmaker GSK (GSK.L) , the other by Oxford University and the Serum Institute of India - are helping close the remaining gap, said Dr Selorm Kutsoati, who heads Ghana’s immunisation programme.

“For me, the malaria vaccine is a gamechanger,” she told Reuters.

Gavi is currently the only organisation purchasing malaria shots for African nations. It anticipates it will be able to spend just over $800 million on the programme over the next five years - 28% less than the expected need - after falling $2.9 billion short of its overall funding goal for the period, according to internal estimates prepared for its board of directors in December, seen by Reuters.

An additional 19,000 lives could be lost as a result due to lower vaccination rates, the documents say. The estimate, which has not previously been reported, is based on modelling of the vaccines’ impact by researchers at Imperial College London and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.

“It is the gap between the promise and the need for the vaccine, and the resources we have to provide that,” Scott Gordon, who heads Gavi’s malaria program, told Reuters.

U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy announced in June that Washington would no longer support Gavi , part of sweeping cuts to foreign aid that President Donald Trump says do not align with his “America First” agenda. The United States was previously one of the group’s top donors, contributing some $1.3 billion between 2020 and 2024.

The U.S. "remains committed to working with global partners to combat malaria," a Department of Health and Human Services official told Reuters.

But the Trump administration will not disburse funds to Gavi unless it starts phasing out vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal from its portfolio, the official said. Anti-vaccine groups have linked thimerosal to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, despite multiple studies showing no related safety issues .

Gavi confirmed the request and said the group remained in contact with the U.S. government on the subject. Any decision related to its portfolio would be "guided by scientific consensus," it said.

Other donors have also been scaling back support. Britain, Gavi’s biggest donor, has pledged 1.25 billion pounds ($1.72 billion) over the next five years, more than 20% less than for 2020-25.

Britain's international development minister, Jenny Chapman, said the country remains committed to supporting Gavi's work because it saves lives.

A MOTHER DECIDES: ‘I HAVE TO GO FOR THE VACCINE’

Some major global organisations initially doubted the potential of the two vaccines now being rolled out in 24 African countries with help from Gavi.

Based on clinical trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates they reduce malaria cases by over 50% during the first year after three shots are administered, an efficacy rate lower than many commonly used childhood shots. A fourth dose is required before a child turns 2 to maintain protection.

Supporters of the vaccines point to the success in Ghana, saying even a partially effective shot has translated into many lives saved.

“In real-world settings, we're seeing significant impact," Gavi’s Gordon said.

Confirmed deaths among children under the age of 5 have dropped nearly 86% in Ghana, from 245 in 2018, the year before GSK’s vaccine was introduced in select districts, to 35 in 2024, according to government figures. A decade ago, nearly 1,000 children in that age group died each year, Kutsoati said.

Malaria infections have also declined, from roughly 6.7 million in 2018 to 5.3 million in 2024, around a fifth of which were among children under 5, Ghana’s figures show.

The actual numbers are likely to be higher, as many malaria cases do not get diagnosed, and deaths that occur at home often go unreported, said Dorothy Achu, the WHO’s team lead for malaria in Africa. There can also be inconsistent reporting by some health facilities.

But Achu agreed the combination of strategies used in Ghana resulted in a “significant reduction in malaria deaths”, adding the WHO is using the country’s figures to update its estimates.

Esther Kolan, a 31-year-old clothing trader, did not need much persuading to get her 1-year-old son Phenehas Gyngyi Jr. vaccinated last summer at the Mother and Child Hospital in the southern town of Kasoa.

Her brother died of malaria just before his 15th birthday. A daughter was hospitalised twice with the disease before she turned 3.

“I told myself, no matter the condition, I have to go for the vaccine,” Kolan said, adding her family also sleeps under bed nets.

Phenehas has had three doses and has never been hospitalised with malaria.

“This has really helped me a lot,” said Kolan, who plans to get him a booster shot soon. “I was not scared for my child.”

Malaria deaths were already declining in their district when vaccines became available in 2023, according to Stanley Yaidoo, the municipal health services director. But the number of cases still put pressure on hospitals, exhausting staff and taking up beds that could be used to treat other dangerous diseases, he told Reuters.

“The vaccine implementation was the master stroke that we needed to support the already existing interventions,” Yaidoo said.

Some regions managed to eliminate malaria without a vaccine, but countries in sub-Saharan Africa face particular challenges, disease experts say.

Many are among the world’s poorest, with poorly-resourced health systems. The prevailing strain is particularly deadly, and there is growing resistance to preventive and curative drugs. Control efforts have been disrupted by conflicts and natural disasters.

The first countries to use the vaccines - Kenya, Malawi and Ghana - were part of a WHO-led pilot programme that began in 2019 with GSK’s shot. The WHO approved this vaccine for wider use in 2021, but the rollout faced hurdles, including a vast supply shortfall .

Access improved when WHO recommended the Oxford shot in 2023.

In many countries, it is too early to assess the vaccines' impact. But there are anecdotal reports of reductions in cases, hospitalisations and deaths among young children, according to the Gavi documents and interviews with health officials in four countries.

Take-up of the vaccines has varied, the documents show. In the first six months of 2025, coverage rates across 11 countries for three doses ranged from over 70% in Ghana and Burkina Faso, to 45% in Liberia and 35% in conflict-hit South Sudan.

Introducing a new vaccine that requires multiple doses has presented logistical challenges, especially in rural areas where transportation and storage options are limited.

In Ghana, there was also resistance from a number of traditional and religious leaders, and politicians skeptical about the benefits, Yaidoo told Reuters.

But results talk, he said.

“Those who have had the vaccination, they give their testimonies on how their children are protected from severe malaria. So many of them are actually our ambassadors."

Cases of severe malaria among vaccinated children were 58% lower than among unvaccinated children in the year after they received the third dose across the countries that participated in the pilot, a study published in The Lancet medical journal in January found.

Health officials in Kenya and Malawi did not respond to Reuters’ questions about their vaccination programmes.

At least four more countries plan to introduce malaria vaccines before 2028, Gavi said.

Until this year, Gavi could subsidise 85% of the assessed need for shots in areas of medium and high malaria transmission, with governments contributing as little as $0.20 per dose.

It has now reduced its spending cap to 70% for areas that will be ordering shots for the first time, the documents show. It will also be asking all but the poorest governments to increase their contributions, which vary depending on the strength of their economies.

Details of how these changes will affect individual countries are being worked out, Gavi said.

Price cuts for the vaccines could help mitigate the aid cuts. GSK and its partner, India’s Bharat Biotech, said in June they would reduce the price of their shot to under $5 a dose by 2028, roughly half what it costs now. In November, Gavi and the U.N. children's agency announced a deal to pay 25% less for Serum’s vaccine, currently priced at around $4 per dose, within roughly a year.

GSK said the real-world data was encouraging, and it was working with Gavi on how to make the roll-out as effective as possible. It did not elaborate. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

At least three countries - Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Togo - have committed to covering some malaria vaccine needs themselves, Gordon said.

But Tanzania is struggling to plug funding gaps and will have to delay the start of its vaccination campaign, said Dr Samwel Lazaro, acting head of its malaria programme.

“Currently, the government is focused on ensuring the implementation of the most essential and life-saving services, such as the use of medicated bed nets,” Lazaro said.

Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam have also tightened screening at airports.

The Nipah virus can cause fever and brain inflammation and has a high mortality rate. There is also no vaccine. But transmission from person to person is not easy and typically requires prolonged contact with an infected individual.

"It has become imperative to strengthen preventative and surveillance measures at Pakistan's borders," the Border Health Services department said in a statement.

"All travelers shall undergo thermal screening and clinical assessment at the Point of Entry," which includes seaports, land borders and airports, the department added.

The agency said travellers would need to provide transit history for the preceding 21-day period to check whether they had been through "Nipah-affected or high-risk regions".

There are no direct flights between Pakistan and India and travel between the two countries is extremely limited, particularly since their worst fighting in decades in May last year.

In Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital's health department on Wednesday also ordered the screening of incoming passengers at Noi Bai airport, particularly those arriving from India and the eastern state of West Bengal, where the two health workers were confirmed to have the virus in late December.

Passengers will be checked with body temperature scanners to detect suspected cases. "This allows for timely isolation, epidemiological investigation," the department said in a statement.

That follows measures by authorities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest city, who said they had tightened health controls at international border crossings.

India's health ministry said this week that authorities have identified and traced 196 contacts linked to the two cases with none showing symptoms and all testing negative for the virus.

Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40% to 75%, depending on the local healthcare system's capacity for detection and management, according to the World Health Organization.

The virus was first identified just over 25 years ago during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore, although scientists believe it has circulated in flying foxes, or fruit bats, for thousands of years.

The WHO classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen. India regularly reports sporadic infections, particularly in the southern state of Kerala , regarded as one of the world's highest-risk regions for Nipah.

As of December 2025, there have been 750 confirmed Nipah infections globally, with 415 deaths, according to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is funding a vaccine trial to help stop Nipah.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 07:15:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU's Kallas: We expect to list Iran's revolutionary guards as a terrorist organization</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eus-kallas-we-expect-list-irans-revolutionary-guards-terrorist-organization-2026-01-29/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The European Union will most likely include Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations, the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Friday ahead of a foreign affairs ministers council.

News that "Le Constellation" bar, in the town of Crans-Montana in Canton Valais, had gone six years without a safety check quickly prompted officials to ban some practices, including the use of sparkling candles blamed for the tragedy.

The stain on Switzerland's otherwise exemplary safety record was quickly felt as local hoteliers reported cancelled bookings in a canton where the cost of real estate in resorts such as nearby Verbier can fetch prices on a par with Hong Kong.

"There were cancellations, there were reservation postponements to later dates in hotels," said Bruno Huggler, director of the Crans-Montana tourism office, after the blaze that killed mostly teenagers and injured more than 100 people.

Le Constellation owners Jacques Moretti and his wife are under investigation for negligent homicide and other crimes.

The disaster has ignited a fractious political debate over safety, including calls for harmonised national standards in a country that prizes local autonomy.

It has also sparked alarm in Verbier's hospitality sector.

"We realize this could very well happen right here," said Lionel Dubois, head of Verbier's Association of Hoteliers, Cafe Owners and Restaurateurs. "That, I think, is a bit frightening."

Tourism in Switzerland was worth about $22.17 billion, or 3% of national output in 2021, official data showed.

While bookings at Crans-Montana's roughly 1,300 hotel rooms have suffered, the overall picture is stable, as chalet and apartment rentals cover most stays, tourism boss Huggler said.

Young people have been shaken, though, and while some restaurants are returning to life, bars remain quieter, said Cedric Berger, head of the Association of Apartment and Chalet Owners of the Crans-Montana Upper Plateau.

Some local accommodation providers have seen cancellations in short-term vacation rentals.

"January is a month to forget, a lost month for everyone," said Berger.

Survivors of the fire, which also killed French and Italian citizens, are still hospitalised around Europe.

Crans-Montana apartment owners from Italy and France are angry, said Berger, who is also a lawyer.

"People go to Valais not because it's the 'best party', but because it's Switzerland, and you think it's safe. If that quality disappears, then Switzerland's 'fortress' is a bit shaken," he added.

Anxiety about the fallout is palpable in Verbier, where Reuters contacted 37 hospitality venues.

Most declined to speak or did not reply, though the 12 who did said checks were conducted properly. But all agreed that rules must be reinforced to guarantee regular inspections, limit numbers at venues and provide fire-safety training to staff.

In four of Switzerland's 26 cantons, including Valais, building insurance is not mandatory - potentially increasing risks for owners hit by fire, as well as weakening controls.

The Swiss Insurance Association said over 90% of buildings in Switzerland are insured according to market estimates, adding it does not keep precise figures on how many are not. Reuters could not establish if Le Constellation had building insurance.

The fire delivered the biggest hit to Switzerland's reputation since the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse bank, said Alexandre Edelmann, head of Presence Switzerland, the foreign ministry unit that promotes the country's image abroad.

As media reports about Switzerland jumped to 25 times more than average in early January, a crisis room was established to support people abroad following the fire, said Edelmann.

Lawmaker Jacqueline de Quattro, head of the lower house of parliament security committee, said the fire had exposed potential shortcomings in Switzerland's federal system, which allows cantons to set their own rules.

"We believed we had strict rules and that Switzerland was well‑prepared," said de Quattro. "But then we were brutally confronted with reality."

Proposing a national review to harmonise standards backed by an events industry group, she voiced concerns over event professionals' reports of sloppy work stemming from inadequate training, cost pressures and irregular inspections.

But the head of Verbier's Val de Bagnes municipality, Fabien Sauthier, said inspections need resources and that, while regular checks occur, it was tough to inspect some 400 public buildings annually with just four full-time safety officials.

And any push towards greater federal oversight could face resistance.

"I'm a Swiss person, so I think the canton should decide what it wants to do," said Willy Schranz, head of the municipal council in Adelboden in Canton Bern. "If you take responsibility, then it's a very good system."

China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their future.

Taiwan routinely holds drills ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins next month, though these are the first to take place in front of the media since China held its latest round of war games around the island in late December.

Any invasion of Taiwan by China would be very difficult given that the People's Liberation Army would have to first cross the Taiwan Strait and then attack the limited number of beaches on the island that would be suitable for landing their forces.

The drill, on a beach that forms part of the Zuoying naval base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, imagined a scenario where Taiwan first detected an unknown boat loitering off the coast - and then sends drones to investigate.

Taiwanese attack drones and fast, missile-armed patrol boats are then pressed into action. Snipers help pick off enemy forces and Taiwan-made anti-ship Hsiung Feng missiles take aim from concealed mobile launchers on the beach.

A Marine Corps officer, speaking while fully masked and not providing his name for security reasons, told reporters the near-shore exercise with coordinated strike missions was able to build a "kill chain and effectively execute joint interceptions."

"This demonstrated the Navy's multi-layered, multi-wave defensive combat effectiveness, as well as the Marine Corps' combat power and resilience in rapidly taking control from both the sea and the land," he added.

President Lai Ching-te's administration, as part of a defence-modernisation programme, has pushed for more combat-realistic training that relies less on set-piece performances and more on simulating actual combat.

Earlier this week, the military showed how its U.S.-made HIMARS - High Mobility Artillery Rocket System - would be used to hit the Penghu islands in the Taiwan Strait should Chinese forces seize them first and use them as a base to launch strikes on Taiwan proper.

The Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab HIMARS, one of Taiwan's newest and most precise strike weapons, has been used extensively by Ukraine against Russian forces.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 07:15:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7CYZ2N2WDBNULBEYGGOL3ZHRRA.jpg?auth=d62d508caff2912d07da53fcef4445908d5428a401e4ca1ef55a0e5252fba867&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel parliament gives initial approval for 2026 budget, averting snap election for now</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-parliament-gives-initial-approval-2026-budget-averting-snap-election-now-2026-01-29/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Israel's parliament gave initial approval to the 2026 state budget draft on Thursday, handing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a temporary political reprieve by averting the immediate prospect of an early election.

Lawmakers voted 62-55 in favor of the spending plan, which totals 662 billion shekels ($214.43 billion), excluding debt servicing, and sets a budget deficit ceiling of 3.9% of gross domestic product this year.

The budget, as well as an accompanying economic plan, still faces a difficult path to final approval amid deepening polarisation within Netanyahu's governing coalition. Under Israeli law, the budget must be passed by the end of March or parliament would automatically dissolve, triggering a snap election.

Tensions inside the coalition have simmered for more than two years, fuelled by disagreements over the war in Gaza, the ceasefire reached in October that halted the fighting, and demands by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties for legislation exempting religious seminary students from mandatory military service.

Some ultra-Orthodox lawmakers did not vote in favour of the budget since a military conscription bill has not yet been approved.

Netanyahu's other right-wing coalition partners - as well as opposition parties - argue that ultra-Orthodox men must share the burden of military service, particularly after two years of fighting in Gaza and Lebanon in which nearly 1,000 Israeli soldiers were killed.

"We made some really good progress on tariffs for whisky, on visa-free travel to China, and on information exchange co-operation on irregular migration," Starmer told reporters in Beijing after an 80-minute summit with the Chinese leader.

The pair discussed how much whisky tariffs would be reduced and over what timeframe, as well as discussing information on the small boats used in irregular migration into Britain as part of a greater strategic focus on security and defence.

Starmer also said the move to lower whisky tariffs was an example of how he wanted "a much wider opening" for British businesses in China, part of the aim of his trip as he seeks to inject growth into the UK's sluggish economy.

Asked whether the pair had discussed Jimmy Lai, the former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen who was convicted in December of national security crimes, Starmer said they had held a "respectful" discussion about that.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:02:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RN3WC6XR5RPA5HTNK7AWVYB6TA.jpg?auth=288aabc2a6cb2134ec26effe0b9e7994cc15150f161196b87be57df1e820db9c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China sees most high temperature days on record in 2025</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/china-sees-most-high-temperature-days-record-2025-2026-01-29/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's national average annual temperature hit a record for a second year at 10.9 degrees Celsius (51.6 degrees Fahrenheit), with the most high-temperature days ever recorded, the country's Meteorological Administration said on Thursday.

The announcement was made at a press conference where the administration released its 2025 climate bulletin.

Last year was among the planet's three warmest on record, the World Meteorological Organisation said in January.

China's average annual temperature has risen over recent decades, and 2025 was the warmest year since nationwide records began in 1961, the administration said. Heavy rainfall and extreme heat have become more intense, increasing risks such as flooding and natural disasters.

The country's 2025 temperature of 10.9 C tied with 2024 for the highest on record, the administration said. China describes high-temperature days as days at or above 35 C.

From late June to early September there were sustained high temperatures across central and eastern China and average precipitation was 4.5% higher than normal, it said.

The amount and duration of rain were also the highest on record in northern China, while the autumn rains in western China were the heaviest on record, the administration said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:02:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N6V2H2DH3RL47JITTIZSLBZ3IY.jpg?auth=0a74fc1dec4728624c626810ae29127bdb2bb8b2459412568fd8f436f5886e29&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gunfire and explosions heard near airport in Niger’s capital, residents say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260129-gunfire-explosions-heard-near-airport-niger-capital-residents-say</link><description>A burst of heavy gunfire and explosions erupted early Thursday near the international airport in Niger 's capital Niamey before halting within hours, residents told AFP.

Videos filmed by residents of the area showed streaks of light in the sky with the sound of loud explosions, while other images showed flames several metres high and charred cars.

The capital's Diori Hamani International Airport houses an air force base and is located about 10 kilometres from the presidential palace.

Niger, a country hit regularly by jihadist attacks, has been led for more than two years by Abdourahamane Tiani , the head of a junta that overthrew the country's elected civilian president in 2023.

The shooting began shortly after midnight, according to residents of a neighbourhood near the airport.

Calm returned two hours later, they said.

It was not immediately clear what had caused the gunfire and whether there were any casualties.

The sound of sirens from fire trucks heading towards the airport could also be heard in the early hours of the morning, according to local residents.

An online activist who supports the military rule , Ibrahim Bana, posted a video on Facebook in which he called on people to turn out on the streets of the capital to "defend the country".

The country's largest international airport is also the headquarters of a joint force created by Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali to combat jihadist groups waging deadly violence in the region.

Since taking over the country, Niger's military leadership has forced out French and US forces who had been helping to combat the jihadists.

Niger and its neighbours, also led by military juntas, have teamed up to create their own confederation, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), and have announced the creation of a 5,000-strong force for joint military operations.

According to ACLED, an NGO that tracks conflict casualties globally, jihadist violence killed nearly 2,000 people in 2025 in Niger.

A huge uranium shipment with an unknown buyer, that left the country's north in late November, has also been stuck at the airport for weeks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:03:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9f5ae042-fcc6-11f0-b793-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92V93WP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike kills three in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-drone-strike-kills-three-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-region-governor-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A Russian drone strike killed three people and wounded three more overnight in Ukraine's southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, the regional governor and emergency services said on Thursday.

Two women aged 26 and 50 and a 62-year-old man were killed in the attack, Ukraine's emergency services said, adding that one private building had been destroyed and several others damaged.

Emergency services posted photos on the Telegram messaging app of firefighters battling a raging fire and a flattened building.

Overall, in the past 24 hours Russia has launched 841 strikes at 34 settlements in the region, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.

Russian forces occupy large swathes of territory in Zaporizhzhia and have been making recent gains there. It is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 105 drones overnight, of which 84 were downed.

Ukraine and Russia met for U.S.-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi last week, with further meetings expected on Sunday, but Russia has continued to pound Ukrainian cities and both countries have hit each other's energy infrastructure .

Moscow's drones also struck again the southern port city of Odesa, causing a large fire at an industrial facility, Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram.

Kiper said that warehouses, production buildings and trucks were damaged in the attack, adding that no one was hurt.

The city of Odesa and surrounding region have been a repeated target of Moscow's attacks in recent months as it steps up pressure on Ukraine's maritime export arteries in retaliation for Kyiv's strikes on unregulated oil tankers sailing to Russia.

The death toll of an overnight attack on Tuesday on Odesa rose to four, Kiper said, after an elderly man died in a hospital from his injuries.

Russian officials made no comments on the attacks. Both Moscow and Kyiv deny they are targeting civilians in the nearly four-year war.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:55:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PO72BNIDJNJLFC4CD3KQ2FXB4E.jpg?auth=d6395eaa70c8bcc8a320d5e1834bd89b03ba9fe5aaade739f817abfc055226ea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz calls for stronger NATO within Europe, but wants to maintain US ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-merz-calls-stronger-nato-within-europe-wants-maintain-us-ties-2026-01-29/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday called for a stronger NATO within Europe but said that it should also always extend the hand of cooperation to the United States.

Kallas said that despite US-led talks to end the war in Abu Dhabi Russia was "bombing Ukrainians, trying to bomb and freeze them to surrender".

Russia's oil giant Lukoil, sanctioned by Washington over the Ukraine war, said on Thursday that it will sell its foreign assets to the US investment firm The Carlyle Group.

Lukoil "informs that it signed an agreement with US investment company Carlyle on the sale of LUKOIL International GmbH ", Russia's second-biggest oil producer said, adding that the deal excluded assets in Kazakhstan.

The number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could be 2 million by spring, with Russia sustaining the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II, a report warned Tuesday.

The report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

As the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes damaged an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and in the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.

Russian drone strikes killed three people and wounded another person overnight in southern Ukraine, the region's governor said early on Thursday.

"Unfortunately, two women and a man were killed, and another man was wounded," said Zaporizhzhia Governor Ivan Fedorov.

He added in a post to Telegram that the strikes had destroyed houses and caused fires.

EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas warned Thursday that Ukraine was facing a "humanitarian catastrophe" as Russian strikes cut power in frigid winter conditions.

Kallas said that despite US-led talks to end the war in Abu Dhabi Russia was "bombing Ukrainians, trying to bomb and freeze them to surrender".

Christina Harward, Russia Deputy Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War, says that the 'Russian advances are coming at a literal foot-pace' and 'this is not the picture that the Russians are trying to paint', adding that Russian casualties are astronomical.

﻿ She explains that Russians are trying to diplomatically strongarm Ukraine and the West into giving up this territory, because they 'know the fight is going to be long'.

For the Inuit people, who have lived here for centuries, no one owns the Arctic land.

The concept that ownership is shared collectively is central to the Inuit identity , they say. It has survived 300 years of colonisation and is written into law: People can own houses, but not the land beneath them.

"We can't even buy our own land ourselves, but Trump wants to buy it - that's so strange to us," said Kaaleeraq Ringsted, 74, in Kapisillit, a tiny settlement of wooden houses clinging to the shore of a fjord east of the capital, Nuuk.

“Since childhood, I have been used to the idea that you can only rent land. We have always been used to the idea that we collectively own our land.”

'A FREE LIFE IN NATURE'

Ringsted, a former fisherman and hunter who was born in Kapisillit, was speaking at the small church that sits on a cliff above the village, reachable only via a steep wooden staircase, where he is now the village catechist.

It is deep winter, and the sun rarely climbs above the surrounding mountains.

The settlement scattered below also boasts a school, a grocery store and a service house where residents can shower and wash clothes. A small emergency room holds basic medical supplies. A job posting for a clinic employee hung on the door.

It is a place of raw beauty and hard logistics. The small pier is the lifeline, where the weekly boat brings supplies from Nuuk and from which fishermen and hunters set out for seal, halibut, cod and reindeer.

"We’ve always had a free life here in nature," said Heidi Lennert Nolso, the village leader. "We can sail and go anywhere without restrictions."

Greenland and its people were thrust into the global spotlight last year when Trump revived his demand that the U.S. take control of the island for national security and to access its abundant mineral resources .

Trump has since backed away from threats the U.S. could take the island by force and said he had secured total and permanent U.S. access to Greenland in a deal with NATO, but much of the detail remains unclear.

Locals in the village said they followed the headlines, but it was not something they spoke a lot about.

“People here are interested in the day that is coming. Is there food in the fridge? Fine, then I can sleep a little longer. If there is no food, then I will go out and catch fish or go out and shoot a reindeer,” said Vanilla Mathiassen, a Danish teacher in Kapisillit who has worked in towns and villages across Greenland for 13 years.

Ulrik Blidorf, a lawyer in Nuuk and owner of the firm Inuit Law, said Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, did not have private freehold ownership of land.

“In Greenland, you can’t own the land,” Blidorf said. “It’s been like that ever since our ancestors came here. Today you get a right to use the area where you have your house.”

Nearly 90% of Greenland's 57,000 population are indigenous Inuit, who have inhabited the island continuously for around 1,000 years.

Rakel Kristiansen, from a family of shamanic practitioners, said Inuit people saw themselves as temporary guardians of the land.

"In our understanding, owning land is the wrong question,” she said. “The question should be who is responsible for the land. The land existed before us, and it will exist after us.”

CLINGING ON TO SURVIVAL

Back in Kapisillit, a cold wind sweeps down from the Greenland ice sheet. Two sea eagles circle above the fjord and seagulls cluster around fishing boats.

Here, the focus is on survival.

But there are fewer hunters and fishermen now, as the pull of education, jobs and services has drawn people away from the settlement in recent decades.

At the school, William, 8, Malerak, 7, and Viola, 7, are the only remaining students, studying beneath a map of Greenland printed in 1954. During recess, they go sledding. All three are moving away soon, and the school may close.

New holiday homes, some with outdoor hot tubs, have been built along the bay for wealthy Nuuk residents. They stand empty and shuttered in winter.

From a nearby cliff, an iceberg-filled fjord is visible. The scenery could draw tourism, but the village lacks even basic infrastructure.

“There's a risk the settlement could die," village leader Nolso said. "People are getting old.”

Kapisillit once had nearly 500 residents at its peak, said Kristiane Josefsen, a lifelong resident. Today it has 37. Josefsen, born in 1959, works with sealskin — washing, processing and scraping it to sell in Nuuk for national costumes.

"Scraping sealskins is very hard on the body," she said.

But though she plans to retire this year, she does not intend to leave.

"I’m staying here. I belong here," she said. "This is my land. Greenland is my land.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:44:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UHN5MS4LWRNHVMET5GFCC47H74.jpg?auth=468fd4652c77e8d84c2f78ce7b08a79a9c3d74e01a27a8eff02395128093789f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's foreign minister to visit Turkey for talks on tensions with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-foreign-minister-visit-turkey-talks-tensions-with-us-2026-01-29/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will visit Turkey on Friday for talks with his counterpart Hakan Fidan on the recent developments in Iran and tensions with the United States, a Turkish Foreign Ministry source said on Thursday.

U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons or the next U.S. attack would be far worse. Trump has sent an " armada " to the Middle East and warned Tehran against killing anti-government protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

Tehran, which brutally cracked down on large protests this month and killed or arrested thousands, responded with a threat to strike back against the United States, Israel and those who support them.

Iranian officials blame the unrest, the biggest since the 1979 revolution, on Iran's foes, Israel and the United States.

Turkey, a NATO member that shares a border with Iran, has said it opposes any foreign intervention on its neighbour and urged Washington to resolve its issues with Iran "one by one".

It has reached out to both sides, warning that destabilisation in Iran would exceed the region's capacity to manage at this time.

The source said Fidan would tell Araqchi that Turkey closely followed developments in Iran, and that Iran's security, peace, and stability were of "great importance" for Ankara.

Fidan will also repeat Turkey's opposition to any military attack on Iran and warn that such a move will "create risks on a global scale", the source said, adding that he would offer Turkey's support in helping resolve tensions with Washington.

Fidan will "note that Turkey supports finding a solution on Iran's nuclear programme as soon as possible, and that it stands ready to help on this issue if it is needed," the source said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:46:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SXPZDAJ2ANNUTKIWK5IC55EBGI.jpg?auth=d070a3361857cac5524ecbeede473ded9b0b6e9e4994b5555785ffc47f412422&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Senate approves draft bill to simplify return of colonial-era artefacts</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260129-french-lawmakers-approve-framework-law-facilitate-return-colonial-artefact</link><description>French senators adopted a bill on Wednesday to simplify the return of artworks looted during the colonial era to their countries of origin.

The draft legislation was unanimously approved by the upper house and will next be sent to the National Assembly lower house before it can become law.

France still has in its possession tens of thousands of artworks and other prized artefacts that it looted from its colonial empire.

President Emmanuel Macron has gone further than his predecessors in admitting past French abuses in Africa.

Speaking on a visit to the Burkina Faso capital Ouagadougou shortly after taking office in 2017, Macron vowed that France would never again interfere in its former colonies and promised to facilitate the return of African cultural heritage within five years.

Former colonial powers in Europe have slowly been moving to send back some artworks obtained during their imperial conquests, but France is hindered by its current legislation.

The return of every item in the national collection must be voted on individually.

Designed to streamline the process, the bill under consideration specifically targets property acquired between 1815 and 1972.

"The idea is not to empty French museums , but to achieve authenticity in France's response, without denial or repentance, but in recognition of our history," said centrist Senator Catherine Morin-Desailly.

In 2025, France's parliament approved the return to Ivory Coast of a " talking drum " that colonial troops took from the Ebrie tribe in 1916.

France has been flooded with restitution demands, including from Algeria , Mali and Benin .

The restitution of looted artworks to Africa is one of the highlights of the "new relationship" Macron wanted to establish with the continent.

In 2023, France adopted two so-called framework laws to return objects in two categories: one for goods looted from Jewish families during World War II , and another for the repatriation of human remains from public collections.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:47:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5245f3c8-3650-11ec-a1ef-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/benin-art.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer seeks fresh start with China as Trump shakes up global relations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260129-uk-starmer-seeks-fresh-start-china-trump-shakes-up-global-relations</link><description>British ⁠Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday that he wanted to build a "sophisticated relationship" with Beijing to boost the UK economy, signalling a reset after years of strained ties.

On the key day of his four-day visit to China , the first by a British prime minister in eight years, Starmer held an 80-minute summit with Xi at the ​Great Hall of the People before they lunched together. Starmer said the pair chatted about football and Shakespeare, as well as business matters.

The British leader will also ‍meet Premier Li Qiang. Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world's second-largest economy a priority, despite lingering misgivings about espionage and human rights .

"China is a vital player on ​the global stage, and it's vital that we build a more sophisticated relationship where we can identify opportunities to collaborate, but of course, ​also allow a meaningful dialogue on areas where we disagree," Starmer told

Xi said ties with Britain had gone through "twists and turns" that did not serve the interests of either country and that China was ready to develop a long-term partnership.

"We can deliver a result that can withstand the test of history," the Chinese leader told Starmer, flanked by his top ministers.

Starmer is the latest Western leader to engage in a flurry of diplomacy with China, as nations hedge against unpredictability from the United States under President Donald Trump.

Trump's on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges to grab control of Greenland , an autonomous territory of Denmark , have rankled long-standing allies like Britain.

Starmer's visit immediately follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who signed an economic deal with Beijing to tear down trade barriers, ‍drawing Trump's ire.

The British leader told reporters he had made progress in discussions with China's leader to reduce tariffs on whisky, while Xi also said China would consider waiving visas for British nationals.

The "relationship is in a good place, a strong place", said ​Starmer, who is being accompanied by more than 50 business leaders on the trip.

Asked by a reporter if Xi was someone he could do business with, Starmer replied "yes".

Starmer has adopted a new policy of engagement with China after ties deteriorated for years under previous Conservative governments, when London curbed some Chinese investment over national ‌security worries and expressed concern over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong.

"I made the promise 18 months ago, when we were elected into government, that I would make Britain face outwards again," Starmer told Xi. "Because, as we all know, events abroad affect everything that happens back in ‍our home countries, to prices on the supermarket shelves to how secure we feel."

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of Britain’s opposition Conservative Party, said on Wednesday she would not have gone to China because of the security risks the country poses. British security services have said China routinely spies on the government. China has denied the claims.

In a sign of how the countries can work together, Starmer also announced that Britain and China would jointly tackle gangs involved in trafficking illegal migrants.

The deal focuses on reducing the use of Chinese-made engines for small boats that transport people across Europe to claim asylum .

British and Chinese officials will share intelligence to identify smugglers’ supply routes and work with Chinese manufacturers to prevent legitimate businesses from being exploited by organised crime , Downing Street said.

Starmer told reporters he also had a "respectful ‍discussion" with Xi about the case of Jimmy Lai , the former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen who was convicted in December of national security crimes.

After arriving in the Chinese capital late Wednesday, Starmer dined at a ‌restaurant known for its mushroom-laden dishes ​that also hosted former US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen during her 2023 visit.

He practiced pronouncing the Chinese word for thank you – "xie xie" – with restaurant staff as he posed for photographs, a video posted on Weibo showed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:47:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/245e23be-fce8-11f0-bc97-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029280407456.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says it is still waiting for U.S. response to Putin's nuclear treaty offer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-it-is-still-waiting-us-response-putins-nuclear-treaty-offer-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Russia is still waiting for the United States to respond to President Vladimir Putin's proposal to informally extend for a year the provisions of the last remaining nuclear arms pact between the two countries, the Kremlin said on Thursday.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the expiry of the New START treaty on February 5 could lead to a serious gap in the legal framework regulating nuclear arms.

New START, which was signed by presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, sets limits on the strategic weapons that each side would use to target the other's critical political and military centres in the event of a nuclear war.

European nations are hiking defence spending in response to pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and following Russia's invasion of Ukraine .

Norway will acquire 16 launch systems and an undisclosed number of rockets for a total cost of 19 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.0 billion), the defence ministry said in a statement.

Hanwha Aerospace's Chunmoo artillery system competed for the Norwegian army contract with U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin's (LMT.N) , opens new tab HIMARS.

"Hanwha will deliver launch units and training materials in 2028 and 2029, and missiles in 2030 and 2031," Norway's Defence Minister Tore Sandvik said in the statement.

Norway, which shares a border with Russia in the Arctic, says the war in Ukraine has shown that long-range artillery is essential on the modern battlefield.

The South Korean system met all requirements set by Norway for the ground-based artillery, including the ability to fire at a range of up to 500 km (310 miles), and had the quickest delivery time, officials have said.

Hanwha Aerospace last year signed an agreement with Polish defence company WB Electronics to form a joint venture producing missiles in Poland, including for the Chunmoo rocket artillery, ensuring manufacturing on European soil.

Some members of Norway's parliament had said the Nordic country should help to develop a European missile alternative, but the government dismissed this as too time-consuming and costly.

British citizens will be allowed to visit China without a visa if they are travelling for under 30 days, Starmer said following his talks with President Xi Jinping, in what he cast as a win for business.

Companies had been "crying out for ways to grow their footprints in China", a statement from Starmer said, adding that visa-free travel would help facilitate expansion in that market, boosting jobs at home.

Injecting growth into Britain's relatively sluggish economy is one of the main aims of his four-day trip.

As part of what Britain called a "new partnership", the two countries also agreed to conduct a feasibility study which could pave the way towards a bilateral services agreement, which would further help British firms doing business in China.

Britain's economy is underpinned by its huge services sector and the partnership will aim to grow links in the healthcare, financial and professional services, legal services, education and skills sectors, the statement said.

Britain exports 13 billion pounds worth of services to China annually, it added, and demand from China is growing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 11:31:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DN3S3SQGUBN7FMX5P7JFFGT3HE.jpg?auth=a94bbf5fa466e4d37b3458b5fbb32cc162cb9ba63b873ac6ea132478b360f6e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia and Ukraine carry out new exchange of war dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-carry-out-new-exchange-war-dead-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW/KYIV, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine said on Thursday that they had carried out the latest exchange of their war dead, a regular practice designed to allow relatives of those killed on the battlefield to bury their loved ones.

Following weeks of daily clashes between protesters and immigration agents, spiked by the fatal shooting of two U.S. citizens during such confrontations, senior Trump administration officials seemed to be recalibrating their approach.

A newly issued internal memo from a high-ranking Immigration and Customs Enforcement official directs federal officers to refrain from any unnecessary communication and engagement with "agitators" so as to avoid "inflaming the situation."

The directive, reviewed by Reuters late on Wednesday, also orders ICE officers to only target immigrants who have records of criminal charges or convictions, a departure from earlier tactics that included randomly stopping people on the street to demand documented proof of legal U.S. residence or citizenship.

The substance of the memo seemed at odds with tough talk coming from Trump and some of his senior officials on Wednesday.

A day after sounding a conciliatory tone in his public remarks, the Republican president took to his Truth Social platform on Wednesday to warn that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, was "playing with fire" by continuing to insist that city authorities would play no role in enforcing federal immigration laws.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents had arrested 16 people on Wednesday in Minnesota for allegedly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal law enforcement.

"Nothing will stop us from continuing to make arrests and enforce the law," Bondi wrote.

A federal judge in Minneapolis said on Wednesday that ICE was flouting the law by ignoring dozens of federal court orders during this month's surge.

While canceling a contempt-of-court hearing for acting ICE chief Todd Lyons - after the agency belatedly complied with an order to release a wrongly detained Ecuadorean man - U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz cited at least 96 federal court orders he said ICE has violated in 74 cases.

"This list should give pause to anyone - no matter his or her political beliefs - who cares about the rule of law," Schiltz wrote in his ruling. "ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2025 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence."

It was not made clear what Homan planned to discuss at his press conference, two days after he held his first meetings with Frey and Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, who have denounced the ICE operation as "reckless" and demanded it be ended altogether.

The guidance contained in the internal ICE memo seemed to reflect a change playing out on the streets of Minneapolis.

Observers and activists closely tracking ICE actions told Reuters that immigration raids had slackened somewhat on Tuesday before ramping up again on Wednesday, though in a more narrowly tailored manner.

Trump himself said on Tuesday he was looking to "de-escalate a little bit," and dispatched Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism and legal challenges.

Minnesota's Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been in a state of upheaval since Trump ordered some 3,000 heavily armed ICE and Border Patrol agents to the area weeks ago to conduct a deportation drive dubbed Operation Metro Surge.

Tensions escalated after Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot dead behind the wheel of her car by an ICE agent on January 7, sparking demonstrations in the Twin Cities and in communities large and small across the country.

But public outrage deepened after Saturday's fatal shooting of an intensive care nurse, Alex Pretti, also 37, during another encounter between immigration agents and activists who confronted them to record and protest ICE activity.

In both cases, Trump administration officials immediately defended the federal agents involved in the shootings, denouncing both Good and Pretti as "domestic terrorists" who they said were threatening to harm law enforcement.

Multiple video recordings of the two incidents that have since gone viral on the internet plainly contradict the notion that either Good or Pretti posed a danger to immigration officers or others.

While some administration officials immediately accused Pretti of planning to "massacre" officers, citing the handgun he was carrying, video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot Pretti in the back while he was being restrained.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was commenting a day after U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons or face a possible U.S. attack.

"We continue to call on all parties to exercise restraint and to renounce any use of force to resolve issues. Clearly, the potential for negotiations is far from exhausted... We must focus primarily on negotiating mechanisms," Peskov told reporters.

"Any forceful actions can only create chaos in the region and lead to very dangerous consequences in terms of destabilising the security system throughout the region."

The suspects were detained following a joint investigation by Istanbul prosecutors, the anti-terrorism police and Turkey's intelligence agency, according to TRT.

They are accused of gathering information on military bases and other sensitive locations in Turkey and abroad, allegedly in coordination with members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' intelligence arm, according to the report.

TRT said the six are further suspected of conducting reconnaissance around the NATO-run Incirlik air base in the southeastern Turkish province of Adana, taking part in shipment of drones through Turkey for use in third countries, and sharing information with Iranian intelligence.

Iran was hit in the past month by the most widespread unrest since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. It is also under U.S. pressure to negotiate a deal to curb its nuclear programme or face, in President Donald Trump's words, a "far worse" attack than a U.S. strike on its nuclear facilities last June.

Trump has sent what he has described as an " armada " to the Middle East to warn Tehran against killing anti-government protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

The report by World Weather Attribution showed that the intensity of such extreme rainfall events has increased by 40% since preindustrial times - a clear sign that warmer ocean temperatures linked to greenhouse gas emissions are partly to blame - and that current La Niña conditions had worsened things.

Severe flooding since December has wrought havoc across Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Eswatini, "with some areas receiving over a year’s rain in just days," the study said. Burst rivers forced the closure of South Africa's Kruger park , and will cost millions of dollars to repair.

"Data confirms a clear move toward more violent downpours," WWA said. "This effect was compounded by the current La Niña, which naturally brings wetter conditions to this part of the world, but is now operating within a ... more moisture-rich atmosphere."

La Niña involves the temporary cooling of temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. The World Meteorological Organization has predicted a weak La Niña in this cycle, but warned that warmer-than-normal sea temperatures linked to climate change are increasing the chance of floods and droughts.

"Human-caused climate change is supercharging rainfall events like this with devastating impacts for those in its path," Izidine Pinto, co-author and senior climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute said.

"Our analysis clearly shows that our continued burning of fossil fuels is increasing the intensity of extreme rainfall, turning (it) ... into something much more severe."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 11:34:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XRVBM7AJZZLSLDTOLGK2CIKMIE.jpg?auth=f0f69f350d8c86333642497ef8dbdb23245fdd397b115ab46aea652bd9d24bc6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran's army chief vows 'crushing response' as US tensions simmer</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260129-live-iran-army-chief-vows-crushing-response-us-tensions-simmer</link><description>Iran's army chief on Thursday vowed a "crushing response" to any attack, state television reported, after the United States moved a strike force into regional waters.

TotalEnergies chief executive Patrick Pouyanne announced the restart of the Mozambique LNG project at a ceremony attended by President Daniel Chapo .

"I am delighted to announce the full restart of the Mozambique LNG project ... The force majeure is over," Pouyanne told the event.

The $20 billion project in the northern Cabo Delgado province on the border with Tanzania was suspended following a bloody jihadist attack in 2021 that killed an estimated 800 people.

TotalEnergies had already lifted in October the force majeure it declared after the attack , and has sought compensation of $4.5 billion in cost overruns linked to the delay from the Mozambique government.

Chapo's office said in a statement the restart of the project "presents a significant milestone for the national economy and reaffirms the confidence of international partners in Mozambique's energy, institutional and human potential".

Reportedly the largest private investment in Africa's energy infrastructure, the project is expected to generate thousands of jobs and help make the country one of the world's biggest LNG exporters.

But environmental groups have called it a " climate bomb" that would bring little benefit to Mozambicans, more than 80 percent of whom lived below the poverty line of three dollars per day in 2022, according to the World Bank .

While northern Mozambique has not experienced an attack on the scale of the one in 2021, there are regular attacks on civilians and troops blamed on jihadist insurgents.

Medics said two men were killed by Israeli forces in eastern Khan Younis, in an area adjacent to where the army operates. The Israeli military told Reuters it wasn't aware of any casualties as a result of Israeli fire on Thursday.

The Gaza health ministry said Israeli airstrikes, tank shelling and gunfire have killed at least 490 people since the truce took effect in October after two years of war that widely demolished the Palestinian enclave.

Israel said four soldiers have been killed by Palestinian militants in the small coastal territory over the same period.

The two sides have traded blame over the truce violations.

By advancing to phase two, the U.S. and mediator partners Egypt and Qatar must confront the more contentious issue of Hamas disarmament, which the group has long rejected.

Laura Fernandez, 39, a political scientist and former presidential chief of staff, holds a commanding lead, signaling voter appetite in the Central American country to extend the right’s mandate.

The election underscores the growing appeal in Latin America of strongmen leaders like El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele who champion their tough security policies at the expense of shrinking civil liberties.

Fernandez campaigned on a vow to continue the policies of Costa Rica's current president and her mentor, Rodrigo Chaves, a brash former World Bank economist who is facing a number of corruption investigations while remaining deeply popular.

“Rodrigo Chaves’ project is not a four-year event, it’s a one-way street,” Fernandez said in a campaign video.

The election is seen by many as a referendum on Chaves' leadership and his tough-on-crime policies.

Fernandez has asked voters to hand her 40 seats in the 57-seat legislative assembly, a supermajority that would allow her to reform the judiciary and constitution, including allowing consecutive or indefinite reelection. Currently, the term is set at four years but cannot be served consecutively.

She has also pledged to enact stricter criminal sentences, reform state pensions and fight crime.

Latest polls show Fernandez at or around 40%, the amount needed to avoid a runoff vote in April, while her closest contenders in the 20-person race are polling in the single digits.

If Fernandez fails to garner enough support to win the election outright, those seen as most likely to make it to a second round against Fernandez include Alvaro Ramos, an economist from the mainstream National Liberation Party and Claudia Dobles, an architect and former first lady who returned to revive the fledgling Citizen Action Party after working as a researcher at MIT.

Most of the 19 opposition candidates have warned against the risk of an emerging authoritarian model led by Chaves, but have failed to form a united front against Fernandez.

A major tourist destination, Costa Rica has long been lauded as a peaceful oasis in a region plagued by civil wars, gang violence and drug trafficking.

But the country of about 5.2 million has seen record levels of murders in recent years as it becomes a growing hotspot for global cocaine trafficking according to the U.S. government.

In late January, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned a Costa Rican drug network and said the country "has become an increasingly significant waypoint for criminal organizations trafficking cocaine to the United States."

The statement underscored a major transformation for a country that has no military and attracts over 2 million tourists a year.

"The speed with which drug traffickers have infiltrated the country and captured some of the country's institutions hasn't been seen before," said Maria Fernanda Bozmoski, the director for Central America at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international affairs think tank.

While rising violence and murders have led to an anti-incumbent shift in recent elections in Chile, Honduras and Ecuador, Bozmoski said that Chaves has remained largely immune to that sentiment.

Ronald Rodriguez, a 61-year-old retiree from the canton of San Carlos in northern Costa Rica, said Chaves’ movement needs more time and power for its policies to make an impact.

"The problem isn't Chaves, it's all of those who came before him and let things get worse," Rodriguez said. "Things are worse than ever and that's why we need the things Chaves is promising, changing the judiciary and building that Bukele jail fast."

El Salvador’s Bukele recently visited Costa Rica to inaugurate a maximum-security prison modeled after El Salvador's 40,000-inmate Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) and Fernandez has vowed to see it through.

Ronald Alfaro, a researcher at Costa Rica's Center for Investigations and Political Studies (CIEP), said Chaves' popularity stems from his anti-status quo reputation.

"His support, like other similar political figures, is more based on his persona and what he represents," Alfaro said. "That's why the government's slogan is, if you want change, vote for continuity."

Despite the incumbent party's lead, a January poll from CIEP shows nearly a third of voters remain undecided while 79% of respondents said they were a little enthusiastic or not enthusiastic at all about the election.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 12:59:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QBIMDONCWVL5FPNCYORQ6TKXRA.jpg?auth=e7289fa10ca2cbf64f648ff2602da6b63db42066bf538929b475c19e2a003cd2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Temperatures as low as minus 30C in Ukraine next week may damage crops</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/temperatures-low-minus-30c-ukraine-next-week-may-damage-crops-2026-01-29/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Extremely low temperatures down to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit) will hit Ukraine at the beginning of next week, which is very dangerous for winter crops, agricultural analysts and the national emergency service said on Thursday.

A sharp drop in temperature will begin on February 1 and will affect all regions except southern Ukraine and the frosts will begin to ease slightly only on February 4, the service said on the Telegram messenger.

"We consider the current cold spell to be extremely dangerous for winter crops across a significant part of Ukraine," analyst Barva Invest said on Telegram.

Ukraine is a producer of winter wheat, which accounts for about 95% of the total Ukrainian wheat harvest. Winter wheat, which has a higher yield than spring wheat, is sown in autumn and harvested in the summer of the following year.

Barva Invest noted that a combination of severe frosts and insufficient snow cover could affect crops in central, north-eastern and eastern Ukraine.

Frosts will be less severe in southern Ukraine, but there is no snow cover there to protect the crops.

Temperatures dropped to minus 20 C in Ukraine in early January, only easing to above-zero temperatures this week.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 12:59:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VZQQYHTF5VNJXMVYWQ3WSEGRGI.jpg?auth=d34a648b1a5951766a59aaf10084f7d3710643b7d447f1d72d4ae992c489887f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chechen leader Kadyrov says Russia should fight war in Ukraine to the end</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/chechen-leader-kadyrov-says-russia-should-fight-ukraine-war-end-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The leader of Russia's Chechnya region, Ramzan Kadyrov, said on Thursday that he was opposed to talks on ending the war in Ukraine and that Moscow should fight on.

Kadyrov, who calls himself Putin's "foot soldier" is a prominent war hawk. His comment reflects a current of opinion among hardliners that Russia is winning the four-year-old war and should keep going, even as U.S. President Donald Trump steps up diplomatic efforts to end it.

However, the decision on whether and when to stop lies firmly with Putin.

Conflicts in the Middle East and a protracted Russia-Ukraine war have led to a surge in demand for arms, driving sales for defense contractors like Lockheed.

Geopolitical tensions have also been further heightened by the capture of the Venezuelan president , opens new tab by U.S. forces.

Lockheed's F-35 and F-22 fighter jets, RQ-170 stealth drones and Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopters were used in the operation, CEO Jim Taiclet said in the release.

Earlier this month, Lockheed clinched a seven-year agreement with the Department of War to boost production of Patriot PAC-3 missile interceptors to 2,000 units annually, up from 600.

Separately, Lockheed also said on Thursday that it had reached a deal with the DoW to more than quadruple production of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile interceptors to 400 per year, up from 96 previously.

During the fourth quarter, the company's missiles business, maker of the Patriot system, posted the fastest sales growth, up 17.8% from a year ago.

Quarterly sales for its aeronautics segment, which is the leading segment by revenue and makes the F-35 jets, rose 6.4%.

In January, Lockheed said it delivered a record 191 F-35 fighter jets in 2025, up from 110 jets in 2024.

The F-35 is the Pentagon's largest acquisition program, with lifetime costs estimated at more than $2 trillion for purchasing, operating and maintaining the aircraft.

President Donald Trump in January signed an order for defense firms linking dividends, share buybacks and executive pay to weapons delivery schedules, introducing uncertainty around capital returns.

Peers RTX (RTX.N) , opens new tab and Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) , opens new tab have reaffirmed their commitment to dividends, although Northrop said it would pause buybacks beyond January.

In 2025, Lockheed paid $3.13 billion in dividends, a rise from $3.06 billion the previous year.

Lockheed forecast 2026 revenue of $77.5 billion to $80 billion, above analysts' estimates of $77.83 billion, according to LSEG-compiled data.

It expects profit per share between $29.35 and $30.25, versus expectations of $29.28.

Myanmar's long‑running conflict remains one of ASEAN's most difficult and divisive issues. It recently completed elections , which are expected to hand a landslide victory to a military-backed party, but ASEAN as a bloc has not endorsed the vote.

While Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Theresa Lazaro noted that some member states view the elections as "something positive," she emphasised this was not an expression of support, merely an acknowledgement that some governments see opportunities emerging.

ASEAN has barred Myanmar's military rulers since 2022 and did not as a bloc endorse the election, which the opposition did not participate in.

Lazaro stressed that ASEAN’s engagement with Myanmar continues to be anchored in the 2021 five-point peace plan agreed with the junta leader after a coup.

Negotiations on an ASEAN‑China Code of Conduct in the South China Sea have dragged on for over two decades, but the Philippines, as 2026 chair, is pushing to inject momentum.

China's extensive maritime claims overlap with the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, making a functional code essential to preventing escalation and managing incidents at sea.

Lazaro said ASEAN ministers "welcome the positive momentum" in negotiations and that the Philippines will endeavour to speed them up and conclude the code this year.

She emphasised the code must be based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and must be legally binding to effectively address disputes.

The long-running border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia remains a sensitive issue for ASEAN.

The previous chair of ASEAN, Malaysia, oversaw several rounds of ceasefire negotiations after renewed fighting along the border last year, when clashes, airstrikes and landmine blasts caused scores of casualties and mass displacement.

Lazaro said the current ceasefire is fragile but holding, and ASEAN is relieved that skirmishes have not escalated.

As chair, the Philippines will serve as coordinator for the ASEAN Observer Team, tasked with monitoring the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FSSIK23YQJNJ7IR6YMISES4ONU.jpg?auth=4f91438c768ade873014dfabc9894ca4811a929379d104e59dcb6bc9a67dd5f1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK immigration officers in court charged with stealing cash from 'small boat' migrants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-immigration-officers-court-charged-with-stealing-cash-small-boat-migrants-2026-01-29/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Five British immigration officers appeared in court on Thursday charged with misconduct in public office and conspiracy to steal from migrants who had arrived in Britain on small boats.

John Bernthal, 53, Ben Edwardes, 45, Lee-Ann Evanson, 42, Besmir Matera, 36, and Jack Mitchell, 33, are charged with stealing from migrants between August 2021 and November 2022.

All five are also charged with one count of misconduct in public office and one count of money laundering.

They sat in the dock at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court as prosecutor Rosalind Earis said the five worked on Britain's south coast "dealing with recent arrivals on small boats across the Channel".

The crossings of small boats carrying migrants from France, the most visible sign of arrivals, have become a focal point for British voters and has helped propel Nigel Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK party into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Earis told the court that "many of these people arrive with relatively large sums of money in cash on their person". When the defendants discovered this "they worked together to take that money for themselves and share it", Earis added.

Matera is also charged with entering or remaining in Britain by deception and possession of three identity documents – a British passport and a full and provisional driving licences – in a false name.

Earis said Matera applied for asylum in 2003, claiming he was from Kosovo and had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry. But, Earis said, Matera was from Albania and arrived in Britain on a school trip.

A sixth defendant, 43-year-old David Grundy, is only charged with one count of money laundering.

All six defendants were granted bail ahead of their next hearing at Southwark Crown Court in February. None were asked to enter pleas.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 13:00:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The top candidates in Costa Rica's presidential election: a tough-on-crime front runner and splintered opposition</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/top-candidates-costa-ricas-presidential-election-tough-on-crime-front-runner-2026-01-29/</link><description>SAN JOSE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A total of 20 candidates are in the running to be Costa Rica's next president, but one right-wing populist candidate has taken a commanding lead in the polls. Laura Fernandez of the ruling Sovereign People's Party is hoping to win at least 40% of the vote to avoid an April runoff.

LAURA FERNANDEZ, 39, Sovereign People's Party (PPSO)

A protégé of the current president, Fernandez has vowed to champion tough policies to combat a surge in crime fueled by drug trafficking in the country. She has also called for changes to state pensions and reforming the judiciary and the constitution.

She has steadily risen in the polls and most show her with over 40% support, the threshold required to avoid a runoff.

A political scientist, Fernandez led the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Policy from 2022 to 2025 and briefly served as the president's chief of staff.

ALVARO RAMOS, 42, National Liberation Party (PLN)

Despite polling below 10%, economist Alvaro Ramos is viewed as one of the candidates who are most likely to reach a runoff.

He briefly oversaw the country's extensive network of public health clinics in 2022, but was dismissed from the job due to a feud with the president over salaries.

Ramos has promised to crack down on crime. But his political party, one of Costa Rica's most established, has struggled to regain its footing in recent elections.

CLAUDIA DOBLES, 45, Citizen Action Party (PAC)

Claudia Dobles, an architect and former researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the wife of former President Carlos Alvarado, who served from 2018 to 2022.

She oversaw urban planning and decarbonization projects during her husband's administration, but her party suffered one of its worst electoral defeats following his presidency and was nearly wiped from the political scene.

ARIEL ROBLES, 34, Broad Front (FA)

A teacher and legislator from the left-wing Broad Front party, Ariel Robles is polling at just 4%, though his party is registering high levels of support in legislative races. Still, his party has mounted the strongest opposition against the ruling party in Congress and is trying to attract the youth vote, which is the largest portion of undecided voters.

JOSE MIGUEL AGUILAR, 47, Avanza

Despite polling at just about 3%, Aguilar has garnered widespread media attention for his marriage to a cousin of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.

Aguilar has sharply criticized Costa Rica's president in televised debates, a notable development given the president's ideological alignment with Bukele, a hard-liner.

The other 15 candidates span the political spectrum and are polling below the margin of error. Most have joined the other opposition candidates in warning against the risk of an emerging authoritarian model championed by the election's frontrunner.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 13:01:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ALUOCBJA5VJLBEHGDM66OLXARQ.jpg?auth=99ac7866b822967137da114e0a63aa214b021967293554dd51e42a3339466988&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK and 23 other OSCE members launch probe into Georgia rights concerns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-23-other-osce-members-launch-probe-into-georgia-rights-concerns-2026-01-29/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 29 - Britain, Canada, Germany and 21 other OSCE members on Thursday said they would launch an expert mission to examine the deteriorating human rights situation in Georgia.

“However, our concerns about the Georgian authorities’ implementation of shared human‑dimension commitments and international human rights obligations have only increased,” the statement, published on the British government's website, said.

The state Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, said professional lapses by staff had contributed to a mass outbreak of a viral infection that led to 46 people being hospitalised. At least three people died as a result of the illness and six other deaths were under investigation.

The care home is just outside the city of Novokuznetsk, where the deaths of nine newborn babies in the space of nine days shortly after the New Year sparked outrage across Russia and spurred a criminal investigation into negligence.

In the latest case, the Investigative Committee said staff were being questioned, medical records had been seized and forensic tests were under way to determine the cause of the infection's spread.

The investigation is into "sanitary violations resulting in the deaths of patients".

The regional health ministry said earlier this month it had detected 46 cases of influenza type A among a sample of 128 residents of the care home, while two more people tested positive for pneumonia.

Those who died included a 21-year-old woman with cerebral palsy and a 19-year-old man, according to regional authorities.

Ilya Seredyuk, governor of the Kuzbass region of Siberia, called the news was devastating, and said a commission formed by the regional government had been working on site since January 24.

"Materials requiring review have been sent to law enforcement agencies," he said.

Kuzbass is a heavily industrial region of about 2.6 million people that accounts for much of Russia's coal production.

Average life expectancy there in 2023 was about 70.2 years, well below the national average of 73.1 and compared with an average of 81.5 in the European Union.

Official data released this month shows deaths from respiratory diseases among working-age people in Kuzbass rose between 2022 and 2024, while overall mortality rates were higher and fertility rates lower than federal averages.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:03:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark's King Frederik to visit Greenland in February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmarks-king-frederik-visit-greenland-february-2026-01-29/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Denmark's King Frederik will travel to Greenland during the week starting February 16, he told journalists on Thursday.

Truckers in Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia began protests on Monday against the EU's new stricter implementation of its entry-exit system under which they face detention and deportation for exceeding Schengen visit limits.

The same day, EU spokesperson Markus Lamert said the bloc was working on a new visa strategy for highly mobile professions like truck drivers, athletes or artists, but the drivers have kept up the pressure.

At the Batrovci border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, an EU-member state, a mile-long column of trucks blocked the approach to the cargo terminal.

"I would personally like this to be over tomorrow..., but we will see what the European Commission will ... bring to us as a solution," said Dusan Andjelic, of the MS Transporter trucking company.

Blockades halted freight along the key corridor linking the EU to Turkey and the Middle East.

Serbia's Chamber of Commerce head Marko Cadez said 93% of exports from the four countries were blocked, causing daily damage of about 92 million euros ($109.95 million).

EU-based firms operating in or exporting to the region are also affected.

"For every company ... it is about 10,000 to 50,000 euros per day in penalties ... as they are not servicing customers," Cadez told Reuters in Belgrade.

In a letter sent on Wednesday to EU enlargement chief Marta Kos, Montenegro's President Jakov Milatovic urged consideration of Montenegrin transporters' daily needs.

On Thursday, Montenegrin truckers lifted a blockade of the Adriatic port of Bar that had stoked fear of fuel shortages .

Cadez said Serbia was seeking a meeting with the European Commission to discuss solutions like special visas or permits.

Chief Michael Petawabano, the leader of the Cree community, said in a Facebook post that all community buildings, schools and offices were closed and that police were conducting an active investigation.

"We ask all community members to remain calm, stay indoors, and cooperate fully with police as they conduct their investigation. We will provide updates as more information becomes available," he said.

A spokesperson for Quebec's provincial police force said that two men in their 30s were found dead on Wednesday night and that the incident appeared to be related to organized crime and drugs.

Mass violence and shootings are rare in Canada, which has stricter gun laws than the neighboring U.S.

Levels of violence in Canada's remote and marginalized First Nations, where living conditions are often poor, are higher than in the rest of the country.

A January 18 high-speed rail crash in southern Spain killed 45 people while a derailment two days later in Catalonia killed a train driver, sparking political and public scrutiny of rail safety, maintenance and infrastructure spending.

Oscar Puente, who was heckled by opposition lawmakers shouting "resign" when he walked up to the podium, said maintenance spending per kilometre had risen 66% since 2017 and was now at or above the European average.

France invests slightly more while Italy spends less, he said.

European Commission data and industry experts have questioned whether maintenance investment has kept pace with Spain's expanding rail network and rising passenger numbers, a view Puente rejected.

According to him, Spain had invested about 30 billion euros ($36 billion) less in rail infrastructure between 2010 and 2018 than it would have if pre-financial crisis spending levels had been maintained.

The conservative People's Party held power from 2011 to 2018, implementing across-the-board spending cuts amid the EU's push for austerity while Spain faced a severe public debt crisis following a housing bubble bust.

Total annual rail investment has jumped to around 5 billion euros ($6 billion) in 2025 from roughly 1.7 billion euros in 2017, said Puente, of the ruling Socialist Party.

Afghanistan's humanitarian situation is deteriorating sharply, with millions pushed into hunger by the loss of remittances, limited job opportunities and a sharp reduction in international assistance.

The two-year programme, backed by the United Nations and Asian Development Bank, will support more than 151,000 families, including Afghan returnees from Iran and Pakistan as well as people affected by recent earthquakes and floods.

The director of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization, Qu Dongyu, said the project would address immediate food security needs but also aim to close Afghanistan's food production gap and create space for private sector recovery.

The FAO warned in a report that 17.4 million people are projected to face acute food insecurity in 2026, with 4.7 million affected by acute malnutrition.

More than 2.5 million Afghans have been expelled from Iran and Pakistan over the past year, according to the World Food Programme, swelling Afghanistan’s population by roughly a tenth and cutting off remittance income for many families.

Aid agencies say winter conditions, scarce jobs and funding shortfalls have further strained households, with the WFP warning that last year marked the biggest surge in malnutrition ever recorded in Afghanistan and that conditions are likely to worsen in 2026.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:06:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ETDF462DPBMBJNS6IX4QGDSYZM.jpg?auth=d128e61f47df173b45b8a5802aa3e88427e3317702d3d7fabcb1e7c43f46f8e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors widen fatal fire probe to local authorities, documents show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swiss-prosecutors-widen-fatal-fire-probe-local-authorities-documents-show-2026-01-29/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors have summoned a current and a former local official for questioning next month in a probe into a New Year bar fire that killed 40 people, and say the town's leaders could be liable for safety failures, documents showed on Thursday.

Prosecutors' inquiries initially focused on the French owners of "Le Constellation" bar, who are under investigation for crimes including suspected negligent homicide.

Most of those killed in the blaze in the Alpine resort of Crans-Montana were teenagers and some of the 116 people injured are still in hospital with severe burns.

Lawyers for the victims have sought an expansion of the probe to include local officials. Crans-Montana's mayor said the municipality had missed multiple annual safety checks.

Officials for the municipality did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It previously expressed regret over the tragedy and dropped its request to be a plaintiff in the case. That would have given the municipality the same status as the victims, access to case documents and, in theory, could have made it entitled to compensation.

The prosecutor's office for Valais declined comment.

The fire was one of the worst disasters in modern Swiss history and has tested relations with neighbouring Italy, which lost six of its nationals in the blaze. The tragedy has also sent chills through the lucrative tourism sector.

In their documents, prosecutors described the two new individuals called for hearings next month as "defendants" in the case, documents showed, and said past and present officials could be responsible for safety failings.

The head of security for Crans-Montana has been called for a hearing on February 6. The defendant's lawyer Nicolas Rivard said his client would reserve statements for prosecutors.

Prosecutors also called a former head of fire safety for the municipality on February 9, another document showed. Reuters could not immediately establish when the individual left the municipality or why.

"(They) will be present on the ninth in the state prosecutor's office," the individual's lawyer David Aioutz said.

Separately, Valais prosecutors sent a document on January 27 that formally rejected the town's request to be a plaintiff.

"There are...reasons to believe that the municipality failed in its duty to enforce the various regulations it was responsible for, intended to safeguard the lives and physical integrity of the bar's customers," it said.

"Failings could be attributable both to staff members and to members of the town council, past and present," it said.

Further hearings are also planned next month with bar owners Jacques and Jessica Moretti, who are not in custody . The couple has expressed grief over the tragedy and vowed to cooperate.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:07:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XLJ2GBF2JBIKPB4GLGL237WAKA.jpg?auth=f108747aa3467c796ac955038bbbd6f824ff4b74a561bd270bfba2e7c2bc88e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Russia has invited Ukraine's Zelenskiy to come to Moscow for peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-russia-has-invited-ukraines-zelenskiy-come-moscow-peace-talks-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that Russia had reiterated its invitation for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to come to Moscow for peace talks, as U.S.-led efforts to reach a deal to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine intensify.

The Kremlin made its statement as the two countries carried out their latest exchange of war dead, and hours after it declined to comment on rumours that Moscow and Kyiv have agreed to stop striking each other's energy infrastructure.

Washington-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi last weekend have injected some new momentum into efforts to clinch a peace deal, but profound differences persist between the Russian and Ukrainian negotiating stances. Fierce fighting is still raging, while Kyiv battles debilitating power outages caused by recent missile strikes.

An unnamed U.S. official told Axios on Saturday that Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin were "very close" to setting up a meeting after the U.S.-mediated talks.

A new round of Abu Dhabi talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiating delegations is scheduled for Sunday, and U.S. President Donald Trump - who is pushing for a deal to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two - said on Tuesday that "very good things" were happening in the process.

Major disagreements remain though, including over who gets what territory in any deal, the potential presence of international peacekeepers or monitors in post-war Ukraine, and the fate of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, cited by the Interfax news agency, said on Thursday that Moscow had not yet received a response to its invitation for Zelenskiy to come to Moscow.

Zelenskiy rejected a similar invitation last year, saying he could not to go to the capital of a nation that was firing missiles at his country every day. He suggested at the time that Putin come to Kyiv instead.

Any meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy would need to be well prepared and results-oriented, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said on Wednesday. He said Zelenskiy's safety would be guaranteed if he came to Moscow.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday described the two sides' disagreement over who gets what territory as the one central issue which was "very difficult" to resolve.

Russia wants Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the roughly 20% of Donetsk region which the Russian army does not control.

Kyiv has said it does not want to gift Moscow territory which Russia has not won on the battlefield and which could serve as a platform in future for Russian forces to push deeper into Ukraine.

Ushakov, the Kremlin aide, said on Thursday he didn't regard the land issue as the only key one left on the table.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov cast doubt on the viability of any security guarantees that Washington might be able to provide Ukraine as part of a deal, saying he doubted they could usher in an enduring peace if they were designed to keep Ukraine's current political leadership in power.

Meanwhile, Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya in southern Russia, called for more war rather than peace in comments that reflect a belief among hardliners that Moscow is winning on the battlefield.

"I believe the war must be taken to its conclusion," Kadyrov told reporters at the Kremlin.

Modest protests that began last month in Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic hardship unleashed long-suppressed wider grievances and swiftly escalated into the gravest existential threat to Iran's Shi'ite theocracy in nearly five decades, with protesters commonly calling for ruling clerics to step down.

Authorities cut internet access and stifled the unrest with overwhelming force that killed thousands, according to rights groups. Tehran blames "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the United States for the violence.

Within days, plainclothes security forces launched a campaign of widespread arrests accompanied by an intensified street presence based around checkpoints, according to five activists who spoke on condition of anonymity from inside Iran.

They said detainees had been placed in secret lockups.

"They are arresting everyone," one of the activists said. "No one knows where they are being taken or where they are being held. With these arrests and threats, they are trying to inject fear into society."

Similar accounts were given to Reuters by lawyers, medics, witnesses and two Iranian officials speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution by security services.

They said the roundups appeared aimed at preventing any serious revival of protests by spreading fear just as the clerical establishment faces rising external pressure.

Uncertainty over the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic has lingered since U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that an "armada" was heading toward the country but that he hoped he would not have to use it.

On Wednesday, however, he doubled down on his threats by demanding Iran negotiate curbs on its nuclear programme, warning that any future U.S. attack would be "far worse" than one day of airstrikes last June on three nuclear sites.

Multiple Western and Middle Eastern sources told Reuters this week that Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, although Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.

One of the activists said security forces were detaining not only people accused of involvement in the latest unrest but also those arrested during protests in previous years, "even if they had not participated this time, plus members of their families".

The latest death toll compiled by the U.S.-based HRANA rights group stands at 6,373 - 5,993 protesters, 214 security personnel, 113 under-18s and 53 bystanders. Arrests stand at 42,486, according to HRANA.

Judiciary officials have warned that “those committing sabotage, burning public property and involved in armed clashes with security forces” could face death sentences.

Two Iranian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to Reuters that thousands of arrests had been carried out in the past few days.

They said many detainees were being held in unofficial detention sites, "including warehouses and other improvised locations", and the judiciary was acting quickly to process cases.

Iranian authorities declined to comment publicly on the number of arrests, or say where the unrest-related detainees were held. Authorities said on January 21 that 3,117 were killed in the unrest, including 2,427 civilians and security personnel.

Amnesty International reported on January 23 that "sweeping arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, bans on gatherings and attacks to silence families of victims mark the suffocating militarisation imposed in Iran by the Islamic Republic’s authorities in the aftermath of protest massacres".

Arrests are continuing across the sprawling country, from small towns to the capital, witnesses and activists said.

"They arrested my brother and my cousin a few days ago,” said a resident of northwestern Iran who asked not to be named.

"They stormed our home in plainclothes, searched the entire house, and took all the laptops and mobile phones. They warned us that if we make this public, they will arrest all of us."

More than 60% of Iran's 92 million people are under the age of 30. Although the latest protests were snuffed out by the security forces, clerical rulers will eventually risk more demonstrations if the heavy repression persists, according to rights activists.

Three Iranian lawyers told Reuters that dozens of families had approached them in recent days seeking help for relatives who had been detained.

"Many families are coming to us asking for legal assistance for their detained children,” one lawyer said. "Some of those arrested are under 18 - boys and girls."

Human rights groups have long said Iranian security organs use informal detention sites during periods of serious unrest, holding detainees without access to lawyers or family members for extended periods.

Five doctors told Reuters that protesters wounded during protests had been removed from hospitals by security forces and dozens of doctors had been summoned by authorities or warned against helping injured demonstrators.

Prison authorities denied holding wounded protesters.

"They have arrested many doctors and nurses who helped wounded protesters...They are arresting everyone," said one of the doctors.

Families of five detainees told Reuters the lack of information about their whereabouts itself had become a form of punishment.

"We don’t know where they are, whether they are still alive, or when we’ll see them,” said an Iranian man whose daughter was arrested.

"They took my child as if they were arresting a terrorist. My child protested because all young people (just) want to have a better life. My child is a young person who only took part in protests."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:07:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KF4KTQHCGRKELF4N5X635Q6GII.jpg?auth=e05cfdf6de4c77800a4ad9abb8351b0b963ae93c04779475a6406d1e22102894&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany aims to confiscate property seized in Lebanon ex-central bank chief probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germany-aims-confiscate-property-seized-lebanon-ex-central-bank-chief-probe-2026-01-29/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 29 (Reuters) - German prosecutors have applied to a court to confiscate some 35 million euros ($42 million) worth of property they had seized in a money laundering investigation into the former governor of Lebanon's central bank and other defendants.

Several European countries including France, Germany and Luxembourg have been investigating whether tens of millions of dollars of the funds allegedly embezzled from the central bank were laundered in Europe.

The investigation is linked to Forry Associates, a company controlled by the brother of former Lebanese central banker Riad Salameh. The brothers - who deny any wrongdoing - were accused of using Forry to divert $330 million in public funds through commissions.

"My lawyer will challenge the case and will prove that these investments are of my own funds," Salameh told Reuters when asked to comment.

The case is separate from an indictmen t in Lebanon of Salameh, who headed the Lebanese Central Bank for three decades, and two lawyers on charges including embezzlement of public funds, forgery and illicit enrichment.

The banker was detained for some 13 months over alleged financial crimes committed during his tenure and released after paying $14 million record bail. He remains in Lebanon, is subject to a travel ban and has denied any wrongdoing.

As part of an extensive money laundering investigation against the ex-governor and four other defendants which started in mid-2021, the properties in Munich and Hamburg and shares in a real estate company in Duesseldorf have been seized, the Munich prosecutors said in a statement.

They added that the total value was about 35 million euros.

"In January 2026, the Munich prosecutor's office applied to the Munich regional court for the confiscation of the seized real estate and company shares," said the prosecutors.

The prosecutors' office could not say what would happen to the assets if the court granted the confiscation.

The Munich prosecutor's office said in February 2024 it had seized three commercial properties in Munich and Hamburg with a total value of about 28 million euros, and shares worth about seven million euros in a Duesseldorf-based property company, as part of the case.

Lebanese authorities have said they want to reclaim the confiscated assets to help recapitalize state coffers drained in the lead-up to the country’s 2019 financial collapse.

The preliminary investigation has been provisionally suspended due to the unknown whereabouts of the suspects, said the prosecutors in their statement, adding there was a presumption of innocence until any decision was made.

"President Trump and I, along with others in the administration, have recognised that certain improvements could and should be made. That's exactly what I'm doing here," he told reporters after the deaths in the northern city of Minneapolis.

Homan was speaking for the first time since the president sent him to Minneapolis to calm furious protests over the killing by federal agents of 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti.

The border czar said federal agents were trying to act professionally but added: "If they don't, they'll be dealt with like any other federal agency. We have standards of conduct."

Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, was shot multiple times on Saturday after being forced to the ground by camouflaged officers in a scuffle captured on video. His death came just weeks after federal agents shot dead fellow Minneapolis resident Renée Good.

"We're going to make sure we do targeted enforcement operations and I'll say it again: we are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter," Homan told the news conference.

"President Trump wants this fixed. And I'm going to fix it – with your help," he added.

Homan said immigration enforcement would reduce the number of officers in Minnesota but suggested this would happen only after "cooperation" from state officials.

But the clatter of single and double-deck trams along this century-and-a-half-old line – a source of civic pride and transport alike for tens of thousands of daily commuters in Egypt's second city – is soon to be stopped.

Next week, authorities are starting a sweeping renovation aimed at replacing the nearly 14-kilometer (9-mile) line's worn but beloved trams with a digitally controlled light rail system, one of the latest projects in a broader push to revamp Egypt’s road and rail networks under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

The National Authority for Tunnels says the renovations should roughly double current speed, cutting end-to-end travel time along a similar route by over half an hour, and boost passenger capacity.

While some commuters welcome the renovation plan, others worry that construction could ensnarl narrow streets, that ticket prices could jump, or that works, planned over two years, might have to be extended.

Some are mourning the loss of one of the Mediterranean city's most treasured features.

"It's not just a means of transport," said Fatma Hussein, 63, a retired agricultural engineer who has ridden the tram since her school days. "It's our memories ... our history. You can develop it, but why stop it? Why deprive employees, students and the people who use it all the time?"

Launched in the 1860s, the Raml line is a rare holdout of double-decker trams. Wide carriage windows frame Alexandria’s tree-lined streets, dilapidated apartment blocks and historic villas.

With standard tickets costing just five Egyptian pounds (about $0.10), it also remains an affordable option for workers, students and pensioners amid rising living costs.

Alexandrian novelist Alaa Khaled, who grew up near the tramline, recalls how he used to make rides into a game with his father, climbing between the tram's floors to see the city from different angles.

"Even now, I still take the whole journey and gaze at the villas and trees as a window onto the history of the city, or just sit down and read," he said.

Architect and urban mobility specialist Yasmin Kandil said she worried that the light rail project, which includes elevating parts of the line to bypass intersections, will prioritise vehicles and speed while distorting the city's aesthetics.

Residents' concerns have been fuelled by the recent suspension of the local Abu Qir rail line for conversion into a metro line, which commuters say worsened congestion and left travellers scrambling for alternatives.

Authorities say they will deploy replacement buses during the construction of the light rail to limit disruption. The National Authority for Tunnels, which manages the tram and its renovation, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The European Investment Bank is providing 138 million euros ($165 million) for the project and lists the total cost at about 592 million euros ($708 million). France’s development agency is also providing financing.

Alexandria has another tram line, the City Line, which has newer trams and has yet to be slated for renovations.

But the loss of the Raml line will be "painful", said 52-year-old tram driver Mahmoud Ramadan, who has worked on the tram network since 1997 and said he met his wife on the job.

"Not everyone will understand," he said. "It's your home and your life for 30 years.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:03:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PJGZF4XODNOI3NWN3EGGA5HSX4.jpg?auth=60ca5cdc8eeca1a99c8cdba2b2fa83aeca0dc9c896f08694b9eaf1331124bdba&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hegseth expected to skip NATO ministers' meeting next month, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hegseth-expected-skip-nato-ministers-meeting-next-month-sources-say-2026-01-29/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is not expected to attend a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels next month, a U.S. official and a NATO diplomat told Reuters on Thursday.

Here are five reasons why:

Since becoming Japan's first female prime minister in October, Takaichi has won strong approval ratings. Despite a slip ahead of the election, several polls still put her support rate above 60%.

Backing for her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), however, trails far behind at about 35%, fuelling doubts whether Takaichi's personal appeal will translate into votes for LDP candidates contesting the 465 seats at stake.

Polling shows Takaichi's strongest backing comes from younger voters rather than the older generations that have long formed the LDP’s electoral backbone. Recent surveys put her approval rating among voters under 30 more than 20 points higher than among those in their 70s.

But younger Japanese tend to vote far less than their older peers. For example, in the October 2024 lower house election in Tokyo, the capital, just 36% of those aged 21 to 24 voted, versus 71% of those aged 70 to 74.

For the first time in 26 years, the LDP is fighting a national election without former coalition partner Komeito, a party linked to the lay Buddhist Soka Gakkai movement, which says it has at least 8 million members in Japan.

Komeito's vote mobilisation has delivered dozens of seats to the LDP in past elections, particularly in urban areas. This time, it has joined the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan in a centrist bloc, potentially redirecting millions of votes away from the LDP.

The slate of as many as 190 candidates fielded by the far-right Sanseito party is the third largest in the fray, as the party looks to add to the two seats it has now.

Sanseito has targeted conservative LDP voters with pledges to toughen immigration and tackle rising prices. Its push follows a breakout performance in July's upper house election when it bled support from the LDP to win 14 seats.

Takaichi's mid-winter scheduling of the election breaks with a convention of polls held in milder months, particularly in autumn.

This is only the third February lower house election in the post-war era and the first since 1990. Heavy snowfall blanketing northern Japan could depress turnout and disrupt campaigning, particularly in rural areas, adding uncertainty in an already volatile race.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:10:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UE2BV23R3BIMVDUKQAMBHO2CD4.jpg?auth=915b24fcfbc402f2defc894a7a879f6f5fe339a16414ea04a7370f0e40cc0ab5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India should consider age-based curbs on social media, adviser says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-should-consider-age-based-limits-social-media-access-economic-adviser-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - India's chief economic adviser proposed age-based limits on access to social media platforms he said were "predatory" in their approach to keeping users online, signalling a potential blow to Meta and YouTube in their largest user market.

Such a shift would pull India in line with a growing global trend , after Australia became the first nation last year to ban social media for children younger than 16.

On Monday, France's National Assembly backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media and Britain, Denmark and Greece are studying the issue.

The adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, recommended in India's annual economic survey that families promote screen-time limits, device-free hours and shared offline activities.

"Policies on age-based access limits may be considered, as younger users are more vulnerable to compulsive use and harmful content," he wrote in the survey, which was published on Thursday.

"Platforms should be made responsible for enforcing age verification and age-appropriate defaults."

The recommendations are not binding, but are reflected in policy discussions in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Past recommendations have prompted tax reforms, easing rules on Chinese investment and stronger digital infrastructure.

India, the world's No. 2 smartphone market with 750 million devices and a billion internet users, is a key growth market for social media apps, and does not set a minimum age for access.

Research firm DataReportal says YouTube has 500 million users in India, Facebook 403 million, while Instagram has 481 million.

Facebook operator Meta (META.O) , opens new tab , YouTube-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta has previously said it backs laws for parental oversight while adding: "Governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites."

New Delhi has repeatedly clashed with social media companies like Meta and X over the years over content moderation, local data storage, user safety and not complying with content takedown orders promptly.

In a press briefing, Nageswaran on Thursday called the platforms "predatory" in their approach to maximise user engagement and time spent by users, adding that "such algorithms are particularly targeted at youngsters between the ages of 15 and 24."

Cheap telecom data plans have boosted use of social media apps in recent years, with 75% of young smartphone users on the apps, the survey report said.

"Digital addiction negatively affects academic performance and workplace productivity due to distractions, 'sleep debt', and reduced focus," Nageswaran added.

The recommendation follows growing efforts among Indian states to rein in screen time for young people.

The coastal state of Goa and the southern state of Andhra Pradesh have said they are studying Australia's regulatory framework, with an eye to similar bans for children.

"Trust in social media is breaking down," Nara Lokesh, the infotech minister in Andhra Pradesh, wrote on X on Thursday, saying the state would study legal frameworks for age-appropriate access.

"Children are slipping into relentless usage, affecting their attention spans and education."

Nageswaran said "we are very happy" the two states are considering restrictions for children.

Some activists and tech experts have called for measures to help children and parents develop healthy and safe social media usage, saying that age-based curbs do not work as children can bypass them with fake identification documents.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:10:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TOGRB4KN35IR5FBTH3H6XN32B4.jpg?auth=9287b2d7d311bb673b553568c4c7aa54011dc67828590c2c45f89e3ec0091cb6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia is ready to evacuate its staff from Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant if necessary, TASS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-is-ready-evacuate-its-staff-irans-bushehr-nuclear-plant-if-necessary-tass-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Russia is ready to evacuate its staff from Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant if necessary, Alexei Likhachev, the head of Russia's state nuclear corporation, was cited as saying on Thursday by the state news agency TASS.

President Vladimir Putin said last year that hundreds of Russians were working at the facility, Iran's only operating nuclear power plant, which Moscow built for Iran.

More nuclear facilities are currently being built at the Bushehr site by Russia.

A U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities in June last year did not target Bushehr. Likhachev warned at the time that an attack on the site could trigger a catastrophe comparable to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

On Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to come to the table and make a deal renouncing nuclear weapons, or the next U.S. attack would be far worse.

Likhachev was quoted as saying: "We sincerely hope that the parties to the conflict will uphold their commitments regarding the inviolability of this territory (Bushehr).

"But, as they say, we are keeping our finger on the pulse and, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence, we will be ready to carry out evacuation measures if necessary."

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, and Russia says it supports Tehran's right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:11:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B3X5K3CYBFPG7FRK3B6BI7X4IQ.jpg?auth=d701f6a3aa341163cd2264b3de8fe952eb2986b6515a87e05a9e1dd82c99c75b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hegseth expected to skip NATO ministers' meeting next month, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hegseth-expected-skip-nato-ministers-meeting-next-month-sources-say-2026-01-29/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is not expected to attend a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels next month, a U.S. official and a NATO diplomat told Reuters on Thursday.

Its second moon claim was featured in a post that garnered more than 16,000 reactions. The claim was also widely circulated on X , with some posts garnering more than 3 million views.

To illustrate this claim, the posts feature an image generated by artificial intelligence showing the Earth with two moons of roughly the same size, suggesting the existence of a new heavenly body similar to the Moon currently in orbit around our planet.

The confusion seems to hail from the discovery made last July by researchers at the Complutense University in Madrid of a small asteroid baptised "2025 PN7". This asteroid was first spotted through the Pan-STARRS1 telescope at the Observatory in Haleakala, Hawaii. While it has an Earth-like orbit, that does not make it a “temporary second moon”.

Our team spoke to Éric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the Côte d’Azur Observatory:

"'2025 PN7' isn’t a new moon. A moon orbits around a planet that it is linked to by gravity, like our moon that orbits Earth. This asteroid, however, is not orbiting our planet. It is what is called a "quasi-moon" or a "quasi-satellite": it orbits the sun, but its trajectory follows Earth’s trajectory, which gives the impression that it is following it."

According to NASA , "moons orbit planets and dwarf planets. They also orbit asteroids". 2025 PN7, on the other hand, doesn’t orbit the Earth; it orbits the sun (see the image below or check out NASA’s Small-Body Database Lookup (SBDB) , which has information about so-called small bodies within our solar system).

The asteroid, which has a diameter of around 19 metres, isn’t gravitationally linked to the Earth – unlike the moon. It doesn’t have any impact on our planet – for example, it has no bearing on the tides, unlike our moon. It also isn’t visible to the naked eye from Earth.

Lagadec says that the confusion stems largely from images shared by some social media users, which depict the asteroid as a similar size to our moon. In reality, our moon has a diameter of around 3,400 kilometres, while 2025 PN7’s diameter is only 19 metres .

"This type of image can feed into conspiracy theories about the moon,” Lagadec said.

"Repression cannot go unanswered," foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X. "Any regime that kills thousands of its own people is working toward its own demise."

"This will put them on the same footing with al-Qaeda, Hamas, Daesh," Kallas said earlier, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State (IS) group. "If you act as a terrorist, you should also be treated as a terrorist."

The 27-nation bloc on Thursday also sanctioned 15 Iranian officials, including top commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, over the violent crackdown on protesters that has left thousands dead .

Iran had no immediate comment, but it has criticised Europe in recent days as it considered the move. Other countries, including the US and Canada, have designated the Guard as a terrorist organisation.

The latest EU measures, while largely symbolic, add to international pressures on the Islamic Republic, which faces a threat of military action from US President Donald Trump in response to the killing of peaceful demonstrators and over possible mass executions.

The American military has moved the USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers into the Mideast. It remains unclear whether Trump will decide to use force.

Sansal, who was pardoned by Algeria's president last November after spending a year in jail, joins the 40 lifelong members of the Académie, traditionally known as the " immortels " (immortals).

The writer was a late contender for the seat left vacant by the late lawyer and writer Jean-Denis Bredin, after no candidate won a majority in an earlier vote in December.

Other candidates included Belgian poet Philippe Leuckx.

Known as the guardian of the French language , the Académie is tasked with maintaining the language's purity and publishes an official dictionary.

In early December, the Académie honoured Sansal at a ceremony where he received the international literary award the Cino del Duca World Prize for his work.

In 2015, he won the Académie's Grand Prix du Roman for his book "2084: The End of the World", a dystopian novel inspired by George Orwell's "1984" and set in an Islamist totalitarian world in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust.

Sansal's novels warning of the risks of creeping authoritarianism but also Islamisation have made him a favourite on the right in France but deeply unpopular with the authorities in his country of birth.

Algeria handed Sansal a five-year jail term in March on charges of undermining its territorial integrity after arresting him in November last year on arrival from France.

His detention was seen by supporters as a consequence of a political row between Algeria and France over sovereignty of the territory of the Western Sahara , where Paris backs the claim of Algiers' north African rival Morocco .

Weeks before his arrest, Sansal told a far-right French media outlet that France had unjustly transferred Moroccan territory to Algeria during the 1830-1962 colonial period.

Even after Sansal's release, prominent French sports journalist Christophe Gleizes remains in an Algerian prison, sentenced to seven years for "glorifying terrorism" for having sought to interview an outlawed group.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:07:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4e96d35a-fd2a-11f0-a1bb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-943E4RE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Merz says Germany exploring shared nuclear umbrella with European allies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/merz-says-germany-exploring-shared-nuclear-umbrella-with-european-allies-2026-01-29/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 29 (Reuters) - European nations are starting to discuss ideas around a shared nuclear umbrella to complement existing security arrangements with the U.S., German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said, amid growing talk in Germany of developing its own nuclear defences.

Merz, speaking at a time of increased transatlantic tensions as U.S. President Donald Trump upends traditional alliances, said the talks were only at an initial stage and no decision was imminent.

"We know that we have to reach a number of strategic and military policy decisions, but at the moment, the time is not ripe," he told reporters on Thursday.

Germany is currently banned from developing a nuclear weapon of its own under the so-called Four Plus Two agreement that opened the way for the country's reunification in 1990 as well as under a landmark nuclear non-proliferation treaty that Germany signed in 1969.

Merz said Germany's treaty obligations did not prevent it from discussing joint solutions with partners, including Britain and France, the only European powers which have a nuclear arsenal.

"These talks are taking place. They are also not in conflict with nuclear-sharing with the United States of America," he said.

European nations have long relied heavily on the United States, including its large nuclear arsenal, for their defence but have been increasing military spending, partly in response to sharp criticism from the Trump administration.

Trump has rattled Washington's European allies with his talk of acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally, and his threat, later rescinded, to impose tariffs on countries that stood in his way.

He has also suggested in the past that the U.S. would not help protect countries that failed to spend enough on their own defence.

Merz's comments were echoed by the head of the parliamentary defence committee, Thomas Roewekamp, who said Germany had the technical capacity which could be used in developing a European nuclear weapon.

"We do not have missiles or warheads, but we do have a significant technological advantage that we could contribute to a joint European initiative," Roewekamp, from Merz's centre-right Christian Democratic Union party, told Germany's Welt TV.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:03:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UV2Z3CG7CJOLXMMJELNHY4OVO4.jpg?auth=69a6ec5a33dfb297ab4168362665dd84d6bf1ff462225c7a2a6ffa98ceca136a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says U.S. to open Venezuela airspace after talk with acting president</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-says-us-open-venezuela-airspace-after-talk-with-acting-president-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he planned on opening up Venezuela's air space after a discussion on Thursday with the country's acting president Delcy Rodríguez.

Ai, speaking to Reuters in London, said he has previously argued that Western leaders visiting China should openly denounce the country's human rights abuses before striking business deals with the world's second-largest economy.

"But today I changed my mind, completely," Ai said. "The West (is) not even (in a) position to accuse China. (They must) just check on their record (of) what they did on international human rights, (their) freedom of speech record."

Ai's remarks come as Keir Starmer makes a four-day visit to China , the first by a UK leader in eight years, aimed at improving relations despite concerns over espionage and human rights.

Ai, in London hosting events for his new book "Censorship", said Western leaders raising issues such as human rights, free speech and censorship would be seen as deeply hypocritical and would "make people laugh".

He pointed to how the West handled the case of Julian Assange, who returned to Australia in June 2024 after a plea deal ended his imprisonment and a 14-year legal battle over the release of classified U.S. military files.

As he arrived in Beijing on Wednesday, Starmer said he would "raise the issues that need to be raised" on human rights with China's president, Xi Jinping, including the case of Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen convicted in December of national security crimes.

Ai said he has also faced censorship in the West, including a London gallery's decision to postpone one of his exhibitions in 2023 over a social media post about the war in Gaza.

"I think they (Western leaders) are shy even to talk about those things (human rights)," Ai said.

Nevertheless, Ai said that, based on business interests, Starmer's decision to visit to China was "rational and practical". He called it a "very good move" that would benefit Britain and be well received in China.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:03:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YJ7QQZ7CCZOATPGK6D3PRRCEJU.jpg?auth=38fbd0011c46ef438674f6f3726e582a808bf56204861342551c2dfd85fff728&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico's Sheinbaum, Trump talk trade as USMCA review approaches</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/mexicos-sheinbaum-says-she-had-productive-call-with-trump-trade-2026-01-29/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke on Thursday about trade and security, as both governments geared up for high-stakes negotiations later this year about their trilateral trade deal with Canada.

Both leaders said the call was productive.

The call follows a Wednesday meeting in Washington between Sheinbaum's economy chief and the U.S. trade representative, who agreed to begin formal discussions on possible reforms to the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

"There is nothing concrete, but it is coming along very well," Sheinbaum said about the trade deal in her morning press conference. She noted progress on the Trump administration's demand that Mexico address what Washington calls "non-tariff barriers" to trade.

Trump, in a Truth Social post, praised Sheinbaum as Mexico's "wonderful and highly intelligent leader." He said the conversation went well.

Under the trilateral trade deal, which was negotiated during Trump's first term, the U.S., Mexico and Canada must launch a joint review of the trade pact by July 1, its sixth anniversary, to confirm their intention to renew it for 16 years or make modifications.

The USMCA deal replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020 and is a backbone of Mexico's economy. It has shielded Mexico from the bulk of Trump's tariffs, as goods that comply with its rules of origin can enter the U.S. duty-free.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, however, has said the deal has "shortcomings," and is not equipped to deal with surges of exports and investment from non-market economies such as China into the region. Trump this month said the USMCA was "irrelevant" for the U.S. despite a highly integrated North American economy.

While the presidents did not go into detail about what they discussed regarding security, Sheinbaum said both agreed things are going "very well."

Washington's desires for a more active role combating drug cartels in Mexican territory - resisted by Sheinbaum who cites Mexico's opposition to foreign interference in law enforcement - have at times been a sticking point in trade talks.

The FBI's reported involvement in arresting Canadian former snowboarder Ryan Wedding on drug charges in Mexico last week has further heightened tension between the U.S. and Mexico on the issue of security.

Two topics - Cuba and critical minerals - were not brought up on the call, said Sheinbaum. She stressed, however, that the two governments are discussing the issues.

Mexico's oil shipments to Cuba have come under scrutiny in Washington after Trump vowed to stop the flow of oil and money to Cuba from Venezuela, until recently Cuba's other main supplier of crude oil.

Sheinbaum this week appeared to acknowledge that Mexico had halted a planned shipment to Cuba, but said decisions about shipments are a sovereign matter and that Mexico would continue to provide humanitarian aid to Cuba in the form of oil.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:03:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FMU6RP6U4JJYRD2W4TQWHZWATU.jpg?auth=54176e7ac35178a7d57f9cb0829dea90cc6f9224376691411ec9f1595136b205&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's NSA pick endorses post-9/11 surveillance powers, stays vague on warrants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-nsa-pick-endorses-post-911-surveillance-powers-stays-vague-warrants-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Army Lieutenant General Joshua Rudd, President Donald Trump 's pick to head the National Security Agency, said on Thursday he is in favor of keeping broad foreign surveillance powers introduced following the September 11, 2001, attacks.

But when it came to whether he would seek a warrant before turning those powers against Americans, Rudd had less to say at his confirmation hearing before a U.S. Senate committee.

Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows the NSA to surveil foreigners abroad using data drawn from U.S. digital infrastructure.

The provision for years has caused anxieties over domestic surveillance because it can allow the NSA's law enforcement counterparts to mine the massive data trove without a warrant. A 2024 proposal to require them to get a judicial sign-off before searching the data failed in the House of Representatives by a single vote.

With the power up for congressional renewal in April, the contours of Section 702's powers are again being put up for debate.

Rudd endorsed Section 702 - enacted as part of changes in U.S. intelligence policies following the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States - during testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

"It's indispensable," Rudd told lawmakers. "It's critical to mission outcomes."

Asked by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden whether he would insist on a judicial warrant before targeting people in the United States for surveillance, Rudd said that "if confirmed, I will absolutely commit to executing the foreign intelligence mission of the NSA in accordance with the authorities that it has been given and in accordance with all applicable laws."

Wyden expressed dissatisfaction, telling Rudd, "That is about as vague as anything I've heard on the subject."

When Republican Senator John Cornyn returned to the matter of seeking warrants at the end of the hearing, Rudd stuck to his noncommittal tone.

"That's certainly something I'd like to take a deeper look at," Rudd said.

Rudd, nominated by Trump last month, currently serves as the No. 2 at the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command, which is responsible for U.S. forces in the greater Pacific region. The NSA is an agency within the Defense Department tasked with monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for global intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:04:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DIM6L3CYG5MTJKSCDDML4I6AJM.jpg?auth=9ad75421842b384e9f46bfda9b43d29de7a0d0fa21cd010906918c22567870c1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>American Airlines plans to resume US flights to Venezuela pending government approval</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/american-airlines-plans-resume-us-flights-venezuela-pending-government-approval-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - American Airlines said Thursday the U.S. carrier plans to resume daily service to Venezuela pending government approval and subject to security assessments just weeks after the U.S. military seized the country's leader.

Although Guterres did not reference any particular country, his remarks come a week after U.S. President Donald Trump launched his Board of Peace. This was initially designed to cement Gaza's rocky ceasefire, but Trump foresees it taking a wider role, an approach that worries some global powers.

"Global problems will not be solved by one power calling the shots. Nor will they be solved by two powers carving the world into rival spheres of influence," Guterres told a press conference to mark the start of his 10th and final year in office.

Trump, who began his second term a year ago, is resuscitating what much of the international community had long spurned as an outdated worldview – spheres of influence carved out by the big powers. He has vowed to restore U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Guterres’ second five-year term has been marked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine , the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the conflict in Sudan, the war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip, a rapid end to Syria's civil war and the U.S. capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro.

"International law is trampled. Cooperation is eroding. And multilateral institutions are under assault on many fronts," said Guterres. "Impunity is driving today’s conflicts – fueling escalation, widening mistrust, and kicking the doors open for powerful spoilers to enter from every direction."

Guterres spoke to reporters amid a cash crisis as the world body's largest contributor - the United States - has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies and refused to make mandatory payments to the U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets. He launched a reform task force in March, known as UN80, which seeks to cut costs and improve efficiency.

Trump has described the U.N. as having "great potential" but said it is not fulfilling that, slamming it for failing to support American-led peace efforts.

"Despite all the hurdles, the United Nations is acting to give life to our shared values," Guterres said. "And we won’t give up. We are pushing for peace – just and sustainable peace rooted in international law. Peace that addresses root causes. Peace that endures beyond the signing of an agreement."

Guterres also had a warning for the world on technology. He has made pushing for a governance framework for artificial intelligence a priority.

"We are witnessing perhaps the greatest transfer of power of our times – not from governments to people, but from governments to private technology companies," he said. "When technologies that shape behavior, elections, markets, and even conflicts operate without guardrails, the reaction is not innovation, it is instability."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:04:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SXN7YX5CRFPVBFCW3MJOS4YYGI.jpg?auth=d6b651bbb7e08fadf6d18efb5a3beb717345f0717d9c65db4bb30679be3dac14&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil police arrest suspect with ties to Islamic State, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-police-arrest-suspect-with-ties-islamic-state-source-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Brazil's federal police arrested on Thursday a suspect with ties to Islamic State accused of preparing a suicide attack, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The company was still scrambling Thursday to explain the deal for a tool to identify and track foreigners on US soil, which it says was signed by an arm's-length subsidiary set up to bid on classified US government work, with limited oversight from HQ in France.

Nevertheless, "according to the information made known to the group, that contract awarded in December 2025 is not currently being fulfilled", Capgemini told AFP by email.

An internal message sent to Capgemini staff Wednesday and seen by AFP said that the contract was "subject to legal challenge" without providing details, adding that the US arm had "launched a process of examining the contents of this contract".

The killings of two people – Renée Good and Alex Pretti – by ICE and border patrol (CBP) agents in Minneapolis have made world headlines in recent weeks, provoking widespread condemnation of the American agency.

Capgemini, which operates in around 50 countries worldwide and belongs to the CAC40 group of France's largest listed companies, has called an extraordinary board meeting for this weekend after being the subject of pointed questions in parliament and calls for transparency from the government.

"I've been at Capgemini for 32 years and I've never seen a crisis situation like this one," CFDT union delegate Frédéric Boloré told AFP. "It's a huge shock for employees."

Shares in the group fell 2.8 percent to €127.85 ($152.70), by close of trading in Paris Thursday, and are 10 percent lower than at the start of the year.

Campaign group Multinationals Observatory last week revealed the ICE contract, with further details reported by broadcaster France 2.

Chief executive Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn Sunday that bosses "were recently made aware, through public sources" of the contract with Capgemini Government Solutions (CGS), the US subsidiary.

At CGS, "decision making is separate, networks are firewalled, and the Capgemini group cannot access any classified information (or) classified contracts", Ezzat added.

Public US government documents show that the ICE-CGS contract signed on December 18 is worth $4.8 million.

"I think the least we can expect of a French company... is to be transparent about the contracts it has with ICE, but perhaps also to call them into question," Economy Minister Roland Lescure told journalists in Paris Thursday.

Ezzat acknowledged in his LinkedIn message that "the nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm".

But CGT union representative Benjamin Girard said the ICE contract's existence was not a "revelation" to him.

"Capgemini works with government organisations playing a part in migration policies that are currently quite authoritarian," he said.

In a letter to CEO Ezzat, CGT representatives said that the ICE deal was "not only contrary to Capgemini's stated values, but makes our company an active accomplice in serious human rights violations".

France 2 has reported that the company has other contracts in the US tied to surveillance of sites used for detention and transport of arrested foreigners.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:06:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/580b98f6-fd36-11f0-82b8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/4f16a6f226e456bb1456e67f32b988d53cdce7bc.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief 'deeply concerned' by escalation of violence in South Sudan, spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-chief-deeply-concerned-by-escalation-violence-south-sudan-spokesperson-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>Jan 29 (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is "deeply concerned" by continued escalation of violence in South Sudan, a spokesperson said on Thursday, while reiterating the world body chief's call to protect civilians.

The use of drones by the fighters from Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in recent attacks has marked a significant escalation in the violence in the region, military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Sani Uba said.

The militants struck the Sabon Gari base before dawn, storming the perimeter and briefly breaching part of the facility, Uba said.

While they were fighting, their drone bombardment destroyed several military vehicles, including an excavator and a low-bed trailer, he added.

The army regained control after reinforcements arrived, repelled the attack and were pursuing the militants, Uba said.

Some soldiers and Civilian Joint Task Force members "paid the supreme price," he said, without giving details on the numbers.

Two security sources told Reuters at least nine soldiers and two task force members were killed, with around 16 others wounded.

Nigeria's military has pushed deeper into insurgent strongholds in the northeast this year as part of a renewed offensive against militant groups.

But despite repeated operations, Boko Haram and its splinter faction ISWAP continue to mount large-scale attacks, exploiting difficult terrain, porous borders and a weak state presence across parts of the arid northeast.

Borno, where Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters have intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:11:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S. sends additional warship to Middle East amid Iran tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-sends-additional-warship-middle-east-amid-iran-tensions-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy has sent an additional warship to the Middle East, a U.S. official told Reuters on Thursday, amid a large military buildup in the region and soaring tensions.

Plainclothes Iranian security forces have rounded up thousands of people in a campaign of mass arrests and intimidation to deter further protests after crushing the bloodiest unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, sources told Reuters .

Modest protests that began last month in Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic hardship unleashed long-suppressed wider grievances and swiftly escalated into the gravest existential threat to Iran's Shi'ite theocracy in nearly five decades, with protesters commonly calling for ruling clerics to step down.

Authorities cut internet access and stifled the unrest with overwhelming force that killed thousands, according to rights groups. Tehran blames "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the United States for the violence.

The latest death toll compiled by the U.S.-based HRANA rights group stands at 6,373. Arrests stand at 42,486, according to HRANA.

The IOC told Reuters in a statement, which was supported by the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations and the Winter Olympic Federations, about its concerns for the situation facing Iranian athletes.

"At this moment in time, we are particularly concerned about the situation of Iranian athletes impacted by the events unfolding in their country - as we are with all athletes who face conflict and tragedies elsewhere in the world," the IOC said.

"Unfortunately, these situations are more regularly brought to our attention due to the increasingly divided world in which we live.

"We have to be realistic about the IOC's ability to directly influence global and national affairs. At the same time, we will continue to work with our Olympic stakeholders to help where we can, often through quiet sport diplomacy."

Iran International, a Persian-language satellite television channel and multilingual digital news operation based in London, reported last week that a 19-year-old wrestler, Shahab Fallahpour, was killed by security forces during demonstrations in the southwestern city of Andimeshk.

United World Wrestling said it had also been alerted to concerns over the safety of several Iranian wrestlers.

"United World Wrestling has received multiple communications regarding the situation of four Iranian wrestlers...," the international governing body for the sport said.

"As a sporting organisation, UWW is not in a position to directly influence global or national affairs.

"However, we are particularly concerned about the situation of Iranian athletes impacted by the events unfolding in their country, as we are with all athletes worldwide who are affected by conflict and tragedy.

"UWW is seeking further reliable information and reiterates its commitment to the protection of athletes and respect for fundamental sporting values."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:51:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MPZB5T25UZLJTMVY75KFLP5ABI.jpg?auth=6f5e780d35f4b5914acb97ca619717d96504be2c5f0878657cb2c6d79cc7e80c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hegseth tells Trump Pentagon is prepared on Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hegseth-tells-trump-pentagon-is-prepared-iran-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday the U.S. military will be prepared to carry out whatever President Donald Trump decides on Iran to ensure Tehran does not pursue nuclear weapons capability.

With a large U.S. military force gathered in the region, Hegseth was asked by Trump at a cabinet meeting to comment on the situation.

"They should not pursue nuclear capabilities. We will be prepared to deliver whatever this president expects of the War Department," Hegseth said, referring to the Trump administration's unofficial renaming of the Defense Department.

U.S. officials say Trump is reviewing his options but has not decided whether to strike Iran.

U.S.-Iranian tensions soared following a bloody crackdown on protests across Iran by its clerical authorities in recent weeks.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations over economic privations and political repression have since abated.

He has said the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear program after the June airstrikes by Israeli and U.S. forces on key nuclear installations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:54:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HFXVBXSLDZPPPIJN4A2PUVJRAQ.jpg?auth=1a0df4661c7a5227cefa67bc937f8534715bba0116da453e8a658ad3a5917e73&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Warships and fighter jets: What is the 'massive' US armada on its way to Iran?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260129-warships-fighter-jets-what-is-massive-us-armada-on-way-to-iran</link><description>US President Trump Donald Trump amped up the pressure on Iran on Wednesday, posting on the Truth Social platform that “ A massive Armada is heading to Iran .”

The deployment comes a month after a sharp rise in the cost of living and the plummeting rial currency prompted protests that swiftly evolved into a crisis of legitimacy for the country's clerical leadership.

The US strike group is "currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability", US Central Command said in a post on X . The strike group was in the Indian Ocean , Central Command said, and not in the Arabian Sea that borders Iran.

Iran's army chief Amir Hatami on Thursday responded by vowing a "crushing response" to any US attack. "In accordance with the threats we are facing, maintaining and enhancing strategic advantages for rapid combat and a crushing response to any invasion ... is always on the army's agenda," Iran's Tasnim news quoted him as saying.

According to Trump’s social media post, the US fleet is "ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary".

The armada is headed by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier – one of 10 nuclear-powered US aircraft carriers, known as the Nimitz class, the largest category of warships in the world, according to the US Navy.

The massive vessels are 333 metres long and can hold more than 65 aircraft and multiple missile mounts. Each of the 10 existing Nimitz-class vessels costs $4.5 billion and the Abraham Lincoln can support a crew of up to 5,680 people .

Despite their huge size, these juggernauts are designed for exceptional speed over extended periods. They can travel at more than 30 knots, or 56km/h (35mph), a speed at which it can still manoeuvre quickly to evade attacks.

The carriers can also host squadrons of stealth aircraft, including Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II fighter jets and Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, according to AP . Hundreds of missiles of different varieties may also be aboard, including Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, as well as the NATO Sea Sparrow , an anti-missile and aircraft weapon system.

Analysts following flight-tracking data have noticed that dozens of US military cargo planes are also heading to the region.

The deployment is similar to that seen last year, AP reported , when US air defence hardware was moved to the region in case of Iranian retaliation for the US bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites during the Iran-Israel war in June.

At least three destroyers are accompanying the USS Abraham Lincoln: the USS Frank E. Petersen Jr., known for its missile-launch systems; the USS Spruance, with advanced radar and sensor capabilities; and the USS Michael Murphy, a more recent version of the Spruance.

The Abraham Lincoln might also be carrying additional equipment, like the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie decoy system, which uses sound to prevent underwater torpedoes from tracking a ship.

The mobilisation suggests that Trump’s repeated threats to strike Iran may crystalise.

Tehran is responding with its own threats. Its mission to the United Nations hit back in a post on X , saying first that the country "stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests" before adding: "BUT IF PUSHED, IT WILL DEFEND ITSELF AND RESPOND LIKE NEVER BEFORE!"

The Iranian regime has blamed the widespread public unrest and demonstrations – seen as the biggest threat to the regime since the 1979 revolution – on Israel and the United States. “We find the US President guilty due to the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted upon the Iranian nation,” Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei wrote on X .

The US president has continued to ramp up the pressure in recent weeks and has repeatedly advocated for new leadership and an end to Khamenei’s 37-year reign. But the primary reason for US military intervention would likely be to curb Iran’s nuclear programme.

What the White House is asking of Tehran has often vacillated , with Trump's threats at one point being tied to demands not to hang protesters before shifting to its nuclear programme .

Trump has criticised the regime’s crackdown on its people, calling on them to keep protesting while asserting in mid-January that, " h elp is on its way ".

Trump on Thursday warned that " time is running out " and demanded that Iran "negotiate a fair and equitable deal – NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS" in a post on Truth Social.

A source told Reuters on Thursday that any US strikes might target the ballistic missiles that can reach US allies in the Middle East as well as Iran's nuclear enrichment programmes.

Concern over a possible military confrontation is spreading globally, with the Kremlin saying any ​use of force against Tehran could create " chaos " in the region and urging talks while Turkey has offered to mediate .

Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said Monday that any attack on its ally Iran would be considered an attack on the militant group , and warned that a conflict " will ignite the region ".

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Thursday that the already volatile Middle East "does not need a new war".

The sharpening rhetoric between Washington and Tehran comes at a volatile moment in the region, and Iranians find themselves caught in the crossfire.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency places the number of deaths in the Iranian protests at more than 6,000 people, including 5,925 protesters, since December, adding that it is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths. Another group – Norway-based Iran Human Rights – has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000 .

Repeated internet shutdowns and communications blockades have prevented the collection of exact figures, and Iranian state-run media remains one of the main sources of news coming out of the country.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:56:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/76303c76-fd20-11f0-8b6b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029228722760.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Burkina Faso military government dissolves political parties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/burkina-faso-military-government-dissolves-political-parties-2026-01-29/</link><description>DAKAR, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Burkina Faso's military-led government has dissolved all political parties and scrapped the legal framework governing their operations, according to a decree approved by the West African nation's council of ministers on Thursday.

The decision by the military rulers who seized power in September 2022 is the latest move to tighten control following the suspension of political activities after the coup.

Burkina Faso's Interior Minister Emile Zerbo said the decision was part of a broader effort to "rebuild the state" after what he said was widespread abuses and dysfunction in the country's multiparty system.

He said a government review found that the multiplication of political parties had fuelled divisions and weakened social cohesion.

Before the coup, the country had over 100 registered political parties, with 15 represented in parliament after the 2020 general election.

The decree disbands all political parties and political formations. A law repealing the statutes and regulating party financing, and the status of the opposition leader, will be sent to the current transitional council, according to minutes of the cabinet meeting.

All the assets of the dissolved parties will be transferred to the state.

The Sahel nation, like neighbours Mali and Niger, has been struggling to contain Islamist insurgencies linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands and displaced millions over the past decade.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 20:32:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E3ZX4XZZY5KGTHIVTNVGOCNL4Q.jpg?auth=3df07cfaa935aa1829ff3abf7d0dd3b8709b6e949235dae12fd6823e3389c086&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney says he expects US administration to respect Canadian sovereignty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/carney-says-he-expects-us-administration-respect-canadian-sovereignty-2026-01-29/</link><description>OTTAWA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, asked about reports that U.S. officials had met separatists seeking independence for the province of Alberta, on Thursday said he expected the U.S. administration to respect Canadian sovereignty.

The Financial Times said State Department officials had held three meetings with the Alberta Prosperity Project, a group that is pushing for a referendum on whether the energy-producing Western province should break away from Canada.

"We expect the U.S. administration to respect Canadian sovereignty. I'm always clear in my conversations with President Trump to that effect," Carney told a press conference.

Trump, he added, had never raised the question of Alberta separatism with him.

The APP, which says Ottawa's policies are stifling the province, wants another meeting next month with State and Treasury officials to ask for a $500 billion credit facility, the Financial Times reported.

Alberta premier Danielle Smith said she wanted to stay part of Canada but noted that polls show 30% of the population was fed up with what it saw as Ottawa's excessive interference.

Alberta is landlocked and Smith is pressing for another oil pipeline to the Pacific Coast. That would have to cross the neighboring province of British Columbia, whose premier David Eby has ruled out the idea.

Eby, whose relations with Smith are usually chilly, told reporters earlier that "to go to a foreign country and to ask for assistance in breaking up Canada ... is treason".

Last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a radio station: "I think we should let them come down into the U.S."

Asked about a possible Alberta referendum, he replied: "People want sovereignty. They want what the U.S. has got."

Carney and Trump have repeatedly traded barbs in recent weeks. Carney, who calls the U.S. president a skilled negotiator, suggests some of Trump's recent comments could be tied to a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact that is due to start later this year.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 20:33:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7YG77G7ZRFNK7AQIECMOTAVKOQ.jpg?auth=a18701c376bb3377585c2661d81767b068771cef8e3d59c55cc3369bd2b2e65f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy expects implementation of agreement not to fire on Kyiv</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-expects-implementation-agreement-not-fire-kyiv-2026-01-29/</link><description>Jan 29 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday he expected the implementation of an agreement by Russia not to fire on Kyiv and other cities for a week because of winter weather, as announced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Zelenskiy said the days to come would show whether Moscow would abide by such an agreement.

"Our teams discussed this in the United Arab Emirates. We expect the agreements to be implemented," Zelenskiy wrote in English on the X social media platform. "De-escalation steps contribute to real progress toward ending the war."

Speaking immediately afterwards in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy expressed his thanks to Washington for the initiative, which he described as halting Russian strikes on energy targets.

"Thanks to the American side for their efforts in ensuring a stop to strikes on energy (targets) at this time and let's hope that America succeeds in ensuring this," he said.

"We shall see what the real situation is with our energy facilities and cities in the days and nights to come."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 20:33:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GQMVCVEBWBJJFOK3I5BQYA4TDY.jpg?auth=ca880cc98de003cd2d075aa4259df95fd7c243c7d1f254c2c5d7bb6123b2bea7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain mourns victims as families push for train crash truth</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-mourns-victims-families-push-train-crash-truth-2026-01-29/</link><description>HUELVA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Some relatives of the 45 people killed in Spain's rail disaster vowed on Thursday to find out why the two high-speed trains collided , making their promise before survivors still wearing bandages and slings at a funeral mass.

"Only the truth will help us heal this wound. We will know the truth, we will fight so that there will never be another train," Liliana Saenz, who lost her mother, said at the service in the southern city of Huelva. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia attended.

Spain is trying to come to terms with the January 18 disaster near the village of Adamuz in southern Spain that caused one of the highest death tolls from a train crash in European history.

The government has been scrutinized over whether it has sufficiently invested in maintenance of Spain's vaunted railway system since the crash and other incidents that same week, including the death of a train driver in Catalonia.

A fracture in the rail appeared to have occurred before one of the trains headed for Madrid from Malaga derailed and was hit by a second, Huelva-bound train coming in the opposite direction 20 seconds later, authorities said. Puente said the gap could have been as short as nine seconds.

Trump launched his Board of Peace last week, initially designed to cement Gaza's rocky ceasefire, but which he foresees playing a wider role that concerns other global powers.

He has invited dozens of other world leaders to join, and while Middle East powers including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious.

Luxon said in an email statement that the decision had been made not to join the Board of Peace in “its current form.”

New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Winston Peters added in a post on X that a number of states, particularly from the region, have stepped up to contribute to the Board’s role on Gaza, and “New Zealand would not add significant further value to that.”

Peters post added that as a “a leading founder and longstanding supporter” of the United Nations, it is important that the Board’s work is complementary to and consistent with the UN Charter.

“It is a new body, and we need clarity on this, and on other questions relating to its scope, now and in the future,” Peters said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 21:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/77P33MMOLRNXLHAEV7CRJLKE7A.jpg?auth=cb43aeabef489eefbffe10e4c506fd345ceb05ff8082bb2aadae5413b5802c9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gang-wracked Haiti capital 'systematically' terrorised by sexual violence, MSF warns</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260129-gang-wracked-haiti-capital-systematically-terrorised-by-sexual-violence-msf-warns</link><description>Sexual and gender-based violence has surged in Haiti in recent years, with women and girls targeted by increasingly brutal practices, medical charity Doctors Without Borders warned Thursday.

Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, with swathes of the country under the control of rival armed gangs who carry out murders, rapes and kidnappings.

"Sexual and gender-based violence has surged in Haiti's capital since 2021, and is being used systematically to terrorise the population," Doctors Without Borders, which goes by its French initials MSF, warned as it published a fresh report based on 10 years of data and testimonies from its clinic in Port-au-Prince.

MSF said its Pran Men'm clinic had "borne witness to the impact of Haiti's descent into violence and of its hollowed-out health, security, and judicial mechanisms on the bodies of women and girls".

The clinic had over the past decade treated nearly 17,000 survivors of sexual violence – 98 percent of whom were women and girls – including 2,300 in just the first nine months of 2025.

Nearly one-fifth of the survivors treated at the clinic had suffered multiple instances of sexual violence.

"The number of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence who receive care at the clinic has almost tripled from an average of 95 admissions per month in 2021 to more than 250 in 2025," MSF head of mission in Haiti Diana Manilla Arroyo pointed out in a statement.

MSF highlighted a "shocking increase in the brutality of the violence" it was seeing.

Fifty-seven percent of survivors who have received care at Pran Men'm since 2022 reported being assaulted by members of armed groups, and often by multiple perpetrators, it said.

MSF said that over 100 patients reported being assaulted by 10 or more perpetrators at a time.

"They beat me and broke my teeth," one 53-year-old survivor was quoted as saying in the report.

"Three young men who could have been my children ... After raping me, they raped my daughter ... and beat my husband."

The report warned of persistent shortcomings in survivors' access to services amid lacking funding for protection services.

Other barriers, including financial difficulties and insecurity, also prevent survivors from swiftly accessing care, it said.

This can have dire medical consequences, it warned, pointing out that only a third of survivors treated at its clinic since 2022 arrived there within three days of their assault, beyond which time it is no longer possible to prevent HIV transmission.

MSF called for more funding and for the "unequivocal recognition of the widespread nature of sexual violence and its deliberate use by armed groups as a tool to control and subjugate women and girls".</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 21:28:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c5092e56-fd53-11f0-8dc5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Haiti-6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tokyo hopes voters will hand PM Takaichi new clout to counter China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tokyo-hopes-voters-will-hand-pm-takaichi-new-clout-counter-china-2026-01-29/</link><description>TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - China may rethink its escalating pressure campaign on Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi if she delivers a resounding victory in a February 8 snap election, say current and former Japanese officials and political analysts.

Weeks after taking office last year, Takaichi touched off the biggest diplomatic dispute with Beijing in over a decade, by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the self-ruled island claimed by China.

Beijing demanded she retract the remarks, which she has not done, and then rolled out a series of retaliatory measures that are starting to weigh on the world’s fourth largest economy.

"China's initial thinking was probably to try to bring down the Takaichi government," said Kazuhisa Shimada, a former vice minister of defence.

"This election is extremely important... a weak government simply won't be taken seriously."

Japan's first female leader hopes to capitalise on her high personal approval ratings, hardly dented by the China row, to bolster her coalition's razor-thin majority in parliament.

A poll showed on Thursday that she may be on course to do just that , though analysts have described the ballot as Japan's most unpredictable in years.

A big win will help send a message to Beijing that its attacks have not damaged her domestically, a senior Japanese government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is a sensitive one.

China's economic curbs on one of its top trading partners could also backfire, while attempts to cast Takaichi as a dangerous ideologue reviving Japan's militaristic past is failing to gain traction internationally, the official added.

Those factors should eventually force China to re-engage with Japan, he said.

So far, however, Beijing has showed no signs of backing down.

China's foreign ministry declined to answer specific questions for this report.

It referred to remarks by spokesperson Guo Jiakun at a January 27 press conference that Takaichi had "severely threatened" the "political foundation of China-Japan relations".

A Chinese official, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that the election may bring Takaichi short‑term political gain but warned that Japanese people would ultimately see the diplomatic and economic price for crossing China.

Takaichi, who has said she will resign if her coalition loses its majority, did not respond to a request for comment sent to her office.

While domestic cost-of-living issues have dominated the campaign, tensions with China loom large, threatening Japan's weak economic growth and spurring the government to step up efforts to boost security.

Unveiling the election decision on January 19, Takaichi called out Chinese military exercises around Taiwan and "economic coercion".

China's retaliation for her earlier remarks on Taiwan have included a state-directed boycott on travel to Japan that almost halved the number of Chinese visitors in December.

Beijing is also weighing curbs on exports of rare earths and critical minerals, Chinese state media said. Analysts at Daiwa Institute of Research say such a ban could shave up to 3% from Japan's GDP, or about $117 billion, and cost 2 million jobs.

More than two-thirds of Japanese firms expect frayed ties with China to affect the economy, a Reuters survey showed this month, with an Asahi newspaper survey showing 60% of voters were concerned about the economic impact, up from 53% in December.

Economic anxiety may have factored into Takaichi's decision to call the election now, said Paul Midford, professor of international studies at Meiji Gakuin University in Yokohama. The next lower house vote did not have to be held until late 2028.

Takaichi's decision to try and solidify power may also be influenced by memories of her mentor, former premier Shinzo Abe, who returned to power in 2012 during an earlier period of high tension with China, said Shimada, the former vice minister.

"Abe kept winning elections and built an extremely solid political base," he said. "Once that happened, China had no choice but to deal with the Abe government."

Abe oversaw a convincing upper house election win in 2013 and met Chinese President Xi Jinping in late 2014, just before his ruling coalition delivered another large majority in a lower house vote.

A key metric of Takaichi's success will be whether her party can deliver a majority on its own, said Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst for Northeast Asia with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.

That would require 35 seats in addition to the 198 it now controls in the 465-seat lower house.

"If she is able to do this, it would signal to Beijing that she will likely remain as prime minister for a few years and China’s pressure campaign against her has backfired," said Chan, a former U.S. diplomat in both China and Japan.

"Conversely, Beijing would likely increase its coercion against Japan if Takaichi wins only a small victory."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:28:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KL6MEU7SJJKHBN334K6REMUEDA.jpg?auth=3ee427db8067ca12775466714534d2aaa8d6b57455ac585bc29d78425f05b68c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ex-Google engineer convicted of stealing AI secrets for Chinese companies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ex-google-engineer-convicted-stealing-ai-secrets-chinese-companies-2026-01-29/</link><description>WILMINGTON, Delaware, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Former Google (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab software engineer Linwei Ding was convicted by a federal jury in San Francisco on Thursday of stealing AI trade secrets from the U.S. tech giant to benefit two Chinese companies he was secretly working for, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday.

Ding, a 38-year-old Chinese national, was found guilty after an 11-day trial of seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets for stealing thousands of pages of confidential information.

Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum 10-year term and $250,000 fine.

Ding is scheduled to appear at a status conference on February 3, according to the DOJ.

An attorney for Ding, also known as Leon Ding, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ding was originally indicted in March 2024 on four counts of theft of trade secrets. A superseding indictment in February expanded the charges.

Ding's case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force, , opens new tab created in 2023 by the Biden administration.

Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware infrastructure and software platform that lets Google's supercomputing data centers train large AI models.

Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give Google, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab , an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon.com (AMZN.O) , opens new tab and Microsoft (MSFT.O) , opens new tab , which design their own, and reduce Google's reliance on chips from Nvidia (NVDA.O) , opens new tab .

Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts three years later, when he was being courted to join an early-stage Chinese technology company.

Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law enforcement. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:31:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ROTTQRFTJRIL5JCTZZ6CWFH2YU.jpg?auth=5d5756c787f7add2e86a86578d4a10ed5778ecd38c929eb91546f9093b22291f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim announces major construction projects as party congress nears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-announces-major-construction-projects-party-congress-nears-2026-01-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 30 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un set a goal to carry out large-scale construction projects this year, including industrial factories in 20 regions simultaneously, state media KCNA said, as the country gears up for a key party congress.

North Korea is preparing to hold the Ninth Party Congress of the ruling Workers' Party, to convene soon to set major policy goals.

"We are now standing on the starting line of our gigantic struggle for another year, aimed at transforming the regions," Kim said in a speech on Thursday, KCNA said on Friday.

The attack happened overnight in Sabon Gari in remote Borno state, which has been the epicentre of an Islamist insurgency by Boko Haram and its Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) offshoot rival since 2009.

More than 40,000 people have been killed and nearly two million others forced to flee their homes.

"The death toll runs into dozens," said Ibrahim Liman, a member of the Civilian Joint Task Force militia that helps the Nigerian military against the militants.

"More bodies are still at the base while many soldiers are missing," he added.

Liman said 20 bodies, including those of five soldiers and 15 construction workers, and local hunters were taken to the general hospital in the nearby town of Biu.

Bukar Yamta Ali, secretary of a local hunters' group in Yamarkumi, near Biu, and two nurses at Biu hospital confirmed they had recovered bodies and wounded from Sabon Gari.

The victims were working on a road bridge that was destroyed last year in another jihadist attack, and were returning to their base when they were attacked.

Military and militia sources said on Tuesday that at least nine Nigerian soldiers were killed in an ISWAP ambush near Damasak near the border with Niger last week.

ISWAP emerged from a split with Boko Haram in 2016 and primarily targets Nigerian security forces, although civilians in the region have been caught up in the violence.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:59:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8c3e567c-e314-11f0-b89a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-26T163203Z-839028605-RC2BOIAF5Q1O-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-NIGERIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to impose tariffs on goods from nations giving oil to Cuba, White House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-impose-tariffs-goods-nations-nations-giving-oil-cuba-white-house-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and establishing a process to impose tariffs on goods from countries that sell or otherwise provide oil to Cuba, the White House said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 23:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L7EN23JCJFLAJFNMBX2CSRS6JU.jpg?auth=bf322c6dc44e2712e319225223268a9f40668035829eb51570e20021a5d0323d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democrats ask top US spy to explain presence at FBI raid on election facility</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/democrats-ask-top-us-spy-explain-presence-fbi-raid-election-facility-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Top Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence committees called on Thursday on Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to brief their panels on why she was present for an FBI raid on an election facility in Georgia.

Senator Mark Warner and Representative Jim Himes told Gabbard in a letter that they were deeply concerned that she was at the scene of Wednesday's FBI operation, saying that the U.S. intelligence community "should be focused on foreign threats."

"When those authorities are turned inwards, the results can be devastating" for privacy and civil liberties, the pair wrote to the top U.S. spy.

Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It is highly unusual for America’s top intelligence official to be included in a domestic law enforcement operation, given that the remit of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is overseas spying and protecting the national security interests of the U.S.

Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, was at the scene when the FBI raided the election office in Fulton County, Georgia in pursuit evidence to back up Republican President Donald Trump's false claims that widespread fraud lost him the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden.

The FBI said in a brief statement that its agents executed a warrant at the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in Union City, a large, warehouse-like facility opened in 2023, calling it a "court-authorized law enforcement activity."

The warrant "sought a number of records related to 2020 elections," the Fulton County government said in a brief statement about the raid, the latest in a string of actions by Trump's administration to use the Justice Department against his perceived enemies or to intervene in cases where he believes he was treated unfairly.

Warner and Himes told Gabbard that any federal efforts to combat "foreign election threats" required that the public and the congressional intelligence committees be informed.

Gabbard, they noted, has questioned a 2017 intelligence community assessment that Russia tried to influence the 2016 presidential vote in Trump's favor, a finding upheld by a bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Gabbard, they said, also has dismantled an intelligence unit created by Congress to expose malign foreign influence operations.

"Your recent actions raise foundational questions about the current mission of your office, and it is critical that you brief the committees immediately as part of your obligation to keep Congress fully and currently informed," the pair wrote.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 23:32:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNWBM3E4ZJN2RGN5LHJJVZ2GEA.jpg?auth=46469b9fade99b0afbdaaa2bcf109f96a98cc104e1585deb71be50414b5ac51a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweeping oil reform in Venezuela approved, operators expected to gain autonomy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sweeping-oil-reform-venezuela-approved-operators-expected-gain-autonomy-2026-01-29/</link><description>Jan 29 (Reuters) - Lawmakers approved in a final vote on Thursday a sweeping reform of Venezuela's main oil law after sweetening a proposal by interim President Delcy Rodriguez to lower taxes, expand the oil ministry's decision power, grant autonomy for private producers and make possible asset transfers and outsourcings.

The changes are expected to encourage increases in oil and gas production and foreign investment following a $100 billion reconstruction plan for the industry proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump this month after the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The fast-tracked reform to the backbone of the country's oil industry follows 20 years of strict nationalization and expropriation of assets previously owned by foreign companies including U.S. oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab , which have not been fully compensated after years of arbitrations and lawsuits.

"We have achieved the unanimous approval of a hydrocarbons law reform that will make hiring domestic and foreign companies to extract resources from the world's largest oil reserve more competitive," said National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez.

As promised by U.S. officials, Trump's administration eased sanctions on the Venezuelan energy industry related to its oil exports through a general license shortly after the reform approval.

The proposal was submitted, discussed and approved in less than two weeks. Trump said he would control Venezuela's oil revenue indefinitely following a flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington.

Many potential oil investors viewed the reform as "good enough" to encourage initial investment to recover the OPEC country's depleted industry, while former Venezuelan officials have called it unconstitutional.

The new law will allow private producers to operate projects under new oil contracts or in joint ventures, even if they are the minority stakeholders. They are gaining long-sought autonomy to commercialize output and cash proceeds out of state company PDVSA's control.

The reform also formalizes an oil production sharing model first introduced by Maduro and negotiated with little-known energy firms in recent years. Politicians and experts have warned about the secrecy of those deals and the potential for corruption due to loose regulation.

Changes to the text added in recent days prepared the ground for reducing the income tax for energy projects and removed a series of extra taxes. But a new 'hydrocarbon tax' yet to be regulated in separate legislation was introduced, casting doubts about Caracas' intention of really lowering the government's take, among the highest in Latin America.

Proposals made at the last minute by opposition lawmakers to grant transparency, limit the ministry's powers and maintain the National Assembly approval power for oil contracts were rejected.

The legislature's energy committee received some 120 proposals to modify the law, said lawmaker Orlando Camacho, who is allied with the government.

Washington did not recognize the legitimacy of the election of Venezuela's National Assembly. The U.S. also rejected other voting processes in the country that had little participation and a lack of international observation.

The possibility of transferring oil assets currently owned and operated by state oil firm PDVSA, and to outsource the operation of oilfields under the new contract model was added recently to the reform.

Those production-sharing contracts are expected to be signed as the government makes an evaluation over the next six months of dozens of PDVSA-controlled oil and gas joint ventures, the model that has dominated the industry since the previous hydrocarbons law was approved in 2001.

The National Assembly lost its previous approval authority over contracts, with the oil ministry - currently also controlled by Rodriguez - taking over almost all power to sign contracts and greenlight any term changes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 23:52:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UQ3HLJSLYNJ53O2VAQ6OPFC6SQ.jpg?auth=fc07759e4b18ff121d16856ea1305ca50169d046ef166901e28f3645864b86f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump warns UK about business with China after Starmer-Xi talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-very-dangerous-uk-get-into-business-with-china-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has warned the United Kingdom against getting into business with China after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chinese leader Xi Jinping hailed a reset in relations.

With Western leaders reeling from the unpredictability of Trump, Starmer became the latest to head to China, where he called for a "more sophisticated relationship" with improved market access, lower tariffs and investment deals in three-hours of talks with Xi on Thursday.

During the premiere of the "Melania" film at the Kennedy Center, Trump was asked about the UK pledging greater business cooperation with China, and he told reporters: "Well, it's very dangerous for them to do that, and it's even more dangerous I think for Canada to get into business with China."

Starmer, whose centre-left Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world's second-largest economy a priority.

His visit comes amid Trump's on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges to grab control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which have rattled long-standing U.S. allies, such as Britain.

Starmer told reporters on the plane on the way to China that Britain could continue to strengthen economic ties with China - without angering Trump - because of his country's long history of working closely with the United States.

"The relationship we have with the U.S. is one of the closest relationships we hold, on defence, security, intelligence and also on trade and lots of areas," he said.

Starmer said Britain would not have to choose between closer ties with the United States or China, highlighting Trump’s visit to Britain in September where they announced 150 billion pound of U.S investment into Britain.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Canada if it goes through with economic deals struck with China on a recent visit by its leader Mark Carney.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is expected to travel to China soon and Trump himself has said he will visit in April.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 02:03:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YS7EHJSXTFN55FOKICREDVMWHE.jpg?auth=7d6179635ffbcbe16957f926854f1bdd5f28050b37835e21f40468d2507f847c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US missions to review aid programs for compliance with new rules on abortion, diversity and gender</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-missions-review-aid-programs-compliance-with-new-rules-abortion-diversity-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The State Department has ordered U.S. missions worldwide to review all aid programs to ensure they meet stringent new rules that prohibit funding of groups working on family planning, diversity or what the Trump administration calls “gender ideology,” according to a cable seen by Reuters.

The Trump administration last week announced the expansion of the so-called Mexico City Policy, which opponents call the "global gag rule" because they say it silences abortion rights advocates.

The policy, previously focused on abortion, now also bars funding of groups that work on diversity, equity and inclusion; gender identity and transgender rights. It expands the amount of foreign aid affected to about $30 billion and targets more groups to include U.S.-based organizations.

The move has outraged aid groups that see it as another blow to the struggling sector and a move that effectively silences civil society in developing countries.

Department bureaus and posts should begin assessing the aid projects they oversee and consider identifying a focal point or forming a “tiger team” to work on the new rules, the cable, dated Wednesday, said.

The new rules, which go into effect on February 26, will be included in any new grants or cooperative agreements and added to existing projects when new funding is awarded, the cable said.

Officials expect some organizations will not comply with the policy and opt out of receiving U.S. funding, according to the cable, which included an internal email address to receive information on those organizations declining to comply.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio will issue limited waivers to ensure implementation of the new rules does not "unduly disrupt ongoing lifesaving programming, disaster response, and other critical priorities," the cable said.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.

President Donald Trump eradicated the federal government’s main foreign aid agency USAID after returning to office last year, throwing the global aid sector into chaos. The administration has also aggressively closed programs relating to diversity initiatives and acceptance of transgender people.

Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City Policy has been rescinded by each Democratic president since and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. Trump restored it a year ago before the expansion was announced by Vice President JD Vance at the March For Life anti-abortion rally in Washington on Friday.

Under the new rules, foreign NGOs are prohibited from using funding from non-U.S. donors as well as U.S. aid for the banned purposes. The restriction previously applied only to U.S. funds.

These are to “provide or promote abortion as a method of family planning; Promote gender ideology; Promote discriminatory equity ideology; or Engage in unlawful diversity, equity, and inclusion-related discrimination,” or provide financial support to other groups engaged in these activities, according to the cable.

U.S.-based NGOs were only restricted from using U.S. assistance for those purposes, it said.

International Crisis Group's Cristal Downing said the policy already required large amounts of paperwork from organizations, including those in conflict zones, and had been damaging to civil society, for instance negatively affecting groups working on women's rights.

"This is an attempt at global social engineering, part of a slash and burn strategy targeting gender equality programming that started with last year’s aid cuts. It will affect access to safe spaces for survivors of gender-based violence, efforts to increase women’s representation in peacebuilding initiatives, and a host of other work," said Downing, project director for gender and conflict at the think tank.

Talking points in the cable instructed U.S. diplomats to say the move was part of Trump’s foreign aid overhaul aimed at focusing "resources on programs that are designed to effectively and efficiently save lives, support allies, and create commercial opportunities that benefit the American economy.”

“Programs predicated upon advancing divisive social causes, globalism, and other radical ideologies have no place in our new foreign assistance architecture,” the talking points said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 02:03:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RC4OPHQZEZLVFPXYDFKRAVZPGY.jpg?auth=af1e54078b887343895541d0b7b5c08aa75a546e09852fbd55dfa5f792685ac7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he is planning to talk to Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-he-is-planning-talk-iran-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was planning to talk to Iran amid rising tensions.

Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has made the indigenous submarine programme a key part of an ambitious project to modernise its armed forces as Beijing stages almost daily military exercises to assert its sovereignty claims.

The submarine programme has drawn on expertise and technology from several countries , including the United States and Britain, a breakthrough for diplomatically isolated Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's territorial claims.

Taiwan's CSBC Corp (2208.TW) , opens new tab , which is leading construction of what is eventually planned to be eight submarines, said in a statement late on Thursday that the first ship, named the Narwhal, had completed its first underwater test at sea.

It said the submarine had carried out a "shallow-water submerged navigation test".

"Submarines are a key strategic capability with deterrent power," it said, after the test off the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung.

The Narwhal had been due to be delivered to the navy in 2024, joining two existing submarines purchased from the Netherlands in the 1980s, but the programme has been hit with delays.

"Due to constraints in the international environment and pressure from the Chinese communists, Taiwan's indigenous submarine programme has faced various difficulties and challenges from the beginning to the present," CSBC said.

Taiwan has said it hopes to deploy at least two such domestically developed submarines by 2027, and possibly equip later models with missiles.

The first submarine, with a price tag of T$49.36 billion ($1.58 billion), will use a combat system by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) , opens new tab and carry U.S.-made Mark 48 heavyweight torpedoes.

Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by those of China, which has three operational aircraft carriers and ballistic missile submarines and is developing stealth fighter jets.

Taiwan is modernising its military to be able to fight "asymmetric warfare," using mobile and agile systems like submarines, drones and truck-mounted missiles to fend off its much larger adversary China.

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te announced in November 2025 that his government would spend an additional $40 billion on defence.

Lawmakers in the country's National Assembly approved the overhaul of the energy industry law earlier in the day, less than a month after the brazen seizure of then-President Nicolás Maduro in a US military attack in Venezuela’s capital.

As the bill was being passed, the US Treasury Department officially began to ease sanctions on Venezuelan oil that once crippled the industry, and expanded the ability of US energy companies to operate in the South American nation, the first step in plans outlined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio the day before.

The license authorisation by the Treasury Department strictly prohibits entities from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea or Cuba from the transactions.

The moves by both governments on Thursday are paving the way for yet another radical geopolitical and economic shift in Venezuela.

“We’re talking about the future. We are talking about the country that we are going to give to our children," Rodríguez said.

Rodríguez proposed the changes in the days after US President Donald Trump said his administration would take control of Venezuela’s oil exports and revitalize the ailing industry by luring foreign investment.

The legislation promises to give private companies control over the production and sale of oil and allow for independent arbitration of disputes.

Rodríguez’s government expects the changes to serve as assurances for major US oil companies that have so far hesitated about returning to the volatile country. Some of those companies lost investments when the ruling party enacted the existing law two decades ago to favor Venezuela’s state-run oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA.

The revised law would modify extraction taxes, setting a royalty cap rate of 30% and allowing the executive branch to set percentages for every project based on capital investment needs, competitiveness and other factors.

It also removes the mandate for disputes to be settled only in Venezuelan courts, which are controlled by the ruling party. Foreign investors have long viewed the involvement of independent courts as crucial to guard against future expropriation.

Ruling-party lawmaker Orlando Camacho, head of the assembly’s oil committee, said the reform “will change the country’s economy.”

Meanwhile, opposition lawmaker Antonio Ecarri urged the assembly to add transparency and accountability provisions to the law, including the creation of a website to make funding and other information public. He noted that the current lack of oversight has led to systemic corruption and argued that these provisions can also be considered judicial guarantees.

Those guarantees are among the key changes foreign investors are looking for as they weigh entering the Venezuelan market.

“Let the light shine on in the oil industry,” Ecarri said.

Oil workers dressed in red jumpsuits and hard hats celebrated the bill’s approval, waving a Venezuelan flag inside the legislative palace and then joining lawmakers in a demonstration with ruling-party supporters.

The law was last altered two decades ago as Maduro ’s mentor and predecessor, the late Hugo Chávez, made heavy state control over the oil industry a pillar of his socialist-inspired revolution.

In the early years of his tenure, a massive windfall in petrodollars thanks to record-high global oil prices turned PDVSA into the main source of government revenue and the backbone of Venezuela’s economy.

Chávez’s 2006 changes to the hydrocarbons law required PDVSA to be the principal stakeholder in all major oil projects.

In tearing up the contracts that foreign companies signed in the 1990s, Chávez nationalised huge assets belonging to American and other Western firms that refused to comply, including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. They are still waiting to receive billions of dollars in arbitration awards.

From those heady days of lavish state spending, PDVSA’s fortunes turned — along with the country’s — as oil prices dropped and government mismanagement eroded profits and hurt production, first under Chávez, then Maduro.

The nation home to the world’s biggest proven crude reserves underwent a dire economic crisis that drove over 7 million Venezuelans to flee since 2014. Sanctions imposed by successive US administrations further crippled the oil industry.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 02:04:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cbf675f0-fcb0-11f0-8f58-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/0668e29028bba83f0f024438bdae56f29fe5d082.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's reformist Natthaphong is frontrunner ahead of February vote, polls show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-reformist-natthaphong-is-frontrunner-ahead-february-vote-polls-show-2026-01-30/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Thailand's progressive People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut continued to lead opinion polls on Friday, highlighting the stiff challenge facing Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul 's bid to stay in power ahead of elections on February 8 .

February's vote has settled into a three-way race between Anutin's conservative Bhumjaithai Party, the former ruling Pheu Thai Party and the reformist People's Party.

A poll by Suan Dusit University published on Friday said Natthaphong was backed by 35.1% of respondents, with Anutin coming in third with 16.1%, behind Pheu Thai's candidate for prime minister Yoshanan Wongsawat at 21.5%.

The poll surveyed 26,621 people from the January 16 to 28 period.

The People's Party is the successor to Move Forward, which won the 2023 elections but was subsequently blocked by conservative lawmakers from forming a government and was later dissolved by court order.

Anutin called a snap election on December 12 after less than 100 days as premier during a chaotic parliamentary session that could have led to a no-confidence vote and the collapse of his fragile minority government.

It also came during Thailand's fierce three-week border conflict with Cambodia.

Another poll by the National Institute of Development Administration also showed Natthaphong in front with support from 29% of respondents, up from 24.7% earlier in the month , with Anutin up modestly at 22.2%.

Anutin faces pressure to consolidate conservative-leaning voters and present a post-election governing path in what are expected to be tight coalition negotiations after the vote.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 04:21:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6I2CJKQLRJ43C5PT6J3MJAC2Y.jpg?auth=7df7fff4d558186f897d7a2f45fa42b21525a0b7413da1aa66bb428fb5133493&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Force won't bring true peace for Taiwan, president tells Pope Leo in letter</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/force-wont-bring-true-peace-taiwan-president-tells-pope-leo-letter-2026-01-30/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Any attempt to change Taiwan's status quo by force or coercion cannot bring true peace, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said in a letter to Pope Leo released by the presidential office on Friday.

The Vatican is one of only 12 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, and the only one in Europe, though the Vatican has worked to improve relations with Beijing, including the appointment of Catholic bishops .

Writing to Pope Leo in response to his January 1 World Day of Peace message, Lai said he had repeatedly emphasised that democracy, peace, and prosperity are "Taiwan's national path and also Taiwan's link with the world".

In the face of long-term military coercion and political intimidation from "authoritarian states in the region", Taiwan has always chosen to safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait through concrete actions, Lai added, without directly naming China.

"I firmly believe that any attempt to change Taiwan's status quo through force or coercion cannot bring true peace," he said.

China's military operates near Taiwan on a daily basis in what the government in Taipei says is an ongoing pressure and harassment campaign. China held its latest war games around the island in late December.

China refuses to talk to Lai, believing he is a dangerous "separatist".

Lai says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

In his letter to the Pope, Lai also called out "efforts to distort" World War Two documents and the interpretation of the 1971 U.N resolution , which led to Taipei losing the China seat at the global body to Beijing "in order to downgrade our sovereign status".

Beijing says World War Two documents like the Cairo Declaration , as well as the 1971 U.N. resolution, give international legal backing to its sovereignty claims over Taiwan.

The government in Taipei says that is nonsense given the U.N. resolution made no mention of Taiwan, and that the People's Republic of China did not exist until the end of World War Two.

Taiwan's formal name is the Republic of China, the name of the government that fought on the side of the Western allies in World War Two.

The republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists who established the People's Republic of China.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 04:22:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P4BZSMCQGJI6XCOMQO5FNTQBGU.jpg?auth=623417bb4932ef31a7ac93b2047898142a96a08df0a5563f2032f4bfff33cb44&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why Thailand will vote to decide a new constitution</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/why-thailand-will-vote-decide-new-constitution-2026-01-30/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Voters in Thailand's general elections on February 8 will also be asked to decide if a new constitution should replace a 2017 charter.

The referendum is the outcome of a decades-long struggle between the pro-military royalist establishment and popular democratic political movements.

Those backing change say the current military-backed charter entrenches unelected power, weakening democratic checks and civil liberties.

The ballot will ask, "Do you approve that there should be a new constitution?" and offer a choice of "Yes", "No" or "No opinion".

A majority "Yes" vote would give parliament a public mandate to begin drafting a new national charter.

A majority "no" vote will leave intact the current constitution, which took effect in 2017 after being drafted by a military-appointed committee following a 2014 coup.

Two prior referendums, in 2007 and 2016, differed from the approaching exercise as they sought approval of drafts written after military coups.

Thailand has had 20 constitutions since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. Most of the changes followed military coups, 13 of which have been successful in the last 94 years.

Critics say the 2017 constitution concentrated power in undemocratic institutions, weakened popular rule and limited decentralisations of power and meaningful checks and balances.

Central to this is the Senate, or upper house of parliament, whose 200 members are chosen through a complex indirect selection process with little public participation, allowing powerful political groups to influence its composition.

The Senate has an oversight role in lawmaking and holds key powers, such as the appointment of judges to the Constitutional Court and other unelected bodies with outsize influence on politics, including dissolving political parties and banning elected leaders from politics.

The empowerment of such unelected bodies over elected ones, critics say, stemmed from a two-decade long tussle between the conservative establishment, backed by the military, and popular political movements, chiefly those linked to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra .

The charter broadly limits civil rights and freedoms by subordinating them to state security and public morality.

Most mainstream political parties , including the ruling Bhumjaithai Party as well as the opposition People's Party and Pheu Thai , back amending the constitution and are urging supporters to vote "yes" in the referendum.

Bhumjaithai, however, says changes must not affect charter provisions on the monarchy.

Opponents of change come mostly from ultra conservative figures and parties such as the pro-military United Thai Nation Party, which backed former junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha but has since lost influence, winning just 36 of 500 seats in the last election.

If "Yes" voters prevail, the new government and lawmakers can start the amendment process in parliament with two more referendums required to adopt a new constitution.

The first task will be to layout the framework and key principles of the drafting process, as well as identifying those responsible for writing the charter.

A second referendum will then seek approval of the process. If secured, a third referendum is next required to approve the finished draft.

Experts say the process could run at least two years after the first referendum.

If the February 8 referendum fails, lawmakers can still propose charter amendments to individual articles in parliament.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 04:22:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J73QT2EJO5MTLNKVHFHCYIFKK4.jpg?auth=19a7a6898da9e3477225985f660e0fa8603e173712c5897c27f35eb247ccf84c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens new tariffs on countries supplying Cuba with oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-trump-threatens-new-tariffs-countries-supplying-cuba-oil</link><description>US President Donald Trump threatened ⁠new tariffs on Thursday on countries supplying oil to Cuba, escalating a pressure campaign against the Communist-run island and long-time foe of the United States.

The move, ​authorised by an executive order under a national emergency declaration, ‍stopped short of specifying tariff rates or singling out any countries whose products could face US tariffs .

Cuba's ​state-run media shot back shortly after Trump's announcement, warning that the ​order threatened to paralyze electricity generation, agricultural production, water supply and health services on an island already suffering a crippling economic crisis.

"What is the goal? A genocide of the Cuban people," Cuba's government said in a statement on the nightly TV newscast. "All spheres of life will be suffocated by the US government."

Emboldened by the US military 's ‍seizure of ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a deadly raid earlier this month, Trump has repeatedly ​talked of acting against Cuba and pressuring its leadership.

Trump said this week that "Cuba will be failing pretty soon," adding that Venezuela, once the island's ‌top oil supplier, has not recently sent oil or money to Cuba.

Reuters exclusively reported last week that Mexico - Cuba's top ‍supplier after Venezuela cut off shipments in December - wasalso reviewing whether to continue sending oil amid growing fears it could face reprisals from the United States over the policy.

Trump has used tariff threats as a foreign policy tool throughout his second term in office.

The New START treaty is set to end on February 5. Without it, there would be no constraints on long-range nuclear arsenals for the first time since Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed two historic agreements in 1972 on the first-ever trip by a U.S. president to Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed the two sides should stick to existing missile and warhead limits for one more year to buy time to work out what comes next, but U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to formally respond.

Trump said this month that "if it expires, it expires", and that the treaty should be replaced with a better one.

Some U.S. politicians argue Trump should reject Putin's offer, freeing Washington to grow its arsenal to counter a rapid nuclear build-up by a third power: China.

Trump says he wants to pursue "denuclearisation" with both Russia and China. But Beijing says it is unreasonable to expect it to join disarmament talks with two countries whose arsenals are still far larger than its own.

Since the darkest Cold War days when the United States and the Soviet Union threatened each other with "mutually assured destruction" in the event of nuclear war, both have seen arms limitation treaties as a way to prevent either a lethal misunderstanding or an economically ruinous arms race.

The treaties not only set numerical limits on missiles and warheads, they also require the sides to share information - a critical channel to "try to understand where the other side is coming from and what their concerns and drivers are", said Darya Dolzikova at the RUSI think-tank in London.

With no new treaty, each would be forced to act according to worst-case assumptions about the weapons the other is producing, testing and deploying, said Nikolai Sokov, a former Soviet and Russian arms negotiator.

"It's a self-sustaining kind of process. And of course, if you've got an unregulated arms race, things will get quite destabilising," he said.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia and the United States have repeatedly replaced and updated the Cold War-era treaties that limited the so-called strategic weapons they point at each other's cities and bases.

The most recent, New START, was signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally who was then serving as Russian president for four years.

It caps the number of deployed strategic warheads at 1,550 on each side, with no more than 700 systems to deliver them from land, sea or air, by intercontinental ballistic missile, submarine-launched missile or heavy bomber.

Replacing it with a new treaty would be no simple task. Russia has developed new nuclear-capable systems - the Burevestnik cruise missile, the hypersonic Oreshnik and the Poseidon torpedo - that fall outside New START's framework. And Trump has announced plans for a space-based "Golden Dome" missile defence system that Moscow sees as an attempt to shift the strategic balance.

Meanwhile, China's arsenal is growing, unchecked by agreements between Washington and Moscow. Beijing now has an estimated 600 warheads and the Pentagon estimates it will have more than 1,000 by 2030.

A bipartisan Congressional commission in 2023 said the United States was now facing an "existential challenge" from not one but two nuclear peers, and needed to be prepared for simultaneous wars with Russia and China.

Its recommendations included preparing to bring out of storage some or all of the strategic nuclear warheads removed under New START and kept in a reserve stockpile.

That could involve restoring warheads removed from Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-fired Trident D5s, and returning to nuclear roles some 30 B-52 strategic bomber planes converted to conventional missions.

"The warheads are there. The missiles are there. You’re not buying anything new," said a former senior U.S. official involved in nuclear weapons policy who requested anonymity.

The former official expected only "modest" increases in warhead reloads should Trump order those options.

But Kingston Reif, a former Pentagon official now at the RAND research organization, told a recent webinar that at the high end the United States could "roughly double" its deployed warheads from the New START limit, while Russia would be in a position to add around 800. Both sides would take at least the best part of a year to make significant changes, he said.

PUTIN'S OFFER DIVIDES VIEWS IN THE U.S.

In policy circles in the United States, views are divided on whether Trump should agree to Putin's offer to keep existing limits in place for a year.

Trump should take steps "to reduce the risk of a wasteful nuclear arms race and to reduce the risk of a catastrophic misinterpretation (of the other side’s intent) that could spiral out of control during a crisis," said Paul Dean, a former arms control official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an advocacy group.

Arms control advocates point out that the United States is already facing huge expenses from a nuclear force modernization program - including a new submarine, bomber and ICBM – that is suffering serious delays and massive cost overruns.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $1 trillion between 2025 and 2034 to modernize, sustain and operate the nuclear forces.

"If the U.S. exceeds New START limits by uploading warheads, Russia will do the same, and China will use it as another excuse to build up their nuclear arsenal," Democratic Senator Ed Markey, a leading arms control proponent, told Reuters.

"Ultimately, Trump will have started a new arms race that we do not need, nor can we win. More weapons will not make use safer."

On the other side of the debate, experts and former officials say the U.S. shouldn't trust Putin, noting that he halted mutual inspections under New START in 2023 because of U.S. support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.

Franklin Miller, a member of the bipartisan Congressional commission, said the threats from Russia and China require an increase in deployed U.S. strategic nuclear warheads.

"We now have to be able to deter Russia and China simultaneously," said Miller. "The force that the treaty confined the U.S. to in 2010 is not sufficient to address Russia and China together."

U.S. weapons requirements should increase, although "not radically, not monumentally," he said, in a process that would probably take several years.

Asked about Trump's intentions, a White House official said: "The president will decide the path forward on nuclear arms control, which he will clarify on his own timeline."

Medvedev, the former Russian president who signed New START, told the Kommersant newspaper that Trump was unpredictable.

The Union and Solidarity Party (USDP) dominated all phases of the vote, winning an overwhelming majority in Myanmar's two legislative chambers. It secured 232 of the 263 seats up for grabs in the lower Pyithu Hluttaw house and 109 of the 157 seats announced so far in the Amyotha Hluttaw upper chamber, according to results released on Thursday and Friday.

Myanmar's parliament is expected to convene in March to elect a president , with a new government set to take over in April, pro-military Eleven Media Group reported earlier this month, citing junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun.

The final round of voting in late January brought an end to an election that began on December 28, more than four years after the military seized power in a coup that overturned the elected government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Myanmar has been in political turmoil since the coup, with the crushing of pro-democracy protests sparking a nationwide rebellion. Around 3.6 million people have been displaced, according to United Nations.

The 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations has said it would not endorse the process, and human rights groups and some western countries have also denounced the election as a sham.

Myanmar's military government insists the polls were free and fair, and supported by the public.

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy was dissolved along with dozens of other parties, and some others declined to take part, drawing condemnation from critics who say the process was designed to entrench military rule.

Under Myanmar's political system, the military is also guaranteed 25% of parliamentary seats, ensuring continued control even after power is formally transferred to a civilian-led administration.

The USDP was founded in 2010 after decades of military-led rule in the southeast Asian country, with the aim of serving as a proxy for the armed forces, also known as the Tatmadaw.

The party is chaired by a retired brigadier general and packed with other former high-ranking officers. It contested the poll with 1,018 candidates, a fifth of the total registered.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing is also expected to play a central role in the next administration.

He has defended the polls as a step toward stability, rejecting criticism from opponents and foreign governments and affirming that state responsibilities will be transferred to the elected government.

"Regardless of any changes among political parties or organizations in the country, Tatmadaw continues to carry out its responsibilities for national defence and security faithfully and without neglect up to the present day," he was quoted by state media as saying on Monday.

Turnout reached around 55% over all three phases, lower than the figure of around 70% in previous elections, including a 2015 vote that brought Suu Kyi to power, as well as the ill-fated 2020 poll, the results of which were cancelled by the junta before staging the coup.

Voting took place in 263 of Myanmar's 330 townships, some of which are not under the complete control of the junta.

It was cancelled in many areas due to ongoing fighting between the military and armed ethnic groups, as well as local resistance forces that emerged after the 2021 coup.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 06:52:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KJBIBLQJ7RMI5LD5OVLNX7K2Y4.jpg?auth=4b8b2f1a0a23b8025527d3757f3ea432209673a39c43aba1f8886326087b6ea6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Early warning of 'Apocalyptic Wasteland' in Gaza blocked by US envoys to Israel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/early-warning-apocalyptic-wasteland-gaza-blocked-by-us-envoys-israel-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Agency for International Development staffers in early 2024 drafted a warning to senior officials in Joe Biden’s administration: Northern Gaza had turned into an “Apocalyptic Wasteland” with dire shortages of food and medical aid.

Three months after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks and Israel's incursion into the Gaza Strip, the internal message laid out in gruesome detail scenes observed by United Nations staff who visited the area on a two-part humanitarian fact-finding mission in January and February.

The staff reported seeing a human femur and other bones on the roads, dead bodies abandoned in cars and “catastrophic human needs, particularly for food and safe drinking water.”

But the U.S. ambassador to Jerusalem, Jack Lew, and his deputy, Stephanie Hallett, blocked the cable from wider distribution within the United States government because they believed it lacked balance, according to interviews with four former officials and documents seen by Reuters.

Reuters is the first to report on the cable and why it was suppressed.

Hallett and Lew did not respond to requests for comment.

The February 2024 cable was one of five sent in the first part of that year documenting the rapidly deteriorating health, food and sanitary conditions and breakdown of social order for Palestinians living in Gaza resulting from Israel's military campaign, six former U.S. officials told Reuters.

Reuters saw one of those cables. The other four, also blocked by Lew and Hallett because of their concerns about balance, were described by four former officials.

Three former U.S. officials said that the descriptions were unusually graphic and would have commanded the attention of senior U.S. officials had the message been widely circulated within Joe Biden’s administration.

It would have also deepened scrutiny of a National Security Memorandum, issued by Biden that month, which conditioned the supply of U.S. intelligence and weapons on Israel’s compliance with international law, they said.

"While cables weren't the only means of providing humanitarian information ... they would have represented an acknowledgement by the ambassador of the reality of the situation in Gaza,” said Andrew Hall, then a crisis operations specialist for USAID.

The U.S. embassy in Jerusalem oversaw the language and distribution of most of the cables about Gaza, including those from other embassies in the region.

One former senior official said Lew and Hallett often told USAID leadership that the cables included information that had been widely reported in the media.

Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and representatives for former President Joe Biden did not respond to requests for comment about the fact that the cables never reached upper leadership of the U.S. government.

The Gaza war started with the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,250 people. The death toll in Gaza now stands at over 71,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry data.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by his side, President Donald Trump announced his Gaza peace plan in the Oval Office last September, but the fighting has not stopped. Some 481 people have been killed since the ceasefire, according to Palestinian health ministry data.

The Biden administration’s backing for Israel during the war deeply divided the Democratic Party and remains an unresolved issue for its political candidates.

More than 80% of Democrats believe that Israel’s military response in Gaza has been excessive and that the United States should help people in the enclave who are facing starvation, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last August.

As the cables were being drafted in early 2024, the White House and other senior U.S. officials were broadly aware of the worsening humanitarian situation in northern Gaza from National Security Council reporting, four former officials said. And humanitarian organizations were warning of famine risks.

"There are a lot of innocent people who are starving, a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying, and it's got to stop,” Biden told reporters at the White House in February 2024, describing Israel’s response in Gaza as “over the top.”

In January 2024, the embassy did approve the wider distribution of a cable about food insecurity throughout Gaza, and the information made it into the president’s daily briefing – a compilation by the intelligence community of the most important national security information and analysis.

The cable, which was described to Reuters, looked at the risk of famine in northern Gaza and the potential for severe food insecurity in the rest of the strip because of a lack of food deliveries. It was one of the first detailed reports from USAID into the rapidly deteriorating situation inside Gaza, including growing food insecurity in the south of the enclave.

That cable caught the attention of several senior White House officials, including deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, who told colleagues he was surprised by how quickly the food situation had deteriorated, according to two of the former U.S. officials.

Finer did not respond to a request for comment.

But senior U.S. officials were not receiving regular first-hand accounts because of restricted access to the area during an intense battle between Israel and Hamas, six former U.S. officials said.

“Simply put, humanitarian expertise was repeatedly sidelined, blocked, ignored,” a former member of USAID’s Middle East disaster response team said.

Until the USAID was reduced to a skeleton staff inside the State Department by the Trump administration, U.S. officials relied heavily on the agency’s reporting in situations where diplomatic presence and human intelligence were scarce.

Because USAID has had no staff inside Gaza since 2019, much of that reporting drew on information provided by U.N. agencies – including UNRWA, the Palestinian refugee agency - and international aid organizations funded by the U.S. government.

That dependence on third parties contributed to some Biden officials’ skepticism of USAID reporting, three former U.S. officials told Reuters.

Biden’s Middle East envoy Brett McGurk and his aides often asked in meetings if the USAID had verified the information and why it diverged, sometimes drastically, from Israel’s version of events, the three former officials said.

“The question was always like ‘where are all the skinny kids?’” one of the former officials said.

McGurk declined to comment.

The two former officials said Hallett sometimes asked for cables to be reframed or edited. She questioned the necessity of one cable, which focused on health, arguing that much of the information was in the public domain.

Two of the former Biden officials also said Hallett sometimes viewed USAID disaster team cables as too sensitive to be published during contentious negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal.

The February 2024 cable about northern Gaza drew on a fact-finding mission by UNRWA, the U.N. Mine Action Service, and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, according to two former U.S. officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.

The cable cleared USAID’s West Bank and Gaza mission offices and the State Department’s Office of Palestinian Affairs, before Hallett barred wider distribution, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. Cables only needed one sign-off from the head office of the embassy, and Hallett would not have barred its distribution without Lew’s knowledge or approval, two former officials said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 06:52:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CFVE2UHMWJOKVCXA55NEVACHGU.jpg?auth=b3ab5ec97e23be3bf220f015c1f95536255030e286af4fa5a049c942e685cc81&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: What is the New START nuclear treaty and why does its expiry matter?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/what-is-new-start-nuclear-treaty-why-does-its-expiry-matter-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - The last Russia-U.S. nuclear arms control treaty, known as New START, is due to expire on February 5.

Here is a guide to the treaty and why it matters.

New START was signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, an ally of Vladimir Putin who served a single term as Russia's president. At the time, relations between the two countries were undergoing a "reset". The treaty came into force the following year.

The treaty sets limits on strategic nuclear weapons - the kind that each side would use to strike the opponent's vital political, military and industrial centres in the event of a nuclear war. It caps the number of deployed strategic warheads at 1,550 on each side, with no more than 700 deployed ground- or submarine-launched missiles and bomber planes, and 800 launchers.

The treaty included a system of short-notice, on-site inspections so each side could satisfy itself that the other was complying. But in 2023, Putin suspended Moscow's participation because of U.S. support for Ukraine in the war with Russia. That brought a halt to inspections - which in any case had been suspended during the COVID pandemic - and forced each side to rely on its own intelligence assessments of what the other was doing. However, neither has accused the other of breaching the warhead limits, which remain in force.

The treaty text says it can only be extended once, and this has already happened - in 2021, just after Joe Biden became U.S. president. With expiry looming, Putin proposed last September that each side should agree informally to stick to the warhead limits for another year. U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to respond formally to that suggestion.

We don't know yet, and time is running short. In the U.S., there are arguments for and against accepting it. Those in favour say it would demonstrate political will to avoid an arms race and buy time to figure out what happens next. Others say the U.S. should free itself now from the New START limits in order to boost its arsenal to take account of a rapid nuclear build-up by China, and that doing otherwise would send a signal of weakness.

If Moscow and Washington cease observing mutual limits on their long-range nuclear arsenals, it will mark the end of more than half a century of constraints on these weapons. The expiry of New START leaves a void, as no talks have taken place on a successor. Arms control advocates fear that raises nuclear risks, especially at a time of heightened international tension because of wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Experts say the value of nuclear treaties lies not just in setting numerical limits but in creating a stable, transparent framework to prevent arms races from spiralling out of control.

Each side would be free to increase its missile numbers and deploy hundreds more strategic warheads. However, experts say this poses some technical and logistical challenges and would not happen overnight - it would take at least the best part of a year to make significant changes. Longer term, the concern is that an unregulated arms race would ensue, in which each side would keep on adding weapons based on worst-case assumptions about what the other was planning.

Trump says he wants a new, better treaty but experts say this would be a long, hard process. A successor treaty would probably need to address other classes of nuclear weapons including short- and intermediate-range, as well as "exotic" new systems that Russia has developed since New START was agreed, such as the Burevestnik cruise missile and Poseidon torpedo.

Apart from the fact such deals are complex and technical, there isn't even agreement on who should take part. While Trump has stated he wants to pursue "denuclearisation" with both Russia and China, Beijing says it is unreasonable and unrealistic to ask it to join three-way talks with countries whose arsenals are still many times larger than its own. Russia says the nuclear forces of NATO members Britain and France should also be up for negotiation, which those countries reject.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 06:53:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ARAE2LIGVBKO7AOC6QUEEMUPEI.jpg?auth=19bebc611f3d8d2e4dc2e5913fb325f9ac55d14b4d3917693dfb2f79c6041219&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump says he hopes to avoid military action against Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260130-live-trump-says-hopefully-won-t-need-iran-military-action</link><description>President Donald Trump said ⁠on Thursday he planned to speak with Iran, even as the US dispatched another warship to the Middle East and Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said ​the military would be ready to carry out whatever the ‍president decided.

Perhaps. Nine French rap, pop and urban music composers recently joined forces with Afrobeats artists to produce 60 tracks for international audiences.

In under a week, French, English, Nigerian Pidgin and Creole blended in musical melodies for future hits at the premises of renowned Nigerian label Mavin Records in the economic and cultural hub, Lagos.

The label produces Afrobeats stars such as Rema, Ladipoe, Ayra Starr and Magixx.

"If one or two songs hit like Ayra Starr's 'Rush' or Rema's 'Calm Down' then we would have achieved it all," said Akotchaye Okio, the director of international artists' rights group Sacem, which organised the camp in collaboration with the French embassy and Mavin Records.

The Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers (Sacem) has hosted similar tie-ups outside Africa , showcasing different musical genres in the United States, France , South Korea and the Netherlands .

Afrobeats, which blends traditional African rhythms with contemporary pop sounds, has become one of the most popular genres in the world, driven largely by the Nigerian diaspora.

Born in the 1970s through the influence of Fela Kuti, regarded as the father of Afrobeats, the genre continues to attract a global audience.

After the camp, Mavin Records' artists will "choose the beats they prefer and record over them", said Okio, in the waiting room at the record label's offices, a building decorated with posters and gold and diamond plaques from its heavyweights.

Nigerian and French artists were divided into groups according to themes.

In one of the studios, French producer PSK, whose real name is Maxime Pasquier, and his Nigerian counterpart Dunnie Alexandra Lawal produced several tracks together.

Like some of the other participants, the 21-year-old Frenchman, who had always yearned for an international collaboration, had never been to Africa.

"What I found interesting and different from the way we work in France is how people let songs carry them away," said PSK, who has worked with major French artists such as Ninho, Jok'Air and Genezio.

"They explore their ideas much further" to compose songs that are both mellow and rhythmic, the beatmaker and pianist said.

Mavin Records' singer and songwriter Elestee, whose real name is Treasure Apiafi Banigo, fine-tuned the compositions.

"This song with the piano puts you in a good mood while also making you thoughtful. I could listen to it at six in the morning while driving, with a smile on my face. The audience will love it," she said.

For Lawal, the collaborations can only be positive.

"Afrobeats might have originated in west Africa, but the future of Afrobeats is international," the Nigerian producer said.

Kizito Ahams, a senior licensing and publishing manager at Mavin Records, said such collaborations met a growing demand for Afrobeats on the international scene, especially in France.

Tie-ups between French and Nigerian artists have soared in recent years.

Last year, Tiakola and Asake released the track "Badman Gangsta", while Joe Dwet File and Burna Boy enjoyed a huge success with their hit "4 Kampe II".

"In every release, when you look at the top of the charts, there is always a track influenced by Afro sounds, especially Afrobeats" in France, said 24-year-old French producer Nassim Diane, also known as Voluptyk.

He attributes the vibrancy of the Nigerian music scene to the talent of the artists and the important role music plays in everyday life in the country.

"There's music everywhere. As soon as you arrive, it's on the buses, in the hotels. It is everywhere. It's truly a country of music," he said.

For Shannon, a singer-songwriter from Martinique , one of the most important parts of the camp was the bridging of different styles that are rarely mashed up, such as Afrobeats and Shatta, a Caribbean mix of dancehall, trap and electronic sounds – to open up new creative paths.

"It blends together beautifully," she said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 07:43:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cb4ada30-fdad-11f0-ac7d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25202734587276.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian Kurdish-led SDF agree ceasefire, phased integration deal with government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-kurdish-led-sdf-agree-ceasefire-phased-integration-deal-with-government-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Kurdish-led Democratic Syrian Forces said on Friday they had agreed to a comprehensive ceasefire and a phased integration of military and administrative bodies into the Syrian state under a broad deal, following recent clashes.

The follow-up round of talks was supposed to take place in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, but Zelenskiy said that he did not know when the next meeting would take place.

"It is very important for us that everyone we agreed with be present at the meeting, because everyone is expecting feedback," he told reporters in remarks released by his office on Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump's top envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who attended the previous round of talks, would not participate in the weekend meeting in Abu Dhabi.

"But the date or the location may change – because, in our view, something is happening in the situation between the United States and Iran. And those developments could likely affect the timing," Zelenskiy said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:40:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NKE2AXPYLBMZ7ODDI6GYI7ZV4E.jpg?auth=4d377c0ab442e5066e208233c4095c1a97c4d71d855163b8509196ca061684c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea, Japan defence ministers agree to upgrade cooperation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-japan-defence-ministers-agree-upgrade-cooperation-2026-01-30/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The defence ministers of South Korea and Japan agreed on Friday to upgrade defence cooperation and plan to work together in incorporating artificial intelligence and unmanned weapon systems, South Korea's Defence Ministry said.

Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and his South Korean counterpart Ahn Gyu-back held talks in Yokosuka, Japan, and agreed to conduct joint naval search-and-rescue drills, it said in a statement.

The two Asian allies of the United States have in recent months drawn closer in political ties under new leaders, as they looked to put behind years of frosty relations rooted in Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula in the early 20th century.

Ahn and Koizumi discussed working together to ensure peace and stability in the region amid the challenges of the global security environment and continuing defence cooperation with the United States, the ministry said.

The meeting follows talks they held in September in South Korea.

Earlier, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Koizumi told Ahn defence cooperation between the two countries, and with the United States, was more important than ever.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:41:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4P7M2DOPXBID3ISUWHEJ2E4N6M.jpg?auth=c267b53a37e8ee40442053b70dc7783a22c3b2a62f692fa007fd65b82e773b33&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump brands Minneapolis shooting victim 'agitator and perhaps insurrectionist'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-trump-brands-minneapolis-shooting-victim-agitator-and-perhaps-insurrectionist</link><description>US President Donald Trump said Friday that the man shot dead by US federal agents in Minneapolis last week was an "agitator and perhaps insurrectionist."

"Agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist, Alex Pretti's stock has gone way down with the just released video of him screaming and spitting in the face of a very calm and under control ICE Officer," he posted on Truth Social.

Trump was referring to footage reportedly showing Pretti in a scuffle with federal agents 11 days before he was shot dead.

The shooting death of Pretti, an intensive-care nurse, by federal agents spurred widespread public outrage, prompting the Trump administration to de-escalate operations in the ‌region.

His killing came just weeks after another activist, Renee Good, was fatally shot blocks away during a separate immigration operation.

The deaths created outrage over the conduct of federal officers operating under Trump's aggressive enforcement campaign.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:42:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0a5123ea-fdb0-11f0-8fa2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2258955724.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian forces capture three villages in Ukraine, state media report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-forces-capture-two-villages-ukraine-tass-reports-2026-01-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Russian troops captured three more villages across two regions of Ukraine, state news agencies reported on Friday, citing the Defence Ministry.

He follows Canadian counterpart Mark Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with allies.

European leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.

"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States," said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.

From the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.

But these are "superficial gestures amid stalled global growth," said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.

"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China," she said. "They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries."

And they benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China as the world's " reliable partner ", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.

"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world," Quelch added.

The deals clinched by Western powers on such visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.

On his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca (AZN.L) , opens new tab unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.

He got nothing beyond "frank dialogue" on tension arising from China's increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.

British and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.

Similarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.

And even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing , after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.

China's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.

Its trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.

Such a pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.

Its exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.

"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China," said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.

"China hardly provides a safe harbour for countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects of U.S. tariffs," added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.

Still, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.

Resetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.

The Asian giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.

The visits by Starmer and Carney are "a propaganda coup for Beijing," said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, "This is not a pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing."

He added, "No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time."</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:35:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4CRQDQE7VO3TKACWVKYRVMTKI.jpg?auth=1b6a86af4d0af5a4bfe1fd581509145fe1cd299cdb4e8bcaab212d8f98a17502&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German commuter transport faces 'standstill' on Monday amid call for strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/german-commuter-transport-faces-standstill-monday-amid-call-strike-2026-01-30/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 30 (Reuters) - German bus and commuter rail services will likely grind to a halt across the country as the main public services trade union called for an almost nationwide strike in a dispute with municipal and state employers over work conditions.

They have arrested two people but one suspect remains at large, he said.

"This is a record catch," Dacic said in a statement, adding that police had also seized four assault rifles and an anti-tank rocket launcher.

Cannabis production remains illegal in Serbia, although activists are promoting its legalisation for medicinal use.

Dacic said the investigation would ascertain the origin of the cannabis.

Serbia, which wants to join the European Union, has stepped up efforts against drug trafficking and production in recent years.

"Within hours of Russian drones with Starlink connectivity appearing over Ukrainian cities, the Ministry of Defence team promptly contacted SpaceX and proposed ways to resolve the problem," Fedorov said on social media.

"I'm grateful to SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell and personally to Elon Musk for their swift response."

Fedorov and the US-based Institute for the Study of War said earlier this week that the Russian army used Starlink satellites to guide its drone attacks deep into Ukraine.

Russia has been battering the country's energy grid as temperatures tumble below freezing and the invasion's fourth anniversary looms.

The ISW said that "Russian forces are increasingly using Starlink satellite systems to extend the range of BM-35 strike drones to conduct mid-range strikes against the Ukrainian rear".

Starlink is also widely used by the Ukrainian army for communications.

"Elon Musk's decision to urgently activate Starlink and send the first batch of terminals to Ukraine at the start of the full-scale invasion was critically important for our country's resilience," Fedorov said.

"Western technologies must continue to support the democratic world and protect civilians, not be used for terror and the destruction of peaceful cities."</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:44:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/76edd494-fdc4-11f0-bda8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-14T113541Z-1679002033-RC2X0JAZHQ92-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-MINISTERS-DEFENCE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria, Kurdish-led SDF reach integration deal after weeks of clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260130-syria-kurdish-led-sdf-reach-integration-deal-after-weeks-of-clashes</link><description>Syria 's government and Kurdish forces reached a comprehensive agreement on Friday that included the gradual integration of the Kurds' forces and administration into the central state, following weeks of clashes between the two sides that led to a ceasefire .

The agreement, shared by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and Syrian state television, came after the Kurds lost control of swathes of territory to government forces during weeks of fighting.

They now find themselves restricted to Kurdish-majority areas, having once held sway over much of north and northeastern Syria.

The agreement stipulates that government forces will enter the Kurdish-controlled cities of Hasakeh and Qamishli in the northeast, while three Syrian army brigades will be created out of the SDF.

Damascus and the SDF on Sunday extended their ceasefire for 15 days while pursuing talks on integration.

Syria's new Islamist authorities, who took over after the ousting of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, are seeking to extend state control across Syria.

Syrian security forces will "be deployed in the cities of Hasakeh and Qamishli" in the northeast, currently controlled by Kurdish forces, while a separate brigade will be created for the Kurdish-majority town of Kobane in the north.

The agreement deals a blow to the Kurdish minority's hopes for self-rule, after having established a de facto autonomous administration in areas under their control during Syria's 13-year civil war.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:44:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c02ce11c-fdc0-11f0-8134-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TV363-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Viktor Orban’s vampiric presence in Transylvania</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260130-viktor-orban-s-vampiric-presence-in-transylvania-romania-hungary-szekely</link><description>“I refuse to say that I'm from Romania or Hungary , I just will not say that,” states 25-year-old Dalma. “So I always say, ‘I'm from Transylvania, comma, Romania'.”

Dalma is keen to set the record straight: she was born into a Hungarian family in the Szekely Land, a sub-region of Transylvania. She is Romanian by nationality, but she grew up immersed in Hungarian culture and language . She therefore sees herself first and foremost through this identity: Hungarian, from Transylvania, in Romania.

In her home region, Dalma's case is far from isolated: the Szekely Land is home to more Hungarians than Romanians. Some villages are even exclusively Hungarian-speaking, while larger cities are bilingual. In Dalma’s native town of Targu Mures, known in Hungarian as Marosvasarhely, street names, signs and inscriptions at building entrances are all in both languages.

“I feel Romanian, Transylvania is a part of Romania,” says Radu, a 24-year-old medical student who also grew up in Targu Mures, in a Romanian family. He considers himself “100% Romanian” and like many Romanians in the region, he speaks almost no Hungarian, although he does acknowledge that knowing the language would be a significant advantage for practising medicine there.

The presence of a large Hungarian community in Transylvania dates back centuries. And for good reason: until 1920, the region was part of Hungary. At the end of World War I , the Treaty of Trianon was signed in Versailles, marking the dismantling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Thus the Kingdom of Hungary lost part of its territory, and a large number of its Hungarian-speaking citizens, including those in Transylvania.

Today, the two communities cohabit rather peacefully in Transylvania, but some people still feel strongly about the issue. In 2018, several Hungarian parties in the region presented a plan for territorial and cultural autonomy, based on the model of Catalonia in Spain or South Tyrol in Italy. To date, this initiative has not been successful.

“It's a very taboo subject,” says Radu. “We have to respect our minorities, (...) [but] personally I view Transylvania as a part of Romania. I truly believe that Transylvania belongs to Romania.”

In neighbouring Hungary, the highly conservative Viktor Orban continues to present this chapter in Transylvanian history as a gaping wound for his country. Although in many ways a rhetorical tool, the Hungarian prime minister's attachment to Transylvania is also reflected in very real investments in the region, with Hungary financing schools, nurseries, media outlets, places of worship, stadiums, and more.

In 2011, Orban also decreed that it was no longer necessary to reside on Hungarian territory to obtain Hungarian citizenship. Speaking the language and proving one's Hungarian origins have since then deemed sufficient criteria. Following his decree, over one million Hungarians residing abroad, most of them in Romania, obtained citizenship. And along with it, the right to vote…

Dalma also obtained a Hungarian passport, and she is grateful for it. She now lives and works in the Hungarian capital Budapest. But she also views Orban’s measures with skepticism. “When [being granted citizenship] is tied with the idea that (...) ‘I'm giving you the right to vote,’ I think it transfers a different message,” she says.

Even though the votes of the Hungarian diaspora in Transylvania only account for a very small number of seats in the Hungarian Parliament, Orban may seek to stack the odds in his favour by securing them ahead of the next Hungarian parliamentary elections in April 2026.

Meanwhile, some right-wing Romanian politicians are playing the “Romanian patriotism” card to garner voter support, scapegoating minorities, including the large Hungarian minority, for their own political aims.

The top military officer at the Civil-Military Command Center, a three-star lieutenant general, is expected to be replaced by a U.S. commander of a lower rank, while the top civilian has returned to his job as U.S. ambassador to Yemen.

The CMCC was set up in October in the first phase of President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war, and is meant to supervise the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, facilitate the entry of aid and shape Gaza policy.

The overhaul in its leadership comes amid what western officials and diplomats say is growing uncertainty over the body's future role, as Trump pursues the next phase of his plan including by setting up a "Board of Peace" of foreign dignitaries to supervise Gaza policy.

Lieutenant-General Patrick Frank, the top commander of U.S. Army forces in the Middle East, has been leading the CMCC in southern Israel since it was established. The U.S. military announced last month that he was being promoted to deputy head of U.S. Central Command.

Four diplomats told Reuters he is expected to leave as soon as next week. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The State Department said in a statement that the CMCC's civilian lead, career diplomat Steve Fagin, had returned to his post as U.S. Ambassador to Yemen after holding "the transitional role as civilian lead for CMCC". The department did not say who would replace him. The four diplomats said a replacement for Fagin had not yet been announced.

Diplomats have said the centre has failed to increase aid flows or achieve political change, with some U.S. partners now reconsidering their involvement.

Under the first phase of the ceasefire plan, major fighting has been halted, hostages were released in exchange for prisoners and Israeli forces have withdrawn from nearly half of the Gaza Strip.

But the warring sides accuse each other of violations. More than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed. The vast majority of Gaza's more than 2 million people now live in a small strip of land outside an Israeli-occupied zone, mostly in makeshift tents or damaged buildings.

Trump has announced the second phase of his plan this month, under which Israel would withdraw further and Hamas would relinquish day-to-day control to an internationally backed administration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:29:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6FYCIHXBDVNUTMR5LXGPVYEIUU.jpg?auth=b0fc3d6b0d28740ad82a2b1482dba19b86cd2bd52b9f41f56afb289e6fb52894&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nationwide protests, walkouts planned over fatal ICE shootings in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nationwide-protests-walkouts-planned-over-fatal-ice-shootings-minneapolis-2026-01-30/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Student organizers have called for walkouts and protests across the United States on Friday to demand that federal immigration agents withdraw from Minnesota, after two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens generated public outrage.

The call for a general strike follows last Friday's protests when thousands marched through Minneapolis in the bitter cold, urging an end to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in their city.

Protesters said they want to step up pressure even after Trump said he would "de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota.

"We want this to be more of a sustained movement, so going forward: more striking, more protesting," Brianna Jackson, part of the Black Student Union at the University of Minnesota, said in a video promoting the strike.

On Thursday, U.S. border czar Tom Homan, newly installed as leader of Trump's immigration enforcement surge in Minneapolis, said federal officers would focus on targeted operations , shifting away from the broad street sweeps.

Newly issued internal guidance from a high-ranking official of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency directs federal officers to refrain from unnecessary communication and engagement with "agitators" to avoid "inflaming the situation."

"No work. No school. No shopping. Stop funding ICE," ran a slogan on the website nationalshutdown.org that listed 250 sites for Friday's protests across 46 states and in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.

Voters ousted the Democrats from the White House and returned Trump to power in 2024 partly out of frustration with a surge in illegal immigration to the United States.

But after weeks of videos showing aggressive tactics by heavily armed and masked officers in Minneapolis, American approval of Trump's immigration policy has fallen to its lowest in his second term, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.

A majority of respondents said his crackdown had gone too far.

A day after last Friday's protests, immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse at a hospital for military veterans.

Many people were already upset at the shooting death of Renee Good, 37, a mother of three, in her car on January 7.

Good and Pretti had been monitoring immigration officers, as part of a movement that enabled witnesses to capture both shootings on cellphone video.

At a memorial at the site where Pretti was killed, a woman laid a bouquet of flowers and quietly wept on Thursday, saying she felt moved to protest in his memory.

"I’m absolutely not spending any money tomorrow," said Stacy, who asked that her last name not be used. "It’s my little way of being a voice for those who don’t have them, like Alex."

In the southern state of Georgia, students at 90 high schools from Atlanta to Savannah plan to walk out of class on Friday.

"We are saying no business as usual while ICE is allowed to terrorize our communities," said Claudia Andrade, an immigrant rights organizer with Atlanta's Party for Socialism and Liberation.

On the eve of the protests, police in Washington, D.C., arrested 54 demonstrators of different religious affiliations who sat on the floor at the Hart Senate Office Building, holding banners that read "Do Justice, Love kindness, Abolish ICE."

They were demanding that the U.S. Senate withhold funding to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:30:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIXUNSPISNLHRBUQ6WEVRKIH64.jpg?auth=3cb69237ca95085993dc78ba657f0f0262406d97b180cec7be3d01a5cb006b8e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Patagonia wildfires stir criticism over Milei austerity cuts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/patagonia-wildfires-stir-criticism-over-milei-austerity-cuts-2026-01-30/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Patagonia forest fires have destroyed an area more than twice the size of Buenos Aires, stirring criticism over austerity measures under President Javier Milei that have significantly cut aid resources.

On Thursday, the government said it would declare an emergency in the southern provinces of Chubut, Rio Negro, Neuquen and La Pampa to help unlock funds.

Wildfires are common in Patagonia during the summer months, but the current fires have breached Los Alerces National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site famed for its alerce trees, which can live more than 3,600 years, making them the world's second-longest-living tree species.

The current forest fires are concentrated in the province of Chubut, where firefighters are battling strong winds and high temperatures. The government of Chubut has said that more than 110,000 acres (44,515 hectares) have been destroyed so far. The first forest fires of the season began in December.

Milei’s government has pursued aggressive fiscal tightening dubbed "chainsaw" spending cuts and environmental groups have criticized budget cuts that have significantly reduced funding for wildfire prevention and response.

Argentina's 2026 budget slashed funding for the National Fire Management Service by 71% in real terms compared with the previous year, according to FARN, a local non-profit group.

"These fires are absolutely predictable," said Ariel Slipak, an economist at FARN, adding that Milei's government had prioritized a balanced budget over emergency funds "at all costs."

Argentina's Ministry of Security on Thursday said it would allocate about $69 million to support fire fighting efforts.

Milei has previously referred to climate change as a "socialist lie," drawing criticism from environmental activists.

His government has said it is also considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the world's main climate pact, following the example of U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally of Milei, who exited the accord this year.

"To continue denying or underestimating the effects of climate change, which science and the ecological movement have long warned about, is a political irresponsibility that will be paid for by forests and homes," Hernan Giardini of Greenpeace in Argentina in a statement.

The descriptions, based on Reuters interviews with more than two dozen witnesses, included four accounts of fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) telling families the children would be used as slaves, to herd animals.

The RSF has been locked in war with Sudan's army since April 2023 over which side will run a country endowed with rich mineral reserves, plentiful arable land and Red Sea ports. While human rights groups have reported alleged war crimes by both sides including the recruitment of child combatants, the abduction and enslavement of children by the RSF and allied militias has not been previously reported by other media.

The 26 witnesses spoke to Reuters in person or by phone after fleeing to the North Darfur town of Tawila or to eastern Chad. They described 23 separate incidents in which at least 56 children aged between two months and 17 years were abducted in attacks dating back to 2023.

Six described their own relatives being taken.

Reuters could not determine how many children in total have been abducted, and could not independently verify the witness accounts or trace what happened to the children after they were taken.

The RSF did not respond to requests for comment about the reported abductions and abuse of minors and killing of their parents. Previously it has denied deliberately targeting civilians and says it has placed fighters suspected of abuses under investigation.

Three legal experts said the abductions may constitute unlawful imprisonment and torture, and amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The accounts gathered by Reuters may also constitute acts of enslavement and slave trading that violate international laws and multiple international treaties, said one of the experts, Patricia Sellers, an international lawyer and former special adviser for slavery crimes at the International Criminal Court.

Sheldon Yett, head of U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Sudan, said he had not received any reports of children being kidnapped specifically to be used as slaves or to tend to livestock, but said the accounts gathered by Reuters "are sadly consistent with the broader pattern of grave violations we continue to see against children". He did not elaborate.

The RSF evolved from the so-called Janjaweed militias that fought alongside government forces under the rule of former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir and were accused of genocide in Darfur in the early 2000s. During that conflict, the Janjaweed abducted children and forced them to do domestic work, look after livestock, or work as sex slaves, according to reports at the time by activists and human rights groups.

Asked for comment on the witness accounts of abductions during the current war, the Sudanese army said such acts were "consistent with those of the Janjaweed militia during the previous regime."

Sudan's army-backed government "cannot accept leaving citizens hostage to the militias' violence," it said in a statement to Reuters.

The RSF has previously denied responsibility for atrocities blamed on its fighters in Darfur.

The war has killed tens of thousands of people and led to famine and disease, in what the United Nations has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis. The RSF and its allies have been blamed for mass killings against ethnic non-Arabs.

In late October the RSF consolidated its grip over Darfur when it took al-Fashir, a city that had sheltered many displaced people and which the paramilitary force had attacked and besieged for 18 months. Witnesses accused it of abuses including summary killings .

During a briefing at the U.N. Security Council on January 20, deputy ICC prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan said her office was investigating alleged crimes committed by the RSF in al-Fashir, with a particular focus on violence against women, girls, and children.

Khan said that based on the evidence collected so far, her office believes war crimes and crimes against humanity occurred in the city in late October during the culmination of the RSF's siege of al-Fashir.

The RSF did not respond to a request for comment on Khan's assertion.

In most cases, the witnesses described RSF fighters taking children whose parents had recently been killed, at gunpoint or after beating the children.

In some cases, six witnesses said, the children had seen their parents being killed.

Ten witnesses interviewed by Reuters in Chad described RSF fighters abducting children during the takeover of al-Fashir.

Abductions took place in the city and along the road to Tawila, a town about 50 km (31 miles) to the west where the U.N. estimates approximately 665,000 displaced people are sheltering, the witnesses said.

Madina Adam Khamis, 38, said she was held captive at al-Fashir University with other women and children after they tried to flee the city on October 26.

At the university she said she watched an RSF fighter known as Abu Lulu shoot many of the captives, including a woman seven months pregnant, and 10 children.

She said Abu Lulu and his group of fighters took three girls and two boys aged between two and five years old, whose mothers they had killed, and put them in the back of a Toyota Land Cruiser. Another fighter took a 2-month-old baby from the arms of one of the girls and sat in the vehicle with the baby as well, she said. She said the children were from al-Fashir, but did not know their names.

"There was one child who lost her mother, the mother died in front of our eyes, and the child was touching her mother to try to get her to wake up," Khamis said.

Reuters could not independently corroborate Khamis' account.

The RSF told Reuters in December that Abu Lulu was in its custody and it was investigating him and several other RSF soldiers regarding abuses committed in the aftermath of the takeover of al-Fashir.

In the wake of the RSF seizing the city, videos online showing Abu Lulu shooting dead unarmed captives, some of which have been verified by Reuters, gained global attention.

The RSF did not respond to a Reuters request to speak to Abu Lulu.

Mohammed Adam Bashir, 38, said he saw RSF fighters take two boys of around four to five years old and a girl of about three years old, after shooting their mothers dead, as he was fleeing north from al-Fashir to Torro village on October 26. He said the fighters put the children in the back seat of an armoured Land Cruiser.

"They pulled the children away from their two mothers who were dying," he said. "They took them to the car and then they came back to ask us for money."

None of the witnesses interviewed by Reuters saw what happened after children were taken. One, Abdulmajeed Abdulkarim, 28, said he heard children crying for their parents at night while he was being held captive in a bush area close to the village of Garney in the days after al-Fashir fell.

Researchers who have interviewed people displaced by the violence in Darfur collected similar testimonies.

A report last month by Amnesty International documented the account , opens new tab of one child who said he was abducted by RSF fighters in Zamzam displacement camp close to al-Fashir, and forced to work.

He said he was chained at night and forced to herd sheep by day for more than six weeks.

His captor called his relatives to demand a ransom of five million Sudanese pounds ($1,500). After they paid, he was released, Amnesty said.

Reuters, which didn't independently verify Amnesty's findings, has previously reported that the RSF has held large groups of adult survivors from al-Fashir for ransom. An RSF adviser said at the time that rivals disguised in RSF uniforms were responsible for most such cases.

Seven witnesses who spoke to Reuters said fighters referred to the children they took as "falungiat", or children of falungi, a term that roughly translates to house slaves and is used as a derogatory term for allies of the Sudanese army.

The witnesses, who were mainly from the Zaghawa tribe, said fighters from the RSF's Arab-dominated force addressed them with racial slurs. The RSF did not respond to a question about possible racial motivations for the abductions.

Several of the witnesses described the RSF taking children alongside seized livestock. Four said RSF fighters told them the children would be used to look after animals - a role commonly assigned to children in the region.

Sixteen witnesses described abductions that took place before the takeover of al-Fashir.

Imam Ali, 26, said he fled besieged al-Fashir in March 2025 with his family and was attacked southeast of Tawila by RSF fighters who arrived with camels, motorcycles, and a car. The fighters shot two of his brothers and abducted the other two, aged 15 and 13, along with 60 of their sheep, he said. He hasn't heard from the kidnapped brothers since.

Fatima Yahya, 47, said she left Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, in October 2023, and was stopped by a group of RSF fighters in a village called Karamaje, as she fled to al-Fashir with other families.

There the fighters blindfolded two boys and one girl of about nine years old and put the children in the middle seats of three double-cabin Land Cruisers, with two fighters on either side, she said. She said she did not know the children but that they were from Nyala, and two had lost their mothers in bombardments there.

"They told us the kids would look after the animals," Yahya said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:30:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D5MLLLLLCROITKTMZ3DAT4DVBM.jpg?auth=63c41339ecd28b16fdf69f7cbd94a499ff33f71da4263ae3a498aca861d7a426&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US energy assistance for Ukraine stalls as winter bites</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-energy-assistance-ukraine-stalls-winter-bites-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. and European officials are growing increasingly worried as hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. energy assistance promised to Ukraine remain unreleased, even as a bone-cold winter pushes the nation's war‑damaged power grid to the brink, said several sources familiar with the matter.

The funds in question were originally slated to help Ukraine import liquefied natural gas and rebuild energy infrastructure damaged by Russian strikes, said the sources, who include a U.S. official and a Ukrainian official. The U.S. Agency for International Development had notified Congress during former President Joe Biden's administration of its intention to disburse at least some of the funds, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

After USAID was effectively shuttered in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, however, some of the funds fell into what the sources described as bureaucratic limbo.

Some administration officials have argued for the State Department - which oversees what is left of USAID - to disburse the funds, the sources said. Others have instead pushed for a role for the Development Finance Corporation, a previously obscure federal agency expected to play a major role in Ukraine's reconstruction.

The Trump administration has paused or delayed Ukraine aid before. For example, the U.S. has temporarily halted military aid shipments several times, in some cases to force concessions from Ukraine amid ongoing U.S.-led peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.

This time, the delay in energy aid appears to stem from bureaucratic confusion and infighting instead of an attempt to exert leverage over Ukraine, two of the sources said.

Still, the stalled aid - valued at roughly $250 million by two of the sources - has stirred frustration in recent weeks, as Russian attacks on power plants and pipelines have left millions of Ukrainians exposed to brutal winter cold, according to a Ukrainian official, a U.S. official, a European official and two others with knowledge of the matter.

One source said aides on Capitol Hill were aware of the stalled funds and were seeking additional information.

A Ukrainian official said Kyiv was also aware, but fearful that broaching the topic could provoke diplomatic blowback. U.S. President Donald Trump has at times reacted coolly to Ukrainian requests for assistance.

Halyna Yusypiuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, said Ukraine and the U.S. were working closely on energy-related matters.

"(The) Ukrainian and American sides are working on a daily basis to strengthen the stability of Ukraine's energy system," she wrote in an e-mail.

A Development Finance Corporation spokesperson said the agency is "working closely with all interagency partners with the goal of supporting Ukraine's reconstruction efforts and advancing shared economic security and prosperity for the United States and Ukraine."

The White House's Office of Management and Budget, in an apparent reference to a critical USAID inspector general report, suggested energy assistance funds for Ukraine had been misused in the past.

"The Biden Admin support to Ukraine's energy sector was a disaster, we have an USAID IG report showcasing how contractors in Ukraine likely lost millions worth of energy products due to no oversight, corruption, theft, etc," a spokesperson wrote in an email.

"President Trump has done more than anyone to bring peace to this brutal war."

The sweeping changes to the federal bureaucracy imposed by the Trump administration have complicated U.S. efforts to distribute aid to its allies.

The de facto elimination of USAID, for instance, has caused confusion about how and when to disburse funds, several sources told Reuters.

Additionally, the National Security Council, which in previous administrations would sort out conflicts between intelligence, national security and diplomatic agencies, has been radically downsized.

Beyond this, energy assistance for Ukraine has long been slow to go out the door amid concerns about widespread corruption in the nation's power sector, said one source.

Residents of Ukraine's major cities, including Kyiv, are currently struggling with power outages that are lasting hours or days, as well as cuts to heating that leave homes as cold as 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius). Water supplies have also been disrupted.

The rumble of generators is a near-constant presence on city streets, which are often plunged into widespread darkness in the evenings. Overnight lows in Kyiv are expected to fall to around -12 Fahrenheit next week.

Ukrainian officials told foreign diplomats in Kyiv in recent days that all of the country's major energy plants had been "damaged or ruined," according to a presentation seen by Reuters. The presentation identified roughly 675 million euros ($807 million) in unfunded energy needs.

"They're preparing for the fact that people in the upper (stories) of apartment buildings are going to freeze to death," Mykola Murskyj, the director of advocacy at Razom, a non-profit group supporting Ukraine, said of next week's expected cold snap.

"They're preparing to retrieve the bodies. It's extremely grim."</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q2IYZCGQPFL77DGVIAYNZ2MTWY.jpg?auth=1740058c7d54976ebdada0c6cc97c579f8bb785aea1735ae024e5d44d1be0253&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa declares Israel's chargé d'affaires persona non grata</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/south-africa-declares-israels-charg-daffaires-persona-non-grata-2026-01-30/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - South Africa has declared Israel's chargé d'affaires Ariel Seidman persona non grata, its foreign affairs ministry said on Friday.

It accused Seidman of "unacceptable violations of diplomatic norms and practice which pose a direct challenge to South Africa's sovereignty".

"These violations include the repeated use of official Israeli social media platforms to launch insulting attacks against His Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa, and a deliberate failure to inform DIRCO (South Africa's foreign affairs ministry) of purported visits by senior Israeli officials," the ministry said.

Israel's diplomatic mission in Pretoria did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

His declarations and executive orders have led to the dismantling of slavery exhibits, the restoration of Confederate statues and other moves that civil rights advocates say could reverse decades of social progress.

Here are some actions that Trump has taken to reshape American historical sites and cultural bodies since returning to the White House:

Trump signed an executive order just weeks after taking office targeting what he said was the spread of "anti-American ideology" at the Smithsonian Institution and calling for the ideology's removal from the vast museum and research complex, a premier exhibition space for U.S. history and culture.

The order also directed the Interior Department to restore federal parks, monuments and memorials that had been "removed or changed in the last years to perpetuate a false revision of history."

Last August, Trump decried in a social media post what he said was an excessive focus on " how bad slavery was ." This month, in an interview with the New York Times, he said civil rights protections hurt white people, when asked about policies that followed from the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The NAACP, the largest U.S. civil rights group, said Trump's remarks were laying the groundwork to roll back social progress. Racial justice group Black Lives Matter said , opens new tab Trump's remarks showed he wanted to deny the atrocities of slavery.

Following Trump's March 2025 executive order on anti-American ideology, the U.S. Interior Department said all national parks' interpretive signage - the plaques and panels that explain sites and events - was under review as the Trump administration attempted to reshape public spaces and museums.

U.S. National Park Service staff subsequently removed a slavery exhibit on January 22 from a Philadelphia historic site where George Washington once lived. The exhibit included a reference to Washington's ownership of enslaved people.

The Washington Post reported that U.S. officials have also ordered national parks to remove dozens of signs and displays related to slavery and the mistreatment of Native Americans by settlers.

The National Park Service said last August it would reinstall a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike that had been toppled and vandalized in 2020 during racial justice protests after George Floyd's murder.

Civil rights groups say such moves undermine the acknowledgment of critical phases of American history. "Stripping enslaved people's stories from museum exhibits, monuments, and digital archives is not neutrality - it is erasure," the NAACP said , opens new tab .

Trump harshly criticized the Smithsonian in a social media post last year, saying it would face the same process as colleges and universities whose funding came under threat for policies that displeased the Trump administration.

The 180-year-old Smithsonian, which includes 21 museums and galleries and the National Zoo, receives most of its budget from the U.S. Congress but is independent of the government in decision-making.

The White House launched an internal review of some Smithsonian museums last year, saying it would assess the tone and historical framing of exhibition text, websites, educational materials and digital content. The Smithsonian said it would engage "constructively."

Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center and filled its board with allies last year. In December, the institution's board voted to rename it the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Trump has previously criticized the institution as too liberal.

Many groups and artists have since withdrawn from the center, citing the Republican leader's takeover. Democrats, noting that the center's name was established by Congress, have said Trump's rebranding has no force of law. John F. Kennedy's family denounced the renaming as undermining the slain president's legacy.

The Trump administration announced last April that the Environmental Protection Agency would close a one-room museum at its headquarters on the agency's history, citing cost cuts.

Last May, Trump attacked historian Kim Sajet , director of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, calling her partisan. She announced the following month that she would step down. Late last year, the White House fired several members of the National Council on the Humanities.

Internationally, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from dozens of global and U.N. entities, including cultural and refugee agencies, saying they do not benefit Washington.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:32:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6SGP5FCPTBLJRND45ZNUP5GTQE.jpg?auth=8a43bd06213796f9cd54deb275bf08ef662c8b86230271a2d76c4b0381839e8b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel military reported to accept death toll of around 70,000 in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-military-reported-accept-death-toll-around-70000-gaza-2026-01-30/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Israel's military has accepted that around 70,000 Palestinians were killed during the war in Gaza, after having earlier cast doubt on death tolls reported by the enclave's health officials, Israeli media reported on Friday citing senior military officials.

The United Nations has long accepted death tolls recorded by health authorities in Gaza as accurate. Israel has cast doubt on the figures, arguing that the health ministry in the enclave was run by Hamas and could not be trusted.

The Gaza health ministry publishes names and ages of those it records as killed. It now says the toll stands at over 71,000, including more than 480 killed in Israeli attacks since the start of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in October.

It says many thousands more are still buried beneath the rubble of Gaza's destroyed cities. It does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has identified most of the dead as women or children.

Citing a briefing on Thursday with senior military officials, Israel's Ynet news website and other leading outlets reported that the military had adopted a similar estimate.

"In our estimation, around 70,000 Gazans were killed during the war, not including missing persons," Ynet cited an official as saying.

"We are currently doing the work of distinguishing between terrorists and those who were not involved," the official was quoted as saying.

Asked for comment, Israel's military said that "the details published do not reflect official (Israel Defence Forces) data."

It added: "Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels."

"The return of residents from Egypt to the Gaza Strip will be permitted, in coordination with Egypt, for residents who left Gaza during the course of the war only, and only after prior security clearance by Israel," COGAT said.

The Rafah crossing is effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there.

Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war . Reopening it was an important requirement under the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump 's plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas militants, which followed a ceasefire agreed in October.

Israel had said it would reopen it only after recovering the body of the last Israeli hostage in Gaza, which took place this week.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:55:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T42RYOAPMRJ3FOMZCTD7N45UM4.jpg?auth=70ae5ac53f776c773138d28e5fac34a94da6f34ee11661ff4080c07873271eb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: How does Iran's system of power work?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/how-does-irans-system-power-work-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United States is considering new military strikes against the Islamic Republic of Iran over its deadly suppression of protests this month.

The complexities of Iran's ruling system, the ideological nature of its support base, and the power of its Revolutionary Guards make it hard to predict its resilience or vulnerability in the face of external attack, or what might come next.

The following explains how the system operates and who the main figures are in today's Iran:

Iran's political system is based on the theory of vilayat-e faqih ("rule of the jurist"), which holds that until the return of the Shi'ite Muslim 12th Imam, who disappeared in the ninth century, power on earth should be wielded by a supreme cleric.

The first Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was the charismatic father figure of the 1979 Islamic Revolution who developed the model of a cleric standing above an elected government.

His successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has cemented that role since becoming leader in 1989. This has ensured he retains the ultimate say on all major policy decisions and has built a parallel system of rule, alongside that of the elected government, staffed with loyalists.

Khamenei's sway has often been wielded through the National Security Council headed by longtime adviser Ali Larijani. Other advisers to Khamenei, including former defence minister Ali Shamkhani and former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati, have also played prominent roles.

Khamenei, 86, has not named a successor and it's not clear who would replace him if he was killed or ousted.

His son, Mojtaba Khamenei , has at times been seen as a possible candidate. His predecessor's grandson, Hassan Khomeini, has been another, as have some older senior clerics.

Iran's clerical elite control powerful bodies that extend their influence throughout the political system.

The Assembly of Experts, made up of senior ayatollahs elected every eight years, is the body that appoints the supreme leader. The constitution also gives it power to question and even dismiss a leader, but it has never done so.

The Guardian Council - half appointed by the leader and half by the judiciary chief - can veto laws passed by parliament and disqualify election candidates, a mandate that has been used to block potential critics of Khamenei.

Another clerical body, the Expediency Council, appointed by Khamenei, resolves disputes between the elected parliament and the Guardian Council.

Iran follows Shi'ite interpretations of Islamic sharia law and its judges are also clerics under a judiciary chief named by Khamenei. The current head, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, was sanctioned by Western countries for a violent crackdown on protesters in 2009 when he was intelligence minister.

Other influential clerics include Expediency Council head and former judiciary chief Sadiq Larijani, the brother of Ali Larijani; Assembly of Experts and Expediency Council member Mohsen Araki; and Tehran Friday prayer leader Ahmad Khatami.

However, not all clerics - even senior ones - are necessarily supporters of Iran's theocratic system or its current rulers. Some have been dissidents, others like former President Mohammed Khatami have unsuccessfully tried to reform and soften the existing system.

Unlike the ordinary military, which comes under the Defence Ministry in the elected government, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps answers directly to the Supreme Leader.

Formed soon after the revolution, the IRGC's role defending the Islamic system greatly expanded during the 1980-88 war with Iraq and it is now the strongest and best-equipped section of Iran's armed forces.

Over the decades, the Guards have extended their influence through the worlds of politics and business, gaining in power at home and abroad.

The Quds Force, an elite Guards unit, has spearheaded Iran's regional strategy of supporting affiliated Shi'ite groups across the Middle East, most notably in Lebanon and Iraq. That strategy was hard-hit by the U.S. assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in a 2020 air strike in Iraq, and by Israel's pummelling of Lebanon's Hezbollah in a 2024 war.

The Basij militia, a part-time paramilitary force under Guards control, is often used to quell protests inside Iran.

Since the early 2000s, the Guards' economic power has grown as its contracting company Khatam al-Anbiya won projects worth billions of dollars in Iran's oil and gas sector.

The targeted nature of Israeli strikes on senior Guards commanders last year and Hezbollah leaders in 2024 has raised questions over possible Western intelligence penetration in the corps' upper echelons.

However, Guards commander Mohammad Pakpour, his deputy Ahmad Vahidi, the IRGC's naval chief Alireza Tangsiri and current Quds Force commander Esmail Ghaani remain powerful figures.

Iranians elect a president and a parliament to four-year terms. The president appoints a government that handles daily policy within parameters permitted by the Supreme Leader.

During the early years of the Islamic Republic the votes drew mass participation. But Guardian Council restrictions on candidates and a much-disputed election outcome in 2009 undermined trust among many voters, while the Supreme Leader's overarching role has reduced the scope for elected bodies.

President Masoud Pezeshkian, seen as a moderate, was elected in 2024 after a first-round vote with around 40% turnout, and a run-off in which about half the electorate took part. He defeated Saeed Jalili, a Khamenei loyalist and anti-Western hardliner who remains influential.

The parliament speaker since 2020 has been former Guards commander Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:55:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KF4KTQHCGRKELF4N5X635Q6GII.jpg?auth=e05cfdf6de4c77800a4ad9abb8351b0b963ae93c04779475a6406d1e22102894&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: European crisis fund worth over $500 billion could be used for defence, says ESM chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/500-billion-euro-crisis-fund-could-be-used-defence-says-esm-chief-2026-01-30/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A European crisis fund with more than 430 billion euros ($514 billion) of firepower could lend money to countries for defence, the head of the European Stability Mechanism told Reuters, as the bloc scrambles to reinforce its military.

Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, said the ESM could give credit lines for defence and would not demand stringent economic reform in return, in part to dispel any stigma that might arise from asking the emergency euro zone fund for money.

"In these times of geopolitical turmoil, which have triggered higher expenditure , defence costs for all countries, we must use the full potential of the ESM," said Gramenga.

He pointed to the use of credit lines for defence for countries in good financial health but whose budgets are stretched, in particular smaller euro zone states.

"We have instruments," he said. "It is in the best interests of Europe ... to use the full potential."

"It is obvious that the relationship between Europe and the United States is becoming more and more bumpy."

Any such financial support would be symbolically important, repurposing a fund set up at the height of the euro zone debt crisis to stave off the collapse of national economies, banks and shore up the currency.

U.S. President Donald Trump's open hostility towards Europe is forcing its political leaders to scour for alternative means of defending the region against Russian aggression .

Gramegna's remarks suggest a willingness to use the vast European reserve to reinforce euro zone countries, in particular smaller Baltic nations bordering Russia, although loans first need to be signed off by the 21 euro zone countries backing the ESM.

Only countries in the euro zone could get the loans, excluding those who do not use the currency, such as Poland. The ESM makes no explicit mention of defence in its mission and any such shift would require the blessing of member states, including from militarily neutral countries like Austria, Cyprus, Malta or Ireland.

Europe's attempts to boost its defences, four years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine , have taken on greater urgency since Trump threatened trade tariffs on countries that rejected his claim on Greenland, a Danish territory.

Gramegna hinted at a potential role for the ESM, which was set up during the debt crisis to lend to countries such as Greece but has since become largely redundant.

"It is one of our instruments," he said, referring to using so-called precautionary credit lines for defence. "It's available. We need to rediscover the potential of that instrument."

"You need to guarantee that this facility ... has to be used for defence expenditure," he said, adding that it would not come with draconian terms. "The whole goal here is to avoid that this type of tool is combined with restructuring of the economy."

His comments breathe fresh life into a "defence support line" earlier suggested by former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta to lend up to 2% of a country's economic output at low interest rates for defence.

Gramegna's proposal mirrors an ESM crisis support scheme worth up to 240 billion euros set up during the COVID pandemic to help countries spend on healthcare. That ultimately remained unused.

The Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia could stand to benefit. They have almost quadrupled spending on defence since Russia invaded Ukraine to roughly 5% of their economic output, borrowing heavily to cover the bill.

Those countries, which border Russia and its close ally Belarus, have suffered an increasing number of sabotage attacks that law enforcement agencies blame on Russia.

They borrowed billions of euros from the EU's oversubscribed SAFE loans scheme for defence projects, where the EU jointly borrows money on the market to lend it on at cost to EU governments for defence. ESM support would work similarly.

If set up like the pandemic support, the loans would have considerable weight across the EU. Estonia had a gross domestic product of roughly 40 billion euros in 2024 - 2% of that would be less than 1 billion euros.

Gramegna said countries could make "collective requests", which would avoid any stigma attached to asking for assistance from the ESM. "The impetus has to come from the member countries," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:57:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXZE2EW2YNPFDPMBNAPWZVORYY.jpg?auth=23527f4d4cbd3a75700fe14100cc37011f38e922dade381ab3362f7f65c8c780&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China to lift restrictions on UK lawmakers, PM Starmer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/china-lift-restrictions-uk-lawmakers-pm-starmer-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - China is set to lift restrictions which it had imposed on a group of British lawmakers, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Friday, meaning that they will now be free to travel to China.

Starmer made the announcement during his four-day visit to China , the first by a UK leader in eight years, aimed at improving relations despite ongoing concerns over espionage, human rights and other issues.

The Prime Minister told the BBC that he raised the issue of sanctioned lawmakers with China's President Xi Jinping, who responded that "restrictions no longer apply".

"President Xi said to me that means all parliamentarians are free to travel to China," Starmer said. "One of the benefits of engaging is to not only seize the opportunities, but to raise those difficult sensitive issues."

In 2021, China imposed sanctions on nine Britons, including Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative Party, accusing them of spreading what it called "lies and disinformation" about alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

Starmer's spokesperson said Britain would not be lifting sanctions on Chinese individuals in return for the lifting of restrictions on the British parliamentarians.

Some of the group of sanctioned British lawmakers said in a statement responding to the possible lifting that they would rather remain under sanction than have their status used as a "bargaining chip" to justify the removal of Chinese officials from Britain's sanctions list.

"We would reject any deal that prioritises our personal convenience over the pursuit of justice for the Uyghur people," the group, which includes former security minister Tom Tugendhat, said in a statement.

China last year lifted sanctions on members of the European Parliament and its human rights subcommittee.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:57:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FLTBWQC2WRL5RJ26UU2FDNHR3A.jpg?auth=f3e6c59ee89154254ea80ce89c86cbbbfa2ab525c24266c9e63431137f4485fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran to label EU armed forces as 'terrorists' over Guards blacklist</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-label-eu-armed-forces-terrorists-over-guards-blacklist-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - Iran plans to designate the armed forces of European Union countries that have blacklisted the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as "terrorists", according to a post by top Iranian security official Ali Larijani on X.

"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no ‌doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is 'central casting, and he will never let you down," Trump said in announcing his latest move to put his stamp on a Fed he persistently criticizes for not caving to his demands for deep reductions in borrowing costs.

U.S. stock index futures pared declines after Trump's announced pick of Warsh, who markets perceive as someone who would support lower rates but who would stop well short of the more aggressive easing associated with some of the other potential nominees.

Trump announced the nomination, which requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate, in a post on social media. No public events have been listed on the president's schedule for Friday involving the ‌Fed.

The Fed has long been seen as a stabilizing force in global financial markets due in no small part to its perceived independence from politics.

Trump's escalating efforts to test ​that independence, including his Justice Department's decision earlier this month to open a criminal probe into Powell, have set the stage for a challenging Senate confirmation process for any successor.

Republican U.S. Senator Thom Tillis has said he will not support any of Trump's Fed nominees amid the ongoing probe , while fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has called for an investigation into the department's actions.

It has also opened the door to the possibility that Powell, who called the criminal probe a pretext to pressure ‍the Fed into setting monetary policy as the president wishes, may opt to stay on at the Fed as a governor even after his term as central bank chief is up in a bid to safeguard it from political capture.

The nomination caps a months-long process that often resembled a public audition as Warsh, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett and other top contenders - including sitting Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street insider Rick Rieder - appeared regularly on television to tout their credentials and showcase their thoughts about the economy and Fed policy.

Trump in August named ⁠White House economic adviser Stephen Miran to fill a vacant governor's seat on the Fed, where he has become a leading proponent of the aggressive rate cuts that Trump has long sought. Trump has also tried to force out Fed Governor Lisa Cook in ‍a battle now before the Supreme Court that, if successful, would mark the first time a president has ever fired a U.S. central bank policymaker.

While Warsh is no White House insider, he has been a confidant of ‌the president and ‌a guest at the president's Florida estate, and looks poised to push many of Trump's priorities as a "shadow" Fed chief until Powell's tenure in the top job ends in mid-May.

A lawyer and distinguished visiting fellow in economics at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Warsh has said he believes the president is right to press the central bank for steep rate cuts, and has criticized the Fed for underestimating the inflation-busting potential of productivity growth supercharged by artificial intelligence.

He has also called for a broad overhaul of the central bank that would slim its balance sheet and ease bank regulations.

Warsh, 55, was nearly named to the job in Trump's first term before being passed over for Powell, and since then has kept a steady ⁠public profile through speeches and essays that have taken Powell ⁠and his colleagues to task for their management of ​the Fed's balance sheet, interest rates and other actions.

He now will be responsible for an institution he has said should scale back its footprint in the economy and change the way it manages monetary policy.

It is not clear how the pick may affect the trajectory of rates in the short term. The Fed's three rate cuts in 2025 brought its benchmark interest rate to the 3.50%-3.75% range. Earlier this week, citing stronger growth and a stabilizing labor market, it left rates on hold and signaled a pause ahead; ‍markets for now don't expect another rate cut until the June 16-17 meeting, when Powell's successor is expected to be in place.

With a background on Wall Street, including as a partner in the office managing the wealth of investing giant Stanley Druckenmiller, and family ties to major Trump supporter Ron Lauder, Warsh will be under an intense spotlight to prove his independence from the president.

As a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, Warsh's familiarity with Wall Street executives and investors made him a chief liaison to the financial community for then-Fed Chair Ben ​Bernanke during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Though he did not dissent against the massive bond purchases Bernanke used to nurse the economy out of ‍what proved a long downturn, he was concerned they would stoke inflation and eventually resigned. Warsh's inflation concerns proved misplaced, but the large size of the Fed's balance sheet, and the role it plays in managing interest rates, remain a concern.

He now argues that shrinking the Fed's big balance ​sheet would allow it to "redeploy" excess liquidity in financial markets to the real economy by lowering the central bank's policy rate.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:59:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3A3YORDCFOP7PZRREBJNTN5BU.jpg?auth=079d675f57424ad7f2ffa023cc031db796e2cea944619453c790a64954f043dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump names former Fed governor ‍Kevin Warsh to replace Powell as US ‌central ‍bank head</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-trump-names-former-fed-governor-kevin-warsh-to-replace-powell-as-us-central-bank-head</link><description>President Donald Trump on Friday chose former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to head the US central bank when Jerome Powell 's leadership term ends in ⁠May, giving a frequent Fed critic a chance to put his idea of monetary policy "regime change" into practice at a moment when the president has pushed for more control over the central bank.

"We have not been able to determine exactly what happened or who was behind the breach but we do believe that the digital domain still is the main suspect," the permanent secretary of the committee that bestows the award told Reuters on Friday.

Bets on Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado winning the prize spiked on October 10, hours before the name of the 2025 laureate was due to be announced in Oslo.

An initial bet was placed on Machado's name to win the prize, rising quickly to some $2.2 million as others followed, Kristian Berg Harpviken said. Machado's name had not been mentioned ahead of time by any of the experts nor the media.

One of Norway's three intelligence agencies was involved in the ensuing investigation of whether there was an internal leak or whether it was the result of spying, either by a criminal actor or a state entity, but it remains unclear who was behind the leak and how it unfolded, Harpviken said.

And while financial bets were placed, it was not known whether the ultimate purpose was to profit from the incident or to inflict damage to the credibility of the prize, he said, adding that the institute's efforts have now turned to preventing future breaches.

Machado won the award for fighting dictatorship in Venezuela and dedicated the award in part to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly insisted he deserved to win himself.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NPO5JJN5KNIBLNGGPTW5NPCQVE.jpg?auth=f5aa6d1ef69105fb9668ae78f5d68ce1a1ed51e1ae7c491ff73ae5cb36f8800b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief Guterres warns of 'imminent financial collapse'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/un-chief-guterres-warns-imminent-financial-collapse-2026-01-30/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.N. chief has told states that the organisation is at risk of "imminent financial collapse", citing unpaid fees and a budget rule that forces the global body to return unspent money, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday.

"The crisis is deepening, threatening programme delivery and risking financial collapse. And the situation will deteriorate further in the near future," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in a letter to ambassadors dated January 28.

The U.N. is facing a cash crisis as the world body's largest contributor - the United States - has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies and refused to make mandatory payments to the U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets.

In the letter, Guterres said "decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced."

It was not immediately clear which state or states he was referring to and a U.N. spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

“Either all Member States honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or Member States must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse," he said, warning that cash could run out by July.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CFSJJ7WOTZJ5BB3FKZ3LJ37ZCE.jpg?auth=15c3f4bbf40fc19af023fa47c05c4ff62b6ea43232c17cba788286e04e64dc81&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudanese man jailed in UK for murdering asylum hotel worker</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/sudanese-man-jailed-uk-murdering-asylum-hotel-worker-2026-01-30/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A Sudanese asylum seeker was jailed on Friday for a minimum of 29 years for murdering a woman who worked at the hotel in central England where he and other migrants were being housed.

Anti-immigration activists have seized on other criminal cases involving asylum seekers, predominantly young men, in hotels to argue that they are a danger to nearby communities.

Last summer, a number of protests at asylum hotels across England – sparked by the arrest of an Ethiopian asylum seeker for sexually assaulting a teenage girl and a woman – turned violent.

The Labour government, nervous of the rise of the anti-immigration Reform UK party in opinion polls, has promised to clamp down on illegal immigration and, by 2029, to stop placing asylum seekers in hotels while their cases are processed.

Deng Chol Majek followed Rhiannon Whyte, 27, to a railway station in October 2024 after she finished her shift.

He stabbed her 23 times to the head, chest and arm with a screwdriver. She died in hospital three days later.

Majek was convicted in October and sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment with a minimum of 29 years at Coventry Crown Court, where some anti-immigration protesters gathered outside for the hearing.

Judge Michael Soole said the murder was "particularly vicious" and told Majek there had been a "chilling composure in every aspect of your behaviour".</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark plans tougher deportation laws, challenging European human rights framework</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/denmark-plans-tougher-deportation-laws-challenging-european-human-rights-2026-01-30/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Denmark said on Friday it would introduce legislation allowing the expulsion of more foreigners including criminals despite the risk of clashing with Europe's human rights court.

In a global hardening of attitudes on asylum and migration issues, various European governments including Denmark have expressed frustration with how the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights has often blocked deportations.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Friday her centre-right coalition government would act without waiting for the court to revise its interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights as relates to immigration.

"Some experts might think that we are breaking the convention with this. We see it the other way around," she said at a press conference.

Frederiksen is under pressure from nationalist and anti-immigration parties who are gaining support ahead of an election due by October 31.

"It is because a majority of the countries behind the (rights) convention share Denmark's desire to change the interpretation that we are now tightening further," the prime minister added, acknowledging that could bring legal challenges.

Denmark has in particular criticized rulings by the European court stopping deportations due to family ties.

The proposed reforms, to take effect from May 1 if approved, would increase requirements to deport foreign nationals sentenced to a year or more for serious crimes.

Other plans include introducing electronic tagging for people without residency permits who breach reporting requirements, reopening Denmark's embassy in Syria - the source of many migrants - and appointing a deportation envoy.

Copenhagen also plans to explore a potential first EU reception centre outside the bloc and intensify reviews to revoke refugee permits.

Frederiksen's government has seen a poll boost for its handling of a standoff over U.S. President Donald Trump ´s demands to acquire Greenland but its ratings remain below those of the 2022 election.

Frederiksen, of the Social Democratic Party, took a tougher stance on immigration when she became prime minister in 2019, with coalition partners Moderates and the Liberal Party following her lead.

With a population of around 6 million, Denmark granted asylum to 839 people in the first 11 months of 2025, on track to approve fewer than 1,000 claims in the year for only the fourth time since 1983. Most asylum applicants in recent years have come from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, and Somalia.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5HUJ3Q4NTFNM5NRL2AHWOQ7UY4.jpg?auth=76924ec55e2aa1e4891fb024dc626fb1d6975e7440fdf32ac6b8c9d8af4e7b25&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Panama ports will operate undisrupted after CK Hutchison ruling, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/panama-president-says-ports-will-operate-without-disruption-after-court-ruling-2026-01-30/</link><description>PANAMA CITY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said on Friday that ports in the country will operate without disruption, despite a Supreme Court decision to annul key port contracts held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison.

The ruling on Thursday left the future operations of some key ports near the Panama Canal unclear.

Mulino said that APM Terminals Panama, a Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) , opens new tab subsidiary, has shown willingness to temporarily take over the operation of the Balboa and Cristobal terminals, following a transition period during which the current operator will stay on.

He said there have been discussions with several companies.

About the process with CK Hutchison, Mulino said during a press conference that he had instructed the Panama Maritime Authority to meet immediately with the Panama Ports Company to coordinate the next steps.

Mulino said there would not be any layoffs.

The ruling comes amid a growing U.S.-China rivalry over global trade routes and is seen as a win for Washington, where President Donald Trump has pushed to curb what he calls Chinese influence over the Panama Canal, which carries about 5% of global maritime trade.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4X5GJVVEJJPOFMQ5SUKFWS6LBE.jpg?auth=59dc32830e1146d14bf9bd4fd9131f538d23f07ff55997b8c60f2b85e72a2c0c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Islamic State claims deadly attack on airport in Niger capital</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/islamic-state-claims-deadly-attack-airport-niger-capital-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 - Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on the airport in Niger's capital Niamey in a statement on Friday, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist activity and communications worldwide.

The Islamic State affiliate in the region has been linked to high-profile attacks in Niger in recent months, killing over a 120 people in strikes targeting the Tillaberi region in September and abducting an American pilot in Octover.

Niger's government said in a statement that the attackers arrived on motorcycles and security forces quickly repelled their advance. In the fighting that ensued, four soldiers were wounded, it said.

Material losses at the airport included a stash of ammunition that caught fire, the government said, and several civilian airplanes that were damaged.

Islamic State described the assault as a "surprise and coordinated attack" that inflicted "significant damage" without providing further details.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:42:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RZL4LEIBP5JKDE2L7HCNRGWMDU.jpg?auth=637892b796f22a1292fc206d96c9e8500a9879c7d76aad4532a5ff759d93816e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Dutch government plans 'freedom tax' to fund defence spending</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/new-dutch-government-plans-freedom-tax-fund-defence-spending-2026-01-30/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The incoming Dutch government plans to add a surcharge to income and corporate taxes to generate around 5 billion euros ($6 billion) per year for increased defence spending, coalition parties said on Friday.

To meet a target set by NATO countries last year, the government aims to increase defence spending to 2.8% of gross domestic product by 2030 and to 3.5% by 2035, compared with around 2% now.

Ultimately, the increase in defence spending would be around 19 billion euros per year, which would be funded by broad budget cuts, including in healthcare and welfare, as well as the tax increment the government has named a freedom tax.

In its coalition agreement presented on Friday, months after the October election, the new government also said it planned to invest in housing, while limiting the government deficit to around 2% of GDP.

"We are charting a new course for our country, with investments aimed at the long term," leader of the D66 party Rob Jetten said.

Earlier this week , Jetten and other political leaders agreed to form a rare minority government in which the centrist pro-EU D66, will team up with the conservative Christian Democrats and right-wing VVD.

This coalition will only hold 66 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament, and will need to find support among opposition parties for its proposals.

The main leftwing opposition party said it would strive for more social and greener policies.

As the leader of the new government, Jetten, aged 38, will become the youngest prime minister in Dutch history.

Other cabinet posts will be filled in the coming weeks, and the government is expected to be officially installed within a month.

MSF, which supports and helps staff hospitals in Gaza, is one of 37 international organisations that Israel ordered this month to stop work in the Palestinian territories unless they meet new rules including providing employee details.

The aid groups say sharing such staff information could pose a safety risk, pointing to the hundreds of aid workers who were killed or injured during the two-year Gaza war.

Israel's diaspora ministry, which manages the registration process, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel has previously said the registrations were meant to prevent diversions of aid by Palestinian armed groups. Aid agencies dispute that substantial aid has been diverted.

MSF had said last week it would be prepared to share a partial list of Palestinian and international staff who had agreed to release that information, provided the list be used only for administrative purposes and not put its team at risk. It also said it wanted to retain control over the management of medical humanitarian supplies.

"However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident in recent days that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required," MSF said in a statement.

It said there could be a devastating impact on humanitarian services if it is banned from operating in Gaza and the West Bank, amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The Ministry of Health in Gaza said in a statement on Friday that it rejected sharing data of health staff working with partner health institutions, saying it threatened the personal safety of workers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:43:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WKF762VVNJKMBI5WSDN2GCAPII.jpg?auth=7f93edb23922d9bb5a2169c98748b1f4b1049eb5a6e988ed3be79349f3058ecd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rohingya survivors expect UN's highest court to find Myanmar committed genocide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rohingya-survivors-expect-uns-highest-court-find-myanmar-committed-genocide-2026-01-30/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Rohingya survivors of the 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar expect the International Court of Justice, the United Nations' highest court, to rule the country committed genocide against them, they said on Friday.

A judgment is expected in three-to-six months' time following three weeks of hearings at the court in the Hague that is also known as the World Court.

The outcome of the case will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, including affecting South Africa’s genocide case at the court against Israel over the war in Gaza.

GAMBIA BROUGHT THE CASE

In their final submissions this week, lawyers for Gambia, a mainly Muslim country that brought the case, told the court that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from Myanmar's conduct is that it intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group.

Myanmar has denied accusations of genocide and said the 2017 offensive that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh was a legitimate counterterrorist operation.

Speaking on Friday on the sidelines of a meeting of survivors of mass atrocities, Yousuf Ali, a 52-year-old Rohingya refugee who says he was tortured by the Myanmar military, said he believed the court would declare a genocide had been committed.

"The world has witnessed us suffering for so many years (... ) how we were deported, how our homes were destroyed and we were killed," he said.

A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded the offensive had included "genocidal acts" and survivors recounted killings, mass rape and arson.

At the international court, Myanmar's lawyers said the fact-finding mission was biased and that its conclusions did not have the standard of proof needed for a finding of genocide.

Gambia's Justice Minister Dawda Jallow asked the court to reject Myanmar's arguments and said a judgment declaring genocide would help to break Myanmar's "cycle of atrocities and impunities".</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S2772TPVAVPE3JVKCVIDBHO6DE.jpg?auth=00ec33e0dd203b5467d9d0ee128ab8f2f0eb3f22e0172d4a438be644c06fa885&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN says Houthi seizure of telecom gear threatens Yemen aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-houthi-seizure-telecom-gear-threatens-yemen-aid-2026-01-30/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Yemen's Iran‑aligned Houthi paramilitary has removed critical telecommunications equipment belonging to the U.N., the global body said on Friday, warning that further restrictions on its work would fuel a worsening humanitarian crisis

The Houthis, who control areas in north Yemen, entered at least six unstaffed U.N. offices in the capital Sanaa and took telecommunications equipment and several vehicles to an unknown location, the U.N.'s Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen Julien Harneis said in a statement.

"This equipment is part of the minimum infrastructure needed by the United Nations to be present and to implement programmes," said Harneis.

The U.N. has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Yemen with some 21 million people needing aid.

Yemen has suffered 11 years of conflict between the Houthis, who took over the capital Sanaa in 2014 and the internationally-recognised government in Aden. Some 4.8 ‎million people are internally displaced and nearly half a million children need treatment for severe malnutrition.

The situation has been aggravated by economic collapse, disruption of health and education services, political uncertainty and funding cuts, the U.N. previously said.

The Houthis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have previously called the work of some U.N. agencies like the World Food Programme a political, military and intelligence operation aimed at subjugating Yemenis.

The U.N. also raised concern of further constraints on aid, stating that the Houthis have not authorized the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service to fly to Sanaa for more than a month, nor the city of Marib, which is controlled by the internationally-recognised government, for more than four months.

These flights are the only way for NGO workers to enter and exit Houthi-controlled areas, Harneis said.

U.N. operations are limited to government-held areas, with U.N. agencies unable to help in Houthi-held areas accounting for about 70% of humanitarian needs, Harneis said.

Staff security is worsening with 73 U.N. colleagues now detained since 2021.

In September the U.N. said it had relocated the base of its resident coordinator for Yemen to Aden, more than a week after at least 18 U.N. personnel were detained in the capital Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis.

Houthi officials have previously accused U.N. staff of espionage.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4LIRVS5GVBKVRKPNBYKORZ5PC4.jpg?auth=ce24314394136c62681f241f12917ce655717fc2de1842ed697bb091a70fb4e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>25 killed in Nigeria's deadliest reported Islamist attack since US Christmas strikes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/25-killed-nigerias-deadliest-reported-islamist-attack-since-us-christmas-strikes-2026-01-30/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 30 (Reuters) - At least 25 people were killed when suspected Boko Haram militants attacked a town in northern Nigeria, relatives of victims said, the deadliest reported Islamist attack since U.S. President Donald Trump ordered air strikes on Christmas Day.

The victims were labourers who had travelled to Sabon Gari town in northeastern Nigeria's Borno State to work at a construction site, when gunmen swept in on Thursday and opened fire, relatives Hassan Usman and Auwal Isa told Reuters.

Aliyu Ndume, a senator who represents the region, said he was "shocked and saddened" by the killing of his constituents.

In a separate militant attack, also on Thursday in Borno, at least nine soldiers and two members of a civilian task force assisting them were killed by fighters who launched a pre-dawn assault on an army base. Sixteen people were wounded.

Borno, where Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency.

Nigeria, plagued by Islamist attacks and mass kidnappings, is under additional pressure to restore security since Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians. U.S. forces struck what they described as terrorist targets on December 25. The Nigerian authorities say they are cooperating with Washington to improve security.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US issues fresh Iran-related sanctions, Treasury Dept website says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-issues-fresh-iran-related-sanctions-treasury-dept-website-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday issued fresh Iran and counter terrorism-related sanctions, targeting seven Iranian nationals and at least one entity, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's website.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4TNLFG3EIBLJFN4HB2RXOJ3CWU.jpg?auth=fefc35bde85eb161e55c0ca8cdcbd2580fabc846c93fd3b9646856a09a8aec7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge dismisses murder, weapons charges against alleged UnitedHealth CEO killer Mangione</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/judge-dismisses-murder-weapons-charges-against-alleged-unitedhealth-ceo-killer-2026-01-30/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A New York federal judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione , a major blow to prosecutors that means Mangione no longer faces a possible death penalty if convicted.

Mangione, 27, previously pleaded not guilty to murder, weapons and stalking charges for allegedly gunning down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in Midtown Manhattan in 2024. Public officials condemned the shocking killing, but Mangione became a folk hero of sorts to some Americans who decry steep healthcare costs and insurance practices.

U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Garnett in Manhattan said she dismissed the murder and weapons charges because they were legally incompatible with the two counts of stalking Mangione faces.

Garnett previously scheduled jury selection to begin in the case in September.

Mangione has separately pleaded not guilty to murder, weapons and forgery charges in Manhattan state court.

Investigators traced at least 31 crypto transactions from virtual wallets controlled by the suspect to addresses that are suspected of being linked to an entity used by the Islamist group, whose attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, triggered a two-year war in the Gaza Strip.

Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation by the 27-member European Union and other Western nations.

Police declined to comment on the suspect's possible motives and on whether he had interacted knowingly with Hamas or was just an intermediary, citing the sensitivity of the investigation.

During searches of the suspect's hair salon and home, officers seized cryptoassets, cash, some 9,000 cigars, jewellery, computers and mobile phones, the police said.

They also froze several bank accounts, with the total value of seized and blocked assets exceeding 370,000 euros.

Their investigation began last June during a separate probe into fraud and money laundering, police said.

Authorities have warned in recent years that militant groups are using cryptocurrencies to move funds across borders, complicating efforts to track and disrupt terrorism financing .

The claim of responsibility was contained in a statement on Amaq News Agency, the group's propaganda wing, that said it was “a surprise and coordinated attack” that inflicted heavy losses.

The IS group's affiliate in the region has been linked to high-profile attacks in Niger in recent months, killing over a 120 people in strikes targeting the Tillaberi region in September and abducting an American pilot in October.

Material losses at the airport included a stash of ammunition that caught fire, the government said, and several civilian airplanes that were damaged.

Niger has struggled to contain deadly jihadist violence that has battered parts of Africa’s Sahel region, where neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali also are run by military juntas.

In 2025, al Qaeda and IS group-backed militants escalated their campaigns in the Sahel, further threatening the stability of the fragile region and of Niger, which was the key security ally of the West in the region until a 2023 military coup.

Niger state television reported that one of the assailants killed was a French national, as footage showed several bloodied bodies on the ground. It provided no evidence.

Niger’s military leader has accused the presidents of France, Benin and Ivory Coast of supporting the armed group behind the attack.

Since seizing power, Niger’s military rulers – along with those in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso – have cut ties with France and other Western powers and turned to Russia for military support to fight insurgencies.

The U.S. military said on January 21 it had started to transfer the detainees. Its announcement followed the rapid collapse of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in northeast Syria, which caused uncertainty about the security of prisons and detention camps they were guarding.

The United States had expected to transfer up to 7,000 fighters to Iraq within days . But more than a week later, only about 500 have been moved, according to two Iraqi judicial officials, two Iraqi security officials and three diplomats, some from countries whose nationals are among those transferred.

An Iraqi foreign ministry official put the number at under 500 so far.

Baghdad asked the U.S. to slow the influx to make time for negotiations with other countries on repatriating their own nationals among the detainees and to prepare additional facilities to host the fighters, the Iraqi officials and a Western diplomat told Reuters.

Those moved to Iraqi facilities so far include about 130 Iraqis and some 400 foreigners, the Iraqi judicial sources, the Iraqi security officials and a Western diplomat said.

The slowdown, which has not previously been reported, is linked to Western governments' reservations about bringing home their own citizens who joined the Islamic State's brutal self-declared caliphate across swathes of Syria and Iraq from 2014.

Most foreign fighters were subsequently captured in Syria and held in prisons in the northeast for years without trial.

The U.S. State Department and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on the transfers.

Iraq agreed to host the detainees being moved by the U.S. military after a brief escape by dozens of fighters from one facility in Syria prompted concerns that more could flee, Iraqi government officials said.

But although it has already tried and sentenced dozens of foreign fighters in recent years, Baghdad balked at the prospect of having the full 7,000 in its custody, the officials said.

The influx could overwhelm Iraq’s courts and prisons, and sentencing detainees to death would prompt criticism from Western countries and rights groups, they said.

"It's a trap," one of the senior Iraqi judicial sources said. "These Western countries object to the death penalty, but refuse to receive their terrorists. Why should we bear the burden of being seen as the butcher?"

Responding to questions from Reuters, Hisham al-Alawi, Undersecretary of Iraq's Foreign Ministry for Political Planning, said fewer than 500 detainees had been transferred to Iraq so far.

"For years, Iraq has been urging foreign states to assume their responsibilities by taking back their citizens and dealing with them in accordance with their own laws. While some countries have taken the initiative, a large number of states have not responded to our requests," Alawi said.

The dilemma of what to do with foreign nationals who joined Islamic State has plagued Western countries for the last decade.

Securing guilty verdicts against such detainees in their home countries could be harder than in Iraq, said four diplomats from countries whose nationals were captured in Syria, citing a greater need to prove direct participation in violent crimes.

Governments in such countries could face a public backlash if Islamic State fighters were repatriated and then freed, the diplomats said.

The return of an Islamic State-linked woman to Norway in 2020 caused a cabinet crisis that ultimately brought down the government.

As a result of Western nations' hesitations, thousands of foreign fighters detained in Syria and Iraq remained there for nearly a decade - even though the U.S., which repatriated and tried its nationals, urged other countries to do the same .

The senior Iraqi judicial source said Baghdad was working with the U.S. State Department on increasing pressure on other countries to begin repatriations.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after transfers had begun that foreign Islamic State members would be in Iraq temporarily. "The United States urges countries to take responsibility and repatriate their citizens in these facilities to face justice," he said.

Two diplomats from countries with nationals now in Iraq said their governments faced an uncomfortable choice between repatriation - which would be unpopular domestically - and the possibility that their nationals would face the death penalty if tried in Iraq, an outcome that could outrage voters at home.

One of the diplomats said Baghdad had begun conversations with their country about repatriations but that their government's policy was unchanged.

"It would be difficult for us to accept that they are transferred to Iraq if they are then going to get their head chopped off," the second diplomat said.

Letta Tayler, an associate fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, said the mass transfer of detainees to Iraq "has mind-boggling legal implications, none of them positive."

It could prolong their indefinite detention without trial and place detainees at risk of torture and executions based on flawed convictions, Tayler said. The U.S. has raised concerns about unfair trials of Islamic State detainees in Iraq.

"The only viable solution is for countries with fair justice systems to repatriate their nationals," Tayler said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:34:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q6FDEGBYQZKFNOWUSKQXIH5VSI.jpg?auth=589f21a90899ad2bb53b8c163035c356e73a817d765c854baaa10c1cbfe8a3f5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico to seek diplomatic solution after US threatens Cuba oil tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-seek-diplomatic-solution-after-us-threatens-cuba-oil-tariffs-2026-01-30/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday her country would seek diplomatic solutions and alternatives to help Cuba after the United States threatened tariffs on nations that supply the Caribbean nation with oil.

"We need to know the scope because we don't want to put our country at risk in terms of tariffs," Sheinbaum said in a morning press conference, adding that she had instructed her foreign minister to reach out to the U.S. State Department.

Mexico is one of Cuba's only remaining suppliers of oil and its shipments are a lifeline for the island.

Sheinbaum said cutting off oil shipments could cause a serious humanitarian crisis in Cuba, affecting transportation and key infrastructure including hospitals and electricity generation.

"Applying tariffs on countries that supply oil to Cuba could trigger a far-reaching humanitarian crisis, directly affecting hospitals, food and other basic services for the Cuban people, a situation that must be avoided," she said.

Sheinbaum did not say whether Mexico would cut shipments of oil or refined products to Cuba, which Sheinbaum said accounted for 1% of Mexico's production, but emphasized the country is looking at alternatives to help the island.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Sheinbaum spoke on Thursday morning, hours before his administration announced the tariffs, but he did not mention the measures, she said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:35:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N5FST77MGFJPZKVK4WFC674WFE.jpg?auth=747c87f9c49dd0f8e53f1ffbfa3901631aaec0a92c42f66efba7532703a2c59c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge temporarily blocks end of Ethiopians' deportation protections</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-end-ethiopians-deportation-protections-2026-01-30/</link><description>BOSTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from ending protections from deportation that had been granted to thousands of Ethiopians living in the United States.

U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston said he would issue an order delaying the February 13 effective date of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's termination of the Temporary Protected Status granted to over 5,000 Ethiopians in order to provide more time for a legal challenge to be heard.

Murphy, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, during a virtual hearing said an order administratively staying the effective date would allow DHS time to produce records detailing how it made its decision so he can then consider whether to block the agency's action for even longer.

The U.S. Department of Justice had requested more time to respond to the lawsuit filed by immigrant rights advocates before Murphy, after he set the case down for arguments on Tuesday.

At the same time, it opposed even a temporary court-ordered delay in the expiration of the protections the Ethiopians had from deportation. Murphy said he would schedule further arguments after the agency's records are produced, which a government lawyer suggested could be done within weeks.

"I want to do everything I can to keep this case going," Murphy said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Under federal law, Temporary Protected Status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

DHS has moved to end the status for about a dozen countries as part of Trump's crackdown on immigration , saying TPS was always meant to be temporary and not a "de facto amnesty program."

The case before Murphy was filed last week by three Ethiopian nationals and the group African Communities Together after DHS said on December 12 it was ending the TPS designation for Ethiopia, citing improved conditions in the African nation.

The lawsuit argues DHS unlawfully terminated the TPS designation first granted to Ethiopia in 2022 by the Biden administration with just 60-days notice, even though armed conflicts there continue.

The plaintiffs say Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took that action based on an unconstitutional animus against non-white immigrants.

Officials in Argentina were moving to finalize this month the third-country deal with the U.S., the New York Times reported.

Reuters could not independently confirm the report. A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment.

Argentina's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A third-country deal with Argentina would bolster President Donald Trump's intention to deport millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. His administration has aimed to ramp up removals to third countries , including to South Sudan, Eswatini, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama.

While Argentina has historically had a relatively open immigration policy, President Javier Milei, a close ally of Trump, has sought to tighten immigration by cracking down on those with criminal records and requiring that travelers are covered by health insurance.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:44:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin envoy Dmitriev to travel to Miami, meet members of Trump administration, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-envoy-dmitriev-travel-miami-meet-members-trump-administration-sources-say-2026-01-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, will travel to Miami on Saturday for meetings with members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, two sources with knowledge of the visit told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHIJGKFNIVPBFLAQKMECGARI6Q.jpg?auth=bf541580f7c05e624b64e6ce8c73b2efced5bbac8908dba3515a75746cf59ba1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria to close camps housing thousands linked to Islamic State</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-close-camps-housing-thousands-linked-islamic-state-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - Syria plans to permanently close two displacement camps in the northeast that hold civilians, including foreigners, linked to Islamic State militants , a government official said on Friday.

The al-Hol and Roj camps hold more than 28,000 people, mostly Syrians and Iraqis, according to the U.N. About 6,000 foreigners are housed in al-Hol and a further 2,000 in Roj.

A charity that has worked in both camps, the Swiss-based Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, told Reuters it understands Damascus aims to empty and shut the sites within a year.

Syrian forces recently took control of al-Hol after the chaotic withdrawal of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF still holds Roj where residents had in recent days reported being confined to their tents as aid groups evacuated due to rising security worries.

More than 50,000 people who fled IS's last strongholds as the group lost territory over the last decade were once held at the two camps. Numbers have fallen due to repatriations, primarily by Iraq.

Among the foreigners held is Shamima Begum , a British-born woman who joined IS.

The civilian displacement camps are for families and others with alleged IS links, distinct from detention facilities that hold suspected fighters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C5WAOEMGYRKGFCH3G3VJQ3UPMM.jpg?auth=60c0d07b16bf9e4f1adf1eadee504503e732f8ae8ea3d2f588418b51bd2400aa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge bars prosecutors from seeking death penalty against Luigi Mangione</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-us-judge-bars-prosecutors-from-seeking-death-penalty-against-luigi-mangione</link><description>A US judge on Friday barred prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down a health insurance CEO in New York in December 2024.

The judge dismissed two charges against Mangione that could carry the death penalty: murder and using a gun with a silencer. The 27-year-old suspect is still charged with two counts of stalking in his federal case, and faces state-level murder charges.

He has pleaded not guilty to the state and federal charges.

Friday's decision "is solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury", Judge Margaret Garnett wrote in a court filing.

Mangione faces life in prison without parole if convicted of the stalking charges. The federal trial is to begin with jury selection on September 8.

The murder of UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson, captured on surveillance video, shocked the United States and exposed public anger with the profit-driven private healthcare system.

Mangione was arrested five days after the killing at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, some 230 miles (370 kilometres) from the crime scene, following a tip from a staff member.

In another significant ruling Friday, Garnett rejected Mangione's lawyers' efforts to suppress as evidence the police search of a backpack recovered at the time of his arrest.

Inside, officers found a handgun, a silencer, a magazine with bullets wrapped in underwear and a red notebook described as a "manifesto".

The defence argued the search breached legal standards.

Following through on Donald Trump ’s campaign promise to vigorously pursue capital punishment, Attorney General Pam Bondi had ordered Manhattan federal prosecutors last April to seek the death penalty against Mangione.

It was the first time the Justice Department was seeking to bring the death penalty in Trump’s second term.

The contract emerged last week after it was first revealed by independent media outlet l’Observatoire des multinationales. It concerns “skip tracing” services – a form of data-driven locating and tracking of individuals whose whereabouts are unknown – used by ICE to verify home and work addresses and support removal operations. The framework agreement is capped at over $365 million, with nearly $4.8 million already committed.

In practical terms, contractors use government-supplied case data alongside commercial databases, public records, phone and social media information and even physical observation to confirm a person’s location for enforcement purposes.

The solicitation , revealed by US magazine Wired in October, outlines an incentive structure offering monetary bonuses for high performance, with companies assigned thousands of cases at a time. To meet these targets, contractors are expected to carry out “commercial data verification” and, if required, “physical observation services” to verify the address information.

Wired described parts of the initiative as relying on private "bounty hunters" paid to locate and track immigrants. A language echoed by The Intercept , which reported on December 23 that at least 10 companies had already earned more than $1 million and could collectively make well over $1 billion from the programme through 2027. The largest potential single share, the investigative outlet outlined, was expected to go to Capgemini Government Solutions.

Capgemini group CEO Aiman Ezzat said Sunday on LinkedIn that senior management had only recently become aware of the contract “through public sources”, adding that it was “not currently being executed” and was subject to legal challenge. An internal message sent to staff and seen by AFP said the US subsidiary had launched a process to examine the contents of the deal, as scrutiny intensified from unions, politicians and investors.

According to The Washington Post , ICE told prospective contractors in a written Q&amp;A in November that the intelligence they gathered "may lead to raids", and that the government "may send correspondence to the alien or take an enforcement action".

French investigative outlet Les Jours reported on Wednesday that Capgemini Government Solutions’ ties with ICE stretched back nearly two decades. Government spending records from USAspending.gov show that 65% of the contracts awarded to the company by US federal agencies were with ICE . As early as 2007, the contracts already covered operational planning, including modelling the agency’s detention capacity.

“If you fire them, ICE would be paralysed. They’ve become essential to certain parts of the system, it’s very hard to get rid of them,”  a former senior ICE official told Les Jours.

This dependency is reinforced by a "revolving door" process, with many employees moving between ICE and CGS, ensuring continuity and deep institutional knowledge.

The relationship has endured for nearly two decades, as documented by Les Jours, and came under scrutiny in a 2021 audit by the DHS Office of Inspector General , which flagged performance and oversight failures. “Although ICE had controls in place that required the contractor to provide qualified labour, ICE did not properly construct or monitor the contract,” the report said.

It also found that the contractor had failed to specify staffing levels for key labour categories, meaning ICE “cannot ensure it received all services and may have overpaid $769,869 in labour cost”. The watchdog further concluded that ICE did not ensure the contractor – Capgemini Government Solutions – met requirements for staff skills, education and experience, or that all contractor personnel worked at the designated place of performance.

This dependence on Capgemini’s services spans operations ranging from detention capacity management to deportation logistics and individual tracking, underscoring how deeply embedded CGS has become to core ICE functions.

These revelations have triggered mounting pressure on Capgemini from unions, politicians and parts of the French government. French union CFDT strongly condemned the ICE contract and has called for more transparency from management at a time when Capgemini is planning to cut up to 2,400 jobs in France . The more hardline CGT called for the ‘immediate and public cessation of any collaboration with ICE’, arguing that the agreement runs counter to the company’s stated values.

French Finance Minister Roland Lescure on Wednesday urged full transparency, saying Capgemini – which is partly state-owned – must "shed light, in an extremely transparent manner, on its activities" and "question the nature of these activities". Defence Minister Catherine Vautrin has meanwhile called for close ethical scrutiny of such contracts.

Capgemini has scheduled an extraordinary board meeting for this weekend in Paris as scrutiny intensifies, with unions warning that its outcome could set a precedent for how European firms engage with US security agencies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/92ca346a-fe09-11f0-a98a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/USA-ICE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Justice Department releases 3 million pages of new Epstein files</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-us-justice-department-releases-3-million-pages-of-new-epstein-files</link><description>The US Justice Department announced Friday it was releasing more than three million pages from the Jeffrey Epstein files along with photos and videos, adding fuel to a political drama putting pressure on President Donald Trump .

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said all images of women were redacted from the documents being released aside from those of Ghislaine Maxwell , the accomplice of the convicted sex offender.

The latest release is expected to contain previously unseen material from the investigation into Epstein, a wealthy US financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls.

Previous releases have shed light on Epstein's ties to leading business executives, celebrities, academics and politicians, including Trump and former president Bill Clinton .

Perhaps the most significant documents published so far are two FBI emails from July 2019 which mention 10 "co-conspirators" of Epstein.

Only one person – Epstein's former girlfriend Maxwell – has ever been charged in connection with his crimes and the names of the alleged "co-conspirators" are redacted from the emails.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein, whose death was ruled a suicide.

According to Axios, major documents which have not been released yet include a draft 60-count federal indictment of Epstein that was inexplicably quashed, and an 82-page prosecution memo from 2007.

Trump, a one-time close friend of Epstein, and Clinton both figure prominently in the records published so far but neither has been accused by officials of any wrongdoing.

A Republican-led House panel has voted to launch contempt of Congress proceedings against Bill and Hillary Clinton over their refusal to testify before its probe into Epstein.

Trump, 79, fought for months to prevent release of the vast trove of documents about Epstein.

But a rebellion inside his Republican Party forced him to sign off on a law mandating release of all the documents.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) called for all of the documents held by the Justice Department to be released by December 19.

The department missed that deadline. Blanche has blamed the delay on the need to painstakingly redact the identities of Epstein's more than 1,000 victims from the files.

The sweeping redactions across many of the documents – combined with tight control over the release by the Trump administration – have stoked scepticism that conspiracy theories of a high-level cover-up will be silenced.

As soon as the president's name began surfacing in the released files, the Justice Department issued a statement saying that some documents "contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump".

But the documents already released confirm that Trump was once close to Epstein.

They moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida and documents confirm that Trump flew multiple times on Epstein's private jet.

A January 2020 note from New York federal prosecutors who were investigating Maxwell had Trump making eight trips on Epstein's plane between 1993 and 1996.

Trump has given varying accounts of why he eventually fell out with Epstein. He has criticised the file dumps, expressing concern that people who "innocently met" Epstein over the years risked having their reputations smeared.

A spokesman for Clinton has urged the Justice Department to release all materials in the files related to the former president, saying he had nothing to hide.

"Someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection," Angel Urena said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/17424ca2-fdf9-11f0-9115-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/c78fb3ddc59591e57e22ce07fc3f18ec063da38f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's Justice Department releases massive cache of Jeffrey Epstein files</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-justice-department-releases-new-cache-jeffrey-epstein-files-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday published a new and final cache of millions of documents related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, under a law passed in November that required the release of all Epstein-related records.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said at a press conference that Friday's massive batch of files marked the end of the Trump administration's planned releases under the law. The new cache includes more than three million pages, 2000 videos, and 180,000 images, he said.

The files include "extensive" redactions, he said, given the law's exceptions permitting certain documents to be blacked out, including identifying information of victims or materials related to active investigations. Previous releases have been heavily redacted, drawing criticism from some members of Congress.

Reuters is in the process of reviewing the files.

Trump, who was friends with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s before they had a falling out years before Epstein's first conviction, spent months resisting any release until both Democrats and Republicans in Congress forced his hand by advancing the law over his objections.

Trump has not been formally accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and he has denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. But the scandal has dogged him for months, in part because he promised to release the files during his 2024 presidential campaign.

It was not immediately clear how many of the newly released files included mentions of Trump. The Justice Department's first major release in December contained relatively few references to the president.

In a press release announcing Friday's document production, the Justice Department wrote, "Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already."

Blanche said the department has also withheld some files based on legal privilege, including work product and attorney-client privilege. Some lawmakers have said those withholdings appear to run counter to the law, which required the department to produce internal communications related to decisions on whether to charge or investigate Epstein or any associates.

The Justice Department will provide Congress a report that includes a summary of all redactions and withheld documents, as required under the law, Blanche said in a letter sent to Congress on Friday.

Asked whether he believed all the files had been released in compliance with the law, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, "We believe it is not."

Epstein, a New York financier with ties to high-profile political and business figures, was found hanged in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. While his death was ruled a suicide, it has engendered years of conspiracy theories, some of which Trump himself boosted to his own supporters during his 2024 presidential campaign.

Blanche expressed frustration with accusations that the Justice Department had declined to pursue associates of Epstein who may have participated in illegal activity.

"There's this built-in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information of men that we know about, that we're covering up, or that we're not we're choosing not to prosecute. That is not the case," he said.

The Epstein scandal has become a persistent political problem for Trump, who is already facing sagging approval ratings on a range of issues, including his handling of the economy and his immigration crackdown.

The department's investigation could potentially lead to criminal charges against the officers involved, though there is a high legal bar to bring such a case.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the FBI was examining Saturday's shooting with potential assistance from the department's Civil Rights Division, which typically plays a leading role in investigations into use of force by law enforcement. He cautioned the review was preliminary and he downplayed its scope.

"This is what I would describe as a standard investigation by the FBI when there's circumstances like what we saw last Saturday," Blanche said at a news conference.

Pretti's shooting by agents taking part in an immigration crackdown has stirred widespread outrage and prompted the Trump administration to make changes in the operation in Minnesota. Local officials have said the administration cannot be trusted and are pursuing their own investigation.

“The family’s focus is on a fair and impartial investigation that examines the facts around his murder," Steve Schleicher, an attorney representing the Pretti family, told Reuters in a statement.

A preliminary review by U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Pretti, 37, was shot by two federal officers, a Border Patrol agent and a customs officer. Pretti was the second protester to be shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.

Video of the encounter verified by Reuters showed Pretti holding a cell phone as he was wrestled to the ground by agents. Video also showed that an officer removed a gun from Pretti’s body shortly before the first shots were fired.

Blanche's statement followed days of uncertainty over the nature of DOJ's involvement in the probe.

A Justice Department official told Reuters earlier this week that a criminal civil rights investigation would only begin if warranted by evidence. A DHS official said in a sworn court statement following the shooting that DHS was the lead investigative entity.

The department has so far not opened a criminal civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month. Blanche previously said there was no basis for a criminal probe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:32:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ZOKRPOAV5LS3MCTZQHD34V3T4.jpg?auth=33c0f1cf653ef208d025b9efa8196eefd983c5b2e4bcd1f3ad02c7f4f815ad26&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Catherine O'Hara, 'Schitt's Creek' and 'Home Alone' star, dies at 71</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260130-catherine-o-hara-schitt-s-creek-and-home-alone-star-dies-at-71</link><description>Catherine O'Hara, the Emmy-winning actor known for comedic roles across the decades – from Kevin's mum in “Home Alone” to the iconic Moira Rose in “Schitt's Creek” – died Friday at 71.

The Canadian-born O'Hara died at her home in Los Angeles “following a brief illness”, according to a statement from her agency, Creative Artists Agency. Further details were not immediately available.

O’Hara’s career was launched at the Second City in Toronto in the in 1970s. It was there that she first worked with Eugene Levy, who would become a lifelong collaborator – and her “Schitt’s Creek” costar. The two would be among the original cast of the sketch show “SCTV,” which would help launch the careers of other top Canadian comedians, like Martin Short and Andrea Martin.

O'Hara's dramatic turn in HBO's “The Last of Us” earned her an Emmy nomination, as did her recent role as a Hollywood producer in “The Studio.”

A report , opens new tab by Poland's Computer Emergency Response Team on the incident - which a Polish minister said was the worst of its kind in years - pointed to a team of hackers from Russia's Federal Security Service, known by its Russian acronym FSB.

The hacks were "purely destructive in nature," the report said, comparing them to arson.

"It is worth noting that this period coincided with low temperatures and snowstorms affecting Poland, shortly before New Year’s Eve,” the report said.

The Russian aim was to irreversibly destroy data stored on devices within the combined heat and power plant but security software blocked that portion of the attack, according to the report.

The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

Poland says its critical infrastructure has been subject to a growing number of cyberattacks by Russia since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022. Moscow regularly denies responsibility for malicious cyber activity.

The report tied the incident to an FSB hacking operation tracked under several nicknames, including "Berserk Bear" and “Dragonfly.” An August 20, 2025 report from the FBI linked the groups to the FSB’s specialised unit Center 16.

While the group has historically had “significant interest” in the energy sector and the ability to attack industrial devices, “this is the first publicly described destructive activity attributed to this cluster,” the Polish cyber officials said, referring to the FSB hacking group.

The report’s verdict on the hacks involved partially backs an independent analysis published last week by researchers at the Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET.

ESET said that the malware involved in the Polish attack overlapped with prior destructive cyber operations tied to Russia, but linked it to a Russian military intelligence hacking unit known as Sandworm, not the FSB.

ESET issued a second report , opens new tab Friday expanding on its analysis of the malware which again tied it to Sandworm, although it cautioned that other aspects of the operation might have been carried out by different hacking groups.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group, said Friday that if the attack truly is Berserk Bear, the activity represents an escalation from its penetration of targets for long-term espionage towards damaging action.

"They have the means, the question was always did they have the motivation,” Hultquist said. "Now, potentially based on this attribution, proven to us that they do have the motivation, which puts us in a much more serious situation.”

Hultquist said the situation should raise concerns about the security of the Winter Olympics, set to kick off February 6.

“Russia has previously attempted to knock the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics offline, and they were extremely active during the last summer games," Hultquist said. “Disruptive cyberattacks are a very real threat.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:33:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ICRDGL3XGROGZI6WG4YDIW6GEQ.jpg?auth=746b565700b3c9fc21716622fcef6ddde5c97d106b2d356509bee10ca3f87485&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 200 killed in coltan mine collapse in east Congo, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/more-than-200-killed-coltan-mine-collapse-east-congo-official-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - More than 200 people were killed this week in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Lubumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesperson for the rebel-appointed governor of the province where the mine is located, told Reuters on Friday.

Rubaya produces around 15% of the world's coltan, which is processed into tantalum, a heat-resistant metal that is in high demand by makers of mobile phones, computers, aerospace components and gas turbines. The site, where locals dig manually for a few dollars per day, has been under the control of the M23 rebel group since 2024.

The collapse occurred on Wednesday and the precise toll was still unclear as of Friday evening.

"More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries," Muyisa said.

An adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.

The United Nations says M23 has plundered Rubaya's riches to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighboring Rwanda, an allegation Kigali denies.

The heavily-armed rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority, captured even more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congo during a lightning advance last year.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisia extends state of emergency by 11 months until Dec 31</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisia-extends-state-emergency-by-11-months-until-dec-31-2026-01-30/</link><description>TUNIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Tunisian President Kais Saied has extended a long-running state of emergency by 11 months until December 31, the official gazette showed on Friday.

"Russian production of military goods was supplied last year to more than 30 countries and the amount of foreign exchange earnings exceeded $15 billion," Putin told a meeting on military-technical cooperation in the Kremlin in a pool video.

Putin said the sector was operating in "complicated conditions".

"Pressure from Western countries remained and was even intensified to slow down or block business ties with Russia," he said. "But despite all these attempts, our export contracts were on the whole being honoured consistently."

African countries, he said, were particularly expressing interest in Russian production.

"Despite pressure from the West, African partners are showing readiness to expand their relations with Russia in the military and military-technical fields," he said.

Russia has been cultivating ties with a string of African countries, including in the domain of military cooperation.

The Central African Republic in 2018 brought in Russia's Wagner mercenaries to fend off rebel groups. Its newly reelected president, Faustin-Archange Touadera, invited Putin this month to visit the country.

Russia has also boosted relations with military administrations in Mali and Burkina Faso.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 23:49:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7ZEK6CCLRM77MSH7BINQBFFAA.jpg?auth=3e7e002dcd3d922b829cb24dea9306183afb70eb3afa55f83a561165883234f5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands marched for democracy in Myanmar. Some died in prison.</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/thousands-marched-democracy-myanmar-some-died-prison-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Shwe Theingi was instantly drawn to Wutt Yee Aung when they met at the start of their second year at Myanmar's Dagon University in 2019.

The 19-year-old zoology major stood out with her boyish clothes, short hair and a friendly but outspoken personality, Shwe Theingi said. The two young women, who were active in the student union, quickly became friends.

At about the same time and in the same city, Khant Linn Naing was working at a printing press. He was also pursuing a degree in history at a different university and involved with a student union.

All three students were part of the first generation in decades to come of age in a quasi-democratic Myanmar, enjoying newfound freedoms in the commercial capital of Yangon before the February 1, 2021 military coup .

And all three were caught up in a brutal crackdown against the tens of thousands of young people who took to the streets in support of democracy five years ago.

Many of those protesters took up arms against the junta. Others fled or were detained in prison, where some of them died.

At least 74 political prisoners aged between 18 and 35 have died in detention since the coup, according to previously unreported data from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, whose information on Myanmar is often cited by United Nations agencies.

The tally was corroborated with the Political Prisoners Network of Myanmar (PPNM), which monitors the country's prison system. A total of 273 people charged with public incitement and insurrection after the coup have died while incarcerated, according to PPNM.

Reuters interviewed three associates and relatives of detained students and the two prison monitor groups, and reviewed letters sent by inmates and correctional authorities. Together, they provide the fullest account to date of the conditions experienced by Wutt Yee Aung and Khant Linn Naing and the circumstances of their deaths.

The news agency could not independently verify all the accounts, but they echo allegations made by U.N. investigators last year of "systematic torture, killing and other serious abuses during interrogations and in detention facilities operated by the security forces of Myanmar."

The junta information ministry did not return multiple requests for comment about the allegations of mistreatment.

The military government's foreign ministry last year denied U.N. reports of torture and abuse, without addressing specifics. "These one-sided and unfounded allegations are persistently advanced based on such unverified data," it said in October.

Arrests, torture and conscription, as well as displacement within and outside Myanmar, "have disproportionately affected the younger generation," the U.N. said in a report last year.

An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 young people have fled the country, which has a population of about 51 million, since the coup, according to the U.N. Development Programme.

When the 2021 crackdown began, Shwe Theingi left Yangon. Wutt Yee Aung remained, participating in the anti-junta resistance until she was arrested in September 2021.

After a junta court convicted her on charges that included insurgency and incitement, she was sentenced to seven years in Yangon's notorious Insein prison.

Through letters and the occasional phone call, she stayed in touch with her family and Shwe Theingi.

"Mother, I hope you are well," Wutt Yee Aung said in a letter from prison in February 2024. "I have run out of snacks and medicine, so please transfer 200,000 kyat."

The hand-written plea for around $100 at official exchange rates also contained a list of medicines, including some for treating nerve damage and asthma.

It was during interrogation in the fortnight after her arrest that Wutt Yee Aung sustained head injuries, according to Shwe Theingi and the Dagon University Students' Union, which also said that she had no health problems prior to her imprisonment.

Her health eventually deteriorated so severely that she was hospitalised inside prison at least once in mid-2025, Shwe Theingi said.

In one undated letter intended for Shwe Theingi, Wutt Yee Aung asked for about $150 for a medical test. "Please don't tell my mother about this," she wrote, "I miss everyone."

Wutt Yee Aung died in prison on July 19, 2025, at age 25. Authorities told her family that the cause of death was a heart condition, Shwe Theingi said.

The student union challenged the junta version of her death in a statement.

"Due to political prisoners not being given adequate medical treatment, the lack of medicine and restrictions on contact with her family, Ma Wutt Yee Aung died in prison at around 9.30 p.m. on July 19, 2025," it said, using an honorific for her name.

Khant Linn Naing's family learnt of his arrest on television news.

The 19-year-old was picked up in December 2021 and accused of inciting people to commit offences against the state and insurrection. He was held at Daik-U prison, some 110 km from Yangon, and sentenced by a junta court to 15 years.

In July 2023, his family was jolted again, this time by a letter from correctional authorities, which said Khant Linn Naing had been shot and killed while trying to escape during a prison transfer.

The contents of the letter were described to Reuters by a family member, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation.

Reuters also viewed a letter sent in June 2023 by prison authorities to the family of another inmate at Daik-U, which said he was killed after "security personnel fired warning shots" when he attempted to escape during a transfer.

A colonial-era rule book that a lawyer and a prison monitor said is still used by correctional authorities allows officials to use weapons like firearms against inmates who are attempting to escape only when "there are no other means available to prevent the prisoner from escaping," according to a section of the manual reviewed by Reuters.

Neither death notice provided more information about the circumstances of the alleged escape attempts and the junta information ministry did not respond to requests for specific details.

Khant Linn Naing's parents were not given access to his remains and, over two years after receiving the notice, they have not conducted a funeral, the relative said.

"Because that letter was so unclear, we don't believe he is dead," the person said.

PPNM spokesperson Thaik Tun Oo said he found it implausible that Khant Linn Naing had been trying to escape because prisoners are typically restrained and paired with police officials during a transfer.

He added that his organization had been informed by prison sources that Khant Linn Naing had been subject to harsh interrogation shortly before the alleged transfer.

In the years after Wutt Yee Aung and Khant Linn Naing protested the junta, youth uprisings have upended politics and ousted governments elsewhere in Asia, including Bangladesh and Nepal.

Myanmar's generals, however, have endured. While they have lost territory in their borderlands, the junta has fought back by introducing conscription and expanding aerial power. This month, it concluded a three-phase election that will likely see a military-backed party take power.

"I wanted to become a news presenter. Wutt Yee wanted to do more volunteer work," Shwe Theingi said. "Each of us had different dreams."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 01:59:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DYS4EFEQGJLH5APUZU3IUG7UJA.jpg?auth=b29e78321511f9c394cac24d0360f9ccd4aeff1210c115842b4525aa3bfc59b3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Modi ally proposes social media ban for India's teens as global debate grows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/modi-ally-proposes-social-media-ban-indias-teens-global-debate-grows-2026-01-31/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - An ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proposed a bill to ban social media for children, as the world's biggest market for Meta and YouTube joins a global debate on the impact of social media on young people's health and safety.

"Not only are our children becoming addicted to social media, but India is also one of the world's largest producers of data for foreign platforms," lawmaker L.S.K. Devarayalu told Reuters on Friday.

"Based on this data, these companies are creating advanced AI systems, effectively turning Indian users into unpaid data providers, while the strategic and economic benefits are reaped elsewhere," he said.

Australia last month became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, blocking access in a move welcomed by many parents and child advocates but criticised by major technology companies and free-speech advocates. France's National Assembly this week backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media, while Britain, Denmark and Greece are studying the issue.

Facebook operator Meta (META.O) , opens new tab , YouTube-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab and X did not respond on Saturday to emails seeking comment on the Indian legislation. Meta has said it backs laws for parental oversight but that "governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites."

India's IT ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

India, the world's second-biggest smartphone market with 750 million devices and a billion internet users, is a key growth market for social media apps and does not set a minimum age for access.

Devarayalu's 15-page Social Media (Age Restrictions and Online Safety) Bill, which is not public but was seen by Reuters, says no one under 16 "shall be permitted to create, maintain, or hold" a social media account and those found to have one should have them disabled.

"We are asking that the entire onus of ensuring users' age be placed on the social media platforms," Devarayalu said.

The government's chief economic adviser attracted attention on Thursday by saying India should draft policies on age-based access limits to tackle "digital addiction".

Devarayalu's legislation is a private member's bill - not proposed to parliament by a federal minister - but such bills often trigger debates in parliament and influence lawmaking.

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Europe ‍had ​stirred tensions in the recent protests ‌that gripped ‍the country and "provoked" people.

The United States on Friday approved a sale of $9 billion in Patriot defense missiles for Saudi Arabia, with the deal coming as tensions rise with nearby Iran.

The kingdom, a longtime US partner, plans to buy 730 Patriot missiles from the United States, the State Department said.

The Trump administration has approved a massive new series of arms sales to Israel totaling $6.67 billion, including 30 Apache attack helicopters and related equipment and weapons as well as 3,250 light tactical vehicles.

The State Department announced the package of four separate sales late Friday amid rising tensions in the Middle East over the possibility of US military strikes in Iran.

The Apache helicopters, which will be equipped with rocket launchers and advanced targeting gear, are the biggest part of the total package, coming to $3.8 billion, according to the department.

The next largest portion are the light tactical vehicles, which will be used to move personnel and logistics “to extend lines of communication” for the Israel Defense Forces and will cost $1.98 billion, it said.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images.

The files, posted to the department’s website, include some of the several million pages of records that officials said were withheld from an initial release in December.

Included were documents concerning some of Epstein's famous associates, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Britain’s Prince Andrew, and email correspondence between Epstein and Elon Musk and other prominent contacts from across the political spectrum.

Friday's disclosure represents the largest document dump to date about a saga the Trump administration has struggled to shake because of the president's previous association with Epstein. Criminal investigations into the financier have long animated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and others who have suspected government cover-ups and clamored for a full accounting, demands that Blanche acknowledged might not be satisfied by the latest release.

“There’s a hunger, or a thirst, for information that I don’t think will be satisfied by the review of these documents," he said.

The latest batch includes correspondence either with or about some of Epstein's friends.

The records have thousands of references to Trump, including emails in which Epstein and others shared news articles about him, commented on his policies or politics, or gossiped about him and his family.

Also included was a spreadsheet created last August summarizing calls to the FBI’s National Threat Operation Center or to a hotline established by prosecutors from people claiming without corroboration to have some knowledge of wrongdoing by Trump.

Mountbatten-Windsor's name appears at least several hundred times in the documents, sometimes in news clippings, sometimes in Epstein’s private email correspondence and in guest lists for dinners organized by Epstein. Some records document an attempt by prosecutors in New York to get the former prince to agree to be interviewed as part of their Epstein sex trafficking probe.

The records also show Musk, the billionaire Tesla founder, reached out to Epstein on at least two occasions to plan visits to the Caribbean island where many of the allegations of sexual abuse purportedly occurred.

In a 2012 exchange, Epstein asked how many people Musk would like flown by helicopter to the island he owned.

“Probably just Talulah and me,” Musk responded, referencing his then-partner, actress Talulah Riley. “What day/night will be the wildest party on our island?”

It’s not immediately clear if the island visits took place. Musk has said he repeatedly rebuffed Epstein's overtures.

Epstein also appears to have tried to connect New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch with women, according to emails.

Tisch said in a statement that he had a “brief association” with Epstein where they emailed about adult women and other topics. He said he “never went to his island” and that he “deeply regrets” the association.

The documents show that Steve Bannon , a conservative activist who served as Trump’s White House strategist earlier in the president’s first term, bantered over politics with the financier, discussed get-togethers with him and, on March 29, 2019, asked Epstein if he could supply his plane to pick him up in Rome.

Epstein told him his pilot and crew “are doing their best” to arrange that flight but if Bannon could find a charter flight instead, “I’m happy to pay.” Apparently in France at the time, Epstein sent a text message saying: “My guys can pick you up. Come for dinner.” The exchange did not show how that played out.

In December 2012, Epstein invited Howard Lutnick, now Trump's commerce secretary, to his private island for lunch, the records show. Lutnick’s wife accepted the invitation and said they would arrive on a yacht with their children. On another occasion in 2011, the two men had drinks, according to a schedule shared with Epstein.

Lutnick has said he cut ties with Epstein long ago. A Commerce Department spokesman said Lutnick had “limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.”

Another Epstein contact surfacing in the records is former Obama White House general counsel Kathy Ruemmler. In one of several exchanges, Epstein emailed Ruemmler to advise that Democrats should stop demonizing Trump as a Mafia-type figure even as he derided the president as a “maniac.”

A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs , where Ruemmler is general counsel and chief legal officer, said in a statement that Ruemmler “had a professional association with Jeffrey Epstein when she was a lawyer in private practice” and "regrets ever knowing him.”

The documents were disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted after months of public and political pressure that requires the government to open its files on the late financier and his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell .

Lawmakers complained when the Justice Department made only a limited release last month, but officials said more time was needed to review additional documents that were discovered and to ensure no sensitive information about victims was released.

After missing a December 19 deadline set by Congress to release all the files, the Justice Department said it tasked hundreds of lawyers with reviewing the records to determine what needed to be redacted, or blacked out.

It denied any effort to shield Trump, who says he cut ties with Epstein years ago after an earlier friendship, from potential embarrassment.

Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

In 2008 and 2009, Epstein served jail time in Florida after pleading guilty to soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. At the time, investigators had gathered evidence that Epstein had sexually abused underage girls at his Palm Beach home. The U.S. attorney's office agreed not to prosecute him in exchange for his guilty plea to lesser state charges.

A draft indictment from that period released Friday shows prosecutors contemplated federal charges against not just Epstein but three others who were his personal assistants and were suspected of participating in a conspiracy to recruit underage girls to perform lewd acts with Epstein.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 06:56:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/28718252-fe69-11f0-ae35-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031020763767.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Are the West's tightening oil sanctions finally taking their toll on Russia’s economy?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-are-the-west-tightening-oil-sanctions-finally-taking-toll-russia-economy</link><description>Across the world's vast oceans, more and more tankers bearing crude oil drawn from the Russian soil have begun to sit idle in the water.

Reuters estimates suggest 19 million barrels of Urals crude loaded before December 15 are still in transit as traders deliberately slow their journeys, struggling to nail down buyers amid declining demand.

And where the oil does flow, it's bringing in less and less in return. Last year, Russia’s revenue from oil and gas sales dropped by about a fifth to their lowest point in five years.

That Russia is getting less and less money from flogging fossil fuels is not in itself surprising – a global glut of crude has pushed oil prices down all over. On top of that, a strong rouble means that Moscow is getting less in its own currency for each dollar it earns from its exports.

But years of Western sanctions , including US President Donald Trump ’s decision in October to target Rosneft and Lukoil – Russia’s two largest oil exporters – also appear to be increasingly eating into Moscow’s much-needed oil rents.

Since the October sanctions, the discount at which Russia is forced to sell its oil to tempt trading partners to risk taking sanctioned crude has doubled. In December, the country’s Urals crude fell below $40 a barrel – its lowest point since global oil prices plummeted in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Taken with the outgoing Biden administration’s decision in January to impose sanctions on the country’s third- and fourth-largest oil exporters, four-fifths of Russia’s oil production is now under US sanctions .

And unlike earlier sanctions, these latest measures hit not just the named companies themselves, but anyone doing business with them.

Alexander Kolyandr, a financial analyst and a senior scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said that the secondary sanctions imposed by Trump threatened to cut companies receiving Russian oil off from the US-run financial infrastructure that underpins much of the global economy.

“The main feature of the American sanctions is that the United States, unlike Europe, is ready to apply secondary sanctions – in other words, if the United States sanctions you, and I trade with you, the US feels within its rights to fine or sanction me,” he said.

“We saw that, for example, in China, the main buyer of the Russian oil was not the state-owned companies or large companies, but rather, what's called ‘teapot refineries’ – small refineries which get sanctioned oil, refine it and then sell it. They have no exposure to the United States, and they can risk it.”

Targeting Russia’s oil rents has been a core strategy of Western governments’ economic response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine . In the months that followed the Russian advance, European Union and Group of 7 countries imposed a “price cap” on Russia’s seaborne oil exports.

The cap effectively banned commercial operators based in EU or G7 countries from transporting Russian oil – or providing insurance or other financial services to those who did – unless it was sold for less than a fixed price.

Originally set at $60 a barrel, the price cap will fall to under $44 a barrel as of February 1.

Catherine Wolfram, the William Barton Rogers professor of energy economics at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, said that the price cap had been designed to avoid a sudden spike in oil prices that could have been triggered by keeping Russian oil off the world market altogether. Russia is the world’s third-largest producer of oil.

“The price cap was designed to A, drive a wedge between the global price and what Russia received for its oil, and B, keep oil on the market – especially in 2022 when oil prices were very high and inflation was running rampant,” she said. “It succeeded with B. With A, it drove a bit of a wedge, but the Trump administration’s actions on Rosneft and Lukoil widened that wedge.”

To sell its oil at higher prices, Russia has become increasingly reliant on what some have dubbed a “shadow fleet” of ageing commercial oil tankers of unclear ownership.

Earlier in January, the French navy boarded an oil tanker in the Mediterranean and forced it to dock in Marseille . The captain who, like all members of the crew is an Indian national, has been taken into custody. French President Emmanuel Macron accused the tanker of helping to “finance Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”. He was released from custody on Monday.

“We see a mounting campaign against Russia’s shadow fleet – it seems that both the Americans and the Europeans are ready to up the ante and start seizing these ships, which increases the cost of transportation,” Kolyandr said. “It all results in the buyer’s attempt to push prices lower. That’s where the discount is coming from.”

Increasingly cut off from Western markets, Moscow initially found willing buyers in India and China , where refiners have jumped at the chance to buy Russian crude at bargain prices.

But Daniel Spiro, an associate professor at the department of economics at Sweden's Uppsala University, said that the latest US sanctions seemed to have spooked even these once-eager buyers.

“For maybe the first time, it seems to have affected India's and China's willingness to buy Russian oil,” he said. “India decreased the volumes and China seems to have demanded a higher discount on the oil it buys. And this hasn't really been the case previously.”

Another casualty of these sanctions has been Lukoil’s extensive overseas assets. Founded in the frantic privatisations that marked the former Soviet Union’s wrenching transition to a market economy, Lukoil is believed to have some $22 billion worth of assets across the world, including in Iraq , Egypt , Nigeria and Mexico .

This week, the company announced that US private equity titan the Carlyle Group had agreed to buy up these assets – except for those in Kazakhstan – for an undisclosed price. The deal would require final approval from the US Treasury.

Spiro said that while the sale would likely eat into Russia’s oil and gas revenue, it would nevertheless boost the country’s critical foreign reserves.

“Presumably they do that at a low price compared to if this would have just been any regular market exchange,” he said. “So it is reducing the profits from oil and gas for Russia, but it is increasing the money they have – because they sold it off.”

He said that it was unclear what impact the sale would have on Russia’s vast oil and gas industry.

“Sanctions are a cat-and-mouse game – somebody imposes sanctions on Russia, and initially, they can be quite painful,” he said. “And Russia, of course, tries to avoid it in some way. For all I know, it could be that when they sell these assets, they use the money to invest in oil and gas production in Russia.”

Wolfram said that the planned sale was partly born from financial necessity.

“This feels like eating your seed corn, but Russia really needs the funds now,” she said.

Russia’s shrinking oil revenues risk eating into the wider state budget.

Oil and gas revenue made up less than 23 percent of the federal budget by the end of 2025 – something not seen for 20 years. With government spending outstripping revenue, last year's budget deficit ended up around 2.6 percent of GDP.

To make up for the shortfall, the Russian government has already begun increasing a range of domestic taxes, including raising VAT to 22 percent – as well as the threshold under which small businesses are exempt from paying it.

Spiro said that declining oil and gas revenues would push the government into making difficult decisions.

“Russia has a few choices. They can raise other taxes – that has a cost, and it's not going to be popular,” he said. “Or they need to increase government take in Russian oil and gas, but it's already quite high – I don't think there's a lot of margin to move on there. Or it has to reduce spending.”

While Russia's war-time economy has driven up wages in some of the country's poorest regions as workers man the production lines of a growing military-industrial complex, the overall economic situation is less rosy.

Economic growth has slowed as the central bank cracks down on inflation with double-digit interest rates, and social spending has already been slashed from 38 percent in 2021 to 25 percent this year.

“There's essentially two ways it can reduce spending – either reduce the war effort or reduce pensions and things like that,” Spiro said. “One of the key questions since the full-scale invasion has been, how far can the Russian government push its economy – or essentially push the costs onto its population.”

Ultimately, though, Kolyandr said it was unlikely the rising cost of Western sanctions would impact Putin’s determination to continue the nearly four-year war in Ukraine.

“Those decisions can only be made by Putin himself if he decides to wind down the war,” he said. “And I think his priorities are pretty clear – that the war and all this geopolitical struggle has priority. That the Russians had a couple of years of pretty good economic growth, and they can suffer a little bit. I don't think that it will derail his ideas.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/14fd6f62-fdfe-11f0-aaac-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25316184713361.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela announces amnesty push targeting mass release of political prisoners</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260131-venezuela-announces-amnesty-push-targeting-mass-release-of-political-prisoners</link><description>Venezuela 's acting president announced on Friday a proposal for mass amnesty in the country, in her latest major reform since the US toppling of Nicolas Maduro just weeks ago.

Delcy Rodriguez , in a speech at the Venezuelan Supreme Court attended by top government officials, said she will propose a "general amnesty law covering the entire period of political violence from 1999 to the present."

Leftist revolutionary Hugo Chavez assumed the presidency in 1999, and was succeeded upon his death in 2013 by Maduro, who oversaw an increasingly authoritarian government and whose two re-elections were widely dismissed as fraudulent.

"This law will serve to heal the wounds left by political confrontation, fueled by violence and extremism. It will allow us to put justice back on track in our country," Rodriguez said, also announcing a "major national consultation for a new judicial system."

She also announced plans to close the notorious El Helicoide prison in Caracas, where rights groups say political prisoners were tortured by Maduro's intelligence services.

The massive facility, originally built as a shopping mall, will be turned into a "sports, cultural and commercial center for police families and neighboring communities," Rodriguez said.

A mother interviewed by AFP near El Helicoide was overjoyed that her son, imprisoned inside, may soon be released under the law.

"It's wonderful! I haven't heard from my son in six months, so, damn it, this is a huge joy, it's an amnesty, my God, it's total liberation," said Betsy Orellana, 63.

Formerly Maduro's vice president, Rodriguez, 56, has quickly moved in less than four weeks in power to overhaul Venezuelan society in ways sought by the United States, earning high praise from US President Donald Trump .

Along with her brother, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez, she has passed a new law opening up the country's critical oil sector to private investments – a key demand of Trump.

The move on Thursday was almost immediately followed by a rollback on US sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil industry.

The government also agreed on January 8, five days after Maduro was seized in a deadly US military operation, to free inmates considered political prisoners by rights groups.

Families – many of whom began camping outside the prisons – and rights groups have criticized the slow pace of the releases, with the Foro Penal NGO counting less than 300 in total released since January 8.

Opposition figures in Venezuela have voiced reserved optimism at the changes taking place, wary that Maduro's closest allies still remain in power.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado said Friday that Rodriguez's amnesty proposal came only after she was pushed by Washington.

"This is not a voluntary gesture by the regime, but a response to pressure from the United States government. And I hope that the prisoners will soon be able to be with their families," she posted on social media.

Opposition lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, whose two brothers are imprisoned, said he hope the amnesty would end "an era of repression."

"May this be the beginning of a path that leads us to freedom and democracy, definitively and forever," he told AFP in an interview at his home in Caracas.

US authorities on Friday announced that all Americans known to be held prisoner in Venezuela had been released.

The announcement came hours after the release of Peruvian-American political prisoner Arturo Gallino Rullier, whom the Foro Penal group said was on his way to the United States.

For years, Venezuela has routinely arrested foreigners and domestic opposition actors on a range of charges from spying to plotting attacks – charges critics dismiss as fabricated.

In a sign of Trump's satisfaction with the new Venezuelan authorities, his administration lifted a ban on US flights to the South American country.

And after years of the US embassy being shuttered, Washington is also preparing to re-establish its diplomatic presence in Caracas.

Seasoned diplomat Laura Dogu was recently named US charge d'affaires for Venezuela – the highest level representative below an ambassador.

Dogu is expected to arrive in Caracas on Saturday, diplomatic sources told AFP.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:32:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5af68142-fe45-11f0-b037-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/17256d9719472ab9bfb1c2fa45b4e6c32ca296a4.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia landslide death toll rises to 49, agency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesia-landslide-death-toll-rises-49-agency-says-2026-01-31/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The death toll from a landslide a week ago in Indonesia's West Java province has risen to 49, the country's main rescue agency Basarnas said on Saturday, with 15 still missing.

Twenty-three soldiers were also killed while conducting border patrol training, the navy said on Tuesday.

The January 24 landslide that hit Pasir Langu village in the Bandung Barat was triggered by heavy rains. The landslide followed cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra late last year that killed 1,200 people and displaced over one million residents.

The rescue agency extended the emergency response period for seven days to February 6.

Basarnas had its funding cut by a parliamentary panel on Wednesday, despite concerns over the number of disasters the agency has to deal with.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:51:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7Z7VQWI3CJK5FEXZ5CBZAFAISU.jpg?auth=5f2d8f0a5d27d8b7212c554f9dbab1ca59b7ddb7bebced65839963706e959741&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran president says Trump, Netanyahu, Europe stirred tensions in protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-president-says-trump-netanyahu-europe-stirred-tensions-protests-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that U.S., Israeli and European leaders had exploited Iran's economic problems, incited unrest and provided people with the means to "tear the nation apart” in recent protests.

The two-week long nationwide protests, which began in late December over an economic crisis marked by soaring inflation and rising living costs, have abated after a bloody crackdown by the clerical authorities that U.S.-based rights group HRANA says has killed at least 6,563, including 6,170 protesters and 214 security forces.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told CNN Turk that 3,100, including 2,000 security forces, had been killed.

The U.S., Israeli and European leaders tried to "provoke, create division, and supplied resources, drawing some innocent people into this movement," Pezeshkian said in a live state TV broadcast.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced support for the demonstrators, saying the U.S. was prepared to take action if Iran continued to kill protesters. U.S. officials said on Friday that Trump was reviewing his options but had not decided whether to strike Iran.

Israel's Ynet news website said on Friday that a U.S. Navy destroyer had docked at the Israeli port of Eilat.

Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Europeans "rode on our problems, provoked, and were seeking — and still seek — to fragment society," said Pezeshkian.

"They brought them into the streets and wanted, as they said, to tear this country apart, to sow conflict and hatred among the people and create division," Pezeshkian said.

"Everyone knows that the issue was not just a social protest," he added.

Regional allies including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have been engaging in diplomatic efforts to prevent a military confrontation between Washington and Tehran.

The U.S. is demanding that Iran curb its missile programme if the two nations are to instead resume talks, but Iran has rejected that demand.

Foreign Minister Araqchi said in Turkey on Tuesday that missiles would never be the subject of any negotiations.

In response to U.S. threats of military action, Araqchi said Tehran was ready for either negotiations or warfare, and also ready to engage with regional countries to promote stability and peace.

"Regime change is a complete fantasy. Some have fallen for this illusion," Araqchi told CNN Turk. "Our system is so deeply rooted and so firmly established that the comings and goings of individuals make no difference."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4X4WMN3PFNWZJ46HQSQYMWUCU.jpg?auth=613700e4aaef77a4559a23eb8aaa05ad01f407efcb0f2ceaad0fc9e006efeca5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French fishermen repurpose used nets to help Ukraine protect against drone attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-french-fishermen-repurpose-used-nets-help-ukraine-protect-drone-attacks</link><description>"These fishing nets were used to catch monkfish, a strong fish that hits the net hard," said Christian Abazou from the Brittany-based NGO Kernic Solidarités.

One airstrike hit an apartment in Gaza City killing three children and two women, according to a family member and the official Palestinian news agency WAFA. Another airstrike hit a tent in Khan Younis, further south, according to WAFA.

The Israeli military said it was looking into the report and did not immediately say whether it had carried out airstrikes in the enclave.

Video showed charred, blackened and destroyed walls at an apartment in a multi-storey building, and debris scattered inside it and outside on the Gaza City street.

"We found my three little nieces in the street, they say ceasefire and all, what did those children do, what did we do?" said Samer al-Atbash, a relative.

Israeli fire has killed more than 500 people, most of them civilians according to Gaza health officials, since a U.S.-brokered truce between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel took effect in October after two years of war .

Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli soldiers since the truce, according to Israeli authorities.

On Friday, the Israeli military said that its forces identified eight gunmen emerging from a tunnel in Rafah , in southern Gaza. Three of them were killed and a fourth, whom it described as a key Hamas commander in the area, was arrested.

The two sides have traded blame over truce violations, even as Washington presses them to proceed to the next phases of the ceasefire deal meant to end the war for good.

The next phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan includes complex issues such as Hamas disarmament , which the group has long rejected, further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.

Gaza's main gateway, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt that has been largely shut during the war, is expected to reopen on Sunday .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:52:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AZHVMLGAQFMQHKDPFHPFWMRPFA.jpg?auth=e7dc01be6fc3da67793e1b8945b5d17ed2fe7e8810599496c6edbdedf59a48b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands flee northwest Pakistan after mosques warn of possible military action</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thousands-flee-northwest-pakistan-after-mosques-warn-possible-military-action-2026-01-31/</link><description>BARA/KARACHI, Pakistan, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people have fled a remote mountainous region in northwestern Pakistan in recent weeks, residents said, after warnings broadcast from mosques urged families to evacuate ahead of a possible military action against Islamist militants.

Residents of the Tirah Valley, in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that borders Afghanistan, said they have moved out of the area into nearby towns despite heavy snowfall and cold winter temperatures because of the announcements to avoid the possible fighting.

"The announcements were made in the mosque that everyone should leave, so everyone was leaving. We left too," said Gul Afridi, a shopkeeper who fled with his family to the town of Bara located 71 km (44 miles) east of the Tirah Valley.

Local officials in the region, who asked to remain unidentified, said thousands of families have fled and are being registered for assistance in nearby towns.

The Tirah Valley has long been a sensitive security zone and a stronghold for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, an Islamist militant group that has carried out attacks on Pakistani security forces.

The Pakistani government has not announced the evacuation nor any planned military operation.

On Tuesday, Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif denied any operation was planned or underway in Tirah, calling the movement a routine seasonal migration driven by harsh winter conditions.

However, a Pakistani military source with knowledge of the matter said the relocation followed months of consultations involving tribal elders, district officials and security authorities over the presence of militants in Tirah, who they said were operating among civilian populations and pressuring residents.

The source asked to remain unidentified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.

The source said civilians were encouraged to temporarily leave to reduce the risk of harm as "targeted intelligence-based operations" continued, adding there had been no build-up for a large-scale offensive due to the area's mountainous terrain and winter conditions.

Pakistan's military media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, the interior ministry, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government did not respond to requests for comment made on Friday.

Residents rejected suggestions that winter alone drove the movement.

"No one left because of the cold," said Abdur Rahim, who said he left his village for Bara earlier this month after hearing evacuation announcements. "It has been snowing for years. We have lived there all our lives. People left because of the announcements."

Gul Afridi described a perilous journey through snowbound roads along with food shortages that made the evacuation an ordeal that took his family nearly a week.

"Here I have no home, no support for business. I don't know what is destined for us," he said at a government school in Bara where hundreds of displaced people lined up to register for assistance, complaining of slow processes and uncertainty over how long they would remain displaced.

Abdul Azeem, another displaced resident, said families were stranded for days and that children died along the way. "There were a lot of difficulties. People were stuck because of the snow," he said.

The Tirah Valley drew national attention in September after a deadly explosion at a suspected bomb-making site, with officials and local leaders offering conflicting accounts of whether civilians were among the dead.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:53:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4LLIDQPKRNLQHNZUWG6JH2FOSE.jpg?auth=06785e09330ab7bbb70f666e3386bf1105c74522df75a9365f8dd568829a7980&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's corruption watchdog probing emergency management minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-corruption-watchdog-probing-emergency-management-minister-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - China's minister of emergency management, Wang Xiangxi, is being investigated for suspected "serious violations of discipline and law," a common euphemism for corruption, the anti-graft watchdog said on Saturday as a purge of senior officials continues.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection did not provide details in its statement on Wang, a Communist Party secretary. It is relatively rare for a sitting minister to undergo investigation.

In President Xi Jinping’s years-long corruption purge, the defence ministry announced last week it was investigating the nation's top general, Zhang Youxia, who is second only to Xi in the military leadership.

Xi said this month that anti-corruption is a battle China must not lose, following a record 65 probes into high-ranking officials last year, while scrutiny has expanded to former leaders of universities and state-owned enterprises.

Wang, 63, took office in July 2022, after serving as chairman of state-owned power generator National Energy Investment Corp.

He appeared on Tuesday, speaking at a regular internal meeting where cadres engage in self-criticism, according to an official release from the Ministry of Emergency Management.

Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for decades, where militants target state forces, foreign nationals and non-locals in the mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran .

"The terrorists ... launched coordinated attacks this morning at more than 12 locations", a senior security official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

"Thirty-seven terrorists have been eliminated... Ten security personnel were martyred while a few others were injured," the official added.

A senior security official based in the provincial capital of Quetta said at least four policemen were killed in Quetta, although it was not clear whether they were included in the 10 officials killed.

A senior military official based in Islamabad confirmed the attacks, adding they were "coordinated but poorly executed".

The attacks "failed due to poor planning and rapid collapse under effective security response", the official added.

Separatists had also abucted the deputy commissioner of Nushki district, a senior official in Quetta said.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for "foiling coordinated attacks" in 12 locations.

"I, along with the entire nation, am proud of our martyrs," Sharif said in a statement accusing India of backing the separatists.

"We will continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication from the country," he said.

At least four police officials in as many districts confirmed that the situation was not completely under control yet.

Mobile phone services have been jammed and traffic disrupted in the affected districts, while train services have been suspended across the province.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the most active militant separatist group in the province, claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement sent to AFP.

The group claimed to target military installations and police and civil administration officials during gun attacks and suicide bombings, adding that major highways were also blocked to disrupt the military's operation.

In Quetta, an AFP journalist heard several explosions as heavy security was deployed across the city, with major roads deserted and business activity shut down.

"Since morning, there have been explosions one after another," Abdul Wali, a 38-year-old private employee, said as he struggled to find blood for his hospitalised mother.

"The police point guns at us and say go back otherwise they beat us. What should we do?" he added.

Saturday's attacks come a day after the military said it had killed 41 insurgents in two separate operations in the province.

Balochistan is Pakistan's poorest province, despite an abundance of untapped natural resources, and lags behind the rest of the country in education, employment and economic development.

Baloch separatists have intensified attacks on Pakistanis from neighbouring provinces working in the region in recent years, as well as foreign energy firms, which they believe are exploiting the province's riches.

Pakistan routinely accuses neighbouring India and Afghanistan of fomenting militancy.

"Throughout the operation, the terrorists were reportedly in continuous contact with their handlers in Afghanistan," the security official said.

Last year, ethnic Baloch separatists attacked a train with 450 passengers on board, sparking a two-day siege during which dozens of people were killed.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:28:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4c341cd6-fe87-11f0-a6ca-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/8ad3e8510b89b341c1573ef4570f8860ac833f9f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moldova hit by widespread power cuts amid Ukraine grid problems</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/moldova-hit-by-widespread-power-cuts-amid-ukraine-grid-problems-2026-01-31/</link><description>CHISINAU, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Moldova's energy system was hit by an emergency outage on Saturday due to problems in neighbouring Ukraine's grid, officials said, with the capital Chisinau and other parts of the country experiencing power cuts.

According to a Moldovan energy ministry statement on the Telegram app, disruptions in Ukraine's grid led to a voltage drop on one of the power lines into Moldova.

Most districts in Moldova's Chisinau were without electricity supplies, the city mayor Ion Ceban said on Telegram, with officials adding that even traffic lights were not working.

Ukrainian energy officials have yet to comment on the situation. Emergency power cuts have also been introduced in some parts of Ukraine, power company DTEK said, and the metro in Kyiv has stopped operating.

The grid emergency has also led to a temporary halt to Kyiv's water supply, officials said.

Ukraine's power grid has been one of the main targets of months of Russian strikes, and there have been significant restrictions to power supplies for consumers there for weeks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:52:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cubans under siege as US stranglehold sets in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-under-siege-us-stranglehold-sets-2026-01-31/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S. threatens a stranglehold on the communist-run nation.

Reuters interviewed over three dozen residents of towns and neighborhoods around the capital Havana – the country's political and economic engine - from street vendors to private sector workers, taxi drivers and state employees.

Together, those discussions paint a picture of a people pushed to the limit as goods and services - particularly those tied to ever more limited fuel supplies - become scarcer and more expensive.

For much of rural Cuba, this is not entirely new. The island's frail and antiquated power generation system has been slowly failing for years and residents have grown accustomed to spending hours at a time without functioning electricity , internet or water pumps.

But the seaside capital, where the streets are lined with 1950s-era cars and colorful if decrepit Spanish colonial architecture, has until recently fared better.

Now crisis looks set to swamp it, too, as fuel shortages take hold, with first Venezuela , then Mexico halting oil shipments to the island.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs will be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe in the wake of the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.

In many other countries, the conditions would have sent people out into the streets. So far, in a nation where dissent has long been curbed, there has been little sign of protest. But it is unclear how much more Cubans will be willing to endure.

Cuba's peso has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar in three weeks, pushing up the price of groceries.

"This has put me in an impossible situation," said Yaite Verdecia, a Havana resident and housewife. "There's no salary that can cope with this."

Trump, when asked about the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in Cuba shortly after the capture of Maduro, said he did not think an attack was necessary because "it looks like it's going down."

On Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an "international emergency" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted "an unusual and extraordinary threat."

But the government has said little about how it will manage the growing threat of humanitarian crisis.

Many of the Cubans Reuters spoke with said daily life - already difficult - had been reduced to basics like assuring food, fuel for cooking, and water, and that it had become noticeably harder in recent days.

Lines for gasoline have grown significantly this week at a handful of service centers in the city still supplied with fuel. And since the U.S. blocked Venezuelan deliveries of oil to Cuba in mid-December, virtually all gas has been sold at a premium, in dollars - a currency to which few Cubans have access.

"It used to be that you could sign up and get fuel once a month (in pesos)," said Havana resident Jesus Sosa, referring to an app that would let residents know when it was their turn to fill up their cars. "Not anymore. Sales in national currency have stopped."

The crunch has hit both public and private transportation, putting some buses and private taxis out of business and forcing others to raise their prices.

Daylan Perez, a 22-year-old who hails private taxis for clients in old Havana, said fewer buses mean people now have no choice but to pay rising fees for private transport.

"You have to pay the price or stay home," he said.

Even transportation by electric vehicle - once thought to be a panacea in a city short of fuel - has been hit by blackouts that now last for eight to 12 hours or more.

Taxi driver Alexander Leyet of Havana swapped to an electric three-wheeled taxi recently, thinking he had outsmarted the pack.

"Now because of the blackouts I can only charge my taxi for four or five hours," he said.

For decades, the government that has its roots in Fidel Castro's 1959 Cuban Revolution has survived despite sometimes brutal economic struggles, upending regular predictions of imminent collapse or an uprising.

It has long alleged a U.S.-led effort to foment revolt, but the most recent widespread protests were in the pandemic year of 2021, despite a 12% contraction of the economy between 2019 and 2024.

Sharp crackdowns on any form of dissent, combined with the emigration of between one and two million people since the pandemic, have all but eliminated organized in-country opposition. The Cubans interviewed by Reuters generally declined to answer questions about the prospect of protests.

But none of those interviewed disputed that change was necessary.

"I'm just praying God finds a way to get us out of this (mess)," said Mirta Trujillo, a 71-year-old street vendor from Guanabacoa who burst into tears as she told Reuters she could no longer afford food. Previously, she had depended on a ration book of basic goods provided by the government, but that was phased out post-pandemic as tourist income and other sources of hard currency dried up.

"I'm not against my country... but I don't want to die of hunger," she said.

On a recent weekday evening, Reuters witnessed an accident at a busy intersection in Havana where the stoplights were not functioning as a result of a power outage.

"Sometimes when the power goes out, accidents happen because the traffic lights don't work," said Raysa Lemu, whose apartment overlooks a boulevard in Marianao, on the outskirts of Havana.

"It used to be they turned off the power two or three times a week, but now it's every day and sometimes it's up to 12 hours."

Julia Anita Cobas, a 69-year-old housekeeper from Guanabacoa, gets up at 4 a.m. each morning for a 10-mile (16-km) commute that now approaches four hours round-trip. With less public transportation available, the journey has become longer and more costly.

"I leave my house before sunrise and I don't know how I'll get back," she said.

But Cobas, who was born just before Castro's revolution, said she had no expectation that Trump would make things any better.

"Since I was born the (United States) has been threatening us, and every day we deal with hardship. But we've survived it all," she said.

Aimee Milanes, a 32-year-old resident of Reparto Electrico, just outside Havana, said neither the Cuban nor the U.S. government offered her much hope.

"We're drowning. But there's nothing we can do," said Milanes. "This is about survival. Nothing else."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:20:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EU4GIFNX7RL4XOMZLGHJT35TVA.jpg?auth=3e1a72443b77e9d6e1059a5ba667b2a6e895c4f7d1dfd42086c86d6c92804358&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Technical malfunction' causes mass power outages in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-technical-malfunction-causes-mass-power-outages-in-ukraine</link><description>Ukraine 's power grid experienced mass outages on Saturday after a "technical malfunction" caused electrical lines between Moldova , Romania and Ukraine to fail, Ukraine's energy minister said.

The malfunction "caused a simultaneous shutdown of the 400 kilovolt line between the power grids of Romania and Moldova and the 750 kilovolt line between western and central Ukraine", Denys Shmygal said on Telegram.

Problems ​in Ukraine's ⁠power grid also led to the emergency ​shutdown ‍of Moldova's ​energy system on Saturday, Moldova's ​energy ministry said.

The latest outages come amid recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure that have caused major disruptions to heat, electricity and water provision as the country faces a particularly harsh winter.

Due to the power shortages on Saturday, Kyiv 's metro system temporarily closed, the operator said.

The Kyiv metro is a vital transport artery for the capital and rarely pauses operations, even during intense Russian bombardment.

Around 800,000 passengers use the system daily, according to data published last year. Many of them rely on it to commute to work.

Residents also use its 52 stations as bomb shelters during Russian attacks.

"Due to a power outage from external power supply centres, train service and escalator operation have been temporarily suspended in the metro," Kyiv Metro said in a post on Facebook.

The system will serve as a shelter until power resumes, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on Telegram.

Russia has hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure throughout its nearly four-year invasion, but Kyiv says this winter has been the toughest yet, as attacks cut power and heating to millions during sub-zero temperatures.

The Kremlin said Friday said that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to stop striking Kyiv for a week until Sunday following a request from US counterpart Donald Trump .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:24:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f5db951e-fe93-11f0-b136-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-30T174851Z-1518836082-RC2PBJAM6D77-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-COLD-KYIV.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria's Fela Kuti is first African musician honoured with Grammys Lifetime Achievement award</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260131-fela-kuti-first-african-honored-grammys-lifetime-achievement-award-afrobeat</link><description>Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti to make history as first African honoured with posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After a lifetime of clashes with successive powers in Nigeria , the recognition comes nearly three decades after Fela's death and long after his influence reshaped global music.

He is one of several artists getting the award at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Saturday, the eve of the main Grammys gala.

Others are Cher, Whitney Houston, Carlos Santana, Paul Simon and Chaka Khan.

In the 1970s, Fela the multi-instrumentalist and full-of-life performer invented Afrobeat: a mixture of jazz , funk and African rhythms.

That laid the groundwork for Afrobeats – a later genre that has attracted a global audience by blending traditional African rhythms with contemporary pop sounds, with its roots in Nigeria.

Two years ago the Grammys introduced the category of Best African Performance in 2024 and it has been dominated by Afrobeats artists, especially from Nigeria.

Of the five nominees for the Best African performance this year, three are Nigerian Afrobeats singers, after another Nigerian, Tems, won last year.

"Fela's influence spans generations, inspiring artists such as Beyonce, Paul McCartney and Thom Yorke, and shaping modern Nigerian Afrobeats," said a citation on the Grammys list of this year's honourees.

Known also as the "Black President", the activist and legendary musician, died in 1997 at the age of 58.

His legacy lives on through his sons, Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti, and grandson Made.

"This acknowledgment coming at this time when all three of us are present. It feels wonderful," Grammy-nominated Made Kuti said.

"It feels wonderful that all of us are still practicing Afrobeat, still taking the legacy as far as we can take it."

Yemisi Ransome-Kuti, Fela's first cousin and head of the family, said on Friday the award was "a celebration for the African people and they should take (it).. as their award. Another African is being celebrated."

"But we also want to send a message to those who are giving these acknowledgements, please ...not wait till people are dead," she said.

As to what would have been Fela's reaction, Ransome-Kuti said: "I'm sure he would have said better late than never" although "in his lifetime he was not particularly interested in being recognised in the external world, particularly the western world".

Fela was arrested frequently by military governments during his career, sometimes for political activism and sometimes also on allegations of theft, which he denied.

His first brush with the law dated back to 1974 when he released his famous album "Zombie", generally considered by the military authorities in power as a diatribe levelled at them.

His songs were long, defiant and explicitly anti-governments in power and anti-corruption.

His manager, Rikki Stein, speaking on the phone from Los Angeles where he will join the Kuti family at the ceremony, was confident the award would "significantly uplift Fela's music".

"Fifty albums out there. I'm sure it's going to continue onward and upward."

"An increasing number of people what weren't even born when Fela died are expressing interest in listening to Fela's music and hopefully Fela's message," he said</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:44:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/32de12d0-fe98-11f0-9909-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP8609130557-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone strikes in Ethiopia's Tigray region kill one, injure another</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/drone-strikes-ethiopias-tigray-region-kill-one-injure-another-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - One person was killed and another injured in drone strikes in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region on Saturday, a senior Tigrayan official and a humanitarian worker said, in another sign of renewed conflict between regional and national forces.

Ethiopia's national army fought fighters from the Tigray People's Liberation Front for two years until late 2022, in a war researchers say killed hundreds of thousands through direct violence, the collapse of healthcare and famine.

Fighting broke out between regional and national forces in the disputed territory of western Tigray earlier this week, according to diplomatic and government sources .

The senior Tigrayan official said the drone strikes hit two Isuzu trucks near Enticho and Gendebta, two places in Tigray about 20 kilometres apart. A humanitarian worker confirmed the strikes had happened. Both asked not to be named.

The Tigrayan official said the Ethiopian National Defence Force launched the strikes but did not provide evidence.

A spokesperson for the ENDF did not respond to a request for comment.

It was not immediately clear what the trucks were carrying.

TPLF-affiliated news outlet Dimtsi Weyane posted pictures on Facebook which it said showed the trucks damaged in the strikes. It said the trucks were transporting food and cooking items.

Pro-government activists posting on social media said the trucks were carrying weapons.

Earlier this week national carrier Ethiopian Airlines cancelled flights to Tigray, where residents rushed to try to withdraw cash from banks.

The Tigray war ended with a peace pact in November 2022, but disagreements have continued over a range of issues, including contested territories in western Tigray and the delayed disarmament of Tigray forces.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 12:50:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion occurs at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas, Iranian media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-occurs-irans-southern-port-bandar-abbas-iranian-media-reports-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - An explosion occurred at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas on Saturday, Iranian media reported, without giving a cause for the blast.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency said that social media reports alleging that a Revolutionary Guard navy commander was targeted in the explosion were "completely false".

Iranian media said the blast was being investigated but gave no further information. Iranian authorities could not immediately be contacted for comment.

The port of Bandar Abbas lies on the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway between Iran and Oman which handles about a fifth of the world's seaborne oil.

The reported explosion comes amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington after Iranian authorities quelled the biggest protests to convulse the country in three years, and also amid ongoing Western concerns over Iran's nuclear programme.

The nationwide protests erupted in December over economic hardship and posed one of the toughest challenges to the country's clerical rulers.

At least 5,000 people were killed in the protests, including 500 members of the security forces, an Iranian official told Reuters.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday an "armada" was heading toward Iran . Multiple sources said on Friday that Trump was weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces.

Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused U.S., Israeli and European leaders of exploiting Iran's economic problems, inciting unrest and providing people with the means to "tear the nation apart”.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 12:50:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBQRDVLZZNOOLEZID2WCMW545E.jpg?auth=0b5d5d815aa14e48446b7c52410d4cfe59a4cc3ff5ce7cb84d5c54e466383810&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan says 67 militants killed after coordinated attacks in Balochistan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-says-67-militants-killed-after-coordinated-attacks-balochistan-2026-01-31/</link><description>QUETTA, Pakistan, Jan 31 (Reuters) - At least 67 militants were killed on Saturday as they battled Pakistan's security forces in multiple cities across the southwestern province of Balochistan, four security officials told Reuters.

Some 10 police and security personnel and 11 civilians were also killed during the orchestrated militant attacks, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Twenty-four police officers were injured.

The military's media wing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in a statement, condemned the attacks and praised security forces for repelling them, saying they had killed dozens of militants.

The attacks came a day after Pakistan's military said it killed 41 militants in separate raids in Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan and has faced a decades-long separatist insurgency.

The banned separatist group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks, saying it had launched them simultaneously across the province. The BLA said it had killed 84 Pakistan security personnel.

Security officials said armed men launched attacks in several urban areas, including the provincial capital Quetta and the port city of Gwadar, prompting operations by the army, police and counterterrorism units.

Hospitals were placed on emergency footing in some districts, officials said.

In Gwadar, militants attacked a camp accommodating migrant workers, killing 11 people, Atta-ur-Rehman, a senior police officer said, revising an earlier death toll of five. Those killed included five men, three women and three children..

Security forces killed six militants in Gwadar after responding to the attack, he said.

Officials said the situation was critical in Noshki, a district of Balochistan, after militants abducted the area's top civil administrator. He said in a social media video that he was in the custody of the militants. Reuters could not independently verify the video.

Armed men briefly blocked roads in parts of Quetta and a blast was heard near a high-security area, authorities said, though they later said the situation had been brought under control.

Security officials said in text messages that forces had responded effectively to the attacks and that clearance operations were still underway.

Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but poorest province and has faced a decades-long insurgency by ethnic Baloch militant groups. Pakistan says the violence is backed by foreign actors, a charge denied by India.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 13:43:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli strikes kill at least 30 across Gaza in one of highest tolls since October ceasefire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260131-israeli-strikes-kill-30-palestinians-including-children-gaza-ceasefire-inches-forward</link><description>Hospitals in Gaza said Israeli strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians Saturday, one of the highest tolls since the October ceasefire aimed at stopping the fighting.

A day after Israel accused Hamas of new ceasefire violations, strikes hit locations throughout Gaza, including lethal ones on an apartment building in Gaza City and a tent camp in Khan Younis, officials at hospitals that received the bodies said.

The casualties included two women and six children from two different families. An air strike also hit a police station in Gaza City, killing at least 14 and wounding others, Shifa Hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said.

The series of strikes also came a day before the Rafah crossing along the border with Egypt is set to open in Gaza’s southernmost city . All of the territory’s border crossings have been closed throughout almost the entire war. Palestinians see Rafah as a lifeline for the tens of thousands in need of treatment outside the territory, where the majority of medical infrastructure has been destroyed.

The crossing's opening, limited at first, marks the first major step in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire. Reopening borders is among the challenging issues on the agenda for the phase now underway, which also include demilitarising the strip after nearly two decades of Hamas rule and installing a new government to oversee reconstruction.

Still, Saturday’s strikes are a reminder that the death toll in Gaza is still rising even as the ceasefire agreement inches forward.

Nasser Hospital said the strike on the tent camp caused a fire to break out, killing seven, including a father, his three children and three grandchildren. Meanwhile, Shifa Hospital said the Gaza City apartment building strike killed three children, their aunt and grandmother on Saturday morning, while the strike on the police station killed at least 14 – officers, including four policewomen, civilians and inmates held at the station. The hospital also said a man was killed in a strike Saturday in the eastern side of Jabaliya refugee camp.

Hamas called Saturday's strikes “a renewed flagrant violation” and urged the United States and other mediating countries to push Israel to stop strikes.

Israel’s military, which has struck targets on both sides of the ceasefire’s dividing line, said its attacks since October have been responses to violations of the agreement. It said in a statement that Saturday’s strikes followed what it described as ceasefire violations a day earlier, when the army killed at least four militants emerging from a tunnel in an Israeli-controlled area of Rafah.

The number reported killed Saturday was several times higher than the daily average since the ceasefire began. As of Friday, Gaza’s Health Ministry had recorded at least 520 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire since the start of the ceasefire on October 10. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by UN agencies and independent experts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 13:46:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b61a3024-fea3-11f0-9b72-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031346989500.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four killed in gas blast in residential building in Iran's Ahvaz, media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/four-killed-gas-blast-residential-building-irans-ahvaz-media-reports-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Four people were killed after a gas explosion at a residential building in Iran's Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported citing the head of the city's fire department.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:27:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's Orban denies need for spending cuts after April election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-orban-denies-need-spending-cuts-after-april-election-2026-01-31/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban denied on Saturday that he will have to impose austerity measures to rein in the budget deficit if he wins an election in April, and said his right-wing Fidesz party would keep its flagship spending policies in place.

In power since 2010, the veteran nationalist is lagging a centre-right challenger in most opinion polls and battling the weakest economic stretch of his 16-year rule, with the economy nearly stagnant since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine caused inflation across central Europe.

Economists say whoever wins the April 12 ballot will have little choice but to tighten purse strings after heavy pre-election spending.

"That's a flat-out lie," Orban told a campaign rally, citing economists' view of Hungary's finances. "The state of the Hungarian economy does not require any kind of austerity."

Late last year, Orban's government raised its budget deficit targets to 5% for 2025 and the 2026 election year to make way for pre-election spending, steps which contributed to Fitch Ratings cutting its outlook on Hungary's debt to negative.

Orban said Hungary's budget deficit, which has exceeded government forecasts in recent years, would have to be lowered "calmly, slowly and gradually" as economic prospects improve.

"We need no austerity and nothing should be taken away from the people", Orban said. He said a 3% subsidised mortgage rate or a plan to exempt mothers of two from income tax by the end of the next government cycle would remain intact if he is elected.

With Fidesz trying to fend off centre-right rival Tisza, Orban's government has launched a 100 billion forint ($310 million) scheme to help the restaurant industry and a 50 billion forint ($160 million) measure to curb household heating bills.

Data released on Friday showed Hungary's economy mired in near-stagnation for a third year, underperforming nearby Poland and the Czech Republic. Some analysts have lowered their 2026 growth outlook after the weak figures.

The party said at a convention in the city of Calgary on Saturday that Poilievre won 87.4% of votes cast in the review mandated after the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, defeated the Conservatives in the election last April.

Under Poilievre, the Conservatives had held a more than 20-point lead over the Liberals last January but U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state united much of the country behind Carney.

Poilievre lost his own seat in the election but returned to parliament after winning a by-election in August.

Before the leadership review, Ashton Arsenault, a former ministerial staffer under ex-Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Poilievre should aim to win at least 75% of the vote to demonstrate the party’s confidence in his leadership.

"That lets every outside observer and party member know that people are behind (Poilievre) and this is the horse we’re riding with in the next election," Arsenault said.

According to the pollster Angus Reid, Carney’s approval rating among Canadians is now at 60%, his highest such rating since he became the Liberal leader.

Although 80% of Conservative voters support Poilievre, who is 46 and has been party leader since 2022, views of him among the wider public are more negative, with 58% holding an unfavourable view of him.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MOX3ZNCOWBK77H2ZNI3SFIVZCI.jpg?auth=ca128faa121bd5fa77c19b710557fd86cec0bc4167b480509c6536d66f4c1637&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy investigates church painting of angel restored to look like Meloni</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/italy-investigates-church-painting-angel-restored-look-like-meloni-2026-01-31/</link><description>ROME, Jan 31 (Reuters) - An angel in a church in central Rome has been restored to look like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a national newspaper reported on Saturday, prompting the culture ministry to investigate and Meloni to laugh off the affair.

In a front-page story, la Repubblica daily was the first to note that one of two angels in a chapel of the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina had been altered to resemble the 49-year-old conservative, Italy's first female prime minister.

The article ran with before-and-after pictures of the painting. It said the angel had previously looked like a "generic cherub".

The culture ministry said it had instructed Rome's top art heritage official to carry out a same-day inspection of the restored painting before "deciding what to do next".

The opposition Five Star Movement complained: "We cannot allow art and culture to risk becoming a tool for propaganda or anything else, regardless of whether the face depicted is that of the prime minister."

The parish priest, Daniele Micheletti, told ANSA news agency that the decorations in the chapel had recently been touched up following water damage. The originals dated only to 2000, so were not under any heritage protection.

The restoration was carried out by the same artist who created the original painting, Bruno Valentinetti. He disputed the suggestion he had altered the image, telling reporters: "I restored what was there before... 25 years ago".

As for Meloni, she posted a picture of the disputed painting on Instagram, with the caption "No, I definitely don't look like an angel", with a laughing emoji.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:57:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VGXAFFMD6JMFFET44ILLWCFC3A.jpg?auth=f78e4aadee9bfe7117dfb828ab67040b5cfab7042264795f75ce3e3863868eab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Creeping fascism': Milan protesters slam ICE deployment at Winter Olympics</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-creeping-fascism-milan-protesters-slam-ice-deployment-at-winter-olympics</link><description>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered Saturday in Milan to protest the deployment of ICE agents during the upcoming Winter Olympics , despite the fact that agents would be stationed in a control room and not operating on the streets .

The protest in Piazza XXV Aprile, a square named for the date of Italy’s liberation from Nazi fascism in 1945, drew people from the left-leaning Democratic Party, the CGIL trade union confederation and the ANPI organisations that protect the memory of Italy’s partisan resistance during World War II , along with many other people.

Organisers handed out plastic whistles, which participants blew as music blared from a van. The protest was as much against the news that agents from a division of ICE would participate in security for the US delegation as against what many saw as creeping fascism in the United States.

“No thank you, from Minnesota to the world, at the side of anyone who fights for human rights ,’’ read one banner. “Never again means never again for anyone,’’ read another, and “Ice only in Spritz’,’ a reference to a popular aperitif, read yet another.

News of the deployment of ICE agents has provoked a backlash in Italy. Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala has said they were not welcome. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi has been called to Parliament to testify about the deployment this week.

Protester Silvana Grassi held a sign that read “Ice = Gestapo.” She said the scenes of ICE agents in Minneapolis shooting and killing protesters and detaining children were deeply upsetting.

“It makes me want to cry to think of it,’’ Grassi said. “It’s too terrible. How did they elect such a terrible, evil man?’’

The ICE agents to be deployed to Milan are not from the same unit as the immigration agents cracking down in Minnesota and other US cities.

Homeland Security Investigations, a ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the US is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.

“Even if it’s not the same ones, we don’t want them here,’’ Grassi said.

Paolo Bortoletto, also holding a banner, was aware that the officers would have an investigative and not a street role.

Still, he said, “We don’t want them in our country. We are a peaceful country. We don’t want fascists. It’s their ideas that bother us."

The Olympics begin February 6 with an opening ceremony that will be attended by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:58:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd87ebcc-febc-11f0-ab2d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031540142092.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Morocco deploys army to help evacuate thousands after floods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/morocco-deploys-army-help-evacuate-thousands-after-floods-2026-01-31/</link><description>RABAT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Morocco has deployed army rescue units to help with the evacuation of thousands of people after floods triggered by torrential rains and rising river levels hit parts of the country's northwest, state TV reported on Saturday.

Weeks of heavy rainfall, combined with water releases from a nearly full dam nearby, increased water levels in the Loukous River and flooded several neighbourhoods in the city of Ksar Kbir, about 190 km (118 miles) north of the capital Rabat, a national flood follow-up committee said.

More than 20,000 people had been moved to shelter and camps by Saturday, official media reported.

Authorities set up sandbags and temporary barriers in flood-prone districts as waters began to recede.

Schools in Ksar Kbir have been ordered to remain closed until February 7 as a precaution.

In the nearby province of Sidi Kacem, the Sebou River's rising levels prompted evacuations from several villages as authorities raised vigilance levels.

The abundant rainfall ended a seven-year drought that drove the country to invest heavily in desalination plants.

The average dam-filling rate has risen to 60%, with several major reservoirs reaching full capacity, according to official data.

Last month, 37 people were killed in flash floods in the Atlantic coastal city of Safi , south of Rabat.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 17:49:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protesters in Copenhagen rally for Danish veterans after Trump remarks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/protesters-copenhagen-rally-danish-veterans-after-trump-remarks-2026-01-31/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Danes gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen on Saturday in support of veterans who said they had been insulted by President Donald Trump's comment that European allies had kept "off the front lines" in the Afghanistan war.

Denmark, with a population less than 2% the size of the United States, was one of the major combat allies in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, losing 44 service members killed, a per capita death toll on par with that of the Americans themselves.

Trump had already antagonised Danes by demanding the annexation of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of the Danish kingdom, when he made the remarks last week questioning the role of NATO allies during the conflict.

The remarks sparked widespread backlash from Europeans, with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling them "insulting and frankly appalling". Trump subsequently singled out British troops for praise, but stopped short of apologising or addressing the role of European troops more broadly.

"Behind all these flags, there's a guy, there's a soldier, there's a young man," said retired Danish Lieutenant-Colonel Niels Christian Koefoed, who served in Afghanistan, as demonstrators planted Danish flags embroidered with the names of the deceased outside the U.S. Embassy.

The protesters, many wearing medals received for their NATO service, marched to the embassy, where the names of Danish soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq were read aloud. The event concluded with a moment of silence.

"I lost a very close friend and colleague of mine," said Afghanistan veteran Jesper Larsen. "So I was hurt by what Mr Trump said, and I think he owes all my combat friends an apology."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 18:33:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IA5FQDOKLRL2JO7XPLNQWLWRPI.jpg?auth=5d8b2e9563c438bbfa81f8da27d07beb9dfe72d99c5221556f9787618c4fd2a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s policies ‘erodes the fabric of global cooperation’, ex-Swedish PM Bildt says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-trump-s-policies-erodes-the-fabric-of-global-cooperation-ex-swedish-pm-bildt-says</link><description>&gt;&gt; Click on video player above to watch the full interview</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 18:36:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/80b6733c-fecd-11f0-a1c9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260131-180206-182104-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says Ukraine is getting ready for new peace talks next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-is-getting-ready-new-peace-talks-next-week-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Ukraine was waiting for more information from the United States about further peace talks and expected new meetings to take place next week.

Zelenskiy's statement during his nightly video address appeared to suggest that a meeting scheduled for Sunday in the United Arab Emirates between representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the United States would not take place. The three sides held a round of talks a week ago.

"We are in constant communication with the American side and are expecting specific details from them regarding further meetings," Zelenskiy said.

"Ukraine is ready to work in all working formats. It is important that there be results and that the meetings take place. We are counting on meetings next week and are preparing for them."

U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff led a team of representatives in talks in Florida on Saturday with Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev and described the discussions as "productive and constructive."

The U.S. has been spearheading diplomatic efforts to end the war, launched nearly four years ago by the Kremlin's invasion of its smaller neighbour.

Witkoff has singled out the question of territory as the key to making progress in the negotiations, with Kyiv rejecting Moscow's demand that it cede all of the Donbas region, including areas its army has not captured.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said this week that land was not the sole key issue under discussion but did not identify other unresolved issues.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 19:22:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PVACHLFTVVKTTDJFYODHGSNMTM.jpg?auth=05d8f6b11473924cfe5a5fa20a13ca6d06182a4b8fa6c2a5abb6b761f932c1bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK’s Starmer says ex-Prince Andrew should testify before Congress over Epstein ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-starmer-says-ex-prince-andrew-should-testify-before-congress-over-epstein-2026-01-31/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday that the former Prince Andrew should testify before a U.S. congressional committee, following new revelations about Andrew's links to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

New files related to Epstein published by the U.S. justice department on Friday included emails that showed King Charles's brother maintaining regular contact with Epstein for more than two years after he was found guilty of child sex crimes.

The files also include pictures appearing to show Andrew crouching over and touching the waist of an unidentified woman lying on the floor. Her face was blacked out in the redacted images.

The king stripped his brother of his title of prince and evicted him from his mansion in the grounds of Windsor Castle in November, in the wake of previous revelations about his links with Epstein.

The former prince, 65, now uses the family name Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He has denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and had previously denied maintaining ties with the financier after Epstein's 2008 conviction, apart from a 2010 visit to New York to end their relationship.

He did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the latest revelations. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

Starmer, speaking to reporters on the plane to Japan after a four-day visit to China , said the former prince should appear before U.S. lawmakers to explain everything he knows about Epstein to help his victims.

"Anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they are asked to do that,” Starmer said. "You can’t be victim centred if you’re not prepared to do that."

In November, members of a U.S. congressional committee investigating the Epstein case intensified their calls for Andrew to answer questions.

Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He was jailed in 2008 for soliciting paid sex from a minor.

The files show Andrew maintained regular contact with Epstein after his conviction, including discussing potential business deals and social meetings.

In several emails, Epstein and Andrew discuss women that the financier proposes to put in touch with the prince. In one email, Epstein offered to bring three women to Buckingham Palace.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:26:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SCDTIH2QXJMRVPXFLDXS264SEY.jpg?auth=115658303f8031c035fe22e14f40f629a349883f3998eab7e2a72c35620fcf92&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq's Shi'ite bloc reaffirms backing for Maliki despite Trump's warnings</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-shiite-bloc-reaffirms-backing-maliki-despite-trumps-warnings-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Iraq's alliance of Shi'ite political blocs, the Coordination Framework, reaffirmed on Saturday its support for former premier Nouri al-Maliki to lead the next government, despite a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that Washington would no longer help Iraq if Maliki returned to power.

The bloc, which holds a majority in parliament, picked Maliki , Iraq's first elected prime minister after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, as its nominee for the post following an election .

"The choice of the prime minister is a purely Iraqi constitutional matter and should proceed without foreign interference," the Coordination Framework said in a statement, adding that it seeks balanced relations with international partners based on mutual respect.

Trump's threats are the starkest example yet of the Republican president's campaign to curb Iran-linked groups' influence in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:27:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7GKVTFRZ5BI5PEV7EIR63MT2SY.jpg?auth=33dff3ba3956c8a3ff45d136784295d3cae412fb8ca881cc05abc5a8236dd9dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff holds ‘constructive’ Ukraine talks with Russia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260131-us-envoy-witkoff-holds-constructive-ukraine-talks-with-russia</link><description>US envoy Steve Witkoff said Saturday he had held constructive talks with a Russian envoy in Florida as part of Washington's drive to end the war in Ukraine .

The meeting came just a day before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were scheduled to meet in Abu Dhabi to discuss a US-backed plan to halt the nearly four-year conflict that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"Today in Florida, the Russian Special Envoy Kirill Dmitriev held productive and constructive meetings as part of the U.S. mediation effort toward advancing a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian conflict," Witkoff posted on X.

"We are encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine," he added.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump 's son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House Senior Advisor Josh Gruenbaum also attended the talks, he said.

Earlier Saturday, a source close to the talks had told AFP that they had started at 8:00 am (1300 GMT) and that Dmitriev had arrived in Miami.

Neither side released details of what was discussed.

Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin 's top economic envoy, met Witkoff and Kushner earlier in January on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

He also held talks with US negotiators on Ukraine in a visit to Miami in December.

The second round of talks in Abu Dhabi are set to start on Sunday, even if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested earlier this week that it might be postponed because of the US-Iran crisis.

Zelensky said in his evening address Saturday his negotiators were also waiting to hear from the United States on further meetings.

"Ukraine is ready to work in all working formats," said Zelensky. "It is important that there are results and that the meetings take place. We are counting on meetings next week and are preparing for them."

Teams from Ukraine and Russia met Friday and Saturday last week in Abu Dhabi in their first in-person negotiations on a plan being pushed by Trump.

The United States says both sides are close to a deal, but they have so far been unable to find a compromise on the key issue of territory in a post-war settlement, according to Kyiv.

The Kremlin on Friday said Putin had agreed to a pause on striking Kyiv -- ending Sunday -- following a request by Trump.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:52:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a59538c6-fee3-11f0-b2a1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029832554221.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly blast rips Iranian port city as Tehran plans naval drills in Strait of Hormuz</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260131-deadly-blast-rips-iranian-port-city-as-tehran-plans-naval-drills-in-strait-of-hormuz</link><description>An explosion tore through an apartment building Saturday in Iran 's port city of Bandar Abbas, killing a 4-year-old girl as local media footage purportedly showed a security force member being carried out by rescuers.

The blast happened a day before a planned naval drill by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz , the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. Already, the US military had warned Iran not to threaten its warships or commercial traffic in the strait, on which Bandar Abbas sits.

State television quoted a local fire official as blaming the blast on a gas leak. Media reported at least 14 others suffered injuries in the explosion at the eight-story building, which blew out windows and covered the street below in debris.

A local newspaper, Sobh-e Sahel, aired footage of one of its correspondents speaking in front of the building. The footage included a sequence that showed a man in black boots and a green security force uniform being carried out on a stretcher. He wore a neck brace and appeared to be in pain, his left hand covering the branch insignia on his uniform.

The local newspaper did not acknowledge the security force member being carried out elsewhere in its reporting. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard itself did not discuss the blast, other than to deny that a Guard navy commander had been hurt in the explosion.

Another explosion blamed on a gas explosion Saturday in the southwestern city of Ahvaz killed five people, state media reported.

It comes as Iran remains tense over a threat by US President Donald Trump to potentially launch a military strike on the country over the killing of peaceful protesters or the possible mass execution of those detained in a major crackdown over the demonstrations.

Ali Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on X late Saturday that “structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.” However, there is no public sign of any talks with the United States, which Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has repeatedly ruled out.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:52:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3bed7d40-fecd-11f0-b8ac-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-31T135958Z-507358427-RC2ACJAE8D5D-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-CRISIS-USA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Qatari PM meets Iran's Larijani in Tehran, discusses easing regional tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatari-pm-meets-irans-larijani-tehran-discusses-easing-regional-tensions-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met with top Iranian security official Ali Larijani in Tehran and reviewed efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Saturday in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:22:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HC4U4YBF6BNLHCMGR4TJIOWWAQ.jpg?auth=210b258168ff277f19ad0a440e8a02c1c661421190c856e9d039e26361b3acba&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge orders release of 5-year-old, father detained in Minnesota ICE raid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-orders-release-5-year-old-father-detained-minnesota-ice-raid-2026-01-31/</link><description>DETROIT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A federal judge has ordered the release of Adrian Conejo Arias and his five-year-old son, Liam Conejo Ramos, whom immigration officers detained during a Minnesota raid.

The boy — seen in a now viral photo that showed him wearing a blue bunny hat outside his house as federal agents stood nearby — was one of four students detained by immigration officials earlier this month in a Minneapolis suburb, according to the Columbia Heights Public School District.

"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children," U.S. District Judge Fred Biery wrote in a ruling published on Saturday.

"Ultimately, Petitioners may, because of the arcane United States immigration system, return to their home country, involuntarily or by self-deportation. But that result should occur through a more orderly and humane policy than currently in place."

The Ecuadorean boy and his father, who entered the United States legally as asylum applicants, were sent to a family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, their attorney Marc Prokosch previously told Reuters .

Prokosch and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return requests for comment.

Armed and masked officers detained two 17-year-olds and a 10-year-old in addition to Liam, school district Superintendent Zena Stenvik said last week.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:45:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBIWWWBB6NJCDAUTZZGTNGJ7BQ.jpg?auth=ccefa05895a64c413db7db0a924836dcb1439a2a0175802c9fb8f4a801e3a819&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top US envoy for Venezuela arrives in Caracas</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/top-us-envoy-venezuela-arrives-caracas-2026-01-31/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Laura Dogu, the top U.S. envoy for Venezuela, arrived on Saturday in Caracas as the two countries gradually resume bilateral relations, broken in 2019 by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

In a post on Telegram, Venezuelan foreign affairs minister Yván Gil said that her visit is meant to "establish a roadmap on matters of bilateral interest" and "resolve existing differences through diplomatic dialogue and through a base of mutual understanding and international law."

Dogu, who previously served as ambassador to Honduras and Nicaragua, wrote on X that she had arrived in Venezuela and that "my team and I are ready to work."

The U.S. captured Maduro on January 3 and brought him to New York for arraignment in court on narcoterrorism charges. Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's interim president, has since said she seeks to move towards "balanced and respectful international relations" with the United States.

The two countries have reached a deal to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, and on Friday Rodriguez announced a proposed "amnesty law" for hundreds of prisoners in the country and said the Helicoide detention center in Caracas would be turned into a center for sports and social services.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 22:23:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian boy killed by shark in Sydney Harbour honoured at Bondi Beach</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-boy-killed-by-shark-sydney-harbour-honoured-bondi-beach-2026-01-31/</link><description>Feb 1 (Reuters) - An Australian boy who died after being bitten by a shark in Sydney Harbour was honoured in a surfing ceremony at Bondi Beach on Sunday, following a series of shark attacks along the country's east coast.

Nico Antic, 12, died in hospital on January 24, six days after being attacked when he and his friends jumped off rocks in Vaucluse, around 9 km (5.5 miles) from Sydney's central business district. Friends pulled him from the water with severe injuries to both legs.

On Sunday, a community "paddle-out" at Bondi Beach honoured Nico, with aerial Australian Broadcasting Corp. footage showing paddle boarders and surfers forming a large circle in the ocean.

Local surf lifesavers, as well as school friends and relatives, took part, local media reported.

Dozens of beaches, including in Sydney, were closed in January after four shark attacks in two days, as heavy rains left water murky and more likely to attract sharks.

In September, a surfer was killed by a large shark at Sydney's Long Reef Beach.

Australia averages 20 shark attacks a year, fewer than three of them fatal, according to data from conservation groups. Those numbers are dwarfed by drownings on the country's beaches.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 23:46:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VYTMER6LEVMX5FOZ25MJY5K2PA.jpg?auth=036776e7143189f5aa6d6a06aaa0861a558cd44b8b8f7f0b55f7f4e869a3d85f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US special envoy for Iraq Mark Savaya no longer in the post, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/us-special-envoy-iraq-mark-savaya-no-longer-post-sources-say-2026-02-01/</link><description>WASHINGTON/RIYADH, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Mark Savaya, named by U.S. President Donald Trump as special envoy for Iraq in October, is no longer in that role, sources familiar with the move said.

The move comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Baghdad over Washington's push to curb Iranian influence in Iraqi politics.

Savaya, a Christian Iraqi-American entrepreneur, was among a handful of Arab Americans named to senior posts by Trump, who campaigned heavily during the 2024 presidential election to win the Arab and Muslim vote in Detroit and around the country.

It was not immediately clear what prompted Savaya's departure or whether a replacement would be appointed.

One of the sources pointed to Savaya's "mishandling" of key situations, including his failure to prevent the nomination of former Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki to be the country's next premier, a move Trump openly warned Baghdad against.

U.S. ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria Tom Barrack, who traveled to Erbil earlier this week to meet with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, is believed to be taking over the State Department's Iraq portfolio, according to the source and a senior Iraqi official.

A spokesperson for Barrack declined to comment.

The State Department referred queries to the White House, which declined to comment on Savaya's status or any replacement.

Reached by Reuters on Thursday, Savaya denied any change in his role, saying that he was still working on administrative procedures required for him to officially assume the role, but a source familiar with the matter said Savaya never became an employee of the State Department.

Savaya's X account, which was active until recently, has not been available since Thursday.

He did not respond to follow-up messages on Friday and Saturday asking him to clarify whether he was still in his appointed role and explain why his X account was taken down.

Savaya, who ran a cannabis business in Detroit and has close ties to Trump, was a surprising choice for envoy because he has no diplomatic experience. He has not traveled to Iraq officially since being named to the role, two of the sources said.

He was set to visit Iraq and hold meetings with senior officials last Friday, but abruptly canceled them, two Iraqi officials said.

The personnel move comes days after Trump warned Iraq that if it again chose Maliki as its prime minister, Washington would no longer help the major oil producer and close U.S. ally. Maliki, accused by the U.S. of stoking sectarian strife and allowing the rise of the Islamic State during his time in office, had been tapped for the role by Iraq's largest parliamentary bloc days earlier.

Trump's comments were the starkest example yet of his campaign to curb the influence of Iran-linked groups in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 04:41:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US may make a deal on Cuba, Trump says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-may-make-deal-cuba-trump-says-2026-02-01/</link><description>ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE, Jan 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he believed the United States would "work a deal" on Cuba.

His comments came days after threatening tariffs on any country supplying Cuba with oil.

Trump reiterated his call for Cuba to negotiate with the United States.

"It doesn't have to be a humanitarian crisis," Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Florida.

"I think they probably would come to us and want to make a deal ... They have a situation that's very bad for Cuba. They have no money. They have no oil. They lived off Venezuelan money and oil, and none of that's coming now."

In 2025, Venezuela was Cuba's largest oil supplier , meeting roughly one-third of the island's daily needs. Supply from Venezuela dropped following the U.S. blockade on shipments from there, even before the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Reuters exclusively reported in January that Mexico, Cuba's top supplier after Venezuela cut off shipments in December, was reviewing whether to continue sending oil amid fears it could face retaliation from Washington.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 04:41:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EPB4EACRFMXZONLMSDLPASLKU.jpg?auth=08295237c0a5f5e872af66223a62676da674522e681f1006abf0ee1dc1c8914a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia seizes $129.9 million in crude oil from tankers suspected of illegally transferring oil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/malaysia-seizes-1299-million-crude-oil-tankers-suspected-illegally-transferring-2026-02-01/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Two tankers suspected of illegal ship-to-ship oil transfers were detained and more than 512 million ringgit ($129.9 million) worth of crude oil seized 24 nautical miles west of Muka Head, Penang last week, the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said on Saturday.

The agency did not specify the origin of the oil being transferred.

The waters off Malaysia are known as a regular site for illegal ship-to-ship transfers, where oil is shifted between tankers at sea to obscure its origin. Malaysian authorities said in July last year they would more tightly enforce rules around the practice.

The seized tankers, worth 718 million ringgit, were carrying 53 Chinese, Burmese, Iranian, Pakistani and Indian crew members. The two captains of the ships were arrested and handed over to Penang state maritime investigation officials, the agency said.

Maritime Captain Muhammad Suffi Mohd Ramli said the tankers at anchor were inspected after a patrol boat received a complaint at about 1 a.m. local time on Thursday. The ships were found in a coupled position and suspected of carrying out transfer activities.

The captain added that the tankers are being investigated for anchoring without permission, which carries a penalty of 100,000 ringgit, and carrying out illegal ship-to-ship transfer activities, which carries a penalty of 200,000 ringgit per vessel.

The EU marked a symbolic shift in its approach to Iran's leadership on Thursday by designating the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation , following what turned out to be the Islamic Republic's bloodiest crackdown of protests since its establishment in 1979.

"By trying to hit the Revolutionary Guards ... the Europeans actually shot themselves in the foot and once again made a decision against the interests of their people by blindly obeying the Americans," Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf told his fellow MPs, all wearing Revolutionary Guards uniforms in support to the elite force.

"According to Article 7 of the law on countermeasures against the designation of the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organisation, the armies of European countries are considered terrorist groups."

Qalibaf added that the national security parliamentary commission would deliberate on the expulsion of EU countries' military attaches and follow up on the issue with the foreign ministry.

Set up after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the Revolutionary Guards have great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 07:02:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/26FDYIHLPJNZPDCN4JRYAPOUAE.jpg?auth=c111821270964e70a321b8b7ff186e0cd14b6a446f64bfe876745bc6b5937939&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says it now considers all EU armies to be 'terrorist groups'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260201-live-qatar-s-top-diplomat-holds-talks-in-iran-aiming-to-reduce-tensions</link><description>Iran speaker of parliament has said that the Islamic Republic now considers all European Union militaries to be terrorist groups.

Qalibaf cited a 2019 law as authorization for the announcement. That law was passed after the U.S. listed the Guard as a terrorist group and allows for reciprocal action by Iran against any nations that follow that decision.

Qalibaf made the announcement as he and others wore Guard uniforms in parliament. Qalibaf was a commander in the Guard.

The reopening comes amid ongoing violence in the Palestinian territory , with Gaza's civil defence agency reporting dozens killed in Israeli attacks on Saturday, while the Israeli military said it was retaliating against ceasefire violations.

The Rafah crossing is a vital gateway for both civilians and aid, but has remained closed since Israeli forces seized control of it in May 2024 during the war with Hamas , aside from a brief and limited reopening in early 2025.

Israel had previously said it would not reopen the crossing until the remains of Ran Gvili – the last Israeli hostage held in Gaza – were returned.

His remains were recovered days ago and he was laid to rest in Israel on Wednesday.

"The Rafah Crossing will open this coming Sunday (February 1st) in both directions, for limited movement of people only," COGAT, an Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civil affairs in the occupied Palestinian territories, said on Friday.

Entry and exit "will be permitted in coordination with Egypt, following prior security clearance of individuals by Israel, and under the supervision of the European Union mission", it added.

However, key details remain unclear, including how many people will be allowed to cross and whether those seeking to return to Gaza will be permitted entry.

A source at the border told AFP that Sunday would be largely devoted to preparations and logistical arrangements.

The crossing is set to open on Sunday on a trial basis to allow the passage of wounded individuals, ahead of a regular reopening scheduled for Monday, three sources at the crossing said.

However, no agreement has yet been reached on the number of Palestinians permitted to enter or exit, the sources added, noting that Egypt plans to admit "all Palestinians whom Israel authorises to leave" the territory.

"Every day that passes drains my life and worsens my condition," said Mohammed Shamiya, 33, who suffers from kidney disease and requires dialysis treatment abroad.

"I'm waiting every moment for the opening of the Rafah land crossing."

Safa al-Hawajri, who has received a scholarship to study overseas, is also eagerly awaiting the reopening on Sunday.

"I'm waiting in the hope of fulfilling my ambition, which is tied to the reopening of the crossing," said Hawajri, 18.

"I hope to be able to travel as soon as it opens."

Located on Gaza's southern border with Egypt, Rafah is the only crossing into and out of the territory that does not pass through Israel.

The crossing lies in an area held by Israeli forces following their withdrawal behind the so-called "Yellow Line" under the terms of a US-brokered ceasefire that came into effect on October 10.

Israeli troops still control more than half of Gaza, while the rest remains under Hamas authority.

The ceasefire has now entered its second phase and calls for reopening the crossing following the release or return of all Israeli hostages held by Palestinian militants.

Hamas had called for its full reopening in both directions after the remains of Gvili were brought back to Israel.

The reopening is expected to facilitate the entry of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic body, the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG), established to oversee the day-to-day governance of the territory's 2.2 million residents.

The committee is to operate under the supervision of the so-called " Board of Peace " chaired by US President Donald Trump .

The NCAG, headed by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, is expected to enter the Gaza Strip once the Rafah crossing reopens.

Violence continued ahead of the crossing's reopening.

At least 32 people, including children, were killed on Saturday in Israeli air strikes in Gaza, reported the civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force under the Hamas authority.

Israel's military said the strikes were retaliation for an incident on Friday in which eight Palestinian fighters exited a tunnel in the city of Rafah, which it said violated the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 07:04:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8a26da18-ff1a-11f0-91e2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/245d1587ec05ed1f7d71455eead73bf6c20cc6c2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Shoigu, China's Wang Yi to discuss security issues</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russias-shoigu-chinas-wang-yi-discuss-security-issues-2026-02-01/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Russian Security Council Secretary Sergei Shoigu arrived in China on Sunday where he will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss security issues, Russian media outlets reported on Sunday citing the Russian Security Council.

All three are angling to add to their trophy cabinets by taking home the gala's most coveted award, Album of the Year, for the first time.

Lamar, the Pulitzer Prize-winning rapper, has nine nominations this time around for his album "GNX" – the most of any artist.

The 38-year-old California native, who won five gramophones last year thanks to his smash diss track "Not Like Us," is also up for Record and Song of the Year for "Luther" featuring R&amp;B artist SZA.

Pop chameleon Lady Gaga and Puerto Rico 's Bad Bunny also are competing in all three top categories.

Also nominated for Album of the Year are: pop princess Sabrina Carpenter; R&amp;B singer-songwriter Leon Thomas; Tyler, the Creator; hip-hop duo Clipse (Pusha T and Malice); and pop superstar Justin Bieber – with his first studio effort in four years.

Lady Gaga, Bieber, Carpenter and Bruno Mars are set to lead a starry list of performers that also includes Lauryn Hill and a tribute to late rocker Ozzy Osbourne featuring Post Malone.

Standing in Lamar's way for Album of the Year is Bad Bunny, who is on a world tour in support of his album "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos" (I Should Have Taken More Photos) after a hugely successful residency in San Juan.

"It was a very exciting album," musicologist Lauron Kehrer told AFP.

"It touched on so much in terms of thematic material and musical material," Kehrer said, pointing to the allusions to decolonization and use of traditional Puerto Rican rhythms.

The 31-year-old Latin megastar, born Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, will headline the Super Bowl halftime show a week after the Grammys, where he is up for six awards .

His "Un verano sin ti" (2022) was the first Spanish-language album nominated for Album of the Year honors. A win on Sunday would give Bad Bunny another mention in the history books.

Lady Gaga, 39, made a splashy comeback to touring with "Mayhem," her collection of pop bangers with a dark edge that embraces her dramatic side. She has seven nominations.

A win for Album of the Year would complete her hat trick of top awards.

She took Record and Song of the Year honors seven years ago for the soundtrack hit "Shallow," from "A Star is Born" – which also earned her an Oscar.

This time around, Song of the Year – which honors songwriting – is a crowded category that includes Carpenter's "Manchild" and "Golden" from the Netflix animated smash hit "KPop Demon Hunters."

Many pundits believe the energetic K-pop hit will triumph.

Up for best new artist are Alex Warren, girl group Katseye, Britain's Olivia Dean, TikTok dancer-turned-singer Addison Rae, The Marias, sombr, Lola Young and Thomas.

For musicologist Kehrer, the infusion of rap, reggaeton and K-pop in the top Grammy categories reflects changes in the composition of the Recording Academy's voting group.

More than 3,800 new members have been admitted. Half of those new members are age 39 or younger, and 58 percent of them are people of color, the academy says.

Invitations were also offered to all members of the Latin Recording Academy.

"The Grammys are more reactionary than anything else," said Kehrer.

"These artists winning those major awards is more of an indication of climate, rather than trying to move or change the climate."

The Grammy Awards will once again be hosted by comedian Trevor Noah.

The main broadcast begins at 5:00 pm (0100 GMT Monday), but many of the 95 awards will be handed out at a pre-gala event.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 07:56:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e797a73a-ff11-11f0-aaa7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/b606b7c8ad88d2c6d0828c04d0984f3cf08f8a1a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Musk says steps to stop Russia from using Starlink have worked</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/musk-says-steps-stop-russia-using-starlink-have-worked-2026-02-01/</link><description>Feb 1 (Reuters) - Elon Musk said on Sunday that steps SpaceX had taken to stop the 'unauthorized' use of Starlink by Russia seemed to have worked.

"Capgemini considered ‍that the usual legal constraints imposed in ​the United States on contracting with federal entities conducting classified ‌activities did not allow the Group to exercise ‍appropriate control over certain aspects of this subsidiary's operations in order to ensure alignment with the Group's objectives," it said ‍in a statement.

It said the divestment process "will be initiated immediately".

The group's contract with ICE was first revealed by independent media outlet l’Observatoire des multinationales.

It found Capgemini sold “skip tracing” services – a form of data-driven locating and tracking of individuals whose whereabouts are unknown – used by ICE to verify home and work addresses and support removal operations as part of a large-scale anti-immigration crackdown .

The framework agreement is capped at over $365 million, with nearly $4.8 million already committed.

Capgemini, which operates in around 50 countries, convened an emergency board meeting this weekend. In an internal message sent to employees, the group specified that the disputed contract, awarded in December, "was the subject of an appeal."

According to the group Capgemini Government Solutions represents 0.4% of the group's estimated revenue in 2025 and less than 2% of its revenue in the United States.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 09:34:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09bba20c-f301-11f0-8378-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016127809169.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tehran warns of regional conflict if US attacks Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/tehran-warns-regional-conflict-if-us-attacks-iran-2026-02-01/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said that if the U.S. attacked Iran it would become a regional conflict, state media reported on Sunday, amid heightened tensions between Washington and Tehran.

The U.S. has built up its naval presence in the Middle East after President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened Iran with intervention if it did not agree to a nuclear deal or failed to stop killing protesters.

"(Trump) regularly says that he brought ships (...) The Iranian nation shall not be scared by these things, the Iranian people will not be stirred by these threats," Khamenei said.

"We are not the initiators and do not want to attack any country, but the Iranian nation will strike a strong blow against anyone who attacks and harasses them."

A diplomatic solution remains on the cards, with Tehran saying it is ready for "fair" negotiations that do not seek to curtail its defensive capabilities.

The U.S. Navy currently has six destroyers, one aircraft carrier, and three littoral combat ships in the region.

The protests, which started in late December over economic hardships but morphed into the most acute political challenge to the Islamic Republic since its establishment in 1979, have now abated after repression.

Official numbers put the unrest-related death toll at 3,117, while U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Sunday it had so far verified the death of 6,713 people. Reuters was unable to independently verify the numbers.

Khamenei likened the protests to a "coup", saying that the goal of the "sedition" was to attack the centres that govern the country, state media reported.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 10:27:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5LQ25ZVDKFJJXKMVYIBUAVDNWQ.jpg?auth=5f36ad43bbe20496a541ff2dba30b92d97b0fba40b4617615b5d3053a11a677a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Preparations underway for full reopening of Gaza's Rafah crossing, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/preparations-underway-full-reopening-gazas-rafah-crossing-officials-say-2026-02-01/</link><description>JERUSALEM/CAIRO Feb 1 (Reuters) - Preparations to reopen Gaza's main border crossing in Rafah were underway on Sunday though it was uncertain any Palestinians would pass through it before the day's end, Israeli and Palestinian officials said.

Before the war, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt was the only direct exit point for most Palestinians in Gaza to reach the outside world as well as a key entry point for aid into the territory. It has been largely shut since May 2024.

COGAT, the Israeli military unit that oversees humanitarian coordination, said the crossing will reopen in both directions for Gaza residents on foot only and its operation will be coordinated with Egypt and the European Union.

"As part of the pilot for the initial operation of the crossing, all involved parties are carrying out a series of preliminary preparations aimed at increasing readiness for full operation of the crossing," COGAT said on Sunday.

"The actual passage of residents in both directions will begin upon completion of these preparations," it added.

A European source close to the EU mission confirmed the details and a Palestinian official said the crossing was expected to open for passengers on Monday. The Egyptian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Israel has said the crossing would open under stringent security checks only for Palestinians who wish to leave the war-ravaged enclave and for those who fled the fighting in the first months of the war to return.

Many of those expected to leave are sick and wounded Gazans in need of medical care abroad. The Palestinian health ministry has said that there are 20,000 patients waiting to leave Gaza.

An Israeli defence official said that the crossing can hold between 150-200 people altogether in both directions. There will be more people leaving than returning because patients leave together with escorts, the official added.

Lists of Gazans set to pass through the crossing have been submitted by Egypt and approved by Israel, the official said.

Reopening the border crossing was a key requirement of the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Israel-Hamas war .

But the ceasefire, which came into effect in October after two years of fighting, has been repeatedly shaken by rounds of violence.

Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians since the ceasefire, local health officials say, and Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli troops, according to Israeli authorities.

On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday when militants emerged from a tunnel in Rafah.

The next phases of Trump's plan for Gaza foresee governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while an international force keeps the peace and Gaza is rebuilt.

Hamas has so far rejected disarmament and Israel has repeatedly indicated that if the Islamist militant group is not disarmed peacefully, it will use force to make it do so.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 10:27:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRKGJJPFPFOD3GCZKDUMP2U5PM.jpg?auth=e0e3c7ec0ffb2daf45adb4a79a5bbd391b3b4442af1304469eb09dcd37867f00&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Icy weather spreads across southern US, disrupting travel</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260131-icy-weather-spreads-disrupting-travel-across-southern-us-states</link><description>The latest bout of extreme weather came about a week after a monster storm pummeled a wide swath of the United States , killing more than 100 people and leaving many communities struggling to dig out from snow and ice.

Heavy snow fell in North Carolina and neighbouring states Saturday, as authorities urged residents to stay off the roads and warned oceanfront structures were threatened by the storm.

All of North and South Carolina, and portions of Georgia, eastern Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as southern Virginia were under a winter storm warning.

North Carolina saw 750 car crashes on Saturday, the highway patrol said.

Faust, North Carolina recorded 14.5 inches (37cm) of snow , while West Critz, Virginia got 12.5 inches. Harrisburg, Tennessee received more than nine inches of accumulation.

In the North Carolina town of Cape Carteret, high winds sent thick snow blowing sideways, prompting the National Weather Service to warn that travel was "Treacherous and Potentially Life-Threatening especially if you become stranded".

In dramatic footage released by police in Gastonia, North Carolina, a train plowed at high speed into a semi-truck that had gotten stuck on the tracks, crushing the vehicle. No one was hurt.

The weekend storm forced more than 1,800 flight cancellations Saturday and Sunday at Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina, a major hub for American Airlines, data from the tracker FlightAware showed.

A 300-strong "snow team" was working to clear runways, taxiways, roads and sidewalks, the airport said Saturday.

More than 600 flights were cancelled Saturday at Atlanta's international airport, the world's busiest. About 50 flights in and out of Atlanta were cancelled in the early hours of Sunday.

"An explosively deepening coastal cyclone will continue to bring moderate to heavy snow, high winds, and possibly blizzard conditions for the Carolinas," the National Weather Service said Saturday.

"An intense surge of arctic air behind the coastal storm will send below freezing temperatures down toward South Florida by Sunday morning."

Davis, West Virginia recorded the lowest temperature in the lower 48 states on Saturday – a frigid minus 28F (minus 33C).

About 156,000 customers remained without power early Sunday, mostly in the south, according to poweroutage.us, with Mississippi, Tennessee and Louisiana hardest hit.

In North Carolina, the National Park Service announced the closure of campgrounds and some beaches at the Outer Banks, a series of barrier islands off the coast of the southern state that are vulnerable to storms.

It said oceanfront structures were threatened, and a section of highway that threads through its dunes was closed.

In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves said the US Army Corps of Engineers helped to install generators at critical sites, and authorities were opening 79 shelters and warming centers across the state.

The freezing weather forced NASA to postpone a key fuelling test over the weekend of the 322-foot (98-metre) rocket that is on the Cape Canaveral launch pad in Florida.

That in turn is likely to push back by at least a couple of days a planned manned Moon fly-by slated for this month.

Kyiv is under U.S. pressure to secure peace in the nearly four-year war while grappling with a Russian campaign of air strikes that has ravaged its energy system during one of the coldest winters in years.

The first round of negotiations took place in late January, but led to no new movement on the vital question of territory, with Moscow still demanding Kyiv cede more land in its war-torn east, which it refuses to do.

Zelenskiy said the new talks would take place on February 4 and 5, and that Ukraine - struggling to stop grinding Russian advances on the battlefield - was ready for a "substantive discussion".

"Ukraine is ready for a substantive discussion, and we are interested in ensuring that the outcome brings us closer to a real and dignified end to the war," Zelenskiy wrote on X.

In the capital Kyiv, 1,000 apartment buildings remained without heating on Sunday, said Mayor Vitali Klitschko, as a new wave of bitter cold swept across much of the country.

Temperatures in the city on Sunday hovered around -15 degrees Celsius, as workers raced to restore heating to hundreds out of the nearly 3,500 high-rises affected by a widespread grid malfunction on Saturday.

Officials did not directly link it to war damage, but the resulting blackouts - which spread to neighbouring Moldova - underlined the vulnerability of Ukraine's energy system after months of Russian attacks.

The Kremlin said two days ago it had agreed to halt strikes on energy infrastructure until Sunday at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump, and Kyiv said it would reciprocate.

Ukraine said the suspension was supposed to last until the following Friday.

The countries have not reported major strikes on their energy systems in recent days, though Zelenskiy said on Sunday that Russia was attempting "to destroy logistics and connectivity between cities and communities" through ongoing air attacks.

In southeastern Ukraine, two people were killed overnight in a drone strike on a residential building in the city of Dnipro, and six people were wounded in an attack on a maternity hospital in Zaporizhzhia, regional officials said.

Temperatures are expected to drop even further on Monday to well below minus 20 degrees Celsius in Kyiv.

Ukrainian private energy firm DTEK said on Sunday it had restored power to 300,000 households in the southern coastal region of Odesa, which had been hit hard by the malfunction.

Grid operator Ukrenergo said late on Saturday that planned outages would be in force throughout the entire country.

Anatoliy Veresenko, a 65-year-old veteran who was out for a run at a Kyiv park, said he was warily anticipating new attacks and did not place much hope in the peace process.

"Talks are talks.

National security adviser Miroslav Lajcak issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and condemning Epstein's crimes. He described the exchange as informal and light-hearted and without any real substance, but said he would offer his resignation so the situation would not be used to attack the prime minister.

"Not because of having done anything criminal or unethical in my actions, but I don't want him (Fico) to bear the political costs for something that's unrelated to his decisions," he said.

Fico announced in a video message on Facebook on Saturday he had accepted Lajcak's resignation, calling the adviser an incredible source of experience in diplomacy and foreign policy.

The U.S. Justice Department on Friday published millions of new files related to Epstein, including a text exchange from October 2018, when Lajcak was Slovakia's foreign minister.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 12:52:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FUWJBEZZMNNUTHEBI4LWL3FEHU.jpg?auth=80f3996976df515a8a2101241473880c3db57bd909e4a918275a55296804dd96&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo urges US and Cuba to engage in sincere dialogue</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/pope-leo-urges-us-cuba-engage-sincere-dialogue-2026-02-01/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Pope Leo said on Sunday he was deeply concerned about rising tensions between the United States and Cuba, and he called for "sincere and effective dialogue" to prevent violence and further suffering for the Cuban people.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week tariffs would be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe after ousting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.

Trump said the tariff threat was necessary to protect "U.S. national security and foreign policy from the Cuban regime's malign actions and policies."

Pope Leo said he had received reports "with great concern" of rising tensions between Cuba and the United States. He joined Cuban bishops in "urging those responsible to promote sincere and effective dialogue to avoid violence and further suffering for the Cuban people," in comments after his weekly Angelus prayer.

Last week Trump predicted that "Cuba will be failing pretty soon," adding that Venezuela, once the island's top oil supplier, had not recently sent oil or money to Cuba.

Laura Fernandez, President Rodrigo Chaves' protege and former chief of staff, is leading in the polls with just over 40%, enough to win outright and avoid an April 5 runoff. She has pledged to continue Chaves’ tough security policies and anti‑establishment message.

Her closest rivals in the 20-person field are Alvaro Ramos, a centrist economist representing Costa Rica's oldest political party, and Claudia Dobles, an architect representing a progressive coalition and a former first lady whose husband, Carlos Alvarado, served as president from 2018 to 2022. Both are polling in the single digits but are seen as the two most likely to compete in a possible runoff if Fernandez falls short of 40%.

Fernandez also has asked voters to hand her 40 seats in the country's 57-seat legislative assembly, a supermajority that would allow her to pursue constitutional reforms.

The current government holds just eight seats and has blamed congressional gridlock for blocking its agenda.

Polls show about a quarter of the 3.7 million voters remain undecided, with the largest group being between the ages of 18-34 and from the coastal provinces of Guanacaste, Puntarenas and Limon.

"People are tired of promises from all the governments, including this one even though the government has said things that are true like needing stronger laws to restore order," said Yheison Ugarte, a 26-year-old deliveryman from downtown Limon, a Caribbean port city that's been the hardest hit by drug violence.

Despite homicides surging to an all-time high during his term and multiple corruption investigations, Chaves remains deeply popular, with a 58% approval rating according to University of Costa Rica's CIEP polling.

While consecutive reelection is not allowed in Costa Rica, Fernandez has vowed to include Chaves in her government and positioned herself as the continuity of his mandate.

Polls opened at 6 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) and will remain open until 6 p.m. with early results expected to come in at 8:45 p.m.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 12:53:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4RFETWP3R5MFBBJTHFUAADSMXY.jpg?auth=a4f77f45dc7fcbd6014adc06aa60704ceb323ecbc2921e56ceb2438a69bbd1ee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian army says it killed a Boko Haram commander and 10 fighters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-army-says-it-killed-boko-haram-commander-10-fighters-2026-02-01/</link><description>ABUJA, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The Nigerian army said on Sunday it had killed a top Boko Haram commander and 10 other militants during a night operation in northeastern Borno state.

The army identified the leader killed as Abu Khalid and said he was second-in-command of Boko Haram in the Sambisa Forest.

"Abu Khalid was a key figure within the terrorist hierarchy, coordinating operations and logistics in the Sambisa axis," said the army statement.

It said no casualties were recorded among its own troops, and that they continued to conduct clearance operations across the Sambisa Forest, Mandara Mountains, Timbuktu Triangle and other known hideouts of Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in the North East region.

Nigeria has been battling Boko Haram and its splinter group ISWAP for over a decade in a conflict that has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions across the Lake Chad region.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 12:54:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian official says Revolutionary Guards have no plan to hold military exercises in the Gulf</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-official-says-revolutionary-guards-have-no-plan-hold-military-exercises-2026-02-01/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The naval forces of Iran's Revolutionary Guards have no plan to carry out live-fire exercises in the Strait of Hormuz as reported by some media outlets earlier this week, an Iranian official told Reuters on Sunday.

The blast happened a day before a planned naval drill by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz , the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil trade passes. Already, the US military had warned Iran not to threaten its warships or commercial traffic in the strait on which Bandar Abbas sits.

State television quoted a local fire official as blaming the blast on a gas leak. Media reported at least 14 others suffered injuries in the explosion at the eight-story building, which blew out windows and covered the street below in debris.

A local newspaper, Sobh-e Sahel, aired footage of one of its correspondents speaking in front of the building. The footage included a sequence that showed a man in black boots and a green security force uniform being carried out on a stretcher. He wore a neck brace and appeared to be in pain, his left hand covering the branch insignia on his uniform.

The local newspaper did not acknowledge the security force member being carried out elsewhere in its reporting. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard itself did not discuss the blast, other than to deny that a Guard navy commander had been hurt in the explosion.

Another explosion blamed on a gas explosion Saturday in the southwestern city of Ahvaz killed five people, state media reported.

It came as Iran remains tense over a threat by US President Donald Trump to potentially launch a military strike on the country over the killing of peaceful protesters or the possible mass execution of those detained in a major crackdown over the demonstrations.

Trump on Saturday said Iran was negotiating with the US, even as the Islamic republic's army chief warned Washington against launching military strikes.

"(Iran is) talking to us, and we'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens...We have a big fleet heading out there," he told Fox News.

"They are negotiating," Trump said.

Trump added that US allies in region were not being told of plans for possible strikes due to security reasons.

"Well, we can't tell them the plan. If I told them the plan, it would be almost as bad as telling you the plan -- it could be worse, actually," he said.

Qatar's premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani, who also serves as the kingdom's foreign minister, held talks with Iran's top security official Ali Larijani in Tehran on Saturday to try to "de-escalate tensions in the region" said the kingdom's foreign ministry.

Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez on Friday announced a proposed "amnesty law" for hundreds of prisoners in the country, and said the infamous Helicoide detention center in the capital Caracas, which rights groups have long denounced as the site of prisoner abuse, will be converted into a center for sport and social services.

Foro Penal says it has verified more than 300 liberations of political prisoners since the government announced the new series of releases on January 8. It added on X on Sunday that several others had been released alongside Tarazona from the Helicoide.

Tarazona is the director of FundaRedes, which tracks alleged abuses by Colombian armed groups and the Venezuelan military along the countries' border. He was arrested in July 2021, accused of terrorism and conspiracy.

"After 1,675 days, four years and seven months, the day we've so wished for has arrived, my brother Javier Tarazona is free," Tarazona's brother Jose Rafael Tarazona said on X. "The freedom of one is hope for all."

Government officials - who deny holding political prisoners and say those jailed have committed crimes - have given a much higher figure of releases, of more than 600, but have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including releases from previous years. The government has never provided an official list of how many prisoners will be released nor who they are.

Families of prisoners say the releases have progressed too slowly, and Foro Penal says more than 700 political prisoners remain jailed, an updated count including prisoners whose fearful families had not previously reported their detentions.

Families and rights advocates have long demanded that charges and convictions against detainees who are considered political prisoners be wiped. Opposition politicians, dissident members of the security services, journalists and rights activists have long been subject to charges like terrorism and treason, which their families say are unjust and arbitrary.

The proposed amnesty law could affect hundreds of detainees who remain behind bars in the South American country, as well as former prisoners who have already been conditionally released.

Among the long-time advocates of releases and amnesty is Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies imprisoned.

Many relatives of detainees - both well-known and lesser-known - have gathered outside prisons, even sleeping there, or have visited multiple detention centers in an effort to find out where their loved ones are being detained.

The recent releases were announced after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro and his arraignment in a New York court on narcoterrorism charges, which he denies.

Among prominent still-detained figures are opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha, both close allies of Machado, and opposition Voluntad Popular party leader Freddy Superlano.

Those released so far include Rafael Tudares , the son-in-law of former opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, who was jailed for over a year, during which he was sentenced to 30 years on terrorism charges which his family has roundly denied.

A 2022 United Nations report claimed state security agencies subjected detainees at the Helicoide, originally designed as a mall, to torture. The government rejected the U.N.'s findings.

The Venezuelan communications ministry, which handles all press queries for the government, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 14:55:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UPM7HIHJ45INVCHECEPOUSLDPY.jpg?auth=abe91df68748de293416329c374099fbb380758f3957963c3f318ee0c070374e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll of Swiss New Year bar blaze rises to 41</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/death-toll-swiss-new-year-bar-blaze-rises-41-2026-02-01/</link><description>ZURICH, Feb 1 (Reuters) - An 18-year-old injured in the New Year bar fire in the Alpine resort of Crans-Montana has died, Swiss authorities said on Sunday, taking the death toll of one of the worst disasters in modern Swiss history to 41.

The Swiss national was in hospital in Zurich and died on Saturday, the statement by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the Canton of Valais added, without providing any further information.

Most of those killed in the blaze at "Le Constellation" bar were teenagers and some of the 116 people who were injured are still in hospital with severe burns.

The additional victim was a young man living near the western city of Lausanne, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

On Saturday, hundreds of people marched alongside bereaved parents through the lakeside town of Lutry near Lausanne, carrying a large banner demanding "truth and justice".

"Today, we are just asking for justice and truth and afterwards we will mourn," Laetitia Brodard-Sitre, who lost her 17-year-old son Arthur in the fire, told a crowd of people carrying white roses.

The fire has tested relations with neighbouring Italy, which lost nationals in the blaze and has protested the release on bail of the bar's owner.

Swiss authorities earlier this week said they would grant the Rome Public Prosecutor's Office access to evidence gathered.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 14:55:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3UEZTKJQFRKFTCMGH2HAVUKMFU.jpg?auth=26e1eab90f3609636a44076bb528f9ea1b1e889c6bce1e34c0bfeb1d574fc337&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan human rights activist Javier Tarazona freed in prisoner release</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260201-venezuelan-human-rights-activist-javier-tarazona-freed-prisoner-release</link><description>Venezuelan ‍rights activist ​Javier Tarazona has been freed ⁠in a prisoner release, legal rights group Foro Penal said on ​Sunday, the latest ‍high profile liberation in a process ​families of the detained say ​has moved too slowly.

Since its resurgence in 2021, the M23 armed group has seized vast tracts of the DRC's resource-rich east, capturing the Rubaya mine in North Kivu province in April 2024 with Rwanda 's help.

Scavengers said part of a hillside in the mining zone collapsed on Wednesday afternoon. A second landslide struck on Thursday morning.

The M23-appointed governor, Eraston Bahati Musanga, told AFP there were "at least 200 deaths".

AFP was unable to independently verify a toll.

The phone network has been down for several days there, and Congolese authorities and civil society groups fled the area when the M23 arrived.

Information is arriving "in dribs and drabs from motorbike couriers circulating the region", making it difficult to establish an accurate toll, a humanitarian source said.

The Rubaya mine produces 15 to 30 percent of the world's supply of coltan, a key component in the production of electronics such as laptops and mobile phones.

Experts estimate that the M23 makes around $800,000 a month from the mine thanks to a seven-dollars-a-kilo tax on the production and sale of coltan.

UN experts also accuse Rwanda – which denies providing the M23 with military support – of using the militia to syphon off the DRC's mineral riches.

Kinshasa on Sunday urged "the international community to fully grasp the scale of this tragedy" which is blamed on "armed occupation and an organised system of looting" by the Rwanda-backed militia.

Besides containing at least 60 percent of the world's coltan, the wider eastern DRC is also home to vast reserves of gold and tin.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 15:52:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d1d747f8-ff79-11f0-b1ca-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-30T213800Z-120793558-RC2PJDAOVU5I-RTRMADP-3-CONGO-MINING-COLLAPSE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike kills 15 miners in Ukraine's Dnipropetrovsk, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drone-strike-kills-12-wounds-7-ukraines-dnipropetrovsk-governor-says-2026-02-01/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Fifteen people were killed and seven wounded after a Russian drone struck a bus carrying miners in Ukraine's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, energy firm DTEK and government officials said on Sunday.

The attack came hours after President Volodymyr Zelenskiy announced that a second round of U.S.-brokered trilateral talks between Ukraine and Russia would take place next week.

DTEK said in a statement that Russian forces had carried out a "massive terrorist attack" on a company mine in the region, and that all the dead and wounded were its employees returning from a shift.

"Today, the enemy carried out a cynical and targeted attack on energy sector workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region," energy minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on the Telegram app.

Police said the attack took place in the city of Terenivka. Footage posted by the State Emergencies Service showed a charred bus with shattered windows that had veered off the road.

Earlier on Sunday, regional officials said at least nine had been wounded in Russian strikes on a maternity hospital and a residential building in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.

Sunday's strikes also follow remarks by Zelenskiy earlier in the day that Russia - which said it had agreed to stop attacking Ukrainian energy infrastructure until February 1 - was still targeting logistics in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 16:30:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal launches $3 billion package to help rebuild after storm Kristin</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/portugal-launches-3-billion-package-help-rebuild-after-storm-kristin-2026-02-01/</link><description>LISBON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Portugal's government approved a 2.5 billion euro ($3.0 billion) package of loans and incentives on Sunday to help people and businesses rebuild after the devastation caused by Storm Kristin, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro said.

Storm Kristin swept across central mainland Portugal early on Wednesday, with wind gusts topping 200 km/h (124 mph) and heavy rain that killed at least six people, damaged homes, factories and infrastructure, and cut power to hundreds of thousands, authorities said.

Montenegro said the public bank Banco de Fomento will launch a 1  billion euro loan programme to rebuild uninsured storm-damaged factories and a 500  million euro financing scheme to help them with their immediate cash-flow needs.

The remaining 1 billion euros in aid includes a financing line to help people rebuild uninsured primary homes, covering up to 10,000 euros per house, as well as social security subsidies for individuals facing hardship or income loss, worth up to 537 euros monthly per person or 1,075 euros per family.

He said that, given the "current exceptional circumstances", all reconstruction work will be exempt from licensing and prior urban planning, environmental and administrative approvals.

"We are mobilising all our resources to manage the emergency responsibly, but also with hope...once again, we will rebuild Portugal," he said at a press conference.

Montenegro said the government also extended the "state of calamity" declared in about 60 hard-hit municipalities until February 8, amid forecasts of more heavy rain and flooding, even though winds are expected to ease compared with last week.

A state of calamity - Portugal's highest civil protection alert used for major disasters - allows authorities to mobilise emergency and armed forces, fast-track procurement and limit access to affected areas without curbing constitutional rights.

Nearly 180,000 households were still without electricity on Sunday, as grid operator REN and distributor E-Redes scrambled to restore power, the companies said.

In December, Israel announced it would prevent 37 aid organisations, including MSF, from working in Gaza from March 1 for failing to submit detailed information about their Palestinian employees, drawing widespread condemnation from NGOs and the United Nations.

"The Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism is moving to terminate the activities of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in the Gaza Strip ," the ministry said on Sunday.

The decision follows "MSF's failure to submit lists of local employees, a requirement applicable to all humanitarian organisations operating in the region", it added.

The ministry had earlier alleged that two MSF employees had links with Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad , which the charity has vehemently denied.

On Sunday, the ministry said MSF had committed in early January to sharing the staff list, but ultimately refrained.

"Subsequently, MSF announced it does not intend to proceed with the registration process at all, contradicting its previous statements and the binding protocol," the ministry added, saying "MSF will cease its operations and depart the Gaza Strip by February 28".

MSF said it had tried for months to engage with Israeli authorities over the issue, but its attempts were unsuccessful.

MSF charged that the ministry's move was a "pretext to obstruct humanitarian assistance" to Gaza.

"Israeli authorities are forcing humanitarian organisations into an impossible choice between exposing staff to risk or interrupting critical medical care for people in desperate need," it said in a statement issued on Sunday.

"MSF did not hand over staff names because Israeli authorities failed to provide the concrete assurances required to guarantee our staff's safety, protect their personal data, and uphold the independence of our medical operation," it said.

Such demands by Israel will force aid organisations to pull out when "needs are overwhelming and health services are collapsing" in Gaza, it said.

"At a moment when more humanitarian assistance is urgently needed, it is being restricted rather than facilitated," the charity said, adding that it remained open for dialogue with Israeli authorities to maintain its services in Gaza and the occupied West Bank .

MSF says 15 of its employees have been killed over the course of the Gaza war.

Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism Amichai Chikli said the organisation had "abruptly changed" its position.

"It appears the organisation's employees do not meet the established criteria," Chikli said.

MSF has long been a key provider of medical and humanitarian aid in Gaza, particularly since the war broke out in October 2023 after Hamas's attack on Israel.

The charity says it currently provides at least 20 percent of hospital beds in the territory and operates around 20 health centres.

In 2025 alone, it carried out more than 800,000 medical consultations and more than 10,000 infant deliveries, and it also provides drinking water.

Aid groups warn that without international support provided by organisations such as MSF, critical services such as emergency care, maternal health and paediatric treatment could collapse entirely in Gaza, leaving hundreds of thousands of residents without basic medical care.

As they did with MSF, the Israeli authorities have repeatedly accused the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA , of providing cover for Hamas militants, claiming that some of its employees even took part in the October 7, 2023 attack.

A series of investigations, including one led by France's former foreign minister Catherine Colonna, found some "neutrality-related issues" at UNRWA but stressed Israel had not provided conclusive evidence for its headline allegation.

Last month, Israeli authorities began demolishing buildings at UNRWA's headquarters in east Jerusalem, which the organisation described as an "unprecedented attack".

UNRWA has now been banned from operating in east Jerusalem, but it continues to operate in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:34:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9e685032-ff8e-11f0-892f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92C28KB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike on bus transporting Ukrainian energy sector workers kills 15</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260201-russian-drone-strike-bus-transporting-ukrainian-energy-sector-workers-kills-15</link><description>Fifteen people were killed ​and seven wounded after a Russian drone struck a ‍bus carrying miners in Ukraine 's southeastern Dnipropetrovsk region, energy firm DTEK and government officials said ​on Sunday.

The attack came hours after President Volodymyr Zelensky announced ​that a second round of US-brokered trilateral talks between Ukraine and Russia would take place next week.

DTEK said in a statement that Russian forces had carried out a "massive terrorist attack" on a company mine in the region, and that all the dead and wounded were its employees returning from ‍a shift.

"Today, the enemy carried out a cynical and targeted attack on energy sector ​workers in the Dnipropetrovsk region," Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal wrote on the Telegram app.

Police said the attack took place in the city of Terenivka.

Footage posted by the State Emergencies ‍Service showed a charred bus with shattered windows that had veered off the road.

Earlier on Sunday, regional officials said at least nine had been wounded in Russian strikes on a maternity hospital and a residential building in the southeastern city of Zaporizhzhia.

In a Telegram post, Ukraine's emergency service said the strike wounded three women in the hospital in Zaporizhzhia, and also sparked a fire in the gynecology reception area that was later extinguished. Regional administration head Ivan Fedorov later said the number of injured had risen to six.

Sunday's strikes also follow remarks by ‍Zelensky earlier in the day that Russia – which said it had agreed to ‌ stop attacking Ukrainian ​energy infrastructure until February 1 – was still targeting logistics in Ukraine.

In the past week, Russia has struck energy assets in the southern Ukrainian city of Odesa and in Kharkiv in the northeast. It also hit the Kyiv region on Wednesday, killing two people and injuring four.

Overnight into Sunday, Russia launched 90 attack drones , with 14 striking nine locations, Ukraine’s air force said in a Telegram post. A woman and a man were killed in an overnight drone strike in Dnipro, according to local administration head Oleksandr Hanzha.

Russian shelling also hit central Kherson, a city in southern Ukraine, soon after 7am, seriously wounding a 59-year-old woman, according to a Facebook post by the municipal military administration.

Russia's defence ministry on Sunday morning said its forces had used operational-tactical aviation, attack drones, missile forces and artillery to strike transport infrastructure used by Ukrainian forces.

In a separate post Sunday, it said that Russian air defences shot down 21 Ukrainian drones flying over southwestern and western Russia. It did not mention any casualties or damage.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:34:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/980587ba-ff88-11f0-82c2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-437N49E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czechs rally to support president in his growing rift with government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/czechs-rally-support-president-his-growing-rift-with-government-2026-02-01/</link><description>PRAGUE, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Czechs rallied on Sunday in support of President Peter Pavel after he refused to approve the nomination of a minister to the new eurosceptic coalition government who performed a Nazi salute and posted Nazi memorabilia.

In an escalating rift with the government, the pro-EU and pro-Ukraine Pavel last week accused Foreign Minister Petr Macinka of sending text messages via his adviser that threatened the president with "consequences" if he continued to oppose Filip Turek's nomination as Czech environment minister.

Turek, a member of Macinka's right-wing Motorists party, has faced criticism for making a Nazi salute and posting Nazi memorabilia. Turek has put his behaviour down to bad taste rather than any affinity for Nazism or racism.

Supporters of the president filled Prague's Old Town Square and nearby Wenceslas Square, while police closed off a number of streets in the area.

Many protesters waved EU and Czech flags and carried signs saying "We stand with the president". Some voiced support for Ukraine and opposition to Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis' coalition government.

Police gave no official estimate of the size of the protest but organizers put the number at 80,000 to 90,000 people, and said they planned to hold further demonstrations in other towns across the Czech Republic on February 15.

After winning an October election, Babis' populist ANO party cobbled together a coalition with the Motorists and the far-right, pro-Russian SPD.

Pavel appointed Babis in December but objected to Turek's inclusion in the list of cabinet nominees and then made public the messages Macinka sent last week, describing them as blackmail. He has referred the messages for review by the National Organized Crime Agency.

Macinka has rejected the president's accusation of blackmail over the text messages, saying they were all part of a typical political negotiation.

Commenting on the matter on Czech television on Sunday, Macinka said: "Politics is not a discipline for princesses... it is a very demanding discipline. Everyone who is in top politics should show greater resilience."</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 17:54:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C4GHLDOYDZLVHD3YLYVR4WYPLE.jpg?auth=56913fbf0c744b5b79ef7a71229b452ecdc20344fa337dfa763881ac5028ba57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top US, Israeli generals meet at Pentagon amid soaring Iran tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/top-us-israeli-generals-meet-pentagon-amid-soaring-iran-tensions-2026-02-01/</link><description>Feb 1 (Reuters) - The top U.S. and Israeli generals held talks at the Pentagon on Friday amid soaring tensions with Iran, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Sunday, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The interior ministry said security units arrested all members of the group, which it said had carried out several strikes on the airport in recent months, after surveillance of suspected launch sites in several areas of the capital.

The weapons used in the attacks originated from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, an ally of former President Bashar al-Assad that once had a large military presence across Syria supporting Assad’s army, the ministry said.

Hezbollah denied the allegations and said it had no activity or ties with any group inside Syria.

Authorities said they also seized a number of drones the group was preparing to use in further operations.

The ministry said only that the detainees had links to unidentified "foreign entities," without mentioning Hezbollah or Iran.

Reuters reported in November that Washington was planning to establish a military presence at an airbase in Damascus to help enable a security pact that Washington is brokering between Syria and Israel. The government denied the report.

Security sources say Hezbollah left behind weapons stockpiles, including drones, in parts of Syria after withdrawing its forces following the collapse of Assad’s rule.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 19:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Texas Democrat's win a 'wake-up call' for Republicans ahead of 2026 elections</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/texas-democrats-win-wake-up-call-republicans-ahead-2026-elections-2026-02-01/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - A Democratic candidate won a special election for the Texas state senate by a double-digit margin, taking control from Republicans for the first time in decades in a result the losing candidate on Sunday called "a wake-up call" for the midterm elections.

The victory for a seat vacated by a four-term Republican followed a string of wins in recent months for the Democratic Party in local and state elections across the country, offering hope for national Democrats looking to claw back power in midterm elections later this year.

Taylor Rehmet, a union machinist and U.S. Air Force veteran, won on Saturday in the conservative area near Dallas by more than 14 percentage points over Republican activist Leigh Wambsganss, whom President Donald Trump had urged voters to rally behind.

In a Sunday statement, Wambsganss said she congratulated Rehmet on his victory and called the Democratic win a "wake-up call" for local and national Republicans.

"The Democrats were energized," Wambsganss said. "Too many Republicans stayed home."

Trump on Saturday touted Wambsganss as a "true MAGA Warrior" and tried to rally voters to the polls on her behalf.

But on Sunday he distanced himself from the loss, saying he was not involved as it was a “local Texas race.”

“I’m not on the ballot, so you don’t know whether or not it’s transferable,” Trump said.

The district is more Republican than overall Tarrant County, which Trump won by 5 percentage points in the 2024 presidential election but Joe Biden won in 2020 by fewer than 2,000 votes.

Wambsganss said she expects to defeat Rehmet when they face off again in the November election for the seat's full four-year term.

But Democrats cited rising momentum heading into the midterm elections in November, when control of Congress is at stake. "Democrats are building on our historic overperformance, and we’re not slowing down," Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin wrote in a social media post.

Saturday's outcome wasn't entirely unexpected. In the November election that led to the runoff, Rehmet had the top result with 48%, while Wambsganss and John Huffman split the Republican vote.

Rehmet's election follows a series of victories for the party nationwide since Trump started his second term last year.

In November, Democrats won governors' races in Democratic-friendly New Jersey and flipped back the gubernatorial control in Virginia.

In December, Democrats won special elections in more conservative Kentucky and Iowa, but Republicans held off a Democratic upset in a special election victory for a Tennessee congressional seat after U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, concerned about his slim Republican majority, rallied national Republicans.

The November 2026 midterm election includes races for Congress and is often seen as a referendum on the White House, as well as some gubernatorial elections across the country.

Democrats, currently the minority party in both chambers of Congress, hope to flip Republicans' majorities.

With a handful of open seats, Republicans currently hold a slim 218-213 edge in the U.S. House, but that will narrow further after the swearing-in of Representative-elect Christian Menefee , a Texas Democrat who also won on Saturday to fill a vacancy in a longtime Democratic district whose previous representative died in March.

The 53-47 Republican-controlled U.S. Senate will pose a bigger challenge for Democrats, but party leaders are encouraged by their candidates who have won before in competitive states like North Carolina, Maine, Ohio and even Alaska.

Trump has encouraged primary challengers to some incumbent Republican senators, such as Louisiana’s Bill Cassidy , and suggested on Sunday he will make an endorsement in the three-way Republican contest in Texas that includes another incumbent, Senator John Cornyn, state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Representative Wesley Hunt.

“I like all of them,” Trump said.

Democratic strategists urged their party to continue emphasizing affordability and pocketbook issues.

"This win is another rejection of the chaos that Trump is creating, and people don't want chaos in their communities," Meghan Hays, a former Biden campaign and White House official, said in a Sunday interview with Reuters.

"Ahead of November, Democrats need to focus on kitchen-table issues and they need to have real solutions. That's what you're seeing in these local races."</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 19:45:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XG4HHS7IYROX3PPHSGPA4JDIBU.jpg?auth=ffd74632b7b4f80dd999716fb0d97862b41ec0f4ced1b432ef1a860fc086788a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran declares European armies 'terrorist groups' in retaliation for IRGC designation</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260201-iran-declares-european-armies-terrorist-groups-in-retaliation-for-irgc-designation</link><description>Iran has declared European countries' armies "terrorist groups", its parliament speaker said Sunday, following the EU's decision to apply the same designation to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Lawmakers wore the green uniform of the Guards in a display of solidarity at the legislative session, where they chanted "Death to America", "Death to Israel" and "Shame on you, Europe", state television footage showed.

Slamming the bloc's "irresponsible action", speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf said that under "Article 7 of the Law on Countermeasures Against the Declaration of the IRGC as a Terrorist Organisation, the armies of European countries are considered terrorist groups".

It remained unclear what immediate impact the decision would have.

The law was first passed in 2019, when the United States classified the Guards as a terrorist organisation.

Sunday's session was held on the 47th anniversary of the return from exile of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic republic in 1979.

The Guards are the ideological arm of Iran's military, tasked with safeguarding the Islamic revolution from external and internal threats.

They have been accused by Western governments of orchestrating a crackdown on a recent protest movement that left thousands dead.

Tehran has attributed the violence to "terrorist acts" fomented by the United States and Israel.

The European Union agreed on Thursday to list the body as a "terrorist organisation" over the response to the protests.

The step matched similar classifications enacted by the United States, Canada and Australia.

Ghalibaf said the decision, "which was carried out in compliance with the orders of the American president and the leaders of the Zionist regime, accelerated Europe's path to becoming irrelevant in the future world order".

The move, he added, had only increased domestic support for the Guards.

The legislative session came as Iran and the United States have traded warnings and threats of potential military action.

Tehran's response to the protests prompted US President Donald Trump to threaten to intervene, dispatching an aircraft carrier group to the region.

In recent days, however, both sides have insisted they remain willing to talk.

"Contrary to the hype of the contrived media war, structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing," Ali Larijani, head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said on Saturday.

Trump later confirmed that dialogue was taking place, but without withdrawing his earlier threats. He told Fox News that Iran was "talking to us, and we'll see if we can do something, otherwise we'll see what happens... we have a big fleet heading out there".

Trump has previously said he believes Iran will make a deal over its nuclear and missile programmes rather than face US military action.

Tehran, meanwhile, has said it is ready for nuclear talks if its missile and defence capabilities are not on the agenda.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Saturday that "a war would be in the interest of neither Iran, nor the United States, nor the region", during a call with his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah al-Sisi , according to Pezeshkian's office.

Qatari premier Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al, who also serves as foreign minister, held talks in Iran Saturday to try to "de-escalate tensions", the kingdom's foreign ministry said.

Firouzeh, a 43-year-old homemaker who declined to give her full name, said the recent tensions have left her "very worried and scared".

They have returned to Minnesota, according to Texas Rep. Joaquin Castro.

The boy and his dad, Adrian Conejo Arias, who is originally from Ecuador, were detained in a Minneapolis suburb on January 20. They were taken to a detention facility in Dilley, Texas.

Katherine Schneider, a spokesperson for the Democratic congressman, confirmed the two had arrived home. She said Castro picked them up from Dilley on Saturday night and escorted them home on Sunday to Minnesota.

In a statement, US Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not target or arrest Liam Conejo Ramos, and that his mother refused to take him after his father’s apprehension. His father told officers he wanted Liam to be with him, she said.

“The Trump administration is committed to restoring the rule of law and common sense to our immigration system, and will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of aliens who have no right to be in this country,” McLaughlin said.

The government said the boy's father entered the U.S. illegally from Ecuador in December 2024. The family’s lawyer said he has an asylum claim pending that allows him to stay in the U.S.

Images of the young boy wearing a blue bunny hat and Spider-Man backpack and surrounded by immigration officers drew outrage about the Trump administration's crackdown in Minneapolis.

In his order granting the release, US District Judge Fred Biery blasted the administration, writing, “The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”

Neighbors and school officials say that federal immigration officers used the preschooler as “bait” by telling him to knock on the door to his house so that his mother would answer. The Department of Homeland Security has called that description of events an “abject lie.” It said the father fled on foot and left the boy in a running vehicle in their driveway.

Castro wrote a letter to Liam while they were on the plane to Minnesota, in which he told the young boy he has “moved the world.”

“Your family, school and many strangers said prayers for you and offered whatever they could do to see you back home,” Castro wrote. A photo of the letter was posted on social media. “Don’t let anyone tell you this isn’t your home. America became the most powerful, prosperous nation on earth because of immigrants not in spite of them.”

Photos on Castro’s social media showed Liam wearing his blue bunny hat and with a Pikachu backpack.

US Sen. Amy Klobuchar , a Democrat from Minnesota, welcomed the boy back to Minnesota, saying in a social media post that he “should be in school and with family — not in detention.” The senator added: “Now ICE needs to leave.”

US Rep. Ilhan Omar, also a Democrat from Minnesota, posted a photo to social media of her with Liam, his father and Castro in which she is holding Liam’s Spider-Man backpack. “Welcome home Liam,” she posted with two hearts.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 21:47:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3cee23ce-ffb4-11f0-aee6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26032616849393.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington scolds Cuba after crowds heckle US diplomat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/washington-scolds-cuba-after-crowds-heckle-us-diplomat-2026-02-01/</link><description>HAVANA, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The United States on Sunday accused Cuba of interfering with the work of its top diplomat in Havana after small groups of Cubans jeered at him during meetings with residents and church representatives outside the capital.

Amid rising tensions between the two countries, the State Department on social media accused the Cuban government of "failed intimidation tactics," and it demanded that Havana stop "sending individuals to interfere with the diplomatic work" of U.S. Charge d'Affaires Mike Hammer.

Friction has increased between the long-time foes after U.S. President Donald Trump last week declared Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and said he would slap tariffs on any country that delivered oil to the communist-run Caribbean island.

Trump on Sunday said Cuba was "a failing nation" but added: "I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba."

Hammer, a career diplomat who arrived in Cuba in late 2024, has traveled the island widely to meet with political dissidents, Catholic Church representatives and others. The Cuban government accuses him of seeking to foment unrest.

On Saturday, he posted a video describing alleged harassment following a meeting with local church leaders.

"When I left the parish, a few communists, surely frustrated by how bad the revolution is going, shouted obscenities at me," Hammer said in the video on social media.

Subsequently, several more videos surfaced showing small groups of people in two locations during nighttime blackouts, taunting Hammer with cries of "Assassin!" and "Imperialist!"

Reuters could not identify the individuals in the videos, and Cuba's government has not commented on them.

Cuba's foreign ministry last year complained to Hammer about behavior it said was "interventionist" and alleged he incited Cubans to commit crimes and attack the state.

The U.S. Embassy, which produces the videos, has denied those charges and says Hammer is simply doing his job.

The two neighboring countries have been at odds since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, but a crippling economic crisis on the island and stepped up pressure from the Trump administration have recently brought the conflict to a head.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 22:51:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7TJIOFZRDFJGRJIBSHZQ4WMSRE.jpg?auth=214eb15d155fd0cbc8af578ebd253268ab5ebf03eb45e6870462cf54ca9d572f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian Kurdish forces announce curfew in northeast cities ahead of deal with Damascus</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260201-syrian-kurdish-forces-announce-curfew-northeast-cities-deal-damascus</link><description>Syrian Kurdish security forces on Sunday announced a curfew early next week in two cities in the country's northeast, ahead of the implementation of a recent deal struck with the Islamist-led government in Damascus.

Damascus and Kurdish forces reached a comprehensive agreement on Friday to gradually integrate the Kurds' military and civilian institutions into the state, after the Kurds ceded territory to advancing government forces in recent weeks.

Mazloum Abdi, head of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, has said the deal would be implemented on the ground from Monday, with both sides to pull forces back from frontline positions in parts of the northeast, and from the town of Kobane in the north.

He said a "limited internal security force" would enter parts of Hasakeh and Qamishli but that "no military forces will enter any Kurdish city or town".

Kurdish security forces announced a curfew in the northeastern city of Hasakeh from 6:00 am (0300 GMT) to 6:00 pm on Monday, and in the northeast's main Kurdish city of Qamishli on Tuesday, during the same hours.

It said the move was "to maintain security, stability and the safety of residents".

A source from the Kurds' security forces said a government security delegation visited its headquarters in Qamishli on Sunday.

The text of Friday's deal maintains an ongoing ceasefire and introduces a "gradual integration" of the Kurdish forces and administrative institutions.

It appeared to include some of the Kurds' demands, such as establishing brigades of fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Kurdish-majority areas.

The government's push to extend its authority across the country was a blow to the Kurds.

They had sought to preserve the de facto autonomy they exercised after seizing swathes of north and northeast Syria in battles against the Islamic State (IS) jihadist group during Syria's civil war, backed by a US-led coalition.

In Qamishli on Sunday, thousands of Kurdish men, women and children filled the streets in a show of solidarity, waving Kurdish flags and holding up pictures of fighters who were killed, an AFP correspondent said.

Student Barine Hamza, 18, said "we have come out for Kurdish unity".

"We are afraid of being betrayed because we do not trust this government," she said.

Housewife Nourshana Mohammed, 40, said that "the presence of the SDF is important for us. It protects us Kurds and saved us" from IS.

Information Minister Hamza Mustafa told state media on Friday that the agreement included the handover of some oil fields, the Qamishli airport and border crossings to the government within 10 days.

He said SDF fighters would be integrated on an individual basis into several brigades being formed under the army's command.

The United States, which has drawn close to Syria's new Islamist authorities, recently said the purpose of its alliance with the Kurdish forces was largely over.

Also on Sunday, the head of internal security in Aleppo province, Mohammed Abdul Ghani, told reporters he met with Kurdish forces in Kobane to discuss security matters there "and begin the deployment of interior ministry forces", without announcing a timeframe.

He said technical details still needed to be settled, but that the response from the Kurdish side was "positive".

Located in Aleppo province more than 200 kilometres (125 miles) from other Kurdish-held areas in Syria's northeast, Kobane is hemmed in by the Turkish border to the north and Syrian government forces on other sides.

Kurdish forces liberated Kobane from a lengthy siege by IS in 2015 and it took on symbolic value as their first major victory against the jihadists.

On Saturday, NGOs and a Turkish MP said Turkish authorities had blocked a convoy carrying aid to Kobane from across the border.</description><pubDate>Sun, 01 Feb 2026 22:52:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c02ce11c-fdc0-11f0-8134-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TV363-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi's party poised for landslide victory, Asahi poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichis-party-poised-landslide-victory-asahi-poll-shows-2026-02-01/</link><description>TOKYO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's party is likely to score a landslide victory in next week's lower house election, a survey by the Asahi newspaper showed.

A strong showing in Sunday's election would solidify Takaichi's grip on her party and give her a mandate for her expansionary fiscal policy, which could heighten concerns about Japan's finances and push bond yields higher.

Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party is likely to well exceed a majority of 233 seats out of 465 seats up for grabs in the lower house, according to Asahi's poll released on Sunday. That would be an increase from 198 seats now.

Together with LDP's coalition partner, the Japan Innovation Party or Ishin, the ruling alliance will likely reach 300 seats, the poll showed.

The largest opposition party, the Centrist Reform Alliance, is struggling and could lose half its 167 seats, the Asahi said.

Mandelson, who was fired by Starmer as Britain's ambassador to the United States last year after previous revelations about his connections to Epstein, said he did not wish to cause "further embarrassment" to Labour, the reports said.

"I have been further linked this weekend to the understandable furore surrounding Jeffrey Epstein and I feel regretful and sorry about this," Mandelson said in a letter to the Labour Party reported by the BBC and other news organisations, which Reuters was not immediately able to obtain.

Mandelson said he believed allegations about financial payments to him by Epstein, which appeared in British media based on files released by the U.S. Justice Department, were false and he would investigate them.

"While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party," the letter said.

Mandelson was key to the Labour Party's electoral success when Tony Blair was prime minister starting in the 1990s.

He came under scrutiny last year after U.S. lawmakers released documents including a letter in which he called Epstein "my best pal", leading to his dismissal as Britain's envoy in Washington.

Mandelson also had a turbulent earlier career in domestic politics. In 1998, he quit as trade minister over a loan he received from a fellow minister to buy a house amid questions over conflict of interest.

A second stint in the cabinet also ended in a resignation in 2001 when he was forced out over his alleged involvement in a passport scandal involving an Indian billionaire. He was later cleared of acting improperly.

Mandelson, a former European Union trade commissioner, is on leave of absence as a member of the upper house of Britain's national parliament.

Separately, Starmer said on Saturday that Britain's former Prince Andrew should testify before a U.S. congressional committee, following new revelations about his links to Epstein.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WBBVOO4X2FLZ5HJCJCUVWMYMEI.jpg?auth=87a7e656f51a5e3e794fe8ba5e8cbc71a65ca6d7fd35f7ceecba9880432bcdcd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK foreign minister says Ethiopia visit to focus on migration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-foreign-minister-says-ethiopia-visit-focus-migration-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister said she would use a visit to Ethiopia on Monday to focus on measures to try to stem rising numbers of migrants from the Horn of Africa seeking to reach the United Kingdom.

Yvette Cooper said job creation partnerships would dissuade people from leaving Ethiopia while stronger law enforcement cooperation was essential to counter smuggler gangs and speed up returns of migrants with no right to stay in Britain.

"We are working together to tackle the economic drivers of illegal migration and the criminal gangs who operate globally, profiting from trading in people," Cooper said in a statement.

"That includes new partnerships to improve trade and create thousands of good jobs in Ethiopia so people can find a better life back home instead of making perilous journeys."

Successive British governments have tried to tackle illegal immigration, an issue which has helped to propel populist campaigner Nigel Farage's Reform UK party into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Around 30% of people crossing the English Channel on small boat over the past two years were nationals from Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia and Sudan, the British foreign ministry said.

To help boost job creation in Ethiopia, Cooper is due to sign an agreement with the country to take forward two energy-transmission projects led by Gridworks, a UK investment organisation.

She was also due to announce 17 million pounds worth of funding for tackling violence against women and girls, assistance for 68,000 children suffering malnutrition, and for projects working with displaced people.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ICH6HKJEOZPG3FJ7SFVIBAAZPQ.jpg?auth=1bd71781fe746fcd646c6ecea92fda31e1cd44384d76c40190a0821dd4c1cee5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK’s Peter Mandelson resigns from Labour party after Epstein ties resurface</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-uk-ex-ambassador-quits-labour-epstein-links</link><description>Former British ambassador to Washington Peter Mandelson quit the Labour Party Sunday, seeking to avoid causing it "further embarrassment" after newly released US documents revived scrutiny of his connection to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

Mandelson, 72, who was sacked as Britain's ambassador to the United States last year over his ties to Epstein, allegedly received several payments from Epstein in the early 2000s, according to documents released on Friday by the US Department of Justice and reported in British media Sunday.

"Allegations which I believe to be false that he made financial payments to me 20 years ago, and of which I have no record or recollection, need investigating by me," Mandelson wrote in a letter to Labour general secretary Hollie Ridley.

"While doing this I do not wish to cause further embarrassment to the Labour Party and I am therefore stepping down from membership of the party," he added, saying he felt "regretful and sorry about this".

Bank records released by the US Justice Department suggest Epstein transferred a total of $75,000 (55,000 pounds) in three payments to bank accounts linked to Mandelson between 2003 and 2004.

Speaking earlier Sunday on the BBC, Mandelson said he had no memory of the transfers and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

Mandelson also appears in newly released, undated photographs, wearing a T?shirt and underwear beside a woman whose face has been redacted by US authorities.

He told the BBC he "cannot place the location or the woman and I cannot think what the circumstances were".

Other documents suggest Epstein sent 10,000 pounds in 2009 to Reinaldo Avila da Silva, Mandelson's partner, at a time when Mandelson was serving as a government minister.

The former ambassador was removed from his post in September after being appointed by Prime Minister Keir Starmer in late 2024.

Mandelson apologised in January for maintaining his friendship with Epstein, having initially refused to do so on the grounds that he was not complicit.

Former prince Andrew, stripped of his royal titles last year over his ties to Epstein, was also named in the files released on Friday.

A second woman alleged Sunday that Epstein sent her to Britain in 2010 for a sexual encounter with Andrew, her lawyer told the BBC.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 02:11:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f44f5260-ffcb-11f0-be4c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/1a137762bb4f48f5d63f4cf2319cc6c22a897434.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Olivia Dean named best new artist</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/grammys-poised-rewrite-musics-record-books-2026-02-01/</link><description>LOS ANGELES, Feb 1 (Reuters) - - British soul-pop singer Olivia Dean was named best new artist, and hip-hop megastar Kendrick Lamar claimed the prize for best rap album with "GNX," his chart-topping sixth studio set, as the 68th Grammy Awards got under way on Sunday.

The London-born Dean, 26, edged out fellow newcomers Leon Thomas, KATSEYE, The Marias, Addison Rae, sombr, Alex Warren and Lola Young in the Grammy race to crown the greatest performer among a field of rising new talents.

Accepting her award from the stage of the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles, Dean paid tribute to her grandmother, who immigrated to Britain from Guyana as a teenager seeking a new life.

"I must say I'm up here as a granddaughter of an immigrant," she said, evoking cheers from the star-studded audience. "I am a product of bravery and I think those people deserve to be celebrated. We're nothing without each other."

Lamar, 38, the West Coast hip-hop sensation regarded as one of the greatest rap artists of all time, entered Sunday's Grammy Awards with nominations in nine categories and immediately clinched the award for best rap album with "GNX."

Lamar's "GNX" was also vying for the top award of the night, album of the year, facing stiff competition from Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny and pop chameleon Lady Gaga.

Bad Bunny was competing for best album with "Debí Tirar Más Fotos," which could make history as the first Spanish‑language winner in that category. The award went last year to Beyoncé’s "Cowboy Carter."

If Lamar wins for "GNX," he would be the first solo male rapper to win the top award. Only two hip-hop musicians have been honored in the category - female artist Lauryn Hill and the duo Outkast.

For Gaga, the best album prize would be the first of her celebrated career. She has never won any of the top four Grammy trophies despite more than two decades in the music business. This year, she is competing with the album "Mayhem," described by critics as a return to her dark dance-pop roots.

Trevor Noah returned to host the festivities for a sixth time, which he has said would be his last Grammys gig. The show aired live on the CBS network from the Crypto.com Arena in downtown Los Angeles.

Bad Bunny's Grammy night recognition carried strong political overtones.

The singer-producer skipped the continental United States on his recent concert tour, saying he feared federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents carrying out U.S. President Donald Trump's deportation drive would show up to arrest his fans.

"ICE out," he said from the stage, accepting the award for best album of Latin urban music for "Debí Tirar Más Fotos."

His selection to perform at the coming Super Bowl halftime show next Sunday drew objections from Trump and other critics who argued the National Football League championship game's entertainment should be performed in English.

The world of KPop also earned a Grammy for the first time.

"Golden," the smash hit from the Netflix (NFLX.O) , opens new tab animated movie "KPop Demon Hunters," won an early award for best song written for visual media. It also was competing for two of the top awards of the night - best record and best song. The song is performed by a fictional band named HUNTR/X. Its real-life members are EJAE, Audrey Nun and Rein Ami.

The best record and best song contests also include "APT.," a duet between Bruno Mars and KPop singer Rosé.

Legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg, 79, achieved EGOT status — one of the rarest honors in the entertainment industry — after winning his first Grammy award for best music film for "Music by John Williams," which he produced. EGOT stands for Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony.

Grammy winners are chosen by the roughly 15,000 voting members of the Recording Academy — industry peers including artists, songwriters, producers and engineers — whose ranks have been revamped over the past seven years to increase diversity. About 1,000 Latin Grammys voters became eligible to vote this year, and 73% of members have joined since 2019.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 04:36:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QOF57H2D3JMR5HJNAMQEOXAGZY.jpg?auth=dcfab9a922431256d56254903cdcf9c52a5e90ca1c3f4941e18fa23a1cd8a9e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bad Bunny, Billie Eilish call out ICE at the 2026 Grammy Awards</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260202-bad-bunny-billie-eilish-call-out-ice-at-the-2026-grammy-awards</link><description>Rapper Kendrick Lamar on Sunday won four Grammys while Bad Bunny and Lady Gaga won two each -- but all three still were in the hunt for history on music's biggest night.

Bad Bunny meanwhile earned cheers as he delivered a powerful political message, ripping the nationwide immigration raids that have polarised America,  a pointed theme at the 68th annual Grammy Awards.

"Before I say thanks to God, I'm gonna say 'ICE out'," Bad Bunny said as he accepted the award for best musica urbana album for his "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos" ("I Should Have Taken More Photos").

"We're not savages, we're not animals, we're not aliens; we are humans and we are Americans," the 31-year-old Puerto Rican singer said, one week before he takes one of the world's biggest stages, headlining the Super Bowl halftime show.

Billie Eilish won song of the year for “Wildflower” at the 2026 Grammy Awards and used the moment to add her voice to the chorus of musicians criticising immigration authorities Sunday.

“No one is illegal on stolen land,” she said while accepting the award for the song from her 2024 album “Hit Me Hard and Soft.” "(Expletive) ICE is all I want to say.”

It was a big moment on a night of hard-hitting performances, poignant speeches and one-liners from six-time host Trevor Noah.

Lamar scooped up four awards in the rap categories including best rap album for "GNX," while Gaga won for best pop vocal album and best dance pop recording.

"I just want to say for women in music that I know sometimes when you're in the studio with a bunch of guys, it can be hard. So I urge you to always listen to yourself and always fight for your ideas," Lady Gaga said.

Britain's Olivia Dean was crowned Best New Artist.

"I'm not good at talking about myself, but I express it through the music. It's an honor to be here," said Lamar, a Pulitzer Prize winner.

The 38-year-old California native, who won five Grammys last year thanks to his smash diss track "Not Like Us," is also up for Record of the Year for "Luther" featuring R&amp;B artist SZA.

Standing in Lamar's way for Album of the Year is Bad Bunny, who is in the middle of a world tour, just months after a hugely successful residency in San Juan.

His "Un verano sin ti" (2022) was the first Spanish-language album nominated for Album of the Year honors. A win on Sunday would give Bad Bunny another mention in the history books.

Lady Gaga, 39, made a splashy comeback to touring with "Mayhem," her collection of pop bangers with a dark edge that embraces her dramatic side. She has seven nominations.

A win for Album of the Year would complete her hat trick of top awards.

She took Record and Song of the Year honors seven years ago for the soundtrack hit "Shallow," from "A Star is Born" -- which also earned her an Oscar.

Also nominated for Album of the Year are: pop princess Sabrina Carpenter; R&amp;B singer-songwriter Leon Thomas; Tyler, the Creator; hip-hop duo Clipse (Pusha T and Malice); and Bieber -- with his first studio effort in four years.

Noah repeatedly joked with the 31-year-old Latin megastar, born Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, about not performing due to Super Bowl contractual restrictions -- and even sang a few bars in Spanish himself before Bad Bunny indulged with a short verse.

K-pop singer Rose and Bruno Mars kicked off the proceedings with a high-octane performance of "APT.," before Noah took to the stage.

Lady Gaga offered an energetic version of "Abracadabra" and Justin Bieber stripped to his boxers for his turn on stage.

Reba McEntire and Lauryn Hill sang in honor of those who died over the last year in the world of music. Late rocker Ozzy Osbourne's wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack looked on as Post Malone paid tribute.

"Golden," from the Netflix animated smash hit "KPop Demon Hunters," won the prize for best song written for visual media, and top Oscar nominee "Sinners" won two soundtrack awards.

The majority of the 95 awards were handed out at a pre-gala ceremony before the televised broadcast.

Joni Mitchell -- one of several attendees wearing an "ICE OUT" pin in protest of US President Donald Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown -- took a prize for best historical album.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 04:38:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cd818b9e-ffe9-11f0-9e7e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-02T022238Z-509359046-HP1EM2206LOKP-RTRMADP-3-AWARDS-GRAMMYS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump hopes to reach a deal with Iran, keeps military option on table</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260202-live-trump-hopes-to-reach-a-deal-with-iran-keeps-military-option-on-table</link><description>Oil prices plunged Monday after Donald Trump said he was hopeful of reaching a deal with Iran , easing concerns about a conflict between the two in the crude-rich region.

The daughter of former President Rodrigo Duterte is widely seen as a frontrunner for the 2028 presidential election and prevailed after a similar impeachment bid last year, which the Supreme Court struck down for violating constitutional safeguards.

A lawyer for Duterte said the fresh challenge "comes as no surprise".

"We are prepared to confront these allegations squarely through the proper constitutional processes," her lawyer Michael Poa said in a statement.

The complaints are the latest twist in the Philippines' tumultuous politics, with the vice president still locked in a bitter battle , opens new tab with former ally President Ferdinand Marcos Jr ahead of the next election. Marcos cannot run again due to a single-term limit but is expected to back a successor to try to keep Duterte from power.

Civil society and leftist groups filed two separate complaints against Duterte on Monday based on similar grounds to those lodged last year.

Those included her alleged misuse of public funds, bribery for government contracts and threatening to kill Marcos, the first lady, and the former House speaker who is also the president's cousin. The complainants also accused Duterte of ignoring congressional inquiries.

"The constitution does not permit such cynical disregard for public trust. It does not allow the Vice President to treat public funds as a personal war chest while stonewalling all attempts at oversight," one of the complaints said.

Duterte has previously rejected the allegations.

Marcos too is facing a separate impeachment complaint at the House of Representatives. Asked for comment on the new complaints against Duterte, the president's communications office said it was a matter for Congress to decide.

"We respect the rule of law and we respect due process. The president wants to fight corruption as much as he can, and people deserve to know the truth," it said.

Unlike last year's complaints, the impeachment effort against Duterte will need to hurdle additional procedures imposed by the Supreme Court last year.

A midterm election last year also saw more Duterte allies join the Senate, members of which serve as jurors in impeachment cases.

"It's even more challenging now, I would say, given this Supreme Court final ruling," Senator Risa Hontiveros told foreign correspondents at a forum on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 06:03:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZUUYJDMECZOGVNUATIMNMTLF3A.jpg?auth=1c0413ca5dc619676b87fd8f183c58b42a50a45bec20f802156096750e02836b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Medvedev says Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland are false 'horror stories'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/medvedev-says-western-claims-russian-or-chinese-threat-greenland-are-false-2026-02-02/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland were false "horror stories" made up by Western leaders to justify their own behaviour.

Japan's election this coming weekend is among the most unpredictable in years , while polls across Latin America will ​test the region's rightward shift.

Here are some of the year's most significant elections for markets:

Japan's snap election on February 8 could loosen fiscal purse-strings in the developed world's most indebted ‌nation, on a debt-to-GDP basis. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi wants to convert personal popularity into support for her expansionary fiscal policies and bolster her coalition government's position in parliament. Latest polls show her approval rating has slipped a touch.

Investors expect pressure on Japanese bonds to continue, and some analysts reckon 10-year yields will hit 3% this year, from just over 2% now.

Colombians will vote as many as three times, starting in March, to choose new legislators and a new president to replace Gustavo Petro , a leftist who has clashed with U.S. President Donald Trump .

Colombian stocks outperformed regional peers last year, but bond investors hope Latam's rightward shift will sweep up Colombia, too, restoring orthodox economic policies.

"If there is a change ‌to the right...there's potential for some fiscal adjustment," said Ninety One portfolio manager Nicolas Jaquier.

Jaquier said a victory for Ivan Cepeda of Petro's coalition could allow him ​to make structural changes at the central bank and supreme court - removing roadblocks that slowed some of Petro's policies.

Hungary's April vote is the opposition's best chance in years to end Prime Minister Viktor Orban's 16-year-long run.

Centre-right party Tisza has a polling lead over Orban's right-wing Fidesz, but the outcome remains uncertain.

Cost of living concerns are high, and Orban has used fiscal giveaways to assuage voter worries.

Fitch Ratings cut Hungary's credit rating outlook to ‍negative last year, citing "significantly worsened" public finance projections that reflected new measures in advance of the election.

Tisza has pledged to repair ties with the European Union and unblock funding. Citi's Luis E. Costa estimates that could mobilise 10 billion euros ($11.9 billion), which alongside other reforms could "enable higher investment spending, accompanied by a lower fiscal deficit and reduced risk premia".

Local elections usually don't attract the attention of foreign investors, but May's ballot might. Keir Starmer's ruling Labour Party is trailing in opinion polls ⁠to the populist Reform UK and has struggled to deliver on promises to strengthen the economy.

Markets are sensitive to signs that the fiscally restrained Starmer might be replaced, as seen by a recent bond selloff.

Societe Generale's UK ‍economist Sam Cartwright says a new British leader would not have scope to significantly lift government borrowing if Starmer is replaced, his base-case scenario. Britain's next parliamentary election must be held by August 2029.

Ethiopia and Zambia, both battling back ‌from debt ‌default, hold summer elections.

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed 's Prosperity Party will almost certainly win a June vote, as key opposition groups plan a boycott.

In Zambia, President Hakainde Hichilema is currently expected to win in August, though Chatham House experts warn that citizens’ lives have yet to improve despite progress on debt restructuring and economic reform.

Investors are closely watching both countries as they seek opportunities in frontier markets . Zambia's economy has proved more resilient than expected, and Ethiopia's defaulted bond is trading above par despite the ongoing default .

Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is leading polls for the October election against Flavio Bolsonaro - a right-wing senator and the son of previous President Jair Bolsonaro.

Leftist ⁠Lula, 80, managed a truce with U.S. President Donald Trump ⁠despite clashing over tariffs, Venezuela and the elder ​Bolsonaro's conviction for plotting a coup.

"A Lula victory...could be quite negative for prices," Tellimer's Geronimo Mansutti wrote, citing concerns of "four more years of wide deficits and a higher debt path".

A fourth term could also leave Lula - a progressive champion - facing more clashes with Trump.

But Ninety One's Jaquier pointed to Lula's value as a "known quantity", adding that he is pragmatic and likely to appoint a credible team to make fiscal adjustments.

The U.S. November mid-term elections will determine who controls ‍Congress and are an important test for Trump.

Affordability is a hot-button issue and the White ‍House has scrambled to offer proposals to ease cost-of-living concerns, including capping credit card interest rates .

Polls show that Americans ​are broadly unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy. The incumbent's party historically suffers during mid-terms and the president recently conceded that his Republican Party could struggle to retain its tenuous grip on Congress.

"Clearly the president would like to see economic growth booming and financial markets rallying, and this will play a big part in ​his narrative and policies in the coming months," said Zurich Insurance chief markets strategist Guy Miller. "The policies in to that election ‍will impact all of us."

Japan says the mission was the world's first bid to tap deep sea rare earths at such a depth.

"Details will be analysed, including exactly how much rare earth is contained" in the sample, government spokesman Kei Sato said, calling it "a meaningful achievement both in terms of economic security and comprehensive maritime development".

The sample was collected by a deep-sea scientific drilling boat called the Chikyu that set sail last month for the remote island of Minami Torishima in the Pacific, where surrounding waters are believed to contain a rich trove of valuable minerals.

It comes as China -- by far the world's biggest supplier of rare earths -- ramps up pressure on its neighbour after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested in November that Tokyo may react militarily to an attack on Taiwan, which Beijing has vowed to seize control of by force if necessary.

Beijing has blocked exports to Japan of "dual-use" items with potential military uses, fuelling worries in Japan that Beijing could choke supplies of rare earths, some of which are included in China's list of dual-use goods.

Rare earths -- 17 metals difficult to extract from the Earth's crust -- are used in everything from electric vehicles to hard drives, wind turbines and missiles.

The area around Minami Torishima, which is in Japan's economic waters, is estimated to contain more than 16 million tons of rare earths, which the Nikkei business daily says is the third-largest reserve globally.

These rich deposits contain an estimated 730 years' worth of dysprosium, used in high-strength magnets in phones and electric cars, and 780 years' worth of yttrium, used in lasers, the Nikkei said.

"If Japan could successfully extract rare earths around Minami Torishima constantly, it will secure domestic supply chain for key industries," Takahiro Kamisuna, research associate at The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), told AFP.

"Likewise, it will be a key strategic asset for Takaichi's government to significantly reduce the supply chain dependence on China."

Beijing has long used its dominance in rare earths for geopolitical leverage, including in its trade war with US President Donald Trump's administration.

China accounts for almost two-thirds of rare earth mining production and 92 percent of global refined output, according to the International Energy Agency.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 06:04:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/281794c2-ffef-11f0-8007-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-12T022016Z-1129875432-RC2CZIAUB2FX-RTRMADP-3-JAPAN-RAREEARTHS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany closer to US than China despite recent tensions, foreign minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/germany-closer-us-than-china-despite-recent-tensions-foreign-minister-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Germany is "not in equidistance" from the United States and China, and will always be closer to Washington despite recent tensions, German foreign minister Johann Wadephul said in Singapore on Monday.

At a lecture hosted by the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Wadephul said the United States remains the most important partner for Europe and Germany and that Europe remains dependent on it for its security, despite issues that are currently "alienating" Washington from the region.

Trump administration officials have been critical of European countries for failing to meet NATO spending targets and for being too dependent on the United States for their own defence.

"Running with open arms to President Xi and saying all our problems vanished in this very moment and we are only heading to become your big partner, this would be the wrong answer," he said, referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Western nations, such as Canada and the United Kingdom have been striking trade deals with China, defying U.S. criticism .

Trump's insistence that Washington should take control over Greenland has shaken transatlantic relations and accelerated European efforts to reduce its dependence on the United States, even as Trump last week withdrew his threat to impose additional tariffs and ruled out taking Greenland by force.

But Wadephul said Europe's united response to U.S. claims on Greenland shows that it can be successful at defending its interests as long as it defines its red lines clearly.

Wadephul also said that the European Union's network of free trade agreements is an "important building block for rules-based free trade in times of increased protectionism and fragmentation".

The European Union is working to "swiftly conclude" more free trade agreements in the Asia-Pacific region, including with Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia, he said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:34:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOYPPONQ2FKSXPBY72AWJP2GNI.jpg?auth=5fa1cda9890a08ff6e6b71fcbf23e216df3a295f2eec5eee7314927a5e99206f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rural Thai voters shift old loyalties, testing Pheu Thai's populist machine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rural-thai-voters-shift-old-loyalties-testing-pheu-thais-populist-machine-2026-02-02/</link><description>UBON RATCHATHANI, Thailand, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Rubber farmer Pinittaya Boonlieng sat with friends in a key political battleground in Thailand to discuss how to vote in the February 8 general election - a choice that once would have been simple in a region long loyal to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra.

Thaksin's populist Pheu Thai party has dominated agrarian Ubon Ratchathani and neighbouring provinces in northeastern Thailand for decades, but that grip is weakening and voters are switching allegiance to powerful individual candidates.

In this region, Pheu Thai is polling at 30.1%, slightly behind the national frontrunner, the reformist People's Party, according to a survey conducted by the University of Khon Kaen in January. The conservative Bhumjaithai Party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul is third at 27.2%.

In the last election in 2023, Pheu Thai won 73 of 133 direct constituency seats available across 20 provinces in Thailand's northeast, which houses 4 million of the country's 8.56 million registered farmers.

Many of its candidates from the 2023 election remain popular, reflecting the patronage politics they have followed, although some have switched parties , particularly after the removal of Thaksin's daughter - Paetongtarn Shinawatra - as premier last year for her botched handling of border tensions with Cambodia.

The row exploded into the worst fighting between the neighbours in decades, killing at least 149 people, and stoking public anger in Thailand over Thaksin's once-close ties with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.

Thaksin is currently in prison because of an unrelated case, and a wave of nationalism washing over Thai politics has weakened Pheu Thai, which is also drawing flak for its inability to deliver on handouts promised when taking office in 2023.

Pinittaya, the rubber farmer, said she is considering backing the ruling Bhumjaithai Party, not because of its ideology or policies, but because she likes her local candidate, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker who defected.

"I am choosing the candidate," Pinittaya, 48, said. "The party is less important."

Six other farmers interviewed by Reuters in Ubon Ratchathani and a neighbouring province shared the same sentiment, showing how farm communities battered by falling crop prices, rising costs and mounting debt are shifting from party-based loyalty to backing candidates they believe can help them.

Manee Ruamtham, 62, a rice farmer in Sisaket province, said she was once a Pheu Thai voter but walked away from the party when it failed to deliver on its promise of a 10,000 baht ($317) cash handout after it took power following the 2023 polls.

"I was like their number one supporter but what they did isn't right," she said. "People lost faith in the party."

Paetongtarn blamed steep tariffs proposed by the United States for stalling her government's flagship handout programme, and her administration was eventually ousted due to the Cambodia crisis, leaving the handouts unfinished.

The local candidate Manee said she will vote for is Nuchanat Jaruwongsethian, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker who defected to the smaller Kla Tham party, an ally of the ruling Bhumjaithai.

"People voted for me to fight for farmers, to fight for decent wages," said Nuchanat, a former long-time Pheu Thai supporter. "But one day it wasn't about this anymore, so how can I answer the people?"

But not all rural voters are abandoning Pheu Thai. In Ubon Ratchathani, 53-year-old tapioca farmer Ubon Thanomsup said she may still back the party she has supported for many years - largely because of the local candidate.

"The candidate lives in our area, so he is nearer to help," she said.

Cherdsak Phokkunlanon, a Pheu Thai candidate in the province, said that his party could retain, and even expand, its rural support base with the help of populist policies, a playbook that Pheu Thai has successfully deployed before.

"Pheu Thai policy will guarantee the price of agricultural goods, so that people will gain 30% profit when they sell their products," Cherdsak said.

Political parties are responding to the swing in sentiment by aggressively recruiting well-known local figures, including defectors from rival camps, in a strategy aimed at capturing personal loyalty networks, rather than relying solely on national campaigns.

Among those is Sudarat Pitakpornpunlop, a former Pheu Thai lawmaker now running for Bhumjaithai in Ubon Ratchathani's District 7.

"Even if I change to another four or five parties, I will be the same old person who worked for all of you like before," she told voters at a rally last month.

Nationwide, at least 91 lawmakers elected in 2023 have changed their political affiliation ahead of February polls, according to multiple local media.

Of these, Bhumjaithai attracted 64 defectors, while Kla Tham took second place with 21 lawmakers joining its ranks. Only one has switched to Pheu Thai.

The trend reflects the enduring power of patronage politics in the Thai hinterland, rooted in gaps in state welfare schemes and public service delivery, said Titipol Phakdeewanich, a political scientist at Ubon Ratchathani University.

"When people help you, you feel you owe them something. These networks are long-term investments, and they can still help politicians win elections," he said.

Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine triggered the biggest confrontation between the West and Moscow since the depths of the Cold War, though U.S. President Donald Trump's envoys are trying to negotiate an end to the war with Russia and Ukraine.

Medvedev, who serves as deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, a kind of modern-day politburo of Russia's most powerful officials, praised Trump and said it was encouraging that contacts had resumed with Washington.

But Medvedev, who has repeatedly hurled invective at Kyiv and Western powers while warning of the risks of an escalation of the war towards a nuclear "apocalypse", said the West had repeatedly ignored Russian interests.

"The situation is very dangerous," Medvedev told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow.

"The pain threshold seems to be decreasing."

"We are not interested in a global conflict. We're not crazy," said Medvedev, who served as Russian president from 2008 to 2012. "A global conflict cannot be ruled out."

President Vladimir Putin remains the final voice on Russian policy, though Medvedev, now an arch-hawk, gives a sense of hardliners' thinking within the Russian elite, according to foreign diplomats.

A cartoon hanging in the room where the interview took place showed Medvedev, a former lawyer who hails from Putin's hometown of St Petersburg, pointing a submachine gun at European leaders.

Putin and Trump have both mentioned the risks of escalation over Ukraine, though European diplomats say that Moscow has skillfully played the escalation card to scare Ukraine's allies from getting too heavily involved in the war.

"They say 'No way - these Russians are making it all up - they are sowing horror stories and they will never do anything," Medvedev said, adding that what the Kremlin calls the "Special Military Operation" in Ukraine showed Russia would stand up for its interests.

Ukraine and its European allies cast the war, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two, as an imperial-style land grab, and say that if Russia wins in Ukraine then it will one day attack NATO. Russia dismisses such claims as nonsense.

Conflict first erupted in eastern Ukraine in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine's Maidan Revolution. Russia annexed Crimea and Moscow-backed separatists battled Kyiv's armed forces in eastern Ukraine.

When asked about the flurry of global events of January in Venezuela, over Greenland and elsewhere, Medvedev said that it had all been simply "too much".

On Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a Russian ally, Medvedev said that if Trump had been "stolen" by a foreign power, then the United States would have clearly seen it as an act of war.

He also said Western claims of a Russian or Chinese threat to Greenland were false "horror stories" made up by Western leaders to justify their own behaviour.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:35:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOLUZGS3Y5N7TBBDYRKOZVMAL4.jpg?auth=5480d241a308f666b63fcb01cd481da441f2ad164df69d8f63a5bd4f32b128a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Medvedev says expiry of New START should alarm the world</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russias-medvedev-says-expiry-new-start-should-alarm-world-2026-02-02/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, said that if the New START treaty expired with no replacement then the world should be alarmed that the biggest nuclear powers had no limits for probably the first time since the early 1970s.

"I don't want to say that this immediately means a catastrophe and a nuclear war will begin, but it should still alarm everyone," Medvedev told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow.

Arms control treaties, Medvedev said, played a crucial role not just in limiting the number of warheads but also as a way to verify intentions and to ensure some element of trust between major nuclear powers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 07:35:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7MOCWNBHYRNFLIXZPZQQY3YSJY.jpg?auth=78b17eaaf6c889c0916d68f3da7c58119c8a1709bb000d2752ccf3e364d73e6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel reopens Gaza's Rafah border crossing to Egypt, with limits</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-expected-reopen-gazas-rafah-border-crossing-egypt-with-limits-2026-02-02/</link><description>GAZA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Israel reopened the border between Gaza and Egypt on Monday for people on foot, a move that would allow Palestinians to leave the enclave and let back in those who want to return after fleeing Israel's war in the enclave.

The reopening of the Rafah border crossing will be limited, with Israel demanding security checks for Palestinians entering and exiting. Israel and Egypt were expected to impose caps on the number of travellers.

Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war that was brought to a tenuous halt by an October ceasefire brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump . Rafah's reopening was an important requirement under the first phase of Trump's broader plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas militants.

An Israeli security official said that European monitoring teams had arrived at the crossing, which "has now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit."

In the first nine months of Israel's assault in Gaza, launched after the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, Palestinians were generally able to flee to Egypt through the Rafah crossing.

Palestinian officials say about 100,000 Palestinians have fled Gaza since the war began, most of them during the first nine months. Some were sponsored by aid groups. Others paid bribes to parties in Egypt to secure permission to leave.

Israel closed the Rafah crossing after its forces swept into the area and has also closed the Philadelphi corridor that runs the length of Gaza's border with Egypt.

The closure cut off an important route for wounded and sick Palestinians to seek medical care outside Gaza. A few thousand have been allowed out to seek medical treatment in third countries via Israel over the past year, though thousands more are in need of care abroad, according to the United Nations.

Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, who have been banned from Gaza since the start of the war, which has caused widespread destruction and laid waste to swathes of territory.

Gaza's about 2 million Palestinians mostly live in makeshift tents and damaged homes, surrounded by the ruins of their destroyed cities.

Israel's Supreme Court is considering a petition by the Foreign Press Association that demands foreign journalists be allowed to enter Gaza from Israel. Government lawyers have said that letting journalists into Gaza could pose risks to Israeli soldiers, while also highlighting potential risks to reporters.

The FPA rejects this, saying the public is being deprived of a vital source of independent information. It also points to the fact that many aid and United Nations workers have been allowed to enter the enclave since the war started.

Trump's plan for Gaza, now in its second phase, foresees governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while it is rebuilt.

Israel has cast doubt on the prospect of Hamas laying down its arms and some officials say the military is preparing for a return to war. Since the October deal was struck, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than 500 Palestinians, health officials say, while militants have killed four Israeli troops.

On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people, in what it said was a response to a Hamas violation of the truce on Friday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:43:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RBBPTNMFQNJ43B5ORNILZS2YJU.jpg?auth=e48441b3ef36878bfcb855a96b53b3611a7f240009d1cade5fe8bf23677606b4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran examines diplomacy with US, hopes for results in coming days, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-examines-diplomacy-with-us-hopes-results-coming-days-official-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Details of various diplomatic processes to manage tensions with the U.S. are being examined by Iran, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei said on Monday, adding that Tehran hoped for results in the coming days.

Verdi, which represents nearly 100,000 transport workers, called the strike after talks with municipal and state employers over working conditions stalled last week.

The union is demanding shorter shifts, longer rest breaks and higher pay for night and weekend work even as cities grapple with budget constraints.

The walkout affects about 150 municipal transport companies in all but one of Germany's 16 federal states, including Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen.

One of the largest coordinated actions in local transport sector in years, the strike began as planned, Serat Canyurt, the leading negotiator for Verdi, told rbb radio on Monday, adding that public transport operators were now expected to return to the negotiating table.

In Stuttgart, Karlsruhe and Freiburg, services will grind to a halt for the entire day, union officials said.

Temperatures fell below zero in much of the country, worsening the situation for commuters forced to seek alternative transportation.

Still, Deutsche Bahn said Friday its urban railway S-Bahn trains in cities including Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Stuttgart, along with long-distance services, would run as normal on Monday as staff were not represented by Verdi.

Talks between Verdi and employer associations have been tense, with union leaders accusing municipalities of seeking to cut benefits and lengthen shifts.

In Berlin, Verdi negotiators said operators wanted workers to fund improvements themselves by giving up sick pay and flexible hours.

The next round of negotiations is scheduled for February 9.

Union leaders warned that further industrial action could follow if employers do not offer significant concessions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:44:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QF2HG53KVJOFNJYKPJASOWWI4M.jpg?auth=04b8d8a0cb99e107f62d7d9c3b77805def9f31118e74a43214334c9c3bfd3346&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaza border reopening long awaited by stranded Palestinians</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/gaza-border-reopening-long-awaited-by-stranded-palestinians-2026-02-02/</link><description>CAIRO/GAZA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Cut off from family or urgently requiring hospital care, Palestinians stranded on each side of Gaza's Rafah crossing waited with growing desperation for Monday's reopening of the border as a delayed part of October's ceasefire deal.

How fully crossings to and from Egypt will resume, and under what conditions, remains unclear with Israel retaining complete control of Gaza's frontier, but for those waiting to travel even a partial reopening feels long overdue.

While Rafah was partially open early in the Gaza war between Israel and Palestinian Hamas militants, it has been shut entirely since summer 2024 and only very small numbers have been able to travel to or from Gaza via Israel since then.

The people hoping to return to Gaza know it lies in ruins, their homes and neighbourhoods destroyed in Israel's two-year military campaign sparked by the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack. Those seeking to leave know that new restrictions could maroon them abroad.

Yet, a mother cut off from family and grieving the death of her newborn son, a trader yearning to reunite with his fiancee for a long-delayed wedding, and two people needing medical treatment abroad were all hopeful for the reopening.

Faten Hamed Abu Watfa, 43, has not seen her three children since she left Gaza nearly 10 months ago. Sitting in Egypt, she scrolls through photographs on her mobile phone, pictures of her two sons, aged 21 and 18, and her 15‑year‑old daughter, trying to bridge the distance that has kept her separated from them.

Abu Watfa left Gaza City’s al‑Karama neighbourhood on April 5, 2024, hoping to stay away for no more than six to eight weeks while her mother‑in‑law received medical treatment. Instead, she became stranded in Egypt after the Rafah crossing closed.

"It's an indescribable feeling, that one will go back to be reunited with his children and family, to the country, to the place where he lived and grew up."

Her return, however, will not be to the home she left behind. Abu Watfa said her house was torched by Israeli forces, leaving only the concrete pillars standing.

“When it rains, they put something like tar on the roof to keep the water from dripping on them, because the situation would be really difficult," she said.

"I am ready to enter Gaza, be searched and get tired, not for a day, but for a whole week... to be dragged around during the journey back, until I reach Gaza and see my children and my father safe and sound."

Many families who arrived in Cairo early in the war never expected to remain for so long. Some depleted their savings, while others found themselves divided, with relatives trapped on opposite sides of the Rafah border.

“I love Gaza, and I don’t see any other place that feels like home,” said Mohammad Talal al‑Burai, 28, a currency trader whose house in Jabalia in north Gaza was destroyed.

Despite fears of a relapse into fighting and concerns that poor internet and communications could disrupt his work, Burai registered with the Palestinian embassy in Cairo as soon as the Rafah crossing reopened.

“Going back to live in a tent? I don’t care,” he said. “I can’t wait to take my father into my arms and place a kiss on his forehead,” Burai told Reuters.

Burai postponed his wedding after the war erupted in October 2023. His mother remains in the United Arab Emirates, receiving medical treatment.

“I will go ahead with my marriage, but I may not hold a party since my mother might not be able to join us,” he said.

For others, the chance to cross is a matter of life and death.

Tamer Al-Burai, 50, who is a cousin of Mohammad Al-Burai's father, suffers from obstructive sleep apnea and relies on Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) machine, to help him breathe normally during sleep by keeping the airway open.

“My health has become much worse because there is no power and no fuel,” he said. His family left for Egypt two years ago, but he was unable to follow because the crossing remained shut.

“I have appealed to humanitarian groups, to the WHO, to the Palestinian Authority - to anyone - so that I can leave, save my life, and reunite with my family,” Al-Burai said.

Thousands of Gaza Palestinians have registered with the World Health Organization to travel for treatment. Gaza’s health ministry said at least 20,000 patients, including children and cancer patients, are awaiting evacuation.

Among them is Noor Daher, 31, a graphic designer from Gaza City with a chronic heart defect. “My heart beats even harder now,” he said. “I am hopeful my problem will finally end.”

For many, the reopening came too late.

Dalia Abu Kashef, 28, died last week while waiting for her name to appear on the Rafah crossing list for a liver transplant.

"We found a volunteer - her brother - who was ready to donate part of his liver," said her husband Muatasem El-Rass.

"We were waiting for the crossing to open so we could travel and do the surgery, hoping for a happy ending. But she deteriorated badly and died."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:44:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4GFHYRCDVVOQVFT3IKZPGWHX4M.jpg?auth=3721508a09102e9df71955e55e4bc984b71b53bec4f7540decc530211c3485c6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What's next for Trump's Gaza plan after Rafah reopening?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/whats-next-trumps-gaza-plan-after-rafah-reopening-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war was given a boost on Monday with the reopening of the enclave's Rafah crossing with Egypt. But difficult questions remain unaddressed, including whether Hamas will disarm.

Trump's plan, now in its second phase, has been shaken by repeated Israeli attacks that have killed hundreds in Gaza, as well as resistance by Hamas militants to lay down their weapons. Israeli officials say they are preparing for a return to war if Hamas refuses to disarm.

Below is background on Trump's plan as well as key issues left to be resolved.

In September, Trump outlined a 20-point plan for an initial truce, followed by steps towards a broader resolution.

It ultimately calls for Hamas to disarm and have no governing role in Gaza, for Israel to pull out its forces, and for broad reconstruction of the territory under international supervision.

The plan was widely endorsed internationally, although the sides have not yet fully agreed to everything in it.On October 9, Israel and Hamas signed a ceasefire deal covering the first phase of the plan. That included a halt to fighting, the release of all remaining hostages held in Gaza in exchange for thousands of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, a partial Israeli withdrawal, a surge in aid and the reopening of the Rafah crossing.

The Trump plan was also endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution that authorised a transitional governing body and international stabilisation force in Gaza.

WHAT IS THE SITUATION NOW?The ceasefire came into effect on October 10 and ended large-scale combat, though fighting did not completely stop.Gaza health authorities say at least 488 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire since October 10, and Israel's military says four soldiers have been killed by militants in that time.

Israeli forces pulled back and suspended ground assaults, but still control over 53% of Gaza, including ruined cities along the Israeli and Egyptian borders where they have demolished remaining buildings and ordered residents out.

That means nearly all of Gaza's more than 2 million people are now confined to a sliver of territory on the coast, where Hamas has reasserted control. Most residents live in damaged buildings or makeshift tents.

Palestinian groups and aid agencies say Israel is still not allowing supplies into Gaza at the rate agreed under the first phase of the deal. Israel says it is meeting those commitments.

Armed anti-Hamas Palestinian groups have set up bases in Israeli-held parts of Gaza; Hamas dismisses them as collaborators with no popular support.

Both sides have shown little sign of narrowing their disputes over steps to be taken in the next phase, which foresees the disarmament of Hamas, further withdrawal of Israeli forces and deployment of peacekeepers.

WHAT'S EXPECTED IN THE SECOND PHASE?Despite wide gaps between Israel and Hamas, Washington launched the plan's second phase after the New Year, announcing the establishment of a committee of Palestinian technocrats to run Gaza.

They will be overseen by a "Board of Peace" of foreign dignitaries led by Trump, which he initially proposed to address the Gaza war and has since said will also tackle other conflicts.

The plan's second phase also includes Hamas giving up its weapons and Gaza being demilitarised, in exchange for Israel fully withdrawing its troops.

The militant group is still believed to possess rockets, which several diplomats estimated to number in the hundreds. It is also estimated to possess thousands of light weapons, including rifles.

Hamas recently agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions and with mediators, sources said. However, two Hamas officials told Reuters that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

Two senior Israeli officials told Reuters that the military was preparing to return to war if Hamas does not give up its weapons and that it did not expect the militants to disarm without the use of force.

Hamas is also seeking to incorporate its 10,000 police officers into the new technocrat-led government in Gaza, sources said, a demand opposed by Israel.

An international stabilisation force is intended to ensure security and peace inside Gaza. But its composition, role and mandate are all up in the air.

The Palestinian Authority, which is internationally recognised and exercises limited self-rule in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, is supposed to carry out unspecified reforms before ultimately taking a role in Gaza. But details have not been outlined.

Plans have yet to be hammered out to fund and oversee Gaza's reconstruction. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, laid out plans this month for a "New Gaza" to be rebuilt from scratch, with computer-generated photos of gleaming residential towers, data centres and industrial zones.

The plan did not address property rights or compensation for Palestinians who lost their homes, businesses and livelihoods during the war, nor did it spell out where displaced Palestinians might live during the rebuilding.

Many Israelis and Palestinians suspect the Trump plan will never be fully realised and a frozen conflict will continue indefinitely.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:45:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TI4AQSRZ6ZMDPIMZVRFZGH55L4.jpg?auth=0b2955e38416e03764b6a784d8a7a67a4082432fc3e5e15e554ef5837d198446&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaza's Rafah crossing with Egypt reopens for limited number of Palestinians</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-gaza-s-rafah-crossing-with-egypt-reopens-for-limited-number-of-palestinians</link><description>Israel reopened the border between Gaza and Egypt on Monday for people on foot, a move that would allow a limited number of Palestinians to leave the enclave and let back in those who want to return after fleeing Israel's war in the enclave.

The reopening of the Rafah border crossing will be limited, with Israel ​demanding security checks for Palestinians entering and exiting.

An Egyptian official said 50 Palestinians would cross in each direction in the first day of the crossing’s operation. The official, involved in talks related the implementation of ceasefire deal, spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the issue.

About 20,000 Palestinian children and adults needing medical care hope to leave devastated Gaza via the crossing, according to Gaza health officials. Thousands of other Palestinians outside the territory hope to enter and return home.

Israel seized the ‍border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war that was brought to a tenuous halt by an October ceasefire brokered by US President Donald Trump .

Rafah's reopening was an important requirement ​under the first phase of Trump's broader plan to stop fighting between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas .

An Israeli security official said ​that European monitoring teams had arrived at the crossing, which "has now opened to the movement of residents, for both entry and exit".

In the first nine months of Israel's assault in Gaza, launched after the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack on southern Israel, Palestinians were generally able to flee to Egypt through the Rafah crossing.

Palestinian officials say about 100,000 Palestinians have fled Gaza since the war began, most of them during the first nine months. Some were sponsored by aid groups. Others paid bribes to parties in Egypt to secure permission to leave.

Israel closed the Rafah crossing after its forces swept into the area and has also closed the so-called Philadelphi corridor, an Israeli name for a strip of land that runs the ‍length of Gaza's border with Egypt.

The closure cut off an important route for wounded and sick Palestinians to seek medical care outside Gaza. A few thousand have been allowed out to seek medical treatment in ​third countries via Israel over the past year, though thousands more are in need of care abroad, according to the United Nations.

Despite the reopening of Rafah, Israel is still refusing to allow the entry of foreign journalists, who have been banned from Gaza since the start of the ‌war, which has caused widespread destruction and laid waste to swathes of territory.

Gaza's about 2 million Palestinians mostly live in makeshift tents and damaged homes, surrounded by the ruins of their destroyed cities.

Israel's Supreme Court is considering a petition by the Foreign ‍Press Association that demands foreign journalists be allowed to enter Gaza from Israel. Government lawyers have claimed that letting journalists into Gaza could pose risks to Israeli soldiers, while also highlighting potential risks to reporters.

The FPA rejects this, saying the public is being deprived of a vital source of independent information. It also points to the fact that many aid and United Nations workers have been allowed to enter the enclave since the war started.

Nearly 220 media workers have died since the start of the Gaza war, making Israel the biggest killer of journalists worldwide for three years running, RSF data shows.

Trump's plan for Gaza, now in its second phase, foresees governance being handed to Palestinian technocrats, Hamas laying down its weapons and Israeli troops withdrawing from the territory while it is rebuilt.

Since the October deal was struck, Israeli attacks in Gaza have killed more than ‌500 Palestinians, health officials say, ​while militants have killed four Israeli troops.

On Saturday, Israel launched some of its most intense airstrikes since the ceasefire, killing at least 30 people , in what it said was a response to an alleged Hamas violation of the truce on Friday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 08:46:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/972c3cf6-ff71-11f0-bca7-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26032256758307.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany arrests five for supplying Russian defence firms</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/germany-arrests-five-supplying-russian-defence-firms-2026-02-02/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - German authorities on Monday arrested five people suspected of forming a criminal organisation to circumvent European Union sanctions by exporting goods to at least 24 listed Russian defence companies, the federal prosecutor's office said.

The attacks at the weekend brought Pakistan's largest province to a near standstill as the separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) struck nearly a dozen targets in one of their largest ever operations, killing 17 security officials and 31 civilians.

Pakistan's military has killed 177 BLA fighters in three days of fighting, the interior ministry said on Monday.

Pakistan's government and military have said the group has received support from India, threatening to escalate hostilities between the nuclear-powered neighbours who engaged in their worst armed conflict in decades in May.

Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said 22 more militants had been killed overnight in different areas of Balochistan, taking the total to 177.

"Security forces, police and intelligence agencies thwarted the nefarious intentions of terrorists by taking timely and effective action," Naqvi said in a statement.

"The Indian agents and their facilitators will be completely eliminated."

India's foreign office had rejected the allegations on Sunday, saying Islamabad should instead address the "long-standing demands of its people in the region".

Balochistan, Pakistan's largest and poorest province, has faced a decades-long insurgency led by ethnic Baloch separatists seeking greater autonomy and a larger share of its natural resources.

The group claimed it had killed 84 members of Pakistan's security forces and captured 18 others. Reuters could not independently verify the claim. The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Attackers dressed as ordinary civilians entered hospitals, schools, banks and markets on Saturday before opening fire, Pakistan's junior interior minister Talal Chaudhry said.

"In each case, the attackers came in dressed as civilians and indiscriminately targeted ordinary people working in shops," he said, adding militants had used civilians as human shields.

The banned BLA said the attacks were part of a coordinated operation dubbed Herof, or "black storm", targeting security forces across the province.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:45:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's Tisza party maintains lead over Orban's ruling Fidesz, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-tisza-party-maintains-lead-over-orbans-ruling-fidesz-poll-shows-2026-02-02/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Hungary's centre-right opposition Tisza party kept an eight-point lead over Prime Minister Viktor Orban's governing nationalist Fidesz party in January, a poll showed on Monday, ahead of a parliamentary election set for April 12.

Orban is facing the biggest challenge to his grip on power since Fidesz swept to victory in 2010, although the outcome remains highly uncertain.

Tisza is led by former government insider Peter Magyar who has said his party will tackle corruption, unlock billions of euros in frozen European Union funds to boost the economy, and firmly anchor Hungary in the EU.

The April vote will have major implications for Europe and its far-right political forces.

Orban, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has often clashed with the EU on a range of issues while maintaining cordial ties with Russia and criticising Ukraine. The EU accuses Orban of eroding democratic values in Hungary, which he denies.

The latest poll, conducted between January 21-24 by Publicus Institute and published by daily newspaper Nepszava, showed that 48% of decided voters supported Tisza while 40% backed Fidesz, unchanged from December.

Besides the two major parties, only the far-right Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) would surpass the 5% threshold required for entry into parliament, the survey found.

The poll also found that 63% of voters thought Hungary was on the wrong track. That figure rose to 71% among pensioners, a key demographic, which Orban has targeted with a pension top-up.

Most polls have shown Fidesz trailing Tisza despite voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation in Hungary, which has also endured the EU's worst inflationary surge following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

However, pro-government pollsters show a Fidesz lead.

A second survey published on Monday by the pro-government Nezopont Institute showed Orban had a 46% approval rating compared with 35% for Magyar.

Nezopont, which did not survey party preferences in the poll conducted between January 26-27, said support for Orban was especially high among elderly and rural voters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:45:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6V7ORONRFPWNNOUUBVFOZHFO4.jpg?auth=c94e48fa00b3b8324da16042ac474a19a551fe34addb55150f73df46af5ddf08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq starts investigations into IS group detainees moved from Syrian camps</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-iraq-starts-investigations-into-is-group-detainees-moved-from-syrian-camps</link><description>Iraq 's judiciary announced on Monday it has begun its investigations into more than 1,300 Islamic State (IS) group detainees who were transferred from Syria as part of a US operation .

"Investigation proceedings have started with 1,387 members of the Daesh terrorist organisation who were recently transferred from the Syrian territory," the judiciary's media office said in a statement, using the Arabic acronym for the IS group.

"Under the supervision of the head of Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council, several judges specialising in counter-terrorism started the investigation."

Those detainees are among 7,000 IS group suspects, previously held by Syrian Kurdish fighters, whom the US military said it would transfer to Iraq after Syrian government forces seized Kurdish-held territory .

They include Syrians, Iraqis and Europeans, among other nationalities, according to several Iraqi security sources.

In 2014, the IS group swept across Syria and Iraq, committing massacres and forcing women and girls into sexual slavery.

Backed by US-led forces, Iraq proclaimed the defeat of the IS group in the country in 2017, and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) ultimately beat the group back in Syria two years later.

The SDF went on to jail thousands of suspected jihadists and detain tens of thousands of their relatives in camps.

The al-Hol and ​al-Roj camps hold more than 28,000 people, mostly ‍Syrians and Iraqis, according to the UN. About 6,000 foreigners are housed ​in al-Hol and a further 2,000 in al-Roj.

Last month, the United States said the purpose of its alliance with Kurdish forces in Syria had largely expired, as Damascus pressed an offensive to take back territory long held by the SDF.

In Iraq, where many prisons are packed with IS group suspects, courts have handed down hundreds of death sentences and life terms to people convicted of terrorism offences, including many foreign fighters.

Iraq's judiciary said its investigation procedures "will comply with national laws and international standards".</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 10:47:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/effbe85a-001a-11f1-96ce-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029591423496.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone incidents at UK military bases doubled last year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/drone-incidents-uk-military-bases-doubled-last-year-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Britain's military bases experienced a doubling of drone incidents last year, highlighting the changing nature of warfare and prompting the government to hand more powers to its forces to protect sites from aerial threats.

In 2025, there were 266 reported uncrewed aerial vehicle incidents near defence sites in Britain, up from 126 reported in 2024, part of a wider trend of European airspace being targeted by drones.

"The doubling of rogue drones near military sites in the UK in the last year underlines the increasing and changing nature of the threats we face," Defence minister John Healey said in a statement on Monday.

Drone incursions forced airports in Belgium and Denmark to close for hours at a time in the last few months of 2025, with experts saying the incidents had the hallmarks of Russian interference, a charge denied by Moscow.

In order to counter the threat from drones to British bases, Healey said military officers would be given new powers to destroy drones operating near them, an action that previously required the involvement of the police.

The new powers will also mean the military can destroy land drones and unmanned vehicles operating under water.

Healey said security at military sites had been stepped up. Last June, pro-Palestinian activists broke into a Royal Air Force base, damaging and spraying red paint over two planes used for refuelling and transport.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:36:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NYKV7PMLCVMADPU2A5BWP6S7WU.jpg?auth=4a826946e1d5c91454d63f95c278e4d240eba6067d8394cfae046024f770f2a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>British serial killer 'Suffolk Strangler' pleads guilty to 1999 murder</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/british-serial-killer-suffolk-strangler-pleads-guilty-1999-murder-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A British serial killer dubbed the "Suffolk Strangler" by the media after he killed five young women two decades ago pleaded guilty on Monday to another murder from 27 years ago.

Steve Wright, who is already serving a life sentence with no prospect of parole for killing the women in 2006, appeared at London's Old Bailey court and admitted kidnapping and murdering 17-year-old Victoria Hall in 1999.

Wright, 67, also pleaded guilty to the attempted kidnap of a 22-year-old woman the day before Hall's murder. He will be sentenced on Friday.

"Justice has finally been achieved for Victoria Hall after 26 years," Samantha Woolley from the Crown Prosecution Service said in a statement.

Wright was convicted in 2008 of the murder of five women who worked as prostitutes in the town of Ipswich, northeast of London in Suffolk. Wright left two of the bodies in a crucifix position with arms outstretched.

He was give a whole-life order, meaning he could never be released from prison, for what the sentencing judge described as "a targeted campaign of murder".

Wright had consistently denied the allegations even though his DNA was found on three of the victims and bloodstains from two of them were found on his jacket at his home. His victims' bodies were found in the space of just 10 days around Ipswich.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:36:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OU2UWHZXQJP3HGNO6SDCN7K2OQ.jpg?auth=9b0e43f1fb7c2f8506c360b2d0d4af7d5a4a3bccaa21a295c989115ee24c72b5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snapchat blocks 415,000 underage accounts in Australia under social media ban</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260202-snapchat-blocks-415-000-underage-accounts-in-australia-under-social-media-ban</link><description>Snapchat has blocked 415,000 accounts under Australia 's social media ban for under-16s , the company said Monday, but warned some youngsters may be bypassing age verification technology.

The platform urged the Australian authorities to oblige app stores to check users' ages as an "additional safeguard" for the world-first crackdown.

Platforms including Snapchat, Meta , TikTok and YouTube must stop underage users from holding accounts under the legislation, which came into effect on December 10.

Companies face fines of Aus$49.5 million (US$34 million) if they fail to take "reasonable steps" to comply.

Australia's eSafety online regulator reported last month that tech giants had already blocked 4.7 million accounts, delivering "significant outcomes".

As of the end of January, Snapchat said it had blocked or disabled 415,000 Snapchat accounts in Australia belonging to under-16s.

"We continue to lock more accounts daily," it said in an online statement.

But the law leaves "significant gaps", Snapchat said, arguing that age estimation technology was only accurate to within two to three years.

"In practice, this means some young people under 16 may be able to bypass protections, potentially leaving them with reduced safeguards, while others over 16 may incorrectly lose access."

Snapchat joined billionaire Mark Zuckerberg 's Meta in calling on Australia to require app stores to check users' ages before allowing downloads.

"Creating a centralised verification system at the app-store level would allow for more consistent protection and higher barriers to circumventing the law," Snapchat said.

The platform said it did not believe an outright ban was the right approach.

Snapchat said it understood Australia's objectives and wanted to protect people online, but did not agree its platform should be covered by the social media ban.

"In the case of Snapchat – which is primarily a messaging app used by young people to stay connected with close friends and family – we do not believe that cutting teens off from these relationships makes them safer, happier, or otherwise better off," it said.

Australia's world-first ban is being closely watched by ⁠other countries considering similar age-based measures, with Britain and France being the latest to signal such plans.

France's National Assembly on January 26 approved legislation to ban children under 15 from social media amid growing concerns about online bullying and mental health risks. The bill still needs to pass through the Senate before a final vote in the lower house.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 11:37:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2649eca4-fffd-11f0-84b0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/536b17d7a21bf1d09abe16827de3c3f7e0437990.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian state forces deploy into Kurdish-run city under ceasefire deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-government-forces-deploy-towards-kurdish-run-city-after-ceasefire-deal-2026-02-02/</link><description>HASAKAH, Syria, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Syrian government security forces deployed into a Kurdish-controlled city in the northeast on Monday under a U.S.-backed ceasefire deal that foresees the Kurdish-run regions being merged with Damascus.

The deal, declared on Friday, has staved off further conflict between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which lost swathes of eastern and northern Syria to government troops in January.

Reuters journalists saw a convoy of more than 30 interior ministry vehicles begin moving towards the city of Hasakah from a position outside the city in the early afternoon. Two local sources in the city said they entered shortly afterwards.

The government forces are expected to be stationed in Syrian state buildings in Hasakah's so-called "security zone", a Syrian official and a Kurdish security source told Reuters ahead of the deployment.

The accord declared on Friday foresees a phased integration of Kurdish fighters with government forces. The United States has hailed the agreement as a historic milestone towards unity and reconciliation in Syria after 14 years of civil war.

The SDF was once Washington's main Syrian ally, playing a vital part in the fight against Islamic State militants. But its status weakened as President Donald Trump built close ties with Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who has now brought almost all of Syria back under the authority of Damascus.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:12:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XU2OL3P45VLKTPSPBHC7WSND6E.jpg?auth=6070df570816fcae4fdd18e4335a9d48662d9dbba6ba0adb2dd86cf13d5982db&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No new targeted Russian strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/no-new-targeted-russian-strikes-ukrainian-energy-infrastructure-zelenskiy-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Russia has not carried out any targeted missile or drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the last 24 hours although energy facilities in frontline areas have come under fire, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday.

Zelenskiy's statement highlighted the limitations of a short-term energy truce that Russia agreed to last week at the request of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Zelenskiy said energy repair crews had managed to restore energy facilities damaged when high-voltage power lines malfunctioned over the weekend, on top of the damage caused by frequent Russian attacks.

"The (energy) system is operating stably. However, given the extremely cold weather and the impact of Russian strikes, all challenges remain serious," Zelenskiy said on the Telegram app.

Zelenskiy said Russian forces were focused on attacking transport logistics, especially railway infrastructure.

Russia and Ukraine said last week they halted strikes on each other's energy infrastructure, but disagreed on the timeframe for the truce.

The Kremlin said Trump had made a personal request to Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskiy said the truce was supposed to last for a week, starting January 30.

A Russian drone strike on Sunday killed 12 miners at a coal mine in the Ukrainian Dnipropetrovsk region, officials said. DTEK said on Monday one of its coal mining enterprises in the Dnipropetrovsk region had been attacked for the second time in 24 hours.

Regional officials said that a Russian strike had killed a father and a son, and wounded two children and their mother in the frontline Donetsk region.

Kyiv and Moscow are preparing for talks in Abu Dhabi this week on how to end the war. The talks are expected to be on Wednesday and Thursday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:12:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JVCO6ZGT55OBZGUT5AQQZXLOVQ.jpg?auth=86a54ad5204733386094d81cfebafad47adcb0b8ca890fee56b65c3290ecbf57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump still aims for Greenland control, its Prime Minister Nielsen warns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-still-aims-greenland-control-its-prime-minister-warns-2026-02-02/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen warned on Monday that while U.S. President Donald Trump has ruled out military force, Washington still fundamentally seeks to control the Arctic island.

The president intensified calls for U.S. control over Greenland at the beginning of the year, citing national security concerns related to Russia and China, which threatened to fracture the NATO alliance.

Trump has since backed away from threats of force and said he secured total U.S. access to Greenland in a NATO deal, though details remain unclear.

"The view upon Greenland and the population has not changed: Greenland is to be tied to the U.S. and governed from there," Nielsen said in a speech to parliament, speaking via a translator.

Nielsen said the U.S. continues seeking "paths to ownership and control over Greenland".</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:12:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3XADLAUJNNKMXLKHDTZWOUKGU4.jpg?auth=1779162f6ee1b135ec4cc354d88f0ea536ebe3fcbf9f7a14796f24a86166a7d7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greek PM targets ministers' immunity, 'jobs for life' to restore voters' trust</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greek-pm-targets-ministers-immunity-jobs-life-restore-voters-trust-2026-02-02/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Greece's prime minister proposed on Monday reviewing ministers' legal immunity and guaranteed "jobs for life" for state-sector workers in a bid to restore voters' trust after a graft scandal and to build support ahead of a 2027 national election.

Kyriakos Mitsotakis' centre-right government remains ahead in opinion polls but it has been shaken by a corruption scandal in which some farmers, aided by state employees, faked land ownership to get subsidies. The affair was revealed by EU prosecutors in 2025 and parliament is looking into the case.

Greeks were also angered by the government's handling of a 2023 train crash which killed 57 people, the country's worst on record. It triggered the biggest mass protests in Greece since a debilitating decade-long debt crisis. A trial opens next month, with protesters demanding full political accountability.

In Greece, only parliament can investigate ministers or lift lawmakers' immunity, according to the four-times-revised 1975 constitution.

"The world of 2026 is different and poses new challenges," Mitsotakis said in a letter to his 156 deputies in the 300-seat parliament and in a televised address. "The time is ripe for a brave constitutional revision towards a functional democracy."

To make public administration more efficient, Mitsotakis suggested that the lifelong job security enjoyed by state employees for more than a century should be reviewed, too, to address underperformance.

The constitution also needs to address modern challenges including artificial intelligence, affordable housing, the climate crisis, fiscal stability and a slow judicial system, he said, without proposing any specific measures.

Mitsotakis and his party took power in 2019 and were re-elected in 2023 for another four-year term.

For the proposed changes to come into effect, two successive parliaments need to approve them and an enhanced majority of 180 deputies is required in at least one of the two votes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:13:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7SMD7NHITNI3XJMRQUK3OFDMIM.jpg?auth=89421ec3b3389411277f5c443c0ffe8d1f95fc812e8b1255b842628b7ac6b6fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Peru foreign minister dies in prison hospital in Brazil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/former-peru-foreign-minister-dies-prison-hospital-brazil-2026-02-02/</link><description>RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Former Peruvian Foreign Minister Augusto Blacker Miller, who was arrested in Brazil in December, died in a prison hospital in Rio de Janeiro late last month, the state penitentiary authority said on Monday.

Russia's accusations were "baseless" and the expulsion was "unprovoked and unjustified", a spokesperson for Britain's Foreign Office (FCDO) said in a statement on Monday.

"Summoning the Russian Ambassador, a senior FCDO official made it clear that the UK will not stand for intimidation of British Embassy staff and so we are taking reciprocal action today, revoking the accreditation of a Russian diplomat," the spokesperson said.

Amid the war in Ukraine, Russia and the West have repeatedly accused each other of unfurling espionage campaigns of an intensity not seen since the depths of the Cold War, while western diplomats in Moscow say they are subject to intrusive surveillance and harassment.

Britain warned Russia against pursuing this course against its diplomats.

"Any further action taken by Russia will be considered an escalation and responded to accordingly," the spokesperson added.

The Russian embassy in London did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:13:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU: rejects Iran's categorisation of EU armies as 'terrorist groups'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-rejects-irans-categorisation-eu-armies-terrorist-groups-2026-02-02/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The European Union said it rejected Iran's decision to consider as " terrorist groups " the armies of EU countries after the EU listed the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on the bloc's list of terrorist organisations.

Budget negotiations have consumed the French political class for nearly two years, after President Emmanuel Macron's 2024 snap election delivered a hung parliament just as a massive hole in public finances made belt-tightening more urgent.

The budget talks have cost two prime ministers their jobs, unsettled debt markets and alarmed France's European partners.

However, Lecornu - whose chaotic two-stage nomination in October drew derision around the world - managed to secure the support of Socialist lawmakers through costly but targeted concessions, boosting his stature in the process.

"It's a political success and an economic failure," said veteran political commentator Alain Duhamel on RTL radio.

Despite the still-elevated budget deficit of 5% of GDP seen by Lecornu, investors have taken heart in the new stability. The French government debt premium over the German benchmark has returned to levels last seen in June 2024, before Macron's snap-election announcement.

The Socialists have said they won't back the no-confidence motions, which means the 2026 budget - already more than a month overdue - will be adopted once the two votes are cleared.

The Socialists' main scalp was the suspension of an unpopular pension reform , delaying the planned increase in the retirement age to 64 until after next year's presidential election.

With just over a year to go before the next presidential election in the spring of 2027, the respite on the budget front is giving Macron some breathing space, as he nears the end of his second term with historically low approval ratings.

Having lost control of the domestic agenda, his push for supply-side economic reforms has largely stalled . Meaningful spending cuts are unlikely before he leaves office, with lawmakers showing little appetite for unpopular measures as election campaigning intensifies.

Macron's supporters say Lecornu, by showing flexibility and an ability to compromise, has prevented the return of wealth taxes and preserved Macron's legacy of making France more attractive to foreign investors.

The president is now focusing almost entirely on foreign policy, pushing Europe to be less dependent on foreign powers, and advocating a harder line in confronting U.S. President Donald Trump over tariffs or the Greenland crisis.

At home, however, he leaves his centrist bloc without a clear successor and significantly weakened against a resurgent far right.

Two of Macron's former prime ministers are gearing up for the presidential race, Edouard Philippe and Gabriel Attal, while Lecornu has also gained popularity over the past few months.

But should the centre remain fragmented, and with no primary planned, it remains uncertain whether a mainstream candidate will reach the election's second round to face the far right, whether led by Jordan Bardella or Marine Le Pen.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:14:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UI7QENH5VKYLHR63VYSJYJ2VA.jpg?auth=05651e037eb03b06aa0f9d8bf55621860088e73aa1fd6f559dbb8e75144cd9f6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria charges nine with 2025 massacre that killed 150</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-charges-nine-with-2025-massacre-that-killed-150-2026-02-02/</link><description>ABUJA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Nigerian prosecutors filed 57 terrorism-related charges on Monday against nine men accused of carrying out a deadly attack on Yelwata community in Nigeria's central Benue state in June 2025 that killed about 150 people.

Benue sits in Nigeria's volatile Middle Belt, the fault line between the Muslim north and Christian south. Years of violence over land, religion, and ethnicity have proved hard for the authorities to rein in.

The charges, filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja, say the defendants held planning meetings, raised funds, procured weapons, and mobilised fighters across several states ahead of the June 13 attack, one of the deadliest rural assaults in years.

The filing says ringleader Ardo Lawal Mohammed Dono and others met in neighbouring Nasarawa state to raise cash, issue orders and recruit fighters. Several defendants are accused of supplying AK-47s, aiding the gunmen or providing safe sites for planning.

Prosecutors say the raid torched homes and caused heavy casualties in Yelwata in Benue's Guma district.

Plagued by Islamist attacks and mass kidnappings, Nigeria is under pressure to restore security since U.S. President Donald Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians. U.S. forces struck what they described as terrorist targets on December 25. The Nigerian authorities say they are cooperating with Washington to improve security.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:14:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3KVSSAP6DFMCFMYBSGWAWKK6QA.jpg?auth=64b4633eae7cb47ddc6589cb7467c86ff2c06ed07dcea96acd6d857a1a6d3cd0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland and Germany pledge to take lead on Europe's economic revival</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/poland-germany-must-take-responsibility-europes-economic-revival-finance-2026-02-02/</link><description>WARSAW, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Germany and Poland must take joint responsibility for an economic revival in Europe, the finance ministers of both countries said in Warsaw on Monday, as the continent's growth remains sluggish compared to rivals such as the U.S. and China.

A relatively weak economy has compounded Europe's challenges on multiple other fronts, with perceived security threats from Russia, trade and geopolitical disputes with the Trump administration and uncertainty over relations with Beijing.

"We need to make Europe more competitive," Polish Finance Minister Andrzej Domanski said during a joint press conference with German Vice Chancellor and Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil.

"Both Poland and Germany are ready to create this impetus and to develop economic policies that will return Europe to an economic, rather than regulatory, power," he said.

Klingbeil spoke about the transatlantic relationship and the marked changes it is undergoing.

"And we agree: precisely in this phase we must strengthen Europe and move Europe forward," he said, in his first visit to Poland since he took office.

Klingbeil said the EU must become "faster, smarter, and more capable of dealing with complexity."

Ministers from six leading European economies including Germany and Poland vowed on Wednesday to be the drivers of European progress, as they tackled how to advance projects stalled by the EU's complex decision-making process.

"We have set ourselves the goal of deepening European cooperation, picking up speed, and also demanding this from the Commission," Klingbeil said about last week's video conference.

He said this was a first meeting and another will follow soon in Brussels.

"It's less about adopting decisions now in a new format; it's about finding common positions so that we can then push our decisions forward in the Eurogroup," Klingbeil said, referring to the forum of euro zone finance ministers.

The idea of forging ad hoc coalitions allowing some EU countries to pursue projects without the need for agreement from all 27 member states has long tempted some and has already been applied to key projects including the euro currency.

"We must unwind the regulatory corset, simplify the law, reform our markets, and fully harness the power of the common European market and its nearly 500 million consumers," said Domanski.

The Polish minister said Europe is in a race.

"A race for competitiveness, for building true economic strength, and to achieve this, we need to accelerate," Domanski said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:15:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPRJQZBQQVKDNGJCDKMMOH6MQM.jpg?auth=a287c7999193d44e9d4006da4d2e12a077d1b16bdc2bd807ad02d4fcc0b5ba53&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia stepping up strikes on Ukraine's railways, Zelensky says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-russian-stepping-up-strikes-on-ukraine-s-railways-zelensky-says</link><description>President Volodymyr Zelensky said Monday he had ordered Ukrainian military leaders to respond to a growing spate of Russian attacks targeting the country's logistics routes, specifically railway infrastructure.

His comments come after Russian forces stepped up their attacks on train facilities, including one last week that left five people dead in a railway car in the eastern Kharkiv region.

Ukraine has managed to keep its nationwide rail network running despite almost four years of war. Russian forces have prioritised the capture of train hubs such as Kupiansk and Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine.

"The Russian army remains focused on terror against our logistics – primarily railway infrastructure," Zelensky said in a post on social media.

"In particular, there were strikes in the Dnipro region and in Zaporizhzhia, specifically targeting railway facilities," he added.

State railway operator Ukrzaliznytsia warned earlier on Monday that several of its routes in eastern Ukraine were becoming increasingly "high risk," urging passengers to instead use buses.

In the eastern Sumy region, Ukrzaliznytsia said some of its services would monitor for drone threats and stop near bomb shelters if they emerge.

Zelensky said that while Russia has not carried out any targeted missile or drone ⁠strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the last 24 hours, energy facilities in frontline areas have come under fire.

The Ukrainian president's statement highlighted the limitations of a short-term energy truce ‍that Russia agreed to last week at the request of US President Donald Trump .

Zelensky said energy ​repair crews had managed to restore energy facilities damaged when high-voltage ​power lines malfunctioned over the weekend, on top of the damage caused by frequent Russian attacks.

"The (energy) system is operating stably. However, given the extremely cold weather and the impact of Russian strikes, all challenges remain serious," Zelensky said on the Telegram app.

Russia fired fewer drones and missiles at Ukraine last month, AFP analysis of data from Kyiv's air force published Monday showed, but still crippled Ukraine's energy infrastructure and pushed the country towards a humanitarian crisis.

The most serious electricity, heating and water outages of the nearly four-year war came in January as the Kremlin battered Ukraine with 4,452 long-range drones – a 13 percent decrease from December – and 135 missiles, a 23 percent decrease on the previous month.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 14:15:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/40bb45e2-0034-11f1-b4e3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-72P24ZQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>As Sicily's Niscemi crumbles, families race to save what the Earth hasn’t taken</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/sicilys-niscemi-crumbles-families-race-save-what-earth-hasnt-taken-2026-02-02/</link><description>NISCEMI, Sicily, Feb 2 (Reuters) - After losing their home in the Sicilian town of Niscemi in a massive landslide last week, Benedetta Ragusa and Toni Rinnone raced to salvage their pizzeria, retrieving appliances and kitchenware from the site as the ground shifted beneath them.

Firefighters stood by, assessing cracks in the walls and monitoring earth movements before offering a helping hand, pushing a refrigerator up the street and to safety.

"Unfortunately our house was first to collapse in Niscemi, so we didn't even have the chance to recover our mementos from inside that little home," said Rinnone.

"We still had faith in the shop, in the premises we had, so we wouldn't completely fall apart. Instead, it seems that that, too, is collapsing, bit by bit. It's a bit tough to deal with," he said.

With a population of around 25,000, Niscemi sits on clay and sandstone cliffs, dominating a plain in southern Sicily that leads to the Mediterranean sea some 30 km (20 miles) away. It has experienced landslides since the 1790s, with the last major rupture recorded in 1997.

Despite warnings of instability, nothing was done to shore up the town's fragile foundations, and on January 25, following a ferocious storm that drenched the land, a four-kilometre-long (2.5-mile) stretch of hillside collapsed.

Buildings slipped into the void, others were lacerated by cracks spreading across their walls. Authorities hastily created a "red zone" down the eastern edge of the town, 150 metres (490 ft) deep, and ordered the evacuation of some 1,500 people.

Those who want to retrieve anything from inside the cordoned-off area have to be accompanied by emergency crews and must move quickly. No time for reminiscing.

"It feels like we're at war," said Ragusa as she rushed to gather glasses, plates and pans, piling them into a van.

Ariel views show a dramatic beige scar down one side of Niscemi, with mounds of earth lying on the plain below, the surrounding greenfields crisscrossed with cracks and crevices suggesting the whole landscape was being torn apart.

Buildings and severed roads hang over the edge of the land that remains intact. Below it, the broken stubs of drains and water pipes poke out from newly exposed earth.

"Unfortunately, the situation is truly critical. We have a city, its historic centre, seriously at risk," said Gianfranco Di Pietro, a geospatial data engineer.

"It is still too early to know what our future will look like. But we hope to secure this historic part of the city as soon as possible, to rebuild, to provide housing again to those who have lost it, and to stabilize the entire slope."

Locals could be forgiven for being sceptical.

After the 1997 landslide, experts said parts of the town had been built on unstable ground and urgent work was needed, including installing proper drainage to stop the ground from saturating during storms.

But plans for such work stalled amid a mix of legal disputes and local bureaucracy that regularly throttle public works projects across Italy.

Niscemi Mayor Massimiliano Conti told reporters his town had only in December received funding needed to pay for safety work tied to the 1997 disaster. But that plan had been washed away, like the cliffs it was meant to safeguard.

The public prosecutor's office in nearby Gela has opened an investigation into negligent disaster.

"It is right that those responsible for this should pay," Conti said.

With much of her pizzeria equipment secured, Benedetta Ragusa said she now faced a period of grief over her lost home and the dreams destroyed along with it.

Looking at drone footage, she can only make out her old bathroom wall with a mirror still attached. She was relieved she hadn't got back earlier and tried to save her belongings.

"Losing everything is terrible, losing your first home is terrible, but we were saved, because honestly I don't know what would have happened if we had been inside," she said.

Astonishingly, lives were not lost in the disaster.

While Sicilians have a reputation in Italy for riding roughshod over regulations, locals rejected accusations on social media last week that they had ignored building rules while developing Niscemi.

"We risk losing everything, and people still find the time to talk badly about us, and that's not right," said French teacher Daniela Ferraro, whose home lay within the red zone.

Recent renovation work was carried out with the required permits and the property had been earthquake-proofed, she said, refusing to face the prospect of moving away from Niscemi.

"We will go to work like every day, we will keep rolling up our sleeves because we don't give up. Our land must be saved."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7I7NEY2ARNJXTNQF56TDVPE6QQ.jpg?auth=21dbbe2e97e811af60500393c2dc41833f7aa231f5ec7846d328b5fef6c1b808&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian captain guilty over crew member's death in U.S. tanker crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-captain-guilty-over-crew-members-death-us-tanker-crash-2026-02-02/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The captain of a container ship that crashed into a U.S. tanker off Britain's east coast last year was found guilty on Monday of causing the death of a crew member through gross negligence.

Russian national Vladimir Motin, 59, was captain of the Solong when it hit the Stena Immaculate tanker, which was anchored and carrying just over 220,000 barrels of high-grade aviation fuel, on March 10, 2025.

The collision started a blaze on both vessels and caused the death of Filipino national and Solong crew member Mark Pernia, 38, whose body has never been found and is presumed dead.

Prosecutor Tom Little told jurors at the start of Motin's trial last month that Motin did "absolutely nothing" to prevent the collision, having been on course to hit the Stena Immaculate for more than 30 minutes before the fatal crash.

Motin's lawyer James Leonard said Motin unsuccessfully tried to take the Solong off autopilot and change course, arguing that while Motin was at fault he was not grossly negligent.

After a trial at London's Old Bailey court, Motin – who had pleaded not guilty – was convicted of the gross negligence manslaughter of Pernia. He will be sentenced on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDZ4K3APCBIABN23SSQTREKUGY.jpg?auth=0085a0033f177e5e90f49a779886760e5967fe24b00ff8f8b3f08a0c9ab54ac7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan's India boycott splits fans as politics overshadows cricket</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/cricket/pakistans-india-boycott-splits-fans-politics-overshadows-cricket-2026-02-02/</link><description>KARACHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Pakistan's decision to boycott its Twenty20 World Cup match against India has drawn widespread support from fans and administrators who hailed the move as a long-overdue stand in a rivalry in which sport and geopolitics have collided.

The government on Sunday cleared Pakistan to take part in the tournament beginning February 7 but barred the team from playing India in a February 15 group match in Colombo, a decision the International Cricket Council (ICC) said was not in the interests of the global game.

The boycott deepened a long freeze in bilateral cricket between the nuclear-armed neighbours — who have not played a full series since 2012–13 and now meet largely at neutral venues — and dealt a blow to the ICC's marquee event, with India-Pakistan matches the biggest drivers of global viewership and revenue.

For many in Pakistan, however, the boycott was less about cricketing issues, with Pakistan forfeiting two points by skipping the match, and more about symbolism.

"Enough is enough," former Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Najam Sethi told Reuters, accusing India's board of politicising the ICC. "It's time to challenge this duplicitous approach by exercising PCB's options in alliance with Bangladesh."

The Indian government, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the International Cricket Council did not respond to requests for comment.

The ICC said it was still awaiting an official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) conveying their "position of selective participation".

"While the ICC respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy, this decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan," the Dubai-based body said in a statement on Sunday.

The government has not publicly detailed its reasoning, but Mosharraf Zaidi, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, linked the move to security tensions with India.

"Nothing is more important than the memory of Pakistani citizens and troops murdered by Indian proxy terrorists over the weekend," Zaidi said. "With funerals taking place today, this was the least that could be done."

The remarks followed coordinated attacks by Baloch separatist militants across Pakistan's southwestern Balochistan province over the weekend that killed nearly 50 people.

India's foreign ministry rejected Pakistan's accusations, calling them "baseless" and accusing Islamabad of deflecting attention from its own internal issues.

Pakistan's World Cup jersey has been branded the "Markhor Edition," after the national animal, a symbol of resilience also used in military iconography, Geo TV reported.

On the streets of Pakistan's major cities, many cricket fans backed the boycott as a response to what they see as India's growing influence over global cricket governance.

"This arrogance of India should be broken a little," said Mohammad Asghar, a fan in Karachi. "They should realise someone has come forward to challenge them."

Others drew parallels with Bangladesh's earlier withdrawal from the tournament over safety concerns, a move that led to Scotland replacing them, and questioned why Pakistan should be held to a different standard.

"If Bangladesh can boycott for one player's safety, why can't Pakistan take a stand?" said Ayaz Ahmed.

The decision also sparked heated debate on social media, with users divided between calls for "self-respect" and warnings that skipping the match could further isolate Pakistan in global cricket.

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi agreed.

"Cricket can open doors when politics closes them," he wrote on X. "It's regrettable that Pakistan won't play India, but this is the moment for the ICC to prove it is impartial."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AE4ZRG36LZJ4NPXU2SIT4KWWUY.jpg?auth=b58c697d3561b8e6e2607524e6046b3106ba25bb7fc30fb2fa73544512d66bfe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway police detain son of crown princess on fresh allegations ahead of trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norway-police-detain-son-crown-princess-fresh-allegations-ahead-trial-2026-02-02/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Norwegian police said on Monday they have detained the eldest son of Norway's crown princess over fresh criminal allegations against him ahead of a separate trial this week in which he faces multiple charges of rape and other crimes.

Police in a statement said Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson to Crown Prince Haakon, was apprehended on Sunday on suspicion of causing bodily harm, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order.

Following the latest accusations, police said they would seek permission from a judge to keep Hoiby in their custody for the next four weeks.

He has so far been at large awaiting the trial, which begins on Tuesday, on four counts of rape as well as domestic violence, assault and drug possession, among other crimes, one of several cases that have shaken the Norwegian monarchy .

He could face new charges from the latest allegations on top of the 38 counts he currently faces. His lawyer declined to comment on the new accusations presented on Monday.

Hoiby does not admit criminal guilt for the charges of rape and domestic violence, but has admitted to some lesser crimes and plans to give a detailed explanation of this in court, his lawyer has previously said. His trial is due to last until March 19.

The case against Hoiby began in 2024 when police named him as a suspect of physical assault against a woman with whom he had been in a relationship.

Hoiby, in a statement to the media at the time, admitted to causing bodily harm to the woman while he was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol and to damaging her apartment. Hoiby said he regretted his acts.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QU2V3X2ZIJIGHCFSYQSALNJEJE.jpg?auth=6e4e7aeae997775979638bb8de1ee0e6b11fa9f6dc676759ca0ef7744c88e7e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia's Clan del Golfo commander dies in river accident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombias-clan-del-golfo-commander-dies-river-accident-2026-02-02/</link><description>BOGOTA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The second-in-command of Colombia's Clan del Golfo crime gang - the country's largest illegal armed group - Jose Gonzalo Sanchez died when the boat he was traveling in to promote the gang's peace process with the government capsized in a river in the northwest of the country, according to reports from the illegal armed group and the government.

The boat carrying Sanchez, more commonly known as 'Gonzalito' capsized on Friday on the Esmeralda River, in the department of Cordoba, the illegal armed group said in a statement on Sunday.

The Office of the High Commissioner for Peace said it hopes that Sanchez's death would not delay the government's peace process with the illegal armed group. The Clan del Golfo crime gang was designated a terrorist organization by the United States in December.

Talks between the group and the government of leftist President Gustavo Petro are part of the administration's embattled plan to bring peace to the country after six decades of armed conflict.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 15:09:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rome introduces Trevi Fountain access fee to curb coin-tossing crowds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/rome-introduces-trevi-fountain-access-fee-curb-coin-tossing-crowds-2026-02-02/</link><description>ROME, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Tourists keen to follow tradition by tossing a coin into Rome's Trevi Fountain will need to dig a little deeper from Monday, as the city introduces a new 2-euro ($2.40) visitor fee.

The charge, aimed at easing overtourism and helping fund upkeep of the monument, applies only to visitors who walk down the stone steps to get close to the fountain's basin.

The surrounding square, which offers views of the landmark, will remain freely accessible.

The fee will be levied from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. at weekends. Under rules first announced in December, Rome residents are exempt, along with people with disabilities and their companions, and children under 6.

"I didn't know that we had to pay, but I have no problem with that," said Argentine tourist Valentina De Vicentis, one of those affected by the new fee. She said she expected it to ease overcrowding.

"There are less people in here, so I think that's good, because if not, there are a lot of people and you can't take pictures and you can't stay (for a long) time and enjoy."

The Trevi Fountain, where tradition dictates that visitors toss a coin into the water to guarantee their return to Rome, has long been one of the city's most popular attractions, even for visiting world leaders .

It is remembered for the famous film scene in Federico Fellini's "La Dolce Vita", in which Anita Ekberg wades into the fountain and beckons her co-star Marcello Mastroianni to join her: "Marcello! Come here!"

Authorities say more than 10 million people visited the fountain in the December 2024-December 2025 period, which largely coincided with a Catholic Holy Year, or Jubilee, which drew about 33.5 million pilgrims to Rome.

Fed by an ancient Roman aqueduct and completed in 1762, the monument is a late Baroque masterpiece depicting Oceanus, the god of all water, symbolising the varying moods of the world's seas and rivers.

With tourism booming in Rome and across Italy, visitor fees have been introduced at a growing number of cultural landmarks.

They include Rome's ancient Pantheon , the entire city of Venice during the peak travel season, and, on a temporary basis, the courtyard in Verona with the balcony associated with Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet".

Michelangelo's "Last Judgment", a Renaissance masterwork in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel that depicts the Second Coming of Jesus, is undergoing its first restoration in 30 years.

Experts will work over three months to remove decades of built-up particles that have obscured the colours of the artwork, the Vatican said in a press release.

"The new intervention... will allow the removal of these deposits and the consequent recovery of the chromatic and luministic quality desired by Michelangelo," it said.

The Sistine Chapel, famous as the site of the secret conclave where the world's Catholic cardinals vote to select new popes , sees millions of visitors each year as part of the Vatican Museums.

The chapel will remain open during the restoration. But the fresco itself, showing Jesus delivering his final judgment of humanity, will be covered by scaffolding.

Visitors will instead be able to see a high-definition reproduction of the artwork, the Vatican said.

The chapel is also home to many other frescoes, including Michelangelo's "The Creation of Adam" on its ceiling. Those will still be on display.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6F4SMTDPNOABOCNUYDXFVNLJE.jpg?auth=3dd80a56484bdb3802d69a59f5cb41732452141be642b11d213e6908ea7f4e3d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S. hospitality space changes name from 'Ice House' to 'Winter House' following protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-hospitality-space-changes-name-ice-house-winter-house-following-protests-2026-02-02/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Olympic officials have changed the name of an athlete hospitality space at the Milano Cortina Games from "Ice House" to "Winter House," a move that comes following protests in Minneapolis over the fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.

The venue has been billed by the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) as an "athlete-first space" where U.S. figure skaters, hockey players, speedskaters and their families can gather in what is normally a boutique-style hotel in the heart of Milan.

"Our hospitality concept was designed to be a private space free of distractions where athletes, their families, and friends can come together to celebrate the unique experience of the Winter Games," U.S. Figure Skating, USA Hockey and US Speedskating said in a joint statement.

"This name captures that vision and connects to the season and the event."

Winter House will host a variety of activities, including meet-and-greets with Olympic champions and legends, medal celebrations, watch parties and sponsored events, according to the USOPC. While not open to the public, NBC will showcase the venue during its coverage.

Thousands of protesters have taken to the streets in Minneapolis and students across the U.S. staged walkouts on Friday to demand the withdrawal of federal immigration agents from Minnesota following the shootings.

Under a national immigration crackdown, President Donald Trump has sent 3,000 federal officers to the Minneapolis area who are patrolling the streets in tactical gear, a force five times the size of the Minneapolis Police Department.

"I think it's wise," U.S. figure skater Amber Glenn told reporters after practice on Monday in Milan.

"It's unfortunate that the term ICE isn't something we can embrace because of what's happening and the implications of what some individuals are doing.

"Unfortunately, in my own country, it is very upsetting and very distressing to see. And I can't imagine how people who have been impacted by that directly feel. So I think it's wise that we change something as minute as a name if it is able to make anyone feel more comfortable."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Truck traffic at Cargill facility in northern Brazil blocked by protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/truck-traffic-cargill-facility-northern-brazil-blocked-by-protesters-2026-02-02/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Protesters have been blocking truck traffic at Cargill's Santarem grain terminal in northern Brazil, according to a company statement in response to Reuters questions on Monday.

Cargill denied any occupation of its facilities by protesters, whom local media identified as Indigenous groups.

Cargill's Santarem terminal handles soybeans and corn. According to the company's website, most of the grain arrives there by barge before being hauled onto ships for export.

A smaller portion of the grain that passes through the terminal arrives by trucks, either directly from the state of Mato Grosso via the BR-163 highway or from local farms.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:01:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SKFCNH6DENL5XINDEIL5PDLKSM.jpg?auth=d8cefc04a768e0e3fea3070b090dab2ee44171e29652bd2c2420904b3aabbf6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gun-wielding IS militants roamed freely on airport tarmac during Niger attack, footage shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/gun-wielding-is-militants-roamed-freely-airport-tarmac-during-niger-attack-2026-02-02/</link><description>DAKAR, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Islamic State militants set off explosions and roamed freely among passenger planes during an attack at Niger's main international airport, according to footage distributed by SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist activity worldwide.

The attack last week has renewed international concern about the security situation in Niger, with Washington ordering non-emergency government employees and their family members to leave the West African country because of safety risks.

It could also further strain regional ties after Niger's military leader Abdourahamane Tiani accused the presidents of Benin and Ivory Coast - as well as France - of sponsoring the attack, without offering evidence.

A Benin government spokesperson denied the allegation, while Ivory Coast summoned the Nigerien ambassador to condemn Tiani's comments.

During the attack at the capital Niamey's airport, claimed by Islamic State's West Africa affiliate on Friday , gunfire and loud explosions echoed around the airport beginning late Wednesday before calm returned on Thursday morning.

In the footage distributed by SITE on Sunday, militants on foot and motorbike fire weapons into the air near parked passenger planes and aircraft hangars, where they set off an explosion near an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and a helicopter that were later shown engulfed in flames.

The video "shows IS militants speaking Kanuri, a language more commonly used in the Lake Chad basin," said Ladd Serwat, senior analyst for Africa at U.S. crisis-monitoring group ACLED.

"While ISSP militants come from diverse areas, this may indicate that more experienced drone operators from Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) supported the attack."

Pan-African carrier ASKY Airlines said two of its aircraft sustained minor damage during the incident while parked on the tarmac. Ivory Coast's national airline Air Cote d'Ivoire said an Airbus A319 was hit, with damage to its fuselage and right wing.

Both companies said no passengers or crew were injured as the incident occurred outside operational hours.

Niger said it killed 20 attackers, including a French national, and injured 11. Islamic State has given no figures.

Niger, like its Sahel neighbours Mali and Burkina Faso, has struggled to contain attacks from jihadist groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands and displaced millions in the three countries.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:02:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IPUE5PAB4FM33CEPA4PDLZNANA.jpg?auth=f5dcc8e89d0afdfd2492dcd0c06a15a8c36a478eb0f34587a2fe58ee9ffc6538&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain performs pioneering face transplant from donor who requested assisted dying</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/spain-performs-pioneering-face-transplant-donor-who-requested-assisted-dying-2026-02-02/</link><description>MADRID, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A hospital in Barcelona said on Monday it had performed a pioneering facial transplant in which the donor, in a world first, had offered her face for donation before undergoing an assisted dying procedure.

The complex surgery involved transplanting composite tissue from the central part of the face and required the participation of around 100 professionals, including psychiatrists and immunologists, the prestigious Vall d'Hebron hospital said in a statement.

The hospital's transplant coordinator, Elisabeth Navas, said the donor had showed "a level of maturity that leaves one speechless".

"Someone who has decided to end their life dedicates one of their last wishes to a stranger and gives them a second chance of this magnitude," Navas said.

The recipient - identified only by her first name Carme - had suffered facial tissue necrosis from a bacterial infection caused by an insect bite, affecting her ability to speak, eat and see.

"When I'm looking in the mirror at home, I'm thinking that I'm starting to look more like myself," Carme told a press conference on Monday, adding her recovery was going very well.

For such cases requiring facial transplants, donor and recipient must share the same sex, blood group and have a similar head size.

With a population of 49.4 million, Spain has been a global leader in organ transplants for more than three decades. In 2021, it became the fourth European Union country to legalise euthanasia.

Half of the six facial transplants ever done in Spain have been performed by Vall d'Hebron staff. The Catalan hospital also carried out the world's first full face transplant back in 2010.

A spokesperson for the hospital declined to say the exact date of the procedure for privacy reasons, but told Reuters it took place during the autumn of 2025.

Some 6,300 organ transplants were performed last year in Spain, according to Health Ministry data, with kidney transplants being the most common.

In 2024, 426 people received assistance in dying, government data shows.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:55:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Can transgender athletes compete at the Milano Cortina Winter Games?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/can-transgender-athletes-compete-milano-cortina-winter-games-2026-02-02/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics opens on Friday, bringing the world's top athletes together in the biggest winter sports show on earth. The Games will be the last one to be held with the existing and fragmented regulations regarding the eligibility of transgender athletes in women's categories.

The International Olympic Committee is expected to shortly issue new and universal guidelines, which it says are designed to protect women's sport.

The issue of transgender athletes at the Olympics and other top sports events has become a controversial issue in recent years due to the lack of clear and universal rules governing sport.

Sporting bodies have had to balance the twin aims of protecting the women's category but also allowing the free participation for all in sports without any discrimination.

Transgender advocacy groups say excluding trans athletes amounts to discrimination.

Critics of transgender inclusion in women's sport say that the process of going through male puberty imbues athletes with a huge musculo-skeletal advantage that transition does not mitigate.

U.S. President Donald Trump last year banned transgender athletes in the country from competing in college and pro events in the female category.

Yes, under existing rules transgender athletes can participate in the summer and winter Olympics once they have been cleared to do so by their respective sports federations. Currently it is up to each sports federation to draw up participation rules for transgender athletes. There is no universal rule governing their participation or eligibility in pro sports.

ARE THERE TRANSGENDER ATHLETES SET TO COMPETE AT THE MILANO-CORTINA 2026 WINTER OLYMPICS.

Yes, transgender athletes are set to compete in Italy's Games, including Elis Lundholm, a Swedish mogul skier. Lundholm was born a female and identifies as a man. The 23-year-old will be competing in the women's category.

Lundholm would still be eligible to compete in the future no matter the restrictions for transgender athletes, as according to the IOC, the Swede's participation is "in accordance with (international skiing federation) FIS eligibility criteria."

"Elis Lundholm competes in the female category, which is aligned with the sex of this athlete," the IOC told Reuters.

No, there is currently no universal rule regarding the participation of transgender athletes in professional or elite sports. The International Olympic Committee long refused to apply any universal rule on transgender participation for the Games.

It instructed international federations in 2021 to come up with their own guidelines.

The IOC's 2021 guidelines on Fairness, Inclusion and Non-Discrimination suggested that federations prioritised the inclusion of gender non-conforming athletes in the category of their choice, while making no presumptions of unfair advantage.

Under new IOC president Kirsty Coventry, however, the Olympic body did a u-turn in 2025 and decided to take the lead in setting eligibility criteria with fairness of competition the foremost consideration.

The IOC has said it will issue its new rules on participation of transgender athletes in the first quarter of 2026. Under rules still in force, transgender athletes are eligible to take part in the Olympics.

Yes, there are several major sports federations that have restricted the participation of transgender athletes in women's competitions.

World Rugby banned transgender athletes from competing at elite level, while World Athletics does not allow transgender athletes who have undergone male puberty to compete.

World Aquatics allows transgender athletes who have transitioned before the age of 12 to compete, but not those who have done so after that age.

The situation remains somewhat murky in soccer, the world's most popular sport, with FIFA yet to announce a long-promised policy update.

Some individual associations, including the English FA, have unilaterally banned transgender players from competing in women's competitions.

In 2025, boxing and athletics introduced mandatory tests for athletes in the female category to detect the SRY gene, which is on the Y chromosome and triggers the development of male characteristics in mammals.

U.S. President Trump has banned transgender athletes from competing in women's sports in schools in the United States.

Trump, who signed the "Keeping Men Out of Women's Sports" order in February 2025, has said he would not allow transgender athletes to compete at the 2028 Los Angeles Summer Olympics.

Following Trump's decision, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee also changed its rules accordingly, banning transgender athletes from taking part in women's sports.

Yes, a small number of openly transgender athletes have taken part in past editions of the Olympic Games. New Zealand's Laurel Hubbard became the first openly transgender athlete to compete in a different gender category to that assigned at birth when the weightlifter took part in the women's weightlifting competition at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:56:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZCUU26Z77RJPBKPZMNC7IWIYW4.jpg?auth=b0ce07719dce3ccdd85b54e43fa2030e44f370d971adc216f707cf083061a307&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fire breaks out in Karachi building near site of recent blaze, provincial spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/fire-breaks-out-karachi-building-near-site-recent-blaze-provincial-spokesperson-2026-02-02/</link><description>KARACHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - A fire broke out in a commercial building in Pakistan's Karachi on Monday, close to the site where a deadly fire killed dozens of people last month, a provincial government spokesman said.

The claim by the group Boervolk of the Orange Free State to land in KwaZulu-Natal province near the border with Lesotho was published in the government gazette last week, invoking a U.N. resolution granting independence to colonial states.

The group said it was taking its cue from Trump questioning whether Denmark's colonisation of Greenland gives it the right to own the Arctic island.

A spokesperson for the group did not respond to several emailed requests for comment. A spokesperson for South Africa's land reform department did not respond to a request for comment.

The government has let one white separatist group, Orania , set up a small community on the Orange River, but it would be unlikely to accept the Boervolk of the Orange Free State's claim.

Boervolk of the Orange Free State is one of several small separatist groups representing Afrikaners - descendents of mostly Dutch settlers who arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in the 17th century and spread inland.

The land it claims was acquired by Afrikaners from the Zulu king they backed in an 1840 succession war against his brother, but Britain took it by force in the second Anglo-Boer war at the turn of the 20th century and incorporated it into South Africa.

Much of the land settled by Afrikaners was seized from Black Africans in skirmishes, and as a result Afrikaners still own most of South Africa's privately owned land. Very few Afrikaners and other white nationalists have sought to break away.

Boervolk of the Orange Free State said ownership of the land in Kwazulu-Natal came from "willing buyer and seller agreements" with Zulu kings Dingaan and Mpande.

"Britain never owned (the land) ... and couldn't legally give it to the Union of South Africa in 1910," it said.

Therefore, it said, the land did not legally belong to South Africa's Black majority government, which took power after ending Afrikaner nationalist apartheid in 1994.

Zulu king Dingaan granted land to Afrikaners in 1837, but historians say the Zulus did not have the same Western concept of land ownership.

Dingaan killed some Afrikaners during a feast the following year and the settlers responded by backing his brother Mpande's revolt, declaring Mpande king when the war ended.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:57:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy says dignified, lasting peace realistic, ahead of talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-says-dignified-lasting-peace-realistic-ahead-talks-2026-02-02/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that it was realistic to achieve a dignified and lasting peace, ahead of the next round of peace talks with Russian and U.S. officials due this week in Abu Dhabi.

"We consider the bilateral security guarantees document with the United States to be complete, and we anticipate further substantive work on documents related to recovery and economic development," Zelenskiy said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:57:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GQMVCVEBWBJJFOK3I5BQYA4TDY.jpg?auth=ca880cc98de003cd2d075aa4259df95fd7c243c7d1f254c2c5d7bb6123b2bea7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Witkoff, Iran's Araqchi to discuss possible nuclear deal on Friday, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/witkoff-irans-araqchi-discuss-possible-nuclear-deal-friday-us-official-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi plan to meet on Friday in Istanbul to discuss a possible nuclear deal and other issues, a U.S. official said on Monday.

"The president's been calling for them to make a deal. The meeting is to hear what they have to say," the official said.

An Iranian foreign ministry official earlier said Tehran was weighing the terms for resuming talks with the United States soon, after both sides signaled readiness to revive diplomacy over a long-running nuclear dispute and dispel fears of a new regional war.

Trump intensified calls for ‍US control over Greenland at the start of the year, citing national security concerns related to Russia and China . Some European ​NATO allies have defended Denmark’s sovereignty over Greenland and said Trump’s pressure threatened to ​fracture the NATO alliance.

The US president has since backed away from threats of force and said he had secured total US access to Greenland in a NATO deal, though details remain unclear.

“The view upon Greenland and the population has not changed: Greenland is to be tied to the US and governed from there,” Nielsen said in a speech to the island’s parliament in ‍Nuuk, speaking via a translator.

Nielsen said the US continues seeking “paths to ownership and control over Greenland”.

The island’s government said last week ​it had launched a survey of the population’s mental health situation at a time of extraordinary pressure.

“Some of our compatriots have severe sleep problems, children feel the worry and anxiety ‌of adults, and we all live with constant uncertainty about what may happen tomorrow,” Nielsen said. “We want to say it very clearly: This is completely unacceptable”.

Diplomatic talks between the US, Denmark and Greenland began last week with senior officials meeting to “discuss how we can address American concerns about security in the Arctic while respecting the Kingdom’s red lines”, Denmark’s foreign ministry said.

Nielsen also praised Denmark as a close partner throughout the crisis.

He has previously stated that if Greenlanders were forced to choose between the US and Denmark, they would choose Denmark. The ‍speech made no mention of independence for Greenland.

For Greenland’s Inuit native population, the debate over ownership clashes with cultural values. Under ‌Greenlandic law, people ​can own houses but not the land beneath them, reflecting the Inuit concept of collective land stewardship.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:58:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2a638d52-f7ad-11f0-8a14-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020618890978.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway’s royal crisis: Crown princess faces Epstein scrutiny ahead of son’s rape trail</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260202-norway-royal-crisis-crown-princess-faces-epstein-scrutiny-ahead-of-son-rape-trail</link><description>The scandals involving Norway’s royal household just keep on piling up.

On Sunday, Marius Borg Hoiby, the eldest son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit , was arrested, accused of assault, threats with a knife and violation of a restraining order, police said in a statement. Police requested four weeks’ detention on grounds of risk of reoffending. His lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.

On Tuesday, Hoiby is due to go on trial at the Oslo district court. The indictment includes 38 counts, including rape, abuse in a close relationship against one former partner, acts of violence against another and transporting 3.5 kilograms of marijuana. Other charges include making death threats and traffic violations.

Hoiby has been under scrutiny since he was repeatedly arrested in 2024 on various allegations of wrongdoing. He was indicted in August, but had been free pending trial until Sunday.

Hoiby is the son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit from a previous relationship and stepson of the heir to the throne, Crown Prince Haakon . He has no royal title or official duties.

The indictment centres on four alleged rapes between 2018 and November 2024; alleged violence and threats against a former partner between the summer of 2022 and the fall of 2023; and two alleged acts of violence against a subsequent partner, along with violations of a restraining order.

Hoiby’s defence team has said that he “denies all charges of sexual abuse, as well as the majority of the charges regarding violence”.

Haakon said last week that he and Mette-Marit do not plan to attend court and that the royal house doesn’t intend to comment during the proceedings.

He emphasised that Hoiby is not part of the royal house and that, as a citizen of Norway, he has the same responsibilities and rights as all others. He said that he is confident that all concerned will make the trial as orderly, proper and fair as possible.

While the royals are generally popular in Norway, the Hoiby case has cast a shadow on their image. And the trial is opening just as his mother faces renewed scrutiny over her contacts with Jeffrey Epstein .

Friday’s release of the latest batch of documents from the Epstein files shone an unflattering spotlight on Mette-Marit. They contained several hundred mentions of the crown princess, who already said in 2019 that she regretted having had contact with Epstein, Norwegian media reported.

The newly released documents, which include email exchanges with Epstein, showed that Mette-Marit borrowed a property of Epstein’s in Palm Beach, Florida, for several days in early 2013, and the royal house confirmed that she did so through a mutual friend, broadcaster NRK reported.

In a statement emailed by the royal house, Mette-Marit said that she “must take responsibility for not having investigated Epstein’s background more thoroughly, and for not realising sooner what kind of person he was”.

“I deeply regret this, and it is a responsibility I must bear. I showed poor judgment and regret having had any contact with Epstein at all,” she said. “It is simply embarrassing.”

She expressed her “deep sympathy and solidarity” with the victims of Epstein’s abuse.

Over the weekend, Kjetil B Alstadheim, a political reporter for one of Norway’s biggest newspapers Aftenposten , described the scandal as “a direct threat against the [royal] institution itself”.

Depending on how she and the royal household handle the matter “could prove decisive for whether Mette-Marit ever becomes queen”, he wrote.

Mette-Marit’s contacts with Epstein and the Hoiby trial are not the only source of negative publicity for Norway’s royals. The business ventures of Haakon’s sister, Princess Martha Louise, have drawn repeated criticism. In 2024, around the same time Hoiby’s case was making news, she married an American self-professed shaman, Durek Verrett.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 16:58:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d1333426-004e-11f1-98ab-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033497287150.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Iran fears US strike may reignite protests, imperil rule, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-fears-us-strike-may-reignite-protests-imperil-rule-sources-say-2026-02-02/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, following a bloody crackdown on anti-government protests, according to six current and former officials.

In high-level meetings, officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown -- the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

The officials said Khamenei was told that many Iranians were prepared to confront security forces again and that external pressure such as a limited U.S. strike could embolden them and inflict irreparable damage to the political establishment.

One of the officials told Reuters that Iran's enemies were seeking more protests so as to bring the Islamic Republic to an end, and "unfortunately" there would be more violence if an uprising took place.

"An attack combined with demonstrations by angry people could lead to a collapse (of the ruling system). That is the main concern among the top officials and that is what our enemies want," said the official, who like the other officials contacted for this story declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The reported remarks are significant because they suggest private misgivings inside the leadership at odds with Tehran’s defiant public stance towards the protesters and the U.S.

The sources declined to say how Khamenei responded. Iran's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on this account of the meetings.

Multiple sources told Reuters last week that U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.

Any such uprising in the wake of a U.S. strike would stand in contrast to Iranians' response to Israeli and U.S. bombing attacks on Iran's nuclear program back in June, which was not followed by anti-government demonstrations.

But a former senior moderate official said the situation had changed since the crackdown in early January.

"People are extremely angry," he said, adding a U.S. attack could lead Iranians to rise up again. "The wall of fear has collapsed. There is no fear left."

Tensions between Tehran and Washington are running high. The arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East has expanded Trump's ability to take military action if he so wishes, after repeatedly threatening intervention over Iran's bloody crackdown.

Several opposition figures, who were part of the establishment before falling out with it, have warned the leadership that "boiling public anger" could result in a collapse of the Islamic system.

"The river of warm blood that was spilled on the cold month of January will not stop boiling until it changes the course of history," former prime minister Mirhossein Mousavi, who has been under house arrest without trial since 2011, said in a statement published by the pro-reform Kalameh website.

"In what language should people say they do not want this system and do not believe your lies? Enough is enough. The game is over'," Mousavi added in the statement.

During the early January protests, witnesses and rights groups said, security forces crushed demonstrations with lethal force, leaving thousands killed and many wounded. Tehran blamed the violence on "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the U.S.

Trump stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene but he has since demanded Iran make nuclear concessions. Both Tehran and Washington have signalled readiness to revive diplomacy over a long-running nuclear dispute.

Analysts and insiders say that while the streets are quiet for now, deep-seated grievances have not gone away.

Public frustration has been simmering over economic decline, political repression, a widening gulf between rich and poor, and entrenched corruption that leaves many Iranians feeling trapped in a system offering neither relief nor a path forward.

"This may not be the end, but it is no longer just the beginning," said Hossein Rassam, a London-based analyst.

If protests resume during mounting foreign pressure and security forces respond with force, the six current and former officials said they fear demonstrators would be bolder than in previous unrest, emboldened by experience and driven by a sense that they have little left to lose.

One of the officials told Reuters that while people were angrier than before, the establishment would use harsher methods against protesters if it was under U.S. attack. He said the result would be a bloodbath.

Ordinary Iranians contacted by Reuters said they expected Iran's rulers to crack down hard on any further protests.

A Tehran resident whose 15-year-old son was killed in the protests on January 9 said the demonstrators had merely sought a normal life, and had been answered "with bullets.”

"If America attacks, I will go back to the streets to take revenge for my son and the children this regime killed.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:39:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6TV3JFRN7VMPXKTFZPA2GBC5AQ.jpg?auth=ffd7fa1817e2aaefbef53210f3f379cac1c890045b369c14966d76a12cde7eb4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodian scam compound yields trove of fraud evidence, Thai military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/cambodian-scam-compound-yields-trove-fraud-evidence-thai-military-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>CHONG CHOM, Thailand/ODDAR MEANCHEY, Cambodia, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The Thai military said on Monday it had recovered a trove of evidence of transnational fraud from a Cambodian scam compound seized during clashes last year between the two countries along their disputed border .

Briefing reporters and foreign delegates in Surin province, senior Thai military officials said the O’Smach complex had housed thousands of people, many of them victims of human trafficking who were forced to scam strangers or face punishment.

Soldiers later showed reporters around one of several buildings in the complex that were bombed and occupied by the Thai military late last year. The six‑storey building was strewn with documents, including long lists of what appeared to be potential targets and their contact details, as well as scripts for scam dialogues.

O'Smach has previously been named as a base for scam operations including by the United States, which cited trafficking and forced criminality.

“The reason we are showing this place today is that we want the world to see how it’s being used as a criminal base against humanity,” Lieutenant General Teeranan Nandhakwang, director‑general of the Royal Thai Army’s Directorate of Intelligence, told reporters.

Touch Sokhak, a spokesperson for Cambodia’s interior ministry, told Reuters Thailand had used scam centres as a pretext for military attacks. He said Cambodia was carrying out a crackdown on scams and had pledged to eradicate the illicit industry before April.

Thailand and Cambodia ended weeks of fierce border clashes in late December with a ceasefire — the second in recent months — that halted the worst fighting in years between the Southeast Asian neighbours.

During the clashes the Thai military struck several casino complexes it alleged were scam compounds, saying they were also used to store weapons and launch attacks.

Parts of Southeast Asia, including border areas between Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia, have become hubs for online fraud in recent years, generating billions of dollars annually.

Among the items seized at O’Smach were 871 SIM cards enabling anonymous international communication, dozens of smartphones, counterfeit police insignia and police uniforms, the Thai military said.

Reporters visiting the complex also saw several rooms set up to resemble police offices from different countries, including Brazil, China and Australia.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W6YXLYNGPZONRIUUIUOXGLPBZI.jpg?auth=666680b612d48c04e865b7aa116e49d7ceed20ae7b12f76d90b1a9a376cfe7d3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal counts multi‑billion‑euro damage after Storm Kristin tears off roofs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/portugal-counts-multibillioneuro-damage-after-storm-kristin-tears-off-roofs-2026-02-02/</link><description>LISBON/LEIRIA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Last week's Storm Kristin left hundreds of homes in central Portugal without roofs, tens of thousands without power and residents lining up for emergency building materials, as authorities warned damage could run into billions of euros.

The storm swept across the region early on Wednesday, with wind gusts topping 200 kph (124 mph) and heavy rain uprooting trees and ripping off roofs. It killed at least six people and cut power to hundreds of thousands of households.

"The roof blew off, all the windowpanes are broken, everything is chaos and misery," said Paula Franco as she queued in Leiria for donated tiles to repair her home.

Portugal's government on Sunday approved a 2.5 billion-euro ($2.95 billion) package of loans and incentives to help people and businesses rebuild after the storm.

The government could apply for grants from the European Solidarity Fund and unused EU recovery funds to finance reconstruction, Environment and Energy Minister Maria da Graca Carvalho said on Monday at a joint news conference with EU Energy Commissioner Dan Jorgensen.

Leiria, one of Portugal’s main industrial hubs known for its plastics and metalworking industries, was among the hardest-hit areas.

Hundreds of houses, several roads, schools, factories and railway lines have been affected. At the Monte Real air base near Leiria, the storm damaged several aircraft, including F16 fighter jets.

Nearly 170,000 households were still without electricity on Monday, Graca Carvalho said.

Damage in the region could total between 1.5 billion euros and 2 billion euros, Henrique Carvalho, president of the Leiria Business Association, told broadcaster NOW.

The government on Sunday extended a state of calamity in 69 municipalities until February 8, with more heavy rain and flooding expected.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T62WBCAY4RLFLHA4YBIHL3NU74.jpg?auth=c20df4070a44739379df25ec77a532c590d8574522441d87d81e01c5f3fb30ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria police says 80 abducted congregants return home, Christian group disputes claim</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-police-says-80-abducted-congregants-return-home-christian-group-disputes-2026-02-02/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Feb 2 (Reuters) - At least 80 congregants earlier believed to have been abducted by gunmen from three churches in northern Nigeria last month have returned home, police said on Monday, a claim immediately disputed by the Christian Association of Nigeria.

Gunmen stormed the churches in Kaduna state on January 18 and seized 177 worshippers, disappearing with them into nearby forests, according to CAN. Eleven people later escaped, leaving 166 missing, the group said.

Kaduna police spokesperson Mansur Hassan said fresh inquiries showed 80 of those reported missing had fled to nearby villages during the attack and only returned to their homes in Kurmin Wali over the weekend when they felt safe.

“Currently, we have invited all of these individuals to the Kaduna State Police Headquarters for verification of their identities, screening and health assessments,” Hassan told Reuters by phone.

Police initially denied the kidnapping before acknowledging the incident and saying security forces were searching for the missing.

However, CAN’s Kaduna state chairman, Reverend Caleb Maaji, said he had no information about any returnees.

“Based on the information available to me, the number of those kidnapped remains 177, except for the 11 who escaped and are receiving care in the hospital,” he said.

The police and CAN often offer different figures and accounts on church kidnappings.

Kidnapping for ransom is widespread in northern Nigeria, where armed gangs frequently attack villages, schools and motorists.

The assault on the Kaduna churches is among the latest in a string of mass abductions that has intensified pressure on the Nigerian government. Nigeria has also faced scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused the country of persecuting Christians — allegations the Nigerian government denies.

Authorities say they are working to curb Islamist insurgents and other armed groups who have targeted both Christian and Muslim civilians, often for ransom.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MQLWRRXWVBLORAKUJMNK5EFSOA.jpg?auth=33bed03bd47566d40475d50ceb3a6656dd654fc1e23b06739dc89f5037747ed8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Morocco evacuates 50,000 as flooding threatens city after weeks of heavy rain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/morocco-evacuates-50000-flooding-threatens-city-after-weeks-heavy-rain-2026-02-02/</link><description>RABAT, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Morocco has evacuated more than 50,000 people, nearly half the population of the northwestern city of Ksar el-Kebir, as flooding driven by weeks of heavy rain threatened to inundate the city, state media said on Monday.

"The city has become a ghost town," local resident Hicham Ajttou told Reuters by phone. "All markets and shops are closed and most residents have either left voluntarily or been evacuated."

Authorities set up shelters and temporary camps and barred entry into Ksar el-Kebir as rising water levels in the Loukkos River spread across several neighbourhoods. Only departures from the city were permitted, while electricity was cut in parts of it and schools were ordered to remain closed until Saturday.

Officials said the floods were partly triggered by water released from the nearby Oued Makhazine dam, which had reached full capacity. Ksar el-Kebir lies about 190 km (120 miles) north of Rabat.

Ajttou said he moved his family to Tangier last week and returned to Ksar el-Kebir to volunteer in relief efforts.

"The question that worries us is what comes next. The dam is full and we don't know how long this situation will last," he said.

The army has deployed rescue units, trucks, equipment and medics to support evacuation and rescue operations and buses evacuated people from the city.

State TV Al Oula showed a helicopter rescuing four people trapped by rising waters in Oued Ouargha in the nearby province of Ouezzane.

Further south, rising levels of the Sebou River prompted authorities to evacuate several villagers in Sidi Kacem and reinforce riverbanks with sandbags and barriers.

The heavy rainfall has brought an end to a seven‑year drought that pushed Morocco to invest heavily in desalination plants. The national dam-filling rate is now close to 62%, with several major reservoirs reaching full capacity, according to official data.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 17:40:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital sovereignty (1/3): Have Trump’s threats spurred a European awakening?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260202-digital-sovereignty-have-trump-threats-spurred-european-awakening</link><description>Out go Teams, Zoom and Google Meet. In comes Visio.

The French administration is preparing to ditch popular US videoconferencing tools in favour of a homegrown equivalent starting in 2027, a move it says will ensure critical data and infrastructure remains in French hands .

The aim, says David Amiel, the junior minister for the civil service and state reform, is to “end the use of non-European solutions and guarantee the security and confidentiality of electronic communications by relying on a powerful and sovereign tool”.

Visio is part of a batch of French tech alternatives, called LaSuite, specifically developed for French officials and millions of public-sector workers.

News of its impending launch comes at a time of increasingly urgent debate about the continent’s reliance on US Big Tech , which dominated discussions at the European Digital Sovereignty Summit in Berlin last November.

The sudden sense of urgency is a direct consequence of US President Donald Trump’s aggressive rhetoric towards European allies and his open threats to seize the Danish territory of Greenland .

While talk of technological ‘decoupling’ from the US is hardly new , the prospect of Washington slapping sanctions on Europe or cutting access to key technologies has dramatically altered the equation, says Francesca Musiani, head of the Internet and Society Centre at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

“The urgency stems from the fact that geopolitical tensions, for instance over Greenland, can rapidly escalate and push the US to take advantage of Europe’s technological reliance, which has been built up over decades,” Musiani explains.

“US threats may have sounded like banter in the past, but Europeans have now realised, particularly with what happened in Venezuela, that Trump is entirely serious when he issues such warnings,” adds Christophe Grosbost, chief strategy officer at the Innovation Makers Alliance.

Should Trump follow through on his threats and ask the likes of Meta , Google and Amazon to “completely cut off European access to their services, our societies and economies would be completely disrupted,” Grosbost warns. “It would be disastrous.”

Such a step would be especially damaging to governments in Europe.

“Technological reliance is most critical for public institutions because they handle sensitive data, perform sovereign functions and have an obligation to maintain continuity of service,” says Musiani, whose research has focused on matters of digital sovereignty.

Given that most administrations process documents using Microsoft software and then store the data on servers hosted by US-based tech giants, any shift to homegrown systems must be undertaken with caution – barring which ordinary citizens will be the first affected.

In Germany’s Schleswig-Holstein, “the local government recently decided to switch from Microsoft to open software (to signal their distrust of the US) – and clearly it was a bloody mess”, notes Jochim Selzer, a “digital self-defence" spokesperson for the Chaos Computer Club, Europe's oldest and largest “hacktivist” group.

A month after severing all ties with the US behemoth, the authorities in the northern German state are still busy fixing the remaining bugs.

Such difficulties largely explain the prevailing “administrative and political inertia” when it comes to ditching American tech, says Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of Swiss-based technology consulting firm UBCOM and an advocate of technological independence.

This inertia can have knock-on effects. “The problem with state institutions is that their reliance affects the entire ecosystem. Once the administration uses a tool, it indirectly imposes it on its partners, service providers and citizens,” says Musiani.

European governments thus play into the hands of American Big Tech companies, allowing them to cement their hold on the digital daily lives of all public and private actors. This in turn lends more credibility to Trump’s threats to pull the plug on Europe, adds Musiani, for whom “the example must come from above”.

But is banning Teams or Slack from French government agencies enough?

Musiani describes the move as “symbolic” but a “big step” nonetheless, noting that “the discourse on digital sovereignty has struggled to materialise until now”. She adds: “At the very least, it signals a desire to reduce exposure to the American ecosystem as soon as a European alternative, however imperfect, becomes available.”

Whether the shift to Visio reflects a long-term commitment to greater autonomy, or merely an opportunistic PR move, remains to be seen.

A key obstacle is “the enduring attachment to Atlanticist policies, both in France and at the European level”, says Imbert-Vier, who is sceptical of any long-term European desire to tackle the continent’s cushy digital reliance on US systems.

While the Trump administration once championed “alternative facts”, America's Big Tech firms are no fans of alternatives to their tools and platforms. Competitors are required to fend off accusations of monopoly, but they remain largely invisible, crushed by “the massive marketing budgets that tech giants have been showering on the public for decades”, says Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank.

Yet there is a world beyond Gmail, Word, X, Chrome and Apple. Europe, in particular, is home to “many small companies with very interesting ideas and products that are sometimes of better quality than their American equivalents”, argues Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and a key advocate of European technological independence.

The hard part is often finding them. Who, for example, has ever heard of Olvid, a French alternative to WhatsApp and text messaging?

France’s Emmanuel Macron has sought to set an example with his “start-up nation” slogan. His government has developed a whole batch of homegrown digital tools to escape American control, aiming to replace Teams with “Visio”, Google Drive with “Files”, and WeTransfer with “FranceTransfer”.

With strained EU-US relations leading to renewed interest in technological sovereignty, some experts in the field have posted catalogues of alternative solutions online.

For each American software programme, Austrian IT developer Constantin Graf has compiled an almost exhaustive list of European alternatives. The ambitious German project Digital Independence Day is less exhaustive but more educational. Its website offers step-by-step instructions on how to switch, for instance, from PayPal to Wero, a European mobile payment system.

Ultimately, “it’s the money that speaks”, adds Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Resilience and Technological Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, highlighting the crucial role of public procurement in providing the basis for digital sovereignty.

“It’s public contracts that make the difference,” he explains. “Nobody ever got fired for procuring Microsoft solutions (...). But if we say this is about safeguarding European democracies, perhaps we’ll be willing to bear the short-term consequences (of shifting to homegrown solutions).”

Grasping the stakes is especially important for digital infrastructure and cloud services, which “needs to be considered a critical asset of society that must continue to function in a state of crisis, like roads, railways and energy grids”, says Johan Linaker, an expert on digital sovereignty at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE).

As Europe gradually awakes to the challenge, Big Tech firms across the Atlantic have sensed the tide turning – and started to offer so-called ‘sovereign’ solutions. Earlier this month, Amazon launched its European Sovereign Cloud, which it claims is “entirely located within the EU”.

Critics, however, have been quick to warn against a “Euro-washing” of American cloud services. As Hullin notes, the data would still belong to a US company, which is liable to comply with US government orders.

The FBI raided the facility outside Atlanta, pursuing Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread voting fraud. Claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard met some of the FBI agents of the bureau's field office in Atlanta a day after the search. During the meeting, she used her cellphone to call Trump, the newspaper reported.

Trump addressed the agents on speakerphone, asked them questions, and praised and thanked them for their work on the inquiry, it added.

Critics have denounced the Georgia investigation as politically motivated. They say the Justice Department requires an unusual amount of independence because it is responsible for administering justice in a non-partisan fashion.

The raid was the latest in a string of actions by Trump's administration to use the Justice Department against his perceived enemies or to intervene in cases where he believes he was treated unfairly.

"DNI Gabbard and FBI Director (Kash) Patel are working together to implement the president's election integrity priorities, and their work continues to serve him and the entire country well," White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement.

The FBI declined to comment. The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 18:44:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZHX5EFJMFZNKRAXP2GJPM5QDUM.jpg?auth=0ff84168b5b43f0dc4b8fc6449708abc058624086d26ca085a86e77dce9aa757&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chile’s president officially backs predecessor Bachelet in race to become UN’s first female chief</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260202-chile-s-president-officially-backs-predecessor-bachelet-in-race-to-become-un-s-first-female-boss</link><description>Chile has officially backed the candidacy of its former president Michelle Bachelet to become the UN 's first female secretary-general, with backing from Mexico and Brazil.

Outgoing President Gabriel Boric made the announcement Monday following concerns that Bachelet's bid could be blocked by right-winger Jose Antonio Kast, due to take over the Chilean presidency next month.

Bachelet, 74, has been a trailblazer for Latin America : the first woman to serve as defense minister and the first female elected as the Chilean president, serving two terms from 2006 to 2010 and 2014-18.

She has also served as the UN high commissioner for Human Rights and the first head of the then-newly created UN Women agency.

Last year, she was nominated for the UN's top job by Boric, and later met Kast to seek his backing.

After that meeting, in December, Bachelet told AFP "the world is ready" for a woman to take over and make "a different contribution through a different kind of leadership".

The UN, which turns 81 years old this year, has never had a woman at the helm and only one Latin American – Peruvian diplomat Javier Perez de Cuellar who served as secretary-general from 1982 to 1991.

The post traditionally rotates between world regions, with Latin America next in line as Portuguese Antonio Guterres 's term comes to an end.

"President Bachelet's candidacy, which has already been registered with the United Nations, will be presented jointly with our sister countries Brazil and Mexico," Boric told reporters on Monday.

Three other women from Latin America and the Caribbean are in the running for the UN top job: Costa Rican Rebeca Grynspan, secretary-general of the UN Conference on Trade and Development; Mexican Environment Minister Alicia Barcena; and Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley.

The other candidate is International Atomic Energy Agency chief Rafael Grossi from Argentina.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 18:45:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/87146f3a-004a-11f1-83fc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/6889262bb19d7904db5d8d7789e7167e9dc7a02c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to cut tariffs on India to 18%, India agrees to end Russian oil purchases</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trump-says-agreed-trade-deal-with-india-2026-02-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON/NEW DELHI, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday announced a trade deal with India that slashes U.S. tariffs on Indian goods to 18% from 50% in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.

Trump announced the deal on social media following a call with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, noting that India would now buy oil from the U.S. and potentially Venezuela.

A White House official told Reuters that the U.S. was rescinding a punitive 25% duty on all imports from India over its purchases of Russian oil that had stacked on top of a 25% "reciprocal" tariff rate.

U.S.-listed shares of major Indian companies rallied on the news. IT consulting firm Infosys closed 4.3% higher, consultancy Wipro rose 6.8%, HDFC Bank gained 4.4% and the iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund rallied 3%.

Trump's announcement added to positive sentiment over semiconductor makers and artificial intelligence, lifting major indexes into positive territory on the day.

Modi also committed India to "BUY AMERICAN at a much higher level," in addition to buying more than $500 billion worth of U.S. energy, including coal, along with technology, agricultural and other products, Trump added.

"They will likewise move forward to reduce their Tariffs and Non Tariff Barriers against the United States, to ZERO," Trump said of India.

Until Trump returned to office and raised U.S. tariff rates to double-digit levels last year, India had some of the world's highest tariffs, with a simple applied rate of 15.6% and an effective applied tariff of 8.2%, according to World Trade Organization data.

Trump's Truth Social message provided few details, including on the start date for the lower tariff rates, the deadline for India to end Russian oil purchases, trade barrier reductions and which U.S. products India had committed to purchasing.

As of late Monday afternoon, the White House had not issued a presidential proclamation nor a Federal Register notice required to make the changes official.

A White House spokesperson offered no further details, while India's commerce and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests sent after working hours. Russia's embassy in Washington also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Previous trade deals with other major Asian trading partners including Japan and South Korea have included commitments to invest hundreds of billions of dollars into U.S. industries, but the India announcement did not mention any specific investments.

The deal brings India "broadly in line with its Asian peers on tariff rates" of 15% to 19%, said Madhavi Arora, economist at Emkay Global, adding that it would eliminate a disproportionate drag on India's exports and its rupee currency.

Indian markets had been battered since the tariffs were levied by Washington, making it the worst-performing market among emerging nations in 2025, with record outflows of foreign investors.

U.S. business groups reacted with caution and criticism. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which has long advocated a market-opening trade deal with India, called Trump's announcement progress towards that goal.

"We are optimistic that this is the first step toward a comprehensive trade agreement that will unlock even more private sector collaboration, and we look forward to reviewing the details of the deal," Chamber CEO Suzanne Clark said in a statement.

A coalition of more than 800 small businesses called "We Pay the Tariffs" urged Americans not to celebrate the deal, which it called a "600% tax increase on American businesses compared to 2024." The group noted that U.S. tariffs on Indian imports were about 2% to 3% at that time but would now be 18% and could go higher if India does not fully wean itself off Russian oil.

"Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18%," Modi said in a social media post on X. "Big thanks to President Trump on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement."

India's Trade Minister Piyush Goyal said the deal would draw the U.S. and Indian economies closer together.

"This agreement unlocks unprecedented opportunities for farmers, MSMEs, entrepreneurs, and skilled workers to Make in India for the world, Design in India for the world, and Innovate in India for the world. It will help India get technology from the U.S.," Goyal said in a post on X.

The deal comes less than a week after India signed a long-awaited trade deal with the European Union that is expected to eliminate or reduce tariffs on 96.6% of traded goods by value. That deal excludes EU soybeans, beef, sugar, rice and dairy from tariff reductions.

The Trump administration has been racing to complete framework trade deals with major trading partners before the U.S. Supreme Court rules on whether to strike down Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act.

Trump administration officials reached a deal with Taiwan last month and say such agreements are expected to continue no matter what the court rules, as they will reimpose tariffs under other authorities.

On Saturday, Trump teased a potential deal for India to buy Venezuelan oil after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a military raid in early January.

The deal followed months of tense trade negotiations between the world's two largest democracies.

Last August, Trump doubled duties on imports from India to 50% to pressure New Delhi to stop buying Russian oil, and earlier this month said the rate could rise again if it did not curb its purchases.

Purchases of Venezuelan oil would help replace some of the Russian oil bought by India, the world's third-biggest oil importer.

India relies heavily on oil imports, covering around 90% of its needs, and importing cheaper Russian oil has helped lower its import costs since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022 and Western nations enacted sanctions on its energy exports.

Recently India has begun to slow its purchases from Russia. In January, they were around 1.2 million barrels per day, and are projected to decline to about 1 million bpd in February and 800,000 bpd in March, according to a Reuters report.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XIVNT4NKZNJLRN7C7VY36JGZHA.jpg?auth=158928fdd06703dc1deeb106d1ab8673a04d9fe7af310f5b32b57f4e3cde7286&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba in communication with US, Cuban diplomat says, as Trump tightens screws</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-communication-with-us-cuban-diplomat-says-trump-tightens-screws-2026-02-02/</link><description>HAVANA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Cuba and the United States are in communication, a Cuban diplomat told Reuters on Monday, although he said the exchanges have not yet evolved into a formal "dialogue."

Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, Cuba's deputy foreign minister, told Reuters the U.S. government was aware that Cuba was "ready to have a serious, meaningful and responsible dialogue."

"We have had exchange of messages, we have embassies, we have had communications, but we can not say we have had a table of dialogue," de Cossio told Reuters in an interview at the Foreign Ministry building in Havana.

De Cossio's statements on Monday represent the first hint from Cuba that the two sides are in conversation, even if in a limited fashion, after tensions flared earlier this month between the two countries following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, long a close ally of Cuba.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday said the United States had begun talks with "the highest people in Cuba," days after declaring Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and threatening tariffs on any nation that sends oil to the communist-run island.

"I think we're going to make a deal with Cuba," Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida on Sunday.

Cuba had previously denied any talks with the United States.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GNFEZOLAANOKZJ3RXWCXUOKHZQ.jpg?auth=4704c84a3386dd1207af0112c6f4f74eb86d8a8943e096189535ef0023e22eff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela says interim president met with U.S. envoy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-says-interim-president-met-with-us-envoy-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government said on Monday that interim President Delcy Rodriguez met with U.S. envoy Laura Dogu, as the two countries gradually resume bilateral relations

The government said in a statement that the meeting took place at the Miraflores presidential palace to discuss "the work agenda between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and the United States."

Rodriguez's brother, head of the national assembly legislature Jorge Rodriguez, attended the meeting, it added, as did Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, with whom Dogu met over the weekend following her arrival in Caracas .

“The governments of Venezuela and the United States have set out to advance on a roadmap to address matters of bilateral interest, through diplomatic dialogue and on the basis of mutual respect and international law,” the statement added.

After months of heightened tensions, the U.S. captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro a month ago, setting off a chain of changes in the country, including the swearing in of Rodriguez, the passage of a reform to its flagship oil law and the release of some political prisoners. Rodriguez has said she is seeking with the U.S., while Trump has said the relationship with the interim government is going well.

The two countries have to export up to $2 billion worth of Venezuelan crude to the United States, and on Friday Rodriguez announced a proposed "amnesty law" for hundreds of prisoners in the country, a move long demanded by the opposition and human rights groups.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WKYX2WNB25OOLDDBVKNQ35R6L4.jpg?auth=e6d37dad87f7e87879d68f0ac9894c08444186c0e35ea68c31f593bb5598bf61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says talks with Iran ongoing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-talks-with-iran-ongoing-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that talks with Iran were ongoing amid high tensions.

The ministry's comment, one of many it said were in response to questions put to Lavrov, also praised U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts at working for a resolution of the war and said he understood the fundamental reasons behind the conflict.

"The deployment of military units, facilities, warehouses, and other infrastructure of Western countries in Ukraine is unacceptable to us and will be regarded as foreign intervention posing a direct threat to Russia's security," the ministry said on its website.

It said Western countries - which have discussed a possible deployment to Ukraine to help secure any peace deal - had to understand "that all foreign military contingents, including German ones, if deployed in Ukraine, will become legitimate targets for the Russian Armed Forces".

The United States has spearheaded efforts to hold talks aimed at ending the conflict in Ukraine and a second three-sided meeting with Russian and Ukrainian representatives is to take place this week in the United Arab Emirates.

The issue of ceding internationally recognised Ukrainian territory to Russia remains a major stumbling block. Kyiv rejects Russian calls for it to give up all of its Donbas region, including territory Moscow's forces have not captured.

Moscow has repeatedly said it will not tolerate the presence in Ukraine of troops from Western countries.

The ministry said Moscow valued the "purposeful efforts" of the Trump administration in working towards a resolution and understanding Russia's long-running concerns about NATO's eastward expansion and its overtures to Ukraine.

It described Trump as "one of the few Western politicians who not only immediately refused to advance meaningless and destructive preconditions for starting a substantive dialogue with Moscow on the Ukrainian crisis, but also publicly spoke about its root causes".</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CJXHROLQY5KC3DP23HPDIBCQIU.jpg?auth=be451f7b6dcdb5a6369c86b11e374ec90aa218db6702a35b56d695148ea2a59a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Costa Rican populists win commanding victory but fall short of legislative supermajority</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-rican-populists-win-commanding-victory-fall-short-legislative-2026-02-02/</link><description>SAN JOSE, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Laura Fernandez’s decisive presidential victory in Costa Rica on Sunday also delivered her Sovereign People’s Party (PPSO) a majority in Congress — the first time since 1990 that one party has secured both the presidency and control of the legislature.

The PPSO won 31 of 57 seats, short of the 38-seat supermajority Fernandez sought to advance more sweeping reforms, including judicial and constitutional changes and the ability to declare states of emergency that could temporarily limit civil liberties to fight crime.

"Those big reforms that people feared the government could implement, we're not going to see them," said Maria Fernanda Bozmoski, the director for Central America at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international affairs think tank.

While the PPSO can pass laws, budgets and make appointments without needing to negotiate with other parties, it has few allies in the new Congress.

The National Renovation Party (PNR), an evangelical party that often aligned with the government in the previous Congress, was left with zero seats.

The National Liberation Party (PLN), the country's oldest political party and main contender against the PPSO in the election, won 17 seats while the Broad Front (FA), a leftist party that has mounted the strongest opposition to the government, is the third-largest force with 7 seats.

The progressive Citizen Action Coalition will have one seat, occupied by former first lady Claudia Dobles, who ran against Fernandez and has voiced strong opposition to her, leaving one seat for the traditional right-wing Social Christian Unity Party (PUSC).

"The (ruling party's) aspirations of reconfiguring the political system fell a bit short with these results," said Ronald Alfaro, a researcher at Costa Rica's Center for Investigations and Political Studies (CIEP).

"For things that require 38 votes they're going to have to negotiate and we'll have to see how that unfolds," Alfaro added.

During his concession speech, PLN candidate Alvaro Ramos said his party would work with Fernandez on issues they agree on, but oppose her when they disagree.

"We need to keep fighting, that's our job, that's our commitment," Ramos said.

President Rodrigo Chaves often blamed Congress for blocking progress through gridlock and obstruction.

"The opposition is going to have to redefine itself because it won't be as easy to obstruct or block things," Alfaro said, adding that the vast majority of the legislators are new to Congress.

"We'll have to see how that block manifests, if they go their own ways or form an opposition alliance."</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OG67I6EDDVL6BBUWFO2A6I27BY.jpg?auth=9306a63a94e5c155ca0205ff8b1fd61910b134278f6b29d30e97d180c94bf754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egypt's drone deployment to border raises stakes in Sudan's civil war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypts-drone-deployment-border-raises-stakes-sudans-civil-war-2026-02-02/</link><description>CAIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The deployment of a powerful model of Turkish combat drone to a remote airstrip on Egypt’s southwestern border signals a sharp escalation in Sudan’s civil war, suggesting one of its largest neighbours is being drawn deeper into the fray, more than a dozen officials and regional experts say.

Egypt, which shares the Nile River and a more than 1,200-kilometre frontier with Sudan, has provided staunch political backing to the country’s military in its nearly three-year conflict with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group.

But while Egyptian security officials have privately acknowledged sending logistical and technical support to the Sudanese Armed Forces, until last year Cairo mostly refrained from direct intervention in fighting that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced millions and spread famine across the vast country.

Cairo’s position toward the conflict started to change when the RSF made a series of advances in Sudan’s western Darfur region, first capturing a strategic northwestern triangle between Egypt and Libya in June and then overrunning the Sudanese military’s last foothold in Darfur, the city of al-Fashir, in October, according to eight regional analysts and three diplomats briefed by Egyptian officials.

Egypt’s presidency warned in December that the country’s national security was directly linked to Sudan’s, and Cairo would not allow its “red lines” to be crossed. Those lines include preserving Sudan’s territorial integrity and rejecting any “parallel entities” that threaten the country’s unity, it said.

Two Egyptian security officials told Reuters two airports in the south have been supplied with military equipment over the past eight months or so to secure the border and carry out military strikes to protect “national security.” The officials, who like other sources spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to provide details.

Satellite images from Vantor, a U.S. space technology firm, show a large drone on the apron of one of the airports, in East Oweinat, on September 29, December 28 and January 9.

Two military experts who reviewed the images told Reuters the aircraft was identifiable as a Bayraktar Akinci based on its distinctive body and wing design. The New York Times has also published imagery of Akinci drones at the East Oweinat airstrip, which they reported were being used for strikes in Sudan.

The Akinci is one of the most advanced drones manufactured by Turkish defence firm Baykar, with the ability to travel at high altitudes, remain airborne for 24 hours and carry a wide range of munitions.

Egypt’s Foreign Ministry and State Information Service did not answer questions about operations at East Oweinat or in Sudan. Sudan’s military also did not respond to requests for comment.

Egypt – along with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and United States – is part of the so-called "Quad" of countries seen as most influential in the conflict, which has been trying, without success, to broker a ceasefire.

Cairo’s toughening stance adds another potentially explosive element to a conflict that has drawn in a wide range of foreign actors since April 2023, when the country’s military and the RSF fell out over how to integrate their forces during a planned transition to civilian rule.

U.N. experts have accused the UAE of providing weapons to the RSF, which Abu Dhabi denies. Sudan’s military has deployed Turkish and Iranian drones , and it has received political and other backing from Qatar and Saudi Arabia .

RSF head Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has accused Egypt of being involved in airstrikes against the group since at least October 2024, which Cairo denied at the time. Shortly before al-Fashir's fall, Dagalo said his forces were being attacked by aircraft taking off from "airports in neighboring countries”, warning they would be considered a “legitimate target” for his fighters.

The RSF did not respond to questions for this article.

The New Arab, a London-based pan-Arab news outlet, quoted an Egyptian military official as saying Egypt carried out an airstrike on an RSF convoy in the border triangle area on January 9. A diplomat in Cairo briefed by Egyptian officials said the strike was carried out from an airbase in southern Egypt. Reuters could not independently verify the accounts.

Samir Farag, a retired Egyptian military officer, said East Oweinat is one of the “main bases through which Egypt can secure its southern borders.”

The airstrip is located in a remote farming region, about 60 km (37 miles) from the Sudan border, and was primarily used to support a desert reclamation project before the war.

“Egypt doesn’t allow anyone to be present on its borders and threaten its national security,” Farag said. “It will intervene directly and manage the situation. This is the right of every country in the world.”

DRONE DEPLOYMENT AT THE BASE

While only one Akinci is clearly visible on any given day in the Vantor imagery, an image captured by U.S. satellite firm Planet Labs on December 28 almost certainly shows two outside one of the hangars, according to Jeremy Binnie, Middle East specialist at Jane’s, a defence intelligence company. Akincis can also be seen outside multiple hangars, suggesting more than one is being used to store drones when they are not flying, he added.

The presence of support equipment and loading material around the aircraft, and the fact that they appear in different locations, suggest they are being used, said Wim Zwijnenburg, a military technology expert at Dutch peace organisation PAX.

The images reviewed by Reuters also show renovations underway at the airport between early July and the end of January. The runway was being repaved and possibly widened slightly, and several smaller roads were added. There were also signs of digging and construction, with at least two small structures added.

The RSF says its territory has been attacked repeatedly with Akincis, claiming its fighters shot down at least seven since June. Reuters could not verify the claims.

Two videos posted on social media in mid-January showed what RSF fighters said was an Akinci shot down near Nyala, the group’s main stronghold in Darfur. The two military experts told Reuters the wreckage was consistent with a crashed Akinci, but the news agency could not determine when and where the videos were shot, or who was operating the drone.

In February 2024, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Ankara would sell drones to Egypt as the two countries normalised ties following a decade-long rupture, but he did not specify what kind.

A Turkish Defence Ministry source said the countries reached an agreement on the sale of Akincis the same year. The source did not provide further details. A Western diplomat, who meets regularly with Turkish officials, said they had privately defended Egyptian airstrikes on the RSF as legitimate and had confirmed drones were recently delivered for use in the war effort but did not give further details.

Five of the six flights into East Oweinat that appear in flight tracking data from FlightRadar24 since September came from Turkey. Of these, three were Turkish Air Force-operated cargo planes from Tekirdag, the Turkish city where Akincis are tested, the data shows.

Reuters could not determine what was on the flights, which took place on December 25, December 26 and January 7.

The Turkish Defence Industries Presidency (SSB), which handles such agreements, the Akincis’ manufacturer, Baykar, and Egypt’s government did not respond to questions about the sale.

Justin Lynch, managing director of the Conflict Insights Group consultancy, which closely tracks the war in Sudan, said the drone deployment at East Oweinat was “an indication of Egypt’s recent policy to be more involved in Sudan”.

The airport is less than 400 kilometres from Sudan’s border triangle, a strategically sensitive region on Egypt’s doorstep through which the RSF can receive supplies from southeastern Libya destined for Darfur.

Supplies sent through that corridor proved instrumental to the fall of al-Fashir , during which the RSF was accused of widespread atrocities, including gunning down hundreds of civilians and holding residents hostage for ransoms.

The city’s fall was a turning point in Egypt’s previously “ambiguous” stance toward the conflict, said Jalel Harchaoui, a contributor to Britain’s Royal United Services Institute think tank.

“The Egyptian military harbors no affinity whatsoever for the Rapid Support Forces. Yet Egypt depends on the United Arab Emirates, a major backer of the RSF, for financial assistance,” he said. “When al-Fashir finally fell … Cairo’s equilibrium shifted toward taking tougher measures against the RSF.”

Egypt may also have been emboldened by Saudi Arabia’s moves to curb the UAE's influence in Yemen, according to the analysts and diplomats who spoke with Reuters, a rivalry that has since spilled over into the Horn of Africa .

An Emirati official said the UAE was working with regional partners – including Egypt and Saudi Arabia – to secure a ceasefire in Sudan and that its “decisions have consistently favoured restraint over escalation".

If confirmed to be an AFC/M23 operation, it would be the furthest west the group has struck as part of its offensive against the government in Kinshasa.

AFC/M23 spokesperson Willy Ngoma said he had "no comment" on the claim from Congolese authorities. A government spokesperson for Rwanda, which United Nations experts and Western powers say backs AFC/M23, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The government of Tshopo province, where Kisangani is located, said in a statement on Sunday that the drones attempted to strike Bangoka International Airport between early Saturday and early Sunday but were shot down before reaching their target.

The statement described the aircraft as “kamikaze drones” carrying “non‑conventional munitions made up of several sub‑munitions.” No casualties or damage were reported.

Bangoka airport lies about 17 km from central Kisangani, hundreds of kilometres from the front lines in North and South Kivu provinces, where AFC/M23 has seized large swathes of territory since 2022, capturing the key cities of Goma and Bukavu in a lightning offensive last year.

The escalation spurred efforts by mediators including the U.S. and Qatar to end the fighting and facilitate Western investments in critical minerals in eastern Congo.

One diplomatic source and three security sources confirmed that a drone attack had taken place near the airport. It was not immediately clear what type of drones were used, but two of the security sources said they appeared to be relatively short range.

Since the fall of Goma to AFC/M23, Kisangani has become the main forward base for Congo’s military aircraft, including jets and drones used in operations in the east.

A local spokesperson for Congo's army declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:05:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Republicans should 'nationalize' voting in at least 15 places</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-republicans-should-nationalize-voting-least-15-places-2026-02-02/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday that Republicans should "nationalize" and "take over" voting in at least 15 unspecified places, reiterating his false claims that U.S. elections are marred by widespread fraud.

In a podcast interview with his former FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino, Trump -- who continues to claim falsely that his 2020 election defeat was the result of fraud -- gave no details on what he intended.

Referring to immigrants, the president said on "The Dan Bongino Show": "These people were brought to our country to vote, and they vote illegally. And you know, amazing that the Republicans aren't tougher on it."

"The Republicans should say, we want to take over. We should take over the voting, the voting in at least many, 15 places. The Republicans ought to nationalize the voting," Trump said in the interview.

He did not specify the locations but said: "We have states that are so crooked and they're counting votes. We have states that I won that show I didn't win."

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for clarification of Trump's remarks.

Bongino returned to his podcast after leaving the Federal Bureau of Investigation last month.

Trump's comments came days after the FBI searched an election office in Georgia's Fulton County for 2020 records as the president continues to press false claims of fraud in his 2020 defeat, an accusation that has been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Trump, in a departure from law enforcement norms, spoke with some of the FBI agents by cellphone the day after the raid during a meeting they had with Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the New York Times reported on Monday.

The U.S. will hold midterm elections in November that will determine control of Congress for the next two years.

"Following this release (of Epstein files) and subsequent media reporting, the Met has received a number of reports relating to alleged misconduct in a public office," Ella Marriott, commander of the Met police, said in a statement on Monday.

Lang, 86, knew Epstein for several years, requesting favours such as the use of his car or plane for himself or his family, French daily Le Monde reported.

French investigative website Mediapart also reported that Epstein in 2016 founded a company based in the US Virgin Islands, half of whose shares were owned by Lang’s eldest daughter Caroline.

But it said no files it reviewed suggested either father or daughter had been implicated in Epstein’s sexual crimes.

Lang said he first met Epstein through the US film director Woody Allen “about 15 years ago”.

“I was completely shocked when I discovered the crimes he had committed,” Lang, who has been president of the Paris-based Arab World Institute since 2013, said in a statement.

“I fully accept the ties I may have formed at a time when nothing suggested that Jeffrey Epstein could be at the heart of a criminal network,” he added.

“Had I known, I would have immediately cut off all contact with him.”

Epstein died by suicide in 2019 while in prison facing charges of sex trafficking underage girls.

Caroline Lang, a one-time actor and now a film producer, told Mediapart she met Epstein through Allen and his wife in 2012, and that one day the US financier told her he wanted to “invest in young French and international artists”.

She said his lawyers set up the company called Prytanee LLC, but that she did not invest any money in it. An email in the Epstein files suggests she instead contributed her knowledge of the art world, Mediapart reported.

She told the investigative website she had been “incredibly naive”.

Later Monday, Caroline Lang resigned as head of the Independent Production Union (SPI).

“I do not want this situation to in any way harm the union,” Lang said, who was only named as the SPI head three weeks ago.

A leading French conductor, Frédéric Chaslin, also named in the new batch of Epstein documents, meanwhile slammed reports of a 2013 email he sent to Epstein in which he said he had “found a formidable girl”.

“It is ... totally unacceptable and false to insinuate that I ‘found a girl’ for Jeffrey Epstein. The reality is simple and verifiable: he had asked me to recommend an interpreter to accompany him on visits to Parisian museums,” Chaslin wrote in a Facebook post in response to a report by the Diapason magazine on the email exchange.

In the 2013 email, Chaslin wrote: “I have found a formidable girl for your next stay in Paris. Philosophy student. 21. She looks a bit like the current wife of (Roman) Polanski.”

Epstein had at this time already been convicted of soliciting an underage person for prostitution.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d6336572-0062-11f1-9017-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/f995f4712de941b40a1394c99426a444ea976788.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria security forces enter strategic al-Hassakeh as part of deal with Kurdish-led SDF</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260202-syria-security-forces-enter-strategic-al-hassakeh-as-part-of-deal-with-kurdish-led-sdf</link><description>A small contingent of security forces with Syria’s interior ministry entered the city of al-Hassakeh on Monday as part of a deal between Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces , or SDF, which control the city.

The SDF announced the new agreement with the central government on Friday, aiming to stabilise a ceasefire in the country that ended weeks of fighting, in which the Kurdish-led force lost most of the territory it previously held in northeastern Syria . It lays out steps toward integrating the force into the army and police forces, and integrating civilian institutions in SDF-controlled areas into the central government.

Under the deal, government military forces will not enter Kurdish-majority areas, but small contingents of security forces reporting to the interior ministry will enter the cities of al-Hassakeh and Qamishli to secure state-affiliated institutions such as the civil registry, passport offices and the airport, and to restart work at those institutions.

Local Kurdish police forces will continue to patrol both cities and will eventually be integrated into the interior ministry as well.

The entry of government forces into al-Hassakeh went forward as planned without any outbreaks of violence.

Later Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned the SDF against any attempts to “sabotage” the agreement reached with the Syrian government.

“With the latest agreements, a new page has now been opened before the Syrian people,” Erdogan said in a televised address. “Whoever attempts to sabotage this, I say clearly and openly, will be crushed under it.”

Turkey is a strong ally of the government in Damascus and regards the SDF as an extension of a Kurdish militant group that has led a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a03389e2-0077-11f1-8b1e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033697269504.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Delayed French 2026 budget finally through, paves way for Macron’s military spending boost</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260202-delayed-french-budget-finally-through-paves-way-for-macron-military-spending-boost</link><description>France has adopted its delayed 2026 budget Monday, clearing the way for higher military spending promised by President Emmanuel Macron to confront threats linked to Russia’s war in Ukraine and Mideast conflicts.

The adoption of the budget marks the final step of a monthslong, chaotic process that exposed deep divisions in the fractured parliament, which proved unable to reach a compromise.

Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu ultimately opted to use his special constitutional power to pass the bill without a vote, surviving two no-confidence votes on Monday evening.

Macron has vowed to increase defence spending to counter what he describes as a widening range of threats, from Russia and nuclear proliferation to terrorism and cyberattacks .

France in December passed an emergency law to avoid a US-style government shutdown, but only the full 2026 budget provides the military with the needed funding to build up forces.

The defence ministry will get this year an additional €6.7 billion compared to 2025 — a notable exception as the state seeks to curb spending across most other sectors. This year, the armed forces are set to receive a new nuclear-powered attack submarine, 362 armoured vehicles to modernise the army, and new Aster surface-to-air missiles.

France is also launching its new voluntary military service this year aiming at training thousands of volunteers, mostly ages 18 and 19.

The government is targeting a budget deficit of 5 percent of gross domestic product, down from 5.4 percent in 2025. Public spending is expected to edge down slightly, from 56.8 percent to 56.6 percent of GDP as authorities try to rein in debt in the European Union’s second-largest economy.

France has come under pressure from the EU and credit rating agencies to reduce its debt, prompting the centre-right government to seek spending cuts.

However, with no majority in parliament, Lecornu also granted costly concessions to Socialists to keep them from backing efforts to topple his government. The most symbolic is the suspension of Macron’s unpopular pension changes to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64.

The state deficit is projected at €131.9 billion, almost stable compared with the previous year.

Businesses will bear several tax increases, including an extra tax on large companies’ profits that’s expected to raise €7.3 billion in 2026.

Macron, 48, is soon entering the last year of his presidency in spring 2027.

He has largely stepped back from domestic politics since his 2024 decision to call early legislative elections plunged parliament into turmoil and led to the collapse of successive governments over budget disputes.

Lecornu, the fourth prime minister in two years, has survived eight no-confidence votes initiated by the hard left and the far right . Macron, meanwhile, has focused on foreign policy, European affairs and defence.

In recent weeks, he has pushed for security guarantees for Ukraine in the event of a peace deal with Russia, joined European leaders in a show of solidarity with Greenland , and supported the inclusion of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on the EU’s list of terrorist organisation.

As his sunglasses became a sensation at the Davos gathering of world leaders, Macron’s remarks that France prefers “respect to bullies”, seen as a rebuke to US President Donald Trump’s tariffs threats, drew worldwide attention.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:06:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/787049c2-0068-11f1-ad6d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94V77UX.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Mexico will stop sending oil to energy-starved Cuba</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-says-mexico-will-stop-sending-oil-energy-starved-cuba-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Mexico would stop sending oil to Cuba as he ramped up a pressure campaign on the Caribbean nation.

"Mexico is gonna cease sending them oil," Trump told reporters in the White House Oval Office. He did not elaborate on why he believed this to be the case.

Mexican authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Mexico is the single-largest supplier of oil to Cuba, which regularly suffers from energy shortages and mass blackouts. Cuba relies heavily on fuel imports of refined products to meet its demand for electricity generation, gasoline, and aviation fuel. U.S. sanctions and a deep economic crisis have prevented the Communist government from purchasing enough fuel for years, forcing it to depend on a small group of allies.

Reuters has reported that the Mexican government is reviewing whether to keep sending oil to Cuba, as it worries that Mexico could face reprisals from the United States over its policy to do so.

President Claudia Sheinbaum's administration said on Sunday it would seek to ship oil to Cuba for humanitarian reasons, “without seeking confrontation." But they also said aid would consist of "other" products for the coming week.

Tensions flared last month between Havana and Washington following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, long a close ally of Cuba. Trump has labeled Cuba "an unusual and extraordinary threat" to U.S. national security and threatened tariffs on the U.S.-bound exports of any nation that sends oil to the communist-run island.

Cuba and the United States are in communication , a Cuban diplomat told Reuters on Monday, although he said the exchanges have not yet evolved into a formal "dialogue." Trump has also said the two sides are talking.

Mexico and many regional analysts think Cuba could face a humanitarian crisis if the country loses access to energy. Other countries might not make up for a shortfall from Mexico, given Washington's threats.

Trump has privately questioned Sheinbaum about crude and fuel shipments to Cuba, Reuters has previously reported. Sheinbaum responded that the shipments are "humanitarian aid," according to sources familiar with a call between the leaders. They added that Trump did not directly urge Mexico to halt the oil deliveries.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:31:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EPB4EACRFMXZONLMSDLPASLKU.jpg?auth=08295237c0a5f5e872af66223a62676da674522e681f1006abf0ee1dc1c8914a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN to deploy ceasefire monitoring mission in Congo, Qatar says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-deploy-ceasefire-monitoring-mission-congo-qatar-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>DAKAR, Feb 2 (Reuters) - The United Nations peacekeeping mission in Congo will send its first team to monitor a ceasefire between Congo’s government and the AFC/M23 rebel group in the coming days, Qatar’s foreign ministry said on Monday after hosting talks in Doha.

Qatar said the team would be deployed to Uvira, a strategic city in eastern Congo that AFC/M23 fighters captured in December during a rapid offensive, and which Congolese forces and allied militias re‑entered last month, restoring government control after the rebels announced they would withdraw.

The announcement late Monday is a sign of progress in Doha-mediated direct talks between Congo and the AFC/M23 rebels, who last year seized more land than they had ever held before in eastern Congo. The United States is hosting separate talks between Congo and Rwanda, which the United Nations and Western powers say backs AFC/M23, an allegation Kigali denies.

The Qatari foreign ministry said on Monday that Congo and M23 had agreed on detailed terms of reference for the ceasefire monitoring mechanism created under an agreement reached in October , and reaffirmed their commitments under the broader peace deal framework signed in November .

The latest push to activate ceasefire monitoring comes amid persistent fighting in the east.

Over the weekend explosive‑laden drones targeted the airport serving the northeastern Congolese city of Kisangani, Congolese authorities said.

If confirmed to be an AFC/M23 operation, it would be the furthest west the group has struck as part of its offensive against the government in Kinshasa.</description><pubDate>Mon, 02 Feb 2026 23:32:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JMY4N2XYVJL5DF4PBJNCP5AZQE.jpg?auth=86f8efa0b4096d8f5fae089b383b9d001d29344efc9fd6acce77e52cd6fd2cdd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian capital Kyiv, other cities, under Russian  attack, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainian-capital-kyiv-under-missile-attack-official-says-2026-02-02/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russian forces attacked the Ukrainian capital Kyiv with missiles early on Tuesday, officials said, with initial reports saying apartment blocks and other buildings had suffered damage.

Officials reported Russian air attacks on other Ukrainian regions, including Kharkiv, the country's second largest city, where the regional governor said two people were injured.

In Kyiv, Reuters witnesses reported loud explosions in the city after midnight and said both missiles and drones were being deployed.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of the city's military administration, said on Telegram that several apartment buildings, an education establishment and a commercial building had been damaged in districts east of the Dnipro River.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said a building housing a kindergarten had been set on fire and a non-residential building hit in eastern districts.

An air raid alert remained in effect more than two hours after it had been announced.

Videos posted on social media showed an apartment on the upper floors of a Kyiv block ablaze.

Ihor Terekhov, the mayor of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, reported several strikes in succession by drones and missiles.

U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes in Washington, D.C., halted , opens new tab the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's effort to terminate Haiti's Temporary Protected Status. The move would have taken effect on Wednesday despite spiraling violence there that has displaced more than 1.4 million people.

Reyes, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, issued the ruling in a class-action lawsuit brought by Haitians seeking to stop the administration from exposing them to deportation by ending their legal status.

Reyes said in the ruling that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem likely violated the procedures required to terminate the protected status of Haitian immigrants in the U.S. as well as the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment guarantee of equal protection under the law.

"Plaintiffs charge that Secretary Noem preordained her termination decision and did so because of hostility to nonwhite immigrants. This seems substantially likely," Reyes wrote.

The law firm representing the plaintiffs, Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner, praised the ruling, noting that Haiti remains extremely dangerous.

"This ruling recognizes the grave risks Haitian TPS holders would face if forced to return, and it ensures that they can remain here in the United States – as legislated by Congress - to continue their lives, contributing to their communities, and supporting their families," the firm said in a statement.

TPS is available to people whose home country has experienced a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

The Department of Homeland Security has moved to end the status for about a dozen countries as part of President Donald Trump's crackdown on immigration , saying TPS was always meant to be temporary and not a "de facto amnesty program."

Department spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin indicated in a social media post that the ruling would be appealed.

"Haiti's TPS was granted following an earthquake that took place over 15 years ago, it was never intended to be a de facto amnesty program, yet that’s how previous administrations have used it for decades. Temporary means temporary and the final word will not be from an activist judge legislating from the bench," McLaughlin said.

Haitians were first given TPS in 2010, after a devastating 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck their country. The U.S. has repeatedly extended the status, most recently under the Biden administration in July 2024.

The department at that time extended TPS for another 18 months through February 3, 2026, citing "simultaneous economic, security, political, and health crises" in Haiti, fueled by gangs and a lack of a functioning government.

Shortly after Trump took office, his administration tried to curtail those humanitarian protections for Haitians in February 2025, when Noem moved to truncate the Biden-era extension so it would expire in August.

After a federal judge in New York in July ruled Noem lacked statutory authority to do so, her department in November moved to terminate Haiti's TPS status, saying there were "no extraordinary and temporary conditions" in the country that would prevent migrants from returning.

Marius Borg Hoiby, 29, son of Crown Princess Mette-Marit and stepson to Crown Prince Haakon, could face multiple years in prison if found guilty of the most serious of the 38 charges brought against him.

His lawyer Petar Sekulic told Reuters he did not admit criminal guilt for the charges of rape or domestic violence, but did admit guilt for some of the less serious matters.

"He will give a detailed explanation about this in court," Sekulic said.

The case is scheduled to run until March 19. Hoiby is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

On Sunday Norwegian police detained him on suspicion of causing bodily harm, wielding a knife and violating a restraining order. A court ruled on Monday Hoiby could be held in custody for four weeks. His lawyer told Reuters he was considering an appeal.

The court case is the most serious crisis to hit the Norwegian royal family in peacetime, according to historian Trond Noren Isaksen, though Hoiby does not have a royal title and is outside the line of succession.

The start of the trial also comes days after his mother Mette-Marit apologised for her "poor judgment" for maintaining contacts with the late U.S. sex offender Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted of child sex crimes in 2008.

Crown Prince Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit are not planning to attend court proceedings, Haakon said in a statement, adding he trusted the justice system to be fair and proper.

About Marius, Haakon said: "We love him, he is an important part of our family. He is a Norwegian citizen, so he has the same responsibilities as everyone else, as well as the same rights," he said.

Haakon expressed sympathy for the alleged victims. "We think about them, we know many are going through a difficult time," he said.

The Nordic country is a constitutional monarchy in which the king is the formal head of state while political power rests with parliament and the government.

Among the charges against Hoiby are one count of rape with sexual intercourse and three counts of rape without intercourse, some of which he filmed on his telephone, the prosecution said.

In January, it added new charges, including of possession and transport of 3.5 kg (7.72 pounds) of marijuana.

In 2024 , police named Hoiby as a suspect of physical assault against a woman with whom he had been in a relationship.

Hoiby, in a statement to the media at the time, admitted to causing bodily harm to the woman while he was under the influence of cocaine and alcohol and of damaging her apartment. Hoiby said he regretted his acts.

The trial comes at a time of multiple challenges for the family, in addition to the ongoing scrutiny Mette-Marit is receiving for her ties to Epstein.

King Harald, 88, Europe's oldest living monarch, cut back activity in 2024 after being hospitalised to treat an infection and later receiving a pacemaker.

Mette-Marit is in need of a lung transplant after being diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis in 2018, a chronic disease that causes scarring in the lungs and leads to a reduced oxygen uptake.

Meanwhile, King Harald's daughter, Martha Louise, stepped down from official royal duties in 2022 to allow her to more freely pursue her own business ventures, and said both she and her husband, an American self-styled shaman, would refrain from using her title as princess in a commercial setting.

They both received criticism last year for starring in a Netflix documentary chronicling their daily lives, including their wedding, and for being critical of the king and queen.

"This must be seen in the context of all the controversies caused by Princess Martha Louise and her husband and that age and health issues have made it more difficult for the royal family to fulfil their duties, which has affected their visibility," said historian Isaksen.

Still, the monarchy remains popular. Some 70% of Norwegians support the monarchy as an institution, according to a Norstat poll for public broadcaster NRK conducted in January among 1,030 people and published on Friday. Only 19% want another form of government.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:11:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TL4SU37LYBMKDEA25RRE4ED47I.jpg?auth=3dd4bb7fe10a7fd934b3b738ded0e3691573f96448aa9fc16ca9c94f554a94e4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bill and Hillary Clinton to testify before Congress in Epstein probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-bill-hillary-clinton-to-testify-congress-epstein-investigation</link><description>Bill and Hillary Clinton will testify in a US House investigation surrounding deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , a spokesman for the ex-president said, heading off a potential vote to hold the couple in contempt.

They had originally refused to appear before lawmakers examining how authorities handled earlier investigations into the disgraced financier, who had connections and correspondence with the world's business and political elite.

"The former President and former Secretary of State will be there. They look forward to setting a precedent that applies to everyone," Angel Urena said on X.

The House Rules Committee had advanced resolutions accusing the Clintons of defying subpoenas to appear in person to explain their links to Epstein, who died in custody in 2019.

The Epstein affair continues to cast a long shadow over Washington, entangling some of the most prominent names in US politics and highlighting the sharp partisan battles that have shaped the scandal.

Democrats say the probe is being weaponised to attack political opponents of President Donald Trump -- himself a longtime Epstein associate who has not been called to testify -- rather than to conduct legitimate oversight.

Trump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.

Neither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.

In letters where they initially refused to appear in Washington, the Clintons had argued that the subpoenas were invalid because they lacked a clear legislative purpose.

Republicans say the Democratic couple's past links to the business tycoon, including Bill Clinton's use of his private jet in the early 2000s, justify in person questioning under oath.

Instead, the couple submitted sworn written statements describing their knowledge of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence for sex trafficking.

Bill Clinton acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited his private island.

Hillary Clinton said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.

The contempt vote and its targeting of the Clintons could have exposed divisions among congressional Democrats.

Some Democrats have privately acknowledged that their party has long argued no one should be beyond scrutiny in efforts to uncover the full scope of Epstein's crimes.

But others feared that advancing the contempt resolutions would have played into a partisan strategy to shift attention away from Trump's past contacts with Epstein.

The Justice Department released last week what it said would be the final batch of files related to the investigation into Epstein.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/019db34e-f09f-11f0-9c2f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-13T163503Z-339867903-RC2NDCAR4CM1-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-EPSTEIN-CLINTONS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain unveils first national plan to curb 'forever chemicals' risks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20260203-britain-national-plan-forever-chemicals-risks</link><description>Britain unveiled Tuesday its first-ever plan to tackle " forever chemicals " and reduce the risks they pose to health and the environment.

PFAs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a group of some 10,000 human-manufactured chemicals used in everything from pizza boxes to cookware, to waterproof clothing.

They take an extremely long time to break down -- earning them their "forever" nickname -- and instead build up in the environment.

There is growing evidence their widespread use has created risks that "will likely remain for hundreds of years", according to the UK's Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs.

It said in a statement the new government plan aims to "understand where these chemicals are coming from, how they spread and how to reduce public and environmental exposure".

The full extent of PFAs in England's estuaries and coastal waters "will be assessed for the first time," it added.

PFAs are present in food and drinking water.

Chronic exposure to even low levels has been linked to liver damage, high cholesterol, reduced immune responses, low birth weights and several kinds of cancer.

Under the plan, "a consultation will be launched later this year on introducing a statutory limit for PFAS in England's public supply regulations."

Should permitted levels be exceeded, this would make it easier for regulators to "enforce against water companies breaking the rules".

"It's crucial that we protect public health and the environment for future generations," said Environment Minister Emma Hardy in the statement.

She noted the government would work with regulators, industry, and local communities "to ensure 'forever chemicals' are not a forever problem".

Safer alternatives to everyday items, such as period pads and waterproof clothing, could also be developed.

Traces of the chemicals have been found everywhere from Tibet to Antarctica and contamination scandals have gripped Belgium and the United States among other nations.

Their use is increasingly being restricted across the world due to adverse health effects.

A handful of US states, including California, implemented a ban on the intentional use of PFAS in cosmetics beginning in 2025, and several other states are slated to follow in 2026.

The European Union has also been studying a ban on the use of PFAs in consumer products.

A report last week said their continued use could cost Europe up to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) by 2050 because of their impact on people's health.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d39309e-ce4d-11f0-8f23-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-11-27T154534Z-1121068092-RC235IA3L2DK-RTRMADP-3-BRITAIN-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Epstein calls himself 'lowest level' offender in newly released interview</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-epstein-denied-he-was-devil-video</link><description>Jeffrey Epstein denied he was the "devil" and insisted he was only the lowest level of sexual predator in a video interview included in the latest release of files by US authorities.

The interview, which lasts around two hours, was conducted by President Donald Trump' s former advisor Steve Bannon. It appears to be filmed in the deceased financier's New York home on an unknown date.

Documents concerning Epstein and government investigations into him have been released in troves, highlighting his connections to political and business leaders worldwide.

"Do you think you're the devil himself?" Bannon asks Epstein, a convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking of underage girls.

"No, but I do have a good mirror," Epstein says smiling, wearing a black shirt and glasses. When questioned again, he adds, "I don't know. Why would you say that?"

Epstein, who pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from an underage girl, also appears to downplay the seriousness of his conviction.

He opposes Bannon labeling him a "class three sexual predator" -- which indicates a most serious threat to public safety, according to a classification used in the United States.

"No, I'm the lowest," says Epstein.

"But a criminal," Bannon adds, to which Epstein responds: "Yes."

The confrontation followed Bannon asking Epstein if he considered his money "dirty" as he "earned it advising the worst people in the world."

Epstein insists he made his money legally but acknowledges that "ethics is always a complicated subject."

He argues that he gave cash to help eradicate polio in Pakistan and India in a bid to justify how he earned his money.

Documents show that Bannon had regular correspondence with Epstein, who offered to help the far-right political figure spread his conservative ideology in Europe.

Millions of pages on Epstein, along with photos and videos, have been published by US authorities since Trump took office in January 2025.

They have shed light on Epstein's ties to top business executives such as Microsoft's Bill Gates, celebrities such as filmmaker Woody Allen, and academics and politicians including Trump and former president Bill Clinton.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/35e1af82-fdfd-11f0-a704-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EPSTEIN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump cuts India tariffs after Modi agrees to stop Russia oil purchases</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260202-trump-cuts-india-tariffs-after-modi-agrees-to-stop-russia-oil-purchases</link><description>US President Donald Trump announced a trade deal Monday to reduce tariffs on India , saying that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil over the war in Ukraine.

Trump said he was cutting levies on Indian goods to 18 percent. He had previously imposed 25 percent "reciprocal" tariffs on many products, plus an additional 25 percent for New Delhi's purchases of Moscow's oil.

The deal eases months of tensions over India's oil purchases -- which Washington says fund a conflict it is trying to end -- and restores the close ties between Trump and the man he describes as "one of my greatest friends."

But while Modi thanked Trump for the "wonderful" phone call and the easing of tariffs, he made no reference to Trump's assertion about halting Russian oil purchases.

"Out of friendship and respect for Prime Minister Modi and, as per his request, effective immediately, we agreed to a Trade Deal between the United States and India," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

Trump said that the United States would lower the reciprocal duty imposed on India during his waves of global "Liberation Day" tariffs last year from 25 percent to 18 percent.

A White House official told AFP that an additional 25 percent tariff Trump had slapped on India in August for its purchase of Russian oil would also be dropped.

Trump added that Modi "agreed to stop buying Russian Oil, and to buy much more from the United States and, potentially, Venezuela. This will help END THE WAR in Ukraine."

The United States is effectively overseeing Venezuelan oil exports since toppling the South American country's leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a military operation in January.

India had further agreed to buy more than $500 billion in US energy, tech, agricultural, coal and other products, Trump said, without giving further details.

Modi was one of the first leaders to visit the White House after Trump's return to the presidency a year ago, but efforts to secure a trade deal had foundered over India's Russian oil purchases.

As recently as December, Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a visit to New Delhi that he was ready to continue "uninterrupted shipments" of fuel to India despite US pressure.

Trump also said in October that Modi had promised to stop buying Russian oil, but an agreement did not materialise at the time.

"Wonderful to speak with my dear friend President Trump today. Delighted that Made in India products will now have a reduced tariff of 18 percent," Modi said in a post on X on Monday.

The Indian leader however made no mention of oil sales.

A recent EU-India accord may have been may have been a catalyst for the sudden Trump announcement, said Tanvi Madan, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution's Center for Asia Policy Studies.

"It is possible that the Indian trade agreement with the EU... incentivized Washington to get to yes," Madan told AFP.

Madan added that the "devil will be in the details" in the sectors that will get relief under the deal.

For India "the Russia question remains," said Farwa Aamer, Director of South Asia Initiatives at the Asia Society Policy Institute.

"Even though it has and will change its oil import structure away from Russia, India would still want to keep relations steady," Aamer added.

India emerged as a major buyer of Russian oil after the start of the Ukraine war, providing Moscow with a crucial export market as Europe sharply reduced purchases.

In 2024, Russia supplied nearly 36 percent of India's total crude imports, around 1.8 million barrels of discounted oil per day.

Modi added however that "President Trump's leadership is vital for global peace, stability, and prosperity."

Trump has repeatedly claimed credit for ending the brief but intense armed conflict between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan in May.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 02:12:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/be84ea5a-0066-11f1-a74d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/f4ddce0c3dd86c595d076023f4d6028b33a208e9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan must look to democracies, not China, for trade cooperation, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-must-look-democracies-not-china-trade-cooperation-president-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>TAIPEI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Taiwan must look to fellow democracies, not China, for trade and economic cooperation, President Lai Ching-te said on Tuesday, as his government mapped out how the island plans to work with the United States on areas like AI and critical minerals.

Senior Taiwanese and U.S. officials last week discussed cooperation in artificial intelligence, tech and drones at a high-level forum launched during the first Trump administration, with the U.S. State Department praising Taipei as a "vital partner."

The two sides signed statements on cooperation on economic security and on the Pax Silica Declaration - a U.S.-led initiative aimed at securing AI and semiconductor supply chains amid intense competition from Beijing, Washington's main strategic rival and which claims Taiwan as its own territory.

Speaking at a news conference at the presidential office about the U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partnership Dialogue, Lai lauded the outcome of those talks.

"Taiwan is on the right economic path and is striding confidently onto the world stage. Taiwan has both the capability and the confidence to work with its democratic partners to lead the next generation of prosperity," he said.

Lai was speaking as the deputy chairman of Taiwan's main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT), Hsiao Hsu-tsen, was in Beijing for a think-tank exchange with China's Communist Party on ostensibly non-political issues like AI and tourism.

Lai said Taiwan's opposition "had their own positions", and pointed to the differences of Taiwan's slower economic growth under the previous KMT government, which signed a landmark trade deal with China, or the much faster growth since the Democratic Progressive Party took office in 2016.

"Do we want to continue collaborating with the U.S., Japan, Europe and other allied nations, or again lock ourselves into China?" he added.

There was no immediate response from the KMT to Lai's remarks, but Hsiao told the opening of the forum in Beijing that "peaceful development" serves the interests of both sides, according to a read out of his remarks provided by the party.

"We should cooperate across the Taiwan Strait to earn money from the world, rather than oppose each other across the strait and let foreign countries reap the benefits, exploiting Taiwan and hollowing it out," he said.

China refuses to speak to Lai, calling him a "separatist". He says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

Speaking to reporters, Lai reiterated an offer to speak to Beijing, based on parity and equality.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:27:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5N45RQ44KBO6TJOQDBAFPG3L6I.jpg?auth=11faa96a7a27dd953bbca4ffdcc93d5c1819a873f1b8cdfe8b481c405e3768f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi calls for 'equal, multipolar world' as he meets Uruguay leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-calls-equal-multipolar-world-he-meets-uruguay-leader-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China and Uruguay should should work together to advance an "equal and orderly multipolar world", President Xi Jinping told his counterpart Yamandu Orsi on Tuesday, according to a media pool report.

Orsi's visit is the first by a South American leader to the Chinese capital since the United States invaded Venezuela in January and captured then President Nicolas Maduro in a raid .

China and Uruguay should "work together to advance an equal and orderly multipolar world and an inclusive, universally beneficial economic globalisation," Xi said in his remarks, aiming to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

The meeting comes in the wake of a flurry of visits to China by Western leaders this year, from Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer to Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo.

Orsi said his visit aimed to "empower Uruguay in the world and generate opportunities, investment and development" in a Facebook comment on Sunday, following his arrival in Beijing.

He is leading a delegation of 150, including business leaders, on a visit that runs until February 7, which will also take in the commercial capital of Shanghai.

The timing is symbolically important for China, said Francisco Urdinez, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile.

"For Beijing, hosting Orsi ... signals that South American countries remain eager to engage, despite the increasingly polarised geopolitical environment."

Marcos, who is midway through his six-year term and denies wrongdoing, faces two separate complaints filed by a lawyer and activists, which hurdled an initial step at the House justice committee on Monday when lawmakers said both were "sufficient in form".

The committee reconvened on Tuesday to determine whether there was "substance" to move the complaints forward. The committee's decision, regardless of which way it goes, would be put to a vote of the lower house of Congress, which is dominated by allies of the president.

If the complaints against Marcos succeed in a vote of the House, he would be the second Philippine head of state to be impeached after Joseph Estrada, whose 2001 trial was aborted when some prosecutors walked out.

The complaints include Marcos' decision to allow his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte to be arrested and taken to The Hague to face trial at the International Criminal Court over thousands of killings during his notorious "war on drugs".

Marcos is also accused of abusing his authority in spending public funds that led to a corruption scandal over flood-control projects. His alleged drug use , which he has denied, also made him unfit to run the country, according to one of the complaints.

The office of Marcos said he respects the process.

"Even before, the president already said he did not do anything wrong, did not violate the law and did not commit an impeachable offence," Presidential press officer Claire Castro told a briefing on Monday.

If the lower house decides to impeach Marcos, it would be sent to the Senate for trial, where its 24 members serve as jurors. Five top officials have been impeached in the Philippines and of those, only one, a former chief justice, was convicted and removed from office.

Among the five was Marcos' estranged Vice President Sara Duterte, whose impeachment was struck down by the Supreme Court last year. She is facing new impeachment complaints and denies wrongdoing.

Gerville Luistro, who heads the justice committee, said its members would decide whether the alleged offences Marcos was accused of were enough to impeach him.

"It's not enough that an impeachable official committed wrongdoing. That wrongdoing must constitute an impeachable offence," Luistro told broadcaster Teleradyo.

Luistro said if lawmakers vote in favour of advancing the complaint, Marcos would have the chance to respond to the allegations. The backing of one-third of the House is needed to impeach the president.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:27:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DWHNUHMKVFMZ3IVLN6IPMG4J3Q.jpg?auth=6a83c9fac72aaffbfdfcf9874f13281cde33d6004f45b5c795610759e766bb91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tulsi Gabbard says Trump requested her presence at FBI raid in Fulton County</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/tulsi-gabbard-says-trump-requested-her-presence-fbi-raid-fulton-county-2026-02-03/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said on Monday she was present at last week's FBI raid on an election facility in Georgia at the request of President Donald Trump and that her attendance was within her authority.

Gabbard wrote in a letter to lawmakers dated Monday that she observed FBI personnel executing a search warrant in Fulton County and was present there for a "brief period of time."

Top Democrats on the Senate and House of Representatives intelligence committees had called for Gabbard to brief their panels on why she was present at the raid and raised concerns about her presence.

Gabbard also said that while visiting the FBI field office in Atlanta, she "facilitated a brief phone call" for Trump to thank FBI agents for their work on the probe, a departure from law enforcement norms.

She added in the letter that Trump did not ask any questions and that she and Trump did not issue any directives.

The FBI searched Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center on Wednesday, pursuing Trump's false claims that his 2020 election defeat was the result of widespread voting fraud.

Claims of voting fraud in the 2020 presidential election have been rejected by courts, state governments and members of Trump's own former administration.

Gabbard's letter was addressed to Democratic U.S. Senator Mark Warner and Representative Jim Himes. Warner's office said Gabbard's letter "raises more questions than it answers."

It is unusual for America's top intelligence official to be included in a domestic law enforcement operation as the remit of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is overseas spying and protecting national security.

"My presence was requested by the President and executed under my broad statutory authority to coordinate, integrate, and analyze intelligence related to election security, including counter-intelligence, foreign and other malign influence and cybersecurity," Gabbard wrote.

Experts had raised legal questions over Gabbard's presence.

"The DNI has authorities set out by statute and they don't include investigating past elections for potential fraud," Robert Litt, who served as the top ODNI lawyer from 2009 to 2017, told Reuters last week.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:28:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VZ7XERIX5VL53EKGAGBB733WYM.jpg?auth=944e2cbb1e297b5ef933aca8f3544d51966d2b6a95fcff84845601bf4f595abe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Washington presses Venezuela interim leader on post-Maduro 'transition'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260203-washington-venezuela-interim-leader-post-maduro-transition</link><description>Venezuela 's interim president Delcy Rodriguez solidified her new government Monday, appointing several cabinet members and meeting with Washington's new top diplomat in Caracas to address the country's "transition" after the ouster of Nicolas Maduro.

Laura Dogu, Washington's charge d'affaires in Venezuela, said on X she spoke with Rodriguez about US plans for "stabilisation, economic recovery, reconciliation and transition."

It was not immediately clear what Dogu meant by a "transition." Maduro had been in power since 2013 until US forces raided the country and captured him, but much of his government remains in place.

Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yvan Gil said after the meeting the diplomatic focus going forward would involve "addressing the differences and historical controversies between the United States and Venezuela."

"We reviewed the common agenda, especially on energy, trade, and politics," he added.

In addition to meeting with Dogu, Rodriguez made several key appointments to her presidential cabinet, including tapping former foreign minister Felix Plasencia to lead Venezuela's diplomatic mission in the United States.

"Very soon we'll have our diplomatic representative, Felix Plasencia, in Washington to accelerate diplomatic work, political work, and the work of developing our common agenda," Gil said.

Plasencia's appointment marks a pivotal change in diplomatic relations between Caracas and Washington, which were severed in 2019 after the United States refused to recognise Maduro's reelection and instead supported a parallel government led by then-opposition leader Juan Guaido.

Rodriguez also appointed Daniella Cabello -- the daughter of Venezuela's powerful interior minister, Diosdado Cabello -- as her cabinet's tourism minister.

The elder Cabello was widely considered to be Venezuela's second-most powerful figure after Maduro, and his backing for Rodriguez's government is seen as critical.

Cabello pledged the police's support for Rodriguez when she became country's leader after Maduro was ousted in a deadly US military operation last month and whisked away to New York to stand trial on drug charges.

The appointments come weeks after Rodriguez, formerly the vice president, cleared ranks among the country's top military brass, appointing 12 senior officers to regional commands.

Among those she dismissed was businessman Alex Saab, the minister of industry under Maduro and a close ally of the former president.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado meanwhile told reporters during a video call Monday that she would be willing to meet with Rodriguez "if it's necessary" in order to establish a "transition timeline."

"If it's necessary to exchange ideas in a meeting to define a transition timeline, it will happen," she said according to a transcript.

However, she added that Rodriguez's interim government "is still the mafia. They may have another name, but they are the mafia."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 04:30:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b23c7174-00a1-11f1-96a9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/81eb07c1b81016a111c6c03f6e71200b3cafeb22.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi calls for 'equal, multipolar world' as he meets Uruguay leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/chinas-xi-calls-equal-multipolar-world-he-meets-uruguay-leader-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China and Uruguay should should work together to advance an "equal and orderly multipolar world", President Xi Jinping told his counterpart Yamandu Orsi on Tuesday, according to a media pool report.

Orsi said Uruguay would like to intensify "trade in goods, especially through diversification, and to invest much more strongly in the area of ​​trade in services and investment," according to the pool report.

China and Uruguay's strategic partnership "is going through its best moment," he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both countries to "commit to raising it to a new level."

While traditional export sectors like meat and soy have played a central role in the relationship, others such as dairy present considerable potential, said Dr Diego Telias, a professor at the Universidad ORT Uruguay and an associate researcher at ICLAC, an institute that studies the impact of Chinese capital in Latin America.

A gap also remains in the area of service exports, he said, "an area in which Uruguay has successfully engaged with markets such as the United States, the United Kingdom and Europe, but not yet with China."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:35:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PGNWVOBW3NMRVLAZCIXD2OV32U.jpg?auth=1620ddb1e97a389e6926bc8cae4cb58f728122ca7bdc8964c67ca93335de48d9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran president gives go-ahead for talks with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/iran-president-gives-go-ahead-talks-with-us-2026-02-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Talks with the U.S. should be pursued to secure national interests as long as "threats and unreasonable expectations" are avoided, President Masoud Pezeshkian posted on X on Tuesday.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

The plan was discussed on several occasions in December and January between Ukrainian, European and American officials and would involve a multi-tiered response to any breaches of an agreed armistice by Russia, the report said.

Envoys from Kyiv, Moscow and Washington will meet in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday and Thursday for talks aimed at ending the war, FT said.

As per the proposal, any Russian breach of a ceasefire would prompt a response within 24 hours, starting with a diplomatic warning and, if necessary, action by Ukrainian army to halt the infraction, the newspaper said.

If hostilities continued beyond that, the proposal would move to a second phase of intervention using forces from the so-called coalition of the willing, which includes many EU members and the UK, Norway, Iceland and Turkey, the report said.

The report added that in the case of an expanded attack, a coordinated response by a Western-backed force, incorporating the U.S. military would be triggered 72 hours after the initial breach.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 05:37:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia is ready for a new world with no nuclear limits, Ryabkov says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-is-ready-new-world-with-no-nuclear-limits-ryabkov-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russia is ready for the new reality of a world with no nuclear arms control limits after the New START treaty expires later this week, Russia's point man for arms control said on Tuesday.

Unless Moscow and Washington reach a last-minute bilateral understanding of some kind, the New START treaty, signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, will expire on February 5.

"The lack of an answer is also an answer," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted by state news agency TASS as saying in Beijing on the absence of a response from Washington on Russian proposals to extend the limits of New START.

Russia was ready for the new reality of the world's two largest nuclear powers having no limits for the first time in decades, Ryabkov said.

He also said Russia supported China's position on arms control.

On Iran, he said the United States' proposals to Iran were tantamount to ultimatums.

He said that if the U.S. pumped lots of missile defence systems onto Greenland then Russia would have to take compensatory measures in its military sphere.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 06:53:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PYHLSES2URNMNGNRBTS7BSUEDI.jpg?auth=a9f8ca0e74868220157a9215d34b8075325d0cff95131d2dd05afa97dde55556&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran’s president Pezeshkian seeks 'fair and equitable negotiations' with US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260203-live-iran-s-president-pezeshkian-seeks-fair-and-equitable-negotiations-with-us</link><description>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told CNN that he believed a nuclear deal with the US was achievable.

"So if that is the case, I am confident that we can achieve a deal," he added.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has ordered the start of nuclear talks with the United States, as his US counterpart Donald Trump threatened "bad things" if no deal with the Islamic Republic was struck.

"Taking into account demands from friendly regional countries to respond ‍to the US ​President's suggestion for talks, I instructed the foreign ‌minister to prepare the ground for ‍equitable and fair negotiations ... should an atmosphere free of threats and unreasonable ‍expectations arise," Pezeshkian wrote on social media.

Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkey, Iranian and U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday, and U.S. President Donald Trump warned that with big U.S. warships heading to Iran, bad things would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

The East African country enacted the Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2023, defying pressure from Western governments as well as local and international rights groups.

Described as one of the world's harshest laws targeting the LGBT community, it carries a sentence of life in prison for same-sex intercourse and imposes the death penalty in cases deemed "aggravated".

That categorisation includes repeat offences, gay sex that transmits terminal illness, or same-sex intercourse with a minor, an elderly person or a person with disabilities.

The then 20-year-old man from Soroti in northeastern Uganda spent nearly a year on remand after he was detained in August 2023 and charged with aggravated homosexuality , his lawyer Douglas Mawadri told Reuters on Tuesday.

The man was accused of "unlawful sexual intercourse" with a 41-year-old man.

During proceedings which lasted more than two years, prosecutors amended the indictment and charged the man with having "carnal knowledge against the order of nature," an offence under Uganda's penal code that carries life imprisonment, Mawadri said.

On Monday "the magistrate discontinued the case upon finding that the accused is of unsound mind after a long detention on remand", Mawadri told Reuters.

Mawadri said the ruling was delivered orally in court and a written version would be available at a later date.

A spokesperson for Uganda's judiciary had no immediate comment.

Uganda's Anti-Homosexuality Act in 2023 drew widespread condemnation an threats of sanctions, and led the World Bank to suspend new funding to Uganda for nearly two years. The U.S. imposed visa restrictions on some Ugandan officials.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 07:43:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics to showcase Italy's Alpine venues</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260203-milan-cortina-winter-olympics-to-showcase-italy-s-alpine-venues</link><description>The 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics open on Friday as the Games return to their traditional heartland of the European Alps for the first time in 20 years, while organisers are praying skiing great Lindsey Vonn is fit to compete.

These Games will use a host of existing venues, meaning they will stretch for 350 kilometres across northern Italy from Cortina – one of the world's iconic skiing locations – to Milan, with other "clusters" spread through the Alps.

Organisers say that avoiding new construction meets the sustainable brief for an event often accused of creating white elephants, but they admit it has added complexity too.

The first Olympics since the re-election of US President Donald Trump are set to be buffeted by global turbulence.

Italy has maintained that it will retain control of all security operations after it emerged that a branch of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) will be sent to Italy in an "advisory" role, sparking anger in the host nation .

Olympic power Russia 's team of just 13 must compete as neutrals, a sanction imposed by the International Olympic Committee after Moscow invaded Ukraine weeks after the last Winter Games in Beijing in 2022.

The sports programme begins on Wednesday, but the Games officially start two days later with a spectacular opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium in Milan featuring performances from US singer Mariah Carey and Italian opera star Andrea Bocelli.

US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected to attend.

When the full programme of sport gets under way, all eyes will be on Vonn, whose comeback at 41 could be the storyline of this Olympics, provided she can recover from the hard fall she suffered in a World Cup race in Crans-Montana, Switzerland , on Friday.

Following the crash, Vonn said she had injured her left knee, the joint that was fortified with titanium in surgery which allowed her to return to the circuit last year after retiring in 2019.

Vonn insisted "my Olympic dream is not over" and she is due to give an update on Tuesday.

Also eagerly awaited is the men's ice hockey competition, with stars from the National Hockey League (NHL) in the US and Canada – the world's strongest – taking part for the first time since 2014.

Kirsty Coventry, the new IOC president, is also under scrutiny as she oversees her first Games since her election as the movement's first woman leader in March.

Coventry admitted that the approach of using existing venues, which are often long distances apart, has complicated the task for organisers.

"I think initially we all thought, 'oh, well, we'll just have it be a little bit more dispersed because that's more sustainable'. Yes, that is very true, but it has added additional complexities in the delivery of the Games," the Zimbabwean said.

Two of the new venues, the sliding centre in Cortina for the bobsleigh , skeleton and luge events and the main ice hockey arena in Milan have caused the most headaches.

The location of the sliding centre became a political hot potato after the IOC initially said those events would have to be held at existing sites in Switzerland or Austria .

But the insistence in late 2023 of Italy's Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini that the events be held in Italy led to a breakneck race to build a track in Cortina, where the 1956 Winter Olympics were held.

Construction didn't start until February 2024, sparking open opposition from the IOC, but it was completed just in time for pre-approval in March last year – a win for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni 's hard-right government.

Meanwhile, repeated delays to the construction of the main ice hockey arena, located in the Santa Giulia district on the outskirts of Milan, led to uncertainty right up until last month over the participation of the NHL players.

Those doubts weren't removed until the successful hosting of a test event at the venue less than a month ago.

Organisers admitted on Sunday that some parts of the Santa Giulia venue are unfinished, but insisted all the scheduled games there would go ahead.

Milan-Cortina estimate the final bill for the Olympics will be 5.2 billion euros ($6 bn). Of that 3.5 bn euros is going on infrastructure and 1.7 bn euros on staging the Games.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 07:43:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c98d7ace-00b7-11f1-ab95-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/cb249e23735e3970895f52c961aa8e42f635f3fc.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysian court acquits French man facing possible death penalty on drug charges</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260203-malaysian-court-acquits-french-man-facing-possible-death-penalty-on-drug-charges</link><description>A French national facing a possible death penalty in Malaysia on eight drug-related charges was acquitted Tuesday, freeing him after nearly two and a half years in detention .

The High Court in the northern city of Alor Setar ruled that prosecutors failed to prove that Tom Félix, 34, had control, custody or possession of the drugs in the case.

"The accused is, therefore, released and acquitted," Alor Setar High Court judge Evawani Farisyta Mohammad said.

Félix, in court wearing a white shirt and trousers, his hands cuffed, looked visibly pleased as the judge delivered the decision.

The former Veolia executive appeared to have lost a considerable amount of weight since his arrest, his parents said.

Jean Luc and Sylvie Félix were seen embracing after the ruling.

Félix and his Malaysian business partner were detained in 2023 after police discovered 1.86 kilograms of cannabis in the common area of a home they shared.

Authorities later said Félix was also found in possession of 11.7 grams of the drug.

He denied all the charges.

If convicted, Félix faced the death penalty or a cumulative sentence of 104 years in prison, 54 strokes of the cane and a 27,000 euro ($31,000) fine, his mother previously told AFP.

Drug trafficking and possession are serious offences in Malaysia, which still allows capital punishment for cases involving large quantities of narcotics.

However, death sentences are no longer mandatory, and no executions have been carried out since 2018.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 08:41:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/565240f6-00d2-11f1-b344-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-47K42W9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit searches French office of Musk's X</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/paris-prosecutors-cybercrime-unit-searches-french-office-musks-x-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Paris prosecutor's office said a search was underway at the French offices of Elon Musk's social media network X on Tuesday as part of an investigation opened in January 2025 .

There was no immediate comment from X.

The Paris prosecutor's office said it launched the investigation after being contacted by a lawmaker alleging that biased algorithms in X were likely to have distorted the operation of an automated data processing system.

Although pro-government pollsters put Fidesz ahead, the 21 Institute poll published by news site 24.hu was the second this week to put Tisza ahead and show Our Homeland winning enough seats to enter parliament.

Nationalist Orban faces the biggest challenge to his rule since Fidesz swept to victory in 2010 although the outcome remains highly uncertain, with opinion polls showing that many voters are still undecided.

The 21 Institute poll, conducted between January 28 and February 2, put Tisza on 35% support among all voters, up from 34% in December. Fidesz was on 28% support, up from 26%.

The poll showed 53% of decided voters supported Tisza and 37% backed Fidesz, a similar level to December.

The poll showed that Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) would be the only other party to pass the 5% threshold required for entry into parliament.

A Publicus Institute poll published on Monday by Nepszava newspaper showed 48% of decided voters supporting Tisza and 40% backing Fidesz, with Our Homeland on more than 5% support. It also showed 27% of voters were undecided, after 31% in December.

Tisza is led by former government insider Peter Magyar who has said his party would curb corruption, unlock billions of euros in frozen European Union funds to boost the economy, and firmly anchor Hungary in the EU and NATO.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:43:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DE5I3T2RVZPU5CPTE3Y7VIIPAQ.jpg?auth=7f1063af919eed20fc088f7564ad654e5e02101542d94535043751d1416ee011&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland detains Defence Ministry employee suspected of collaborating with Russia, Onet reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-detains-defence-ministry-employee-suspected-collaborating-with-russia-2026-02-03/</link><description>WARSAW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Poland's Military Counterintelligence Service has detained an employee of the Defence Ministry suspected of collaborating with Russian intelligence, news website Onet reported citing sources.

Australia in December became the first country to ban social media for children under 16.

Trump said on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to stop striking Kyiv and "various towns" during cold weather.

The Kremlin said the truce would last until Sunday but did not link it to the subzero temperatures.

Russia hit Kyiv "in the bitter cold with another massive strike" overnight, Tymur Tkachenko, the head of the city's military administration, said Tuesday on Telegram.

The emergency services said in a later post that three people in Kyiv had been wounded.

Kyiv ​Mayor ⁠Vitali Klitschko said ‍that ​1,170 residential ​buildings in the capital were left without ‍heating following the strikes.

In the eastern city of Kharkiv, two people were wounded by Russian shelling, regional military chief Oleg Synegubov said.

The hours-long attack targeted energy infrastructure and aimed to "cause maximum destruction ... and leave the city without heat during severe frost", Synegubov wrote on Telegram.

Authorities had to cut heating to more than 800 homes to prevent the wider network from freezing, he said, urging people to go to round-the-clock "invincibility points" around the city if they needed to warm up.

Overnight temperatures plunged to minus 17C in Kyiv and sank as low as minus 23C in Kharkiv.

Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday said Russia was prioritising more attacks over peace talks , after Moscow fired dozens of missiles and hundreds of drones at Ukraine overnight.

"Taking advantage of the coldest days of winter to terrorise people is more important to Russia than turning to diplomacy," Zelensky wrote on social media, adding Russian forces had attacked with "more than 70 missiles in total, as well as 450 attack drones."

Russia's invasion of Ukraine will hit the four-year mark on February 24.

Washington has sought to craft a peace settlement between both sides, but the first round of trilateral talks held in Abu Dhabi last weekend failed to yield a breakthrough.

A second round is due to begin on Wednesday in the Emirati capital.

Zelensky said on Monday that recent "de-escalation" with Russia was helping build trust in negotiations, apparently referring to a break in attacks on energy facilities.

But territory remains a sticking point, and the warring sides have not yet shown willingness for compromise.

Russia wants full control of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region, which Kyiv has ruled out, saying such a move would only embolden Moscow.

After failing in its aim of a lightning offensive to capture Kyiv and topple Ukraine's leadership in a matter of days in 2022, Russia has been bogged down in the face of Ukrainian defences and is now mounting a grinding advance that has come at huge human cost.

Moscow's troops accelerated their advance in Ukraine throughout January, capturing almost twice as much land as in the previous month, according to an AFP analysis.

Russia seized 481 square kilometres in January, analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War, which works with the Critical Threats Project, showed.

The January gains were up from 244 square kilometres in December 2025 and one of the largest advances during a winter month since Russia invaded four years ago.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 09:45:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/498a3cb6-00cd-11f1-980d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/1693e0e5307de4a5fd9cffaa89fd6f0505740d2e.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's tariff cut spells relief in India despite scant details</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/trumps-tariff-cut-spells-relief-india-despite-scant-details-2026-02-03/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's move to slash tariffs on Indian imports sparked a relief rally across the Asian country's markets on Tuesday, lifting sentiment among exporters and policymakers even as details of the agreement remained scant.

Trump announced a trade deal with India on Monday to cut tariffs to 18% from 50% in exchange for New Delhi halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers.

But Trump's social media post was not followed by any details of the deal from the White House or the Indian government.

An Indian government official said India has agreed to buy petroleum, defence goods and aircraft from the U.S., while partly opening up its guarded agriculture sector under the agreement .

New Delhi has also lowered tariffs on imported cars to address Washington's immediate demands, according to the official.

Trump said India will buy more American goods with purchases rising to over $500 billion, including energy, coal, technology, agricultural and other products. He did not specify any time-frame.

"India's tariff agreement with the U.S. removes its earlier disadvantage versus peers," said Neelkanth Mishra, chief economist at Axis Bank.

The deal helps affected Indian gems and jewellery, leather, plastics, ceramics and auto components and non-tech foreign investment, he added.

Among Asian peers, U.S. tariffs on goods from Indonesia stand at 19% while the rate for Vietnam and Bangladesh stands at 20%.

India's exports to the U.S. rose 15.88% year-on-year to $85.5 billion in January-November, while imports stood at $46.08 billion, Indian government data showed.

The announcement of the trade deal has reduced a great deal of global uncertainty, India's economic affairs secretary , Anuradha Thakur, said at an event in New Delhi on Tuesday.

It also lifted investor sentiment . India's benchmark stock index, the Nifty 50 (.NSEI) , opens new tab , was up nearly 3% and the rupee climbed over 1% to 90.40 per dollar in early trading.

"Lower tariffs will not only improve price competitiveness but also help Indian exporters integrate more deeply into U.S. supply chains,” said S.C. Ralhan, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.

Reduction in U.S. tariffs on most Indian goods will reinvigorate India's exports to the U.S., Moody's Ratings said in a statement.

Despite the announcement by Trump and a post on X from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, details of the deal remain scant.

Indian refiners will need a wind-down period to complete Russian oil deals before imports from that country can be halted, and they have so far not been ordered by the government to stop such imports, Reuters reported .

The Kremlin said it had heard no statements from India about halting purchases of Russian oil.

Moody's said immediately stopping Russian oil imports could be disruptive to India’s economic growth.

"A complete shift toward non-Russian oil could also tighten supply elsewhere, raise prices and pass through to higher inflation given that India is one of the world’s largest oil importers,” it said.

The India-U.S. trade deal will ensure more exports of American farm products to India's massive market, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said in a post on social media, without giving any details.

In the past, India's trade deals have typically excluded some sensitive farm and dairy items, as New Delhi maintains the need to protect millions of subsistence farmers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:40:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KEMCEHU52FM2NAD7TRLXKQDOBM.jpg?auth=3d740c864e9d6dd0b664e264955c281d154114f7be4e07c785529dd6f63103df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian police say 139 foreigners arrested over unrest in Yazd province</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-police-say-139-foreigners-arrested-over-unrest-yazd-province-2026-02-03/</link><description>DUBAI, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Iranian police said 139 foreign nationals have so far been arrested in the central province of Yazd for their participation in recent protests, the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Tuesday, without specifying their nationalities.

Yazd, a predominantly desert province with a relatively small population above 1 million, was one of many provinces affected by nationwide protests in January.

The protests, which started in December over economic hardships and quickly turned political, were repressed in the most violent crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The official death toll stands at 3,117, although rights groups say many more people have been killed. U.S.-based rights group HRANA has said that nearly 50,000 people have so far been arrested.

Authorities blame Israel and the United States for fomenting the violence.

"These (foreign) individuals played an active role in organising, inciting, and directing riotous actions, and in some cases were in contact with networks abroad," Yazd's police commander Ahmad Negahban was quoted as saying by Tasnim.

Judicial authorities have warned of severe consequences for unrest-linked detainees who committed violent acts.

"Those who played a role in this American sedition and supported it will not be spared," Iran's judiciary spokesperson Asghar Jahangir said on Tuesday.

Iranian media reported on Monday the arrest of four foreigners in Tehran over last month's unrest, a shift from earlier reports announcing daily arrests of suspected protest ringleaders without pointing to foreign nationals.

Following a 12-day war in June in which Israel relied on agents within Iran for its early offensive, Tehran accelerated a campaign to deport mainly Afghan nationals, who represent the largest foreign community in the country.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:40:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea president keeps mines minister in post-election government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-president-keeps-mines-minister-post-election-government-2026-02-03/</link><description>CONAKRY, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Guinea President Mamady Doumbouya, who came to power in a coup and was sworn in for a seven-year term last month, has retained his mines minister but appointed new ministers of finance, justice and security as part of his government.

The former special forces commander, thought to be in his early 40s, has been leading the West African nation since seizing power in 2021.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou , where a massive mining project was launched in November.

The following month, Doumbouya won the presidential election that completed the return to civilian rule. Last week, Doumbouya announced that Amadou Oury Bah would stay on as prime minister.

According to a decree read on Monday night on state television, Mariama Cire Sylla, a former World Bank country representative who had been serving as agriculture minister, will now lead the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Budget.

Ibrahima Sory Tounkara, who acted as a judge during a trial for a 2009 stadium massacre that killed more than 150 people, was appointed justice minister.

General Ahmed Mohamed Diallo was named minister of security and civil protection.

The mines minister, Bouna Sylla, was first appointed to the role in 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WFFOGPAH2FPODDL5ZDIDSQY2MI.jpg?auth=0300683d85ba1f984c9d6f5d5603676020330ce5131bd04705337c0060a8d11a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO's Rutte says reaching deal to end war will require tough choices</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/natos-rutte-says-reaching-deal-end-war-will-require-tough-choices-2026-02-03/</link><description>KYIV, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Reaching a peace deal to end Russia's war in Ukraine will require tough choices, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said on Tuesday.

Iran and the United States will resume nuclear talks on Friday in Turkey, Iranian and U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump warned that with big U.S. warships heading to Iran, "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

The UAE, a highly influential Gulf Arab power and close U.S. ally, said a long-term solution was needed.

"I think that the region has gone through various calamitous confrontations. I don't think we need another one, but I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don't have these issues every other day," the UAE president's adviser Anwar Gargash told a panel at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will meet in Istanbul in an effort to revive diplomacy over a long-running dispute about Iran's nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war. A regional diplomat said representatives from countries such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt would also participate.

The U.S. naval buildup near Iran follows a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded Tehran make nuclear concessions and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was "seriously talking", while Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said arrangements for negotiations were under way.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former officials.

In high-level meetings, officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown - the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long rejected all three demands as unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

In June last year the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets , joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work has stopped.

Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show some repair work since December, with new roofing over two previously destroyed buildings. No other rebuilding was visible, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KQW4J4IZ4JPCFA4XU24M2GTG5M.jpg?auth=53de3ac8191085788961bd5a0f48c9f842113c79e46782fb50e3a5b17222ce65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisia upholds and increases jail terms for opponents and security officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisia-upholds-increases-jail-terms-opponents-security-officials-2026-02-03/</link><description>TUNIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - A Tunisian appeal court on Tuesday upheld and increased lengthy prison sentences on high-profile politicians, including opposition leader Rached Ghannouchi and former security officials, as part of a crackdown on dissent.

Among those sentenced on charges of conspiring against the state in the mass trial were Nadia Akacha, the former chief of staff to President Kais Saied.

Akacha, who was sentenced in absentia after fleeing abroad, received a 35-year jail term, TAP state news agency said.

Rached Ghannouchi, 84, veteran head of the Islamist-leaning Ennahda party, was handed an increased 20-year prison sentence, up from the previous 14-year term.

Ghannouchi, who was speaker of the elected parliament dissolved by Saied in 2021, has been in prison since 2023. With this new sentence, the total sentences against him on several charges rise to 50 years.

A total of 21 were charged in the conspiracy case, with 10 already in custody and 11 having fled the country.

The court upheld 35-year sentences against former intelligence chief Kamel Guizani, former foreign minister Rafik Abdessalem, and Mouadh Ghannouchi, the son of Rached Ghannouchi. All three are outside the country.

The accused deny the charges, arguing that the case has been politically fabricated to silence Saied's opponents.

Most opposition leaders, some journalists and critics of Saied, have been imprisoned since he seized control of most powers in 2021.

Saied dissolved parliament in 2021 and began ruling by decree, then dissolved the independent Supreme Judicial Council and sacked dozens of judges, a move that opposition figures called a coup which undermined the nascent democracy that in 2011 sparked the Arab Spring uprisings.

Saied rejects the accusations and says his steps are legal and aim to end years of chaos and corruption within the political elite.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BZWI4CJLFVKO7A5E2L6O6BVEUY.jpg?auth=e9e6b41272547a8a252ebc02963c4bbd36a1b747fcbe98be31e21c759670ae5e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO's Rutte to meet Zelenskiy in Kyiv, FT says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/natos-rutte-meet-zelenskiy-kyiv-ft-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has arrived in Kyiv and will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, a Financial Times correspondent said in a post on X.

The boy, named in local media as Austin Appelbee , made it across four kilometres of ocean to raise the alarm.

He had gone out kayaking and paddle-boarding on the water Friday afternoon with his family.

But the waves soon grew, flipping their boards and filling their kayak with water as they were dragged further out into the ocean.

"I was really scared," the young teen told reporters.

"I was just thinking in my head, like thinking I was going to make it through. But I was also thinking about all my friends at school, and friends at my Christian youth," he said.

"I just said: 'Alright, not today, not today, not today. I have to keep on going'."

The youngster said he started heading for shore with just his life jacket but later abandoned it to swim unencumbered.

"I was very puffed out, but I couldn't feel how tired I was."

The boy said he was trying to think of happy things, at one point singing the "Thomas the Tank Engine" theme song.

"At this time, you know, the waves are massive, and I have no life jacket on. So anyway, I just keep swimming. I do breaststroke. I do freestyle. Survival backstroke."

When he reached the beach, the teen said he called emergency services and asked them to deploy boats, helicopters and planes.

"My family is out at sea," he told them.

Marine rescue volunteer Paul Bresland said the teen's four-hour swim saved his family.

A search helicopter found his mother and two children wearing life jackets and clinging to a paddleboard at 8:30pm, police said. They had drifted 14 kilometres from the tourist town of Quindalup after spending up to 10 hours in the water.

"He swam, he reckons, the first two hours with a life jacket on," Bresland told national broadcaster ABC.

"And the brave fella thought he's not going to make it with a life jacket on, so he ditched it, and he swam the next two hours without a life jacket.

"I thought, mate, that is incredible," said Bresland, describing the boy's efforts as "superhuman".

Police inspector James Bradley said the boy's actions "cannot be praised highly enough".

"His determination and courage ultimately saved the lives of his mother and siblings," he told the ABC.

The boy's mother, named in local media as Joanne, has also been praised for keeping her family alive during hours out at sea with her other son, 12-year-old Beau, and eight-year-old daughter Grace.

"It seemed nice and calm to begin with," the mother told reporters.

"One of the hardest decisions I've ever had to make was to say to Austin: 'Try and get to shore and get some help, this could get really serious really quickly'," the mother was quoted as saying.

"As the sun went down I thought: 'Something's gone terribly wrong here', and my fear was that Austin didn't make it," she said.

"Everything goes through your head."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 10:41:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a9f26f36-00e8-11f1-9acd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26034352526728.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit raids X’s French office</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260203-paris-prosecutor-s-cybercrime-unit-raids-x-s-french-office</link><description>The ⁠Paris prosecutor's office said a search was under way at the French offices of ​Elon Musk's social media network ‍X on Tuesday as part of an ​investigation opened in January 2025 .

Trump, who has voiced a desire for American dominance over all of Latin America, has in recent months had an up-and-down relationship with Petro, a former anti-imperialist guerrilla who was elected Colombia's president in 2022.

In October, Trump called Petro an " illegal drug leader " though he provided no evidence, and in January, he floated military action against the longtime ally, which he has accused of failing to control the narcotics trade.

Petro, for his part, has been harshly critical of the U.S. president. He has said the Trump administration's deadly strikes on alleged drug boats amount to war crimes, and he described the U.S. operation last month deposing Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro as a "kidnapping."

In January, the two leaders held a phone call that both described positively, a surprise thaw that resulted in Petro's invitation to Washington. Trump told reporters on Monday that Petro's tone had changed of late, implying that he had become more acquiescent after the Maduro raid.

"We're gonna have a good meeting," Trump said.

Still, if the two men have anything in common, it is that they behave unpredictably, speak elliptically and change opinions quickly. One Colombian source acknowledged that the meeting could be "tense" given the sometimes stubborn personalities of the two presidents.

At the Tuesday meeting, Colombian officials plan to deliver a detailed presentation on their main anti-drug achievements, including cocaine seizure figures, said three sources with knowledge of the matter.

Will Freeman, fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the meeting could go smoothly if Petro sticks to discussing counternarcotics matters, rather than broader philosophical disagreements.

"But everything we know about both presidents' personalities suggests that's not going to happen," he said.

If the two leaders fail to reach a more lasting rapprochement, it could have profound implications for regional security, analysts said.

Colombia is the world's top producer of coca, the main ingredient in cocaine, and hosts several U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. But it has also been one of Washington's staunchest allies in the region, working closely with successive administrations to suppress drug flows northward.

Under Petro, coca production in Colombia has climbed, though the exact figures are a matter of dispute. Bogota argues that while the government has shifted away from forced eradication - a policy that can harm subsistence farmers - it has ramped up seizures and more sophisticated interdiction efforts.

For foreign leaders, meetings with Trump can be fraught, and many have resorted to flattery to minimize tension with the president and his advisers.

It was far from clear, however, that Petro - who has positioned himself as a thorn in Washington's side for almost all of his career - will choose that route.

Last week, he urged Colombian migrants to return from Chile, Argentina and the United States so as not to be treated like "slaves." He also said it is better to live in Havana than in Miami, which he described as traffic-clogged and cultureless.

Colombia has requested the meeting be held in private, a Colombian official said. But Trump, who is famously media-hungry, often asks reporters to enter the Oval Office at the last minute.

Petro himself has struck an upbeat if lofty tone.

"I think we should fill ourselves with optimism," Petro told public television station RTVC before departing for Washington. "I'll be expecting you on Tuesday, when I am meeting with the president, to be in all the public squares, to build the chain of affection, the certainty of love."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:35:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N2V23VGRIZJSJJXKV4U2UYRRX4.jpg?auth=814e195bd49b35707e9f3a5587f06129c1434e6a84d25225f5e3903d342b3251&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China to ban 'hidden' car door handles to address safety fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-ban-hidden-car-door-handles-address-safety-fears-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China will ban 'hidden' car door handles from 2027, becoming the first country to phase out a design pioneered by Tesla (TSLA.O) , opens new tab and adopted by Chinese competitors including Xiaomi (1810.HK) , opens new tab .

The hidden handle design, which functions through a key fob or mobile phone or by manually pressing it, has drawn scrutiny in both the United States and China over potential safety risks.

Last year, the U.S. auto safety agency opened a defect probe into Tesla Model 3 sedan's emergency door release controls. Tesla, which did not comment on the investigation at the time, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

China's industry ministry said on Monday that under its new safety technical requirements, every car door should be equipped with both exterior and interior handles.

Mechanical release designs will be mandatory, with innovations such as electrical handles optional.

China's new policy sets out rules for where handles must be located on the outside of a car and how they should function to ensure that they can be opened in the event of an accident. It also requires interior handles to be clearly visible.

New vehicle models must align their door handle design with the new regulation from January 1, 2027 while approved models will come under the rules by January 1, 2029, the ministry said.

Chinese state media reported in October that the driver of a Xiaomi SU7 Ultra sedan died in an accident after passers-by were unable to open the door to pull him out of the burning vehicle.

Xiaomi, which has not commented publicly on the incident, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:36:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLUV7BCNUFPKXAXRNFUXQ6C4R4.jpg?auth=ad5747dd77d44ba679c1d292f5b5631b88a4f4b6c2940bb6d2715f44ee2549c3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland foreign minister hopeful to find common ground with US that will respect its red lines</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland-foreign-minister-hopeful-find-common-ground-with-us-that-will-respect-2026-02-03/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt said on Tuesday that she was hopeful and optimistic that the Arctic island would find common ground with the United States that respected its red lines .

"On the second of February, WHO and partners supported the medical evacuation of five patients and seven companions to Egypt via the Rafah crossing," said WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier.

"It was the first medical evacuation through this route since sometime in 2025," he said referring to a limited number of evacuations during an early 2025 ceasefire.

Over 18,500 patients are awaiting evacuations after the two-year war, he said, with trauma injuries from the war as well as chronic conditions such as cancer and diabetes.

A UNICEF spokesperson said that more than 3,000 of them were children. Gaza health authorities are choosing whom to prioritise among the sick and wounded, Lindmeier said.

"We know that patients have died basically waiting for evacuation, and that's something which is horrible when you know just a few miles or kilometers outside that border, help is available," he added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:37:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DOMDLH2QORM6TLRPTFSLASXBFA.jpg?auth=036104a8718a3589f5f14195f783b5da77f6cf5aa13b31289d3cd6c64535d1e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway parliament supports monarchy despite scandals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/norway-parliament-supports-monarchy-despite-scandals-2026-02-03/</link><description>OSLO, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Norway's parliament on Tuesday voted overwhelmingly in favour of maintaining the country's monarchy, rejecting a proposed change to a republic, despite recent turmoil in the king's family and an opinion poll showing a dip in popular support for the royals.

In the long-planned vote, 141 of parliament's 169 members supported the continuation of the monarchy, while 26 members cast ballots in favour of ending the reign of King Harald and his descendants, according to the official tally.

Supporters of the monarchy say the institution brings stability by being above partisan politics and that it has served Norway well since independence from Sweden in 1905.

Republican proponents argue that political power already rests with Norway's elected parliament and the government, adding that the inherited privilege of the royals does not belong in a democratic society.

"The sponsors seek to amend the constitution so that Norway's head of state is elected by the people, that is, a president," read the now-failed proposal from a group of seven members of parliament representing parties from across the political spectrum.

Still, Crown Princess Mette-Marit was criticised by the prime minister on Monday who said she had displayed poor judgement in having contacts with Jeffrey Epstein , following fresh reports of her ties with the late U.S. sex offender.

On Saturday, Mette-Marit, the spouse of the heir to the throne, Haakon, apologised for the contact, which occurred in the years after Epstein was found guilty of child sex crimes in 2008.

An opinion poll conducted on Monday for Norwegian daily Verdens Gang found that 61% of Norwegians favour keeping their royals in place, down from 72% last year, while support for a republic rose 10 percentage points to 27%, the survey released on Tuesday showed.

Asked whether Mette-Marit should become Norway's next queen, 44% said no while only 33% said yes, while the rest did not express an opinion, the survey of 1,014 respondents by polling institute InFact showed.

Separately on Tuesday, Mette-Marit's son from a previous relationship, Marius Hoiby, 29, went on trial . He has been accused of rape, domestic violence, assault and drug possession. He was arrested again at the weekend on suspicion of further crimes.

Hoiby has denied the most serious accusations against him, including those of rape and domestic violence, while admitting to some lesser charges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 11:37:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AMXTCUICZVJP7OQ5ZFX6UOWXE4.jpg?auth=ce010ea1c09c43572075b39600019df4b2787ae3f8928b015bfe253595cdb512&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why are French prosecutors investigating Elon Musk's X?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/technology/why-are-french-prosecutors-investigating-elon-musks-x-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors said on Tuesday they were widening an investigation into Elon Musk's social media platform X and that they have summoned the tech billionaire for questioning in April.

Numerous small armed vessels attempted to contact the vessel via VHF radio, but it ignored requests to stop and continued on its planned route, the agency said.

The strait links the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea beyond.

OPEC members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the strait, mainly to Asia.

Three vessels, two in 2023 and one in 2024, were seized by Iran near or in the strait.

Here are some reactions from governments and regulators since the start of January as well as xAI's response:

The European Commission on January 26 opened an investigation into whether Grok disseminates illegal content such as manipulated sexualised images in the EU. The probe will examine whether X assesses and mitigates risks as required under the bloc's digital rules.

Britain's media regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation to determine whether sexually intimate deepfakes produced by Grok violated its duty to protect people in the UK from potentially illegal content, under the Online Safety Act.

The Information Commissioner's Office - Britain's privacy watchdog - launched its own investigation on February 3, saying the reported creation of the sexualised images, including of children, raised serious concerns under UK data protection law.

Paris prosecutor's cybercrime unit raided X's office in Paris on February 3 and ordered Musk to face questions in April regarding a widening investigation over alleged algorithmic bias, complicity in the detention and diffusion of images of child‑pornographic nature and the violation of a person’s image rights with sexually explicit deepfakes.

Germany's media minister said EU rules provided tools to tackle illegal content and alleged the problem risked turning into the "industrialisation of sexual harassment."

Italy's data protection authority warned that using AI tools to create "undressed" deepfake imagery of real people without consent could amount to serious privacy violations or criminal offences.

Swedish political leaders condemned Grok-generated sexualised content after reporting that imagery involving Sweden's deputy prime minister was produced from a user prompt.

India's IT ministry sent X a formal notice on January 2 over alleged Grok-enabled creation or sharing of obscene sexualised images, directing that the content be taken down and requiring a report on actions being taken within 72 hours.

Japan also probed X over Grok, stating that the government would consider every option to prevent the generation of inappropriate images.

Indonesia said it had blocked access to Grok, a move meant to protect women and children from AI-generated fake pornographic content, citing the country's strict anti‑pornography laws.

Malaysia restored access to Grok in January for its users after X implemented additional safety measures.

The Philippines will reinstate access to Grok after its developer pledged to remove image-manipulation tools that had sparked child-safety concerns, the country's cybercrime investigation unit said in January.

California's governor and attorney general said on January 14 they were demanding answers from xAI amid the spread of non-consensual sexual images on the platform.

Canada's privacy watchdog said it was widening an existing investigation into X after reports that Grok was generating non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes.

Brazil's government and federal prosecutors gave xAI 30 days to prevent the chatbot from spreading fake sexualised content.

Australia's regulator eSafety said in January it was investigating Grok-generated sexualised deepfake images, assessing adult material under its image‑based abuse scheme and noting that child-related examples it had reviewed did not meet the legal threshold for child sexual abuse material under Australian law.

HOW HAS xAI RESPONDED?

xAI said on January 14 it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal." It did not identify the countries.

It had earlier limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features only to paying subscribers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 13:04:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YDM7ZFTLJJI5LHSR4QJR6TOHHY.jpg?auth=39c4516da4f7542d06b530b413e5dfb1bc77949b544c232b9c0c94ce5cd253de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top EU diplomat to visit Kyrgyzstan for talks on sanctions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/top-eu-diplomat-visit-kyrgyzstan-talks-sanctions-2026-02-03/</link><description>BISHKEK, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Kyrgyzstan said on Tuesday the European Union's sanctions envoy would visit on February 26 after a report that the EU was planning to ban some exports to the Central Asian country for allegedly facilitating Russian sanctions evasion.

Bloomberg News reported last week that the EU was considering the first use of its "last resort" anti-sanctions evasion tool by banning exports of certain categories of goods to Kyrgyzstan.

In a statement, Kyrgyzstan's government said Deputy Prime Minister Daniyar Amangeldiev held a video call with EU envoy David O'Sullivan on Tuesday and they agreed on "constructive and substantive dialogue on sanctions-related issues".

It said further talks would take place during O'Sullivan's visit to Bishkek later this month.

A mountainous country of 7 million people, Kyrgyzstan has enjoyed rapid economic growth in recent years, partly by becoming a main clearinghouse for trade with Russia redirected by Western sanctions imposed on Moscow over its war in Ukraine.

Several Kyrgyz bank and cryptocurrency firms have come under U.S., EU and British sanctions for allegedly facilitating illicit trade with Russia.

Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic, continues to host Russian military bases and is in a customs union with Russia, where many of its citizens work as migrant labourers.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:26:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian security convoy heads to key Kurdish city under US-backed deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-security-convoy-heads-key-kurdish-city-under-us-backed-deal-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - Syrian government security forces moved towards the Kurdish-controlled northeastern city of Qamishli on Tuesday, security sources and witnesses said, as they implement a U.S.-backed deal to bring Kurdish-run regions under the control of Damascus.

The deal, declared on Friday , staved off the prospect of further confrontation between Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which lost swathes of eastern and northern Syria to government troops in January.

The government forces are expected to be stationed in several Syrian state buildings in Qamishli and also at the city's airport, a Syrian official and a Kurdish security source told Reuters ahead of the deployment.

Reuters witnesses said dozens of villagers obstructed a convoy of security forces as it approached the outskirts of the city, the de facto political centre of the Kurdish-led administration.

On Tuesday, interior ministry vehicles entered the ethnically-mixed city of Hasakah, about 80km (47 miles) south of Qamishli.

Friday's accord foresees a phased integration of Kurdish fighters with government forces. The United States has hailed the agreement as a historic milestone towards unity and reconciliation after 14 years of civil war in Syria.

The SDF was once Washington's main Syrian ally, playing a vital part in the fight against Islamic State militants.

But its status weakened as U.S. President Donald Trump built ties with Sharaa, a former al Qaeda commander who has now brought almost all of Syria back under the authority of Damascus.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:27:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H3WRKXRT65NKHM5QCIJ5VY3SNE.jpg?auth=62421b72e45f827feb915ba81c10ea32be20c812d30694fee8b25ab0bcdcef1f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece to soon announce social media ban for children under 15, government source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/greece-soon-announce-social-media-ban-children-under-15-government-source-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>ATHENS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Greece is "very close" to announcing a social media ban for children aged under 15, a senior government source told Reuters on Tuesday.

"Russian investment in their Northern Fleet, and in particular, in their subsurface capabilities, is undiminished," General Gwyn Jenkins, First Sea Lord of the Royal Navy, told French think tank IFRI's naval conference in Paris.

"Despite the horrendous cost in terms of national resource and blood to Russia, of their egregious invasion of Ukraine, they have continued to pump resource into their Northern Fleet and their subsurface capabilities," he said.

Jenkins, who was speaking alongside top navy chiefs from the United States, France, Italy and the Netherlands, said Russia's activity was testing Western capabilities, given how long it took to upgrade, build and develop new vessels in a fast-changing technological environment.

"It doesn't take many assets to fix us as allies, because we have a very low risk tolerance of allowing a aggressive actor operating in our backyard, and that does take a lot of resource to respond to," Jenkins said.

Vice-Admiral Harold Liebregs, commander of the Royal Netherlands Navy echoed Jenkins' comments saying Russia was being increasingly emboldened in the North Sea and loitering over vital infrastructure, possibly preparing further actions.

"We see ships operating drones that fly over our territory, and we see the shadow fleet, or Dark Fleet, that's fueling the Russian war economy, using ships that are ill maintained, not insured, and posing all kinds of liability issues in our precious North Sea," he said.

"I think the main point here is that we should not accept this as the new normal, because it pushes us back in a position where we have less freedom to manoeuvre, and that creates a less suitable strategic position."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 14:30:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M2JZHKKNCNI5ZIKYZ22YY74N2E.jpg?auth=19147dbe047f0d08df81c7f5de6f6956bde3e6044839d99d46742e0523495c5f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Snow causes delays, some cancellations at Frankfurt airport</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/snow-causes-delays-some-cancellations-frankfurt-airport-2026-02-03/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Passengers at Frankfurt airport face delays and isolated flight cancellations on Tuesday due to heavy snowfall, operator Fraport (FRAG.DE) , opens new tab said.

Iran and the United States will discuss Iran's nuclear programme on Friday in Turkey, Iranian and U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump said that with big U.S. warships heading to Iran, "bad things" would probably happen if a deal could not be reached.

A source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday that Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner would take part in the talks, along with U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Kushner's plans. Ministers from other countries in the region are also expected to attend.

An Iranian diplomatic source said Tehran's view of the talks is neither optimistic nor pessimistic, adding that the Islamic Republic's defensive capabilities are non-negotiable and that it is ready for any scenario.

"It remains to be seen whether the United States also intends to conduct serious, result-oriented negotiations or not," the source said.

Iranian sources have said Trump is also seeking to limit Iran's ballistic missile programme, which Iranian officials say is an essential component of the country's defence.

Earlier the UAE, a highly influential Gulf Arab oil producer and close U.S. ally, said the region cannot afford another conflict.

"I think that the region has gone through various calamitous confrontations," the UAE president's adviser Anwar Gargash told a panel at the World Governments Summit in Dubai.

"I don't think we need another one, but I would like to see direct Iranian-American negotiations leading to understandings so that we don't have these issues every other day."

Iran should rebuild its relationship with Washington to reach a wider geo-strategic deal which could help Tehran repair its economy ravaged by U.S. sanctions, Gargash said.

Gulf Arab states are worried that Iran will carry out its threat to target U.S. bases on their territory should Trump attack the Islamic Republic again.

In June, the United States struck Iranian nuclear targets, joining in at the close of a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign. Since then, Tehran has said its uranium enrichment work - which it says is for peaceful, not military purposes - has stopped.

Recent satellite imagery of two of the targeted sites, Isfahan and Natanz, appears to show new roofing over two destroyed buildings but no other signs of rebuilding, according to the imagery provided by Planet Labs and reviewed by Reuters.

The meeting in Istanbul aims to revive diplomacy over the long-running dispute about Iran's nuclear programme and dispel fears of a new regional war.

The U.S. naval buildup near Iran follows a violent crackdown against anti-government demonstrations last month.

Trump, who stopped short of carrying out threats to intervene, has since demanded nuclear concessions from Iran and sent a flotilla to its coast. He said last week Iran was "seriously talking", while Tehran's top security official Ali Larijani said arrangements for negotiations were under way.

The priority of the Istanbul talks is to avoid conflict and de-escalate tension, a regional official told Reuters. Regional powers including Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Egypt, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates were also invited, he said.

Iran’s leadership is increasingly worried a U.S. strike could break its grip on power by driving an already enraged public back onto the streets, according to six current and former officials.

Officials told Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei that public anger over last month's crackdown - the bloodiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution-- has reached a point where fear is no longer a deterrent , four current officials briefed on the discussions said.

Iranian sources told Reuters last week that Trump had demanded three conditions for resumption of talks: Zero enrichment of uranium in Iran, limits on Tehran's ballistic missile programme and ending its support for regional proxies.

Iran has long said all three demands are unacceptable infringements of its sovereignty, but two Iranian officials told Reuters its clerical rulers saw the ballistic missile programme, rather than uranium enrichment, as the bigger obstacle.

One Iranian official said: "Diplomacy is ongoing. For talks to resume, Iran says there should not be preconditions and that it is ready to show flexibility on uranium enrichment, including handing over 400 kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU), accepting zero enrichment under a consortium arrangement as a solution."

Tehran's regional sway has been weakened by Israel's attacks on its proxies - from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and militias in Iraq - as well as by the ousting of Iran's close ally, former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:12:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KQW4J4IZ4JPCFA4XU24M2GTG5M.jpg?auth=53de3ac8191085788961bd5a0f48c9f842113c79e46782fb50e3a5b17222ce65&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutors seek public office bans in Le Pen appeals trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-prosecutors-seek-public-office-bans-le-pen-appeals-trial-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors urged an appeals court on Tuesday to largely confirm a previous court's ruling against French far-right officials in an EU embezzlement trial, without saying yet how this will apply to longtime party chief Marine Le Pen .

The initial ruling, in March last year, was a major setback for Le Pen as it banned her from running for office for five years, effective immediately.

If that ruling is fully confirmed, Le Pen will not be able to run in next year's presidential election. If the ban is substantially shorter, or if there is no ban, she could still take part.

In last year's ruling the court said that Le Pen had been "at the heart" of a scheme to misappropriate more than 4 million euros of EU funds and use them to pay the far-right party's staff back home.

Le Pen told the court in her appeals trial that she had no sense of having done anything wrong, and had appealed against the ruling along with others from her party.

The prosecutor's office wants public office bans to be decided this time too, Thierry Ramonatxo, Advocate General at the Paris General Prosecutor’s Office told the appeals court.

"We will seek office bans," he said. "Parliamentary assistants worked for the party but were paid by Europe. That's the stark reality."

The prosecutors are expected to specify later in the day what sentences they will seek for each of the defendants, including Le Pen, with the ruling expected in the coming weeks or months.

In last year's ruling, Le Pen also received a four-year prison sentence - two years of which are suspended and two years of which are to be served under home detention, as well as a 100,000-euro fine. These were not enforced immediately.

The RN and two dozen party figures were also found guilty of diverting European Parliament funds.

Le Pen has run three times for president.

If she cannot run next year, party president Jordan Bardella looks set to become the RN's candidate.

Bardella, 30, has helped expand the RN's appeal among younger voters though some analysts question whether he has the experience to win over the broader electorate the RN needs to secure victory in 2027.

The appeals court ruling is also subject to appeal though France's highest court, the Cour de Cassation.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:12:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBAPSQV5B5NPNBYSLKGUAZSGTM.jpg?auth=f2763ce51c15d570763edba845197ebe0d6c59f1aee53dab798d4243b613b716&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Somaliland expects Israel trade deal, has minerals to offer, leader says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/somaliland-expects-israel-trade-deal-has-minerals-offer-leader-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Somaliland expects to reach a trade agreement soon with Israel, the first country to recognise its independence, and is willing to offer rights to valuable mineral deposits as part of a deal, its leader said in an interview with Reuters.

Israel in late December became the first country to recognise the Republic of Somaliland, a northeastern part of Somalia that has claimed independence for decades. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said Israel would seek immediate cooperation in agriculture, health, technology and the economy.

Speaking to Reuters via video link from Dubai where he was attending the World Government Summit, Somaliland President Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi said no bilateral economic deal with Israel had yet been reached, but Somaliland expected to sign "a partnership agreement".

"At the moment, there is no trade, and there is no investment from Israel. But we are hoping 100% (for) their investment, their trade, and hopefully we will engage with the business people and the government of Israel soon," he said.

"Somaliland is a very rich country in resources - minerals, oil, gas, marine, in agriculture, energy and other sectors.... We have meat, we have fish, we have minerals and they (Israel) need them. So trade can start from these main sectors," he said. "The sky is the limit."

He said in return Somaliland would seek access to Israeli technology.

Somaliland says its mineral resources include vast reserves of lithium, critical for batteries and electric vehicles. In 2024 the Saudi Mining Company Kilomass secured an exploration deal there for lithium and other critical minerals.

Abdullahi said he was grateful to Israel for being first to recognise Somaliland. While Somaliland also hopes for future military cooperation with Israel, he said establishing Israeli military bases had not been discussed.

He said he had accepted an invitation from Netanyahu and would visit Israel soon, but no date had yet been set. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar visited Somaliland a month ago.

Abdullahi said he expects all United Nations countries eventually to follow Israel's lead, including the United Arab Emirates and the United States, though he said it was normal for recognition to take time.

He said he had a good working relationship with the U.S. and believes President Donald Trump will "someday" recognise Somaliland. Last month, he pitched investment deals at a dinner in Davos attended by Trump's son Eric .

Israel's decision to recognise Somaliland has drawn an angry response from Somalia, and has also been criticised by China, Turkey, Egypt and the African Union.

Somaliland also cooperates with the UAE, with DP World a big investor in the Berbera port. The UAE has "not decided officially yet but they are just one of the countries we expect to recognise Somaliland," Abdullahi said.

"We also expect that the Saudi government will make the same investment in Somaliland," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 16:14:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VLVBLYEF75M73AQ44G3RQUVMTQ.jpg?auth=8db4a2901a7c79ee52a206cffe3a49b5e594a88c32b065cc067e18fad60e9942&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO has started military planning for an Arctic mission</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/nato-has-started-military-planning-an-arctic-mission-2026-02-03/</link><description>BERLIN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - NATO has started the military planning for an Arctic Sentry mission, a spokesperson for the alliance's military headquarters SHAPE said on Tuesday.

"An objective and thorough investigation of the circumstances of doubtful legality as well as international legal cooperation is only possible if a pre-trial investigation is launched," Lithuania's prosecutor general's office said in a statement, without naming any suspects or specific crimes.

Earlier on Tuesday, President Gitanas Nauseda called for a principled law enforcement investigation into the case.

Lithuanian media have reported that the names of several Lithuanian models and arts figures are reported in the files, published last week by the U.S. Justice Department.

Several performers have announced a boycott of an arts festival, Midsummer Vilnius, whose promoter, Valdas Petreikis, is mentioned in the files as having received payments from Epstein.

Petreikis has said he was unaware of Epstein's crimes at the time of their acquaintance, denies wrongdoing and is withdrawing from promoting arts events due to the public backlash.

Lithuanian police and prosecutors are currently assessing publicly released information, analysing the legal framework and exchanging information with partners, the prosecutor general's office said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin and Saudi crown prince discuss work of OPEC+, Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/russias-putin-saudi-crown-prince-discuss-work-opec-kremlin-says-2026-02-03/</link><description>MOSCOW, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin held a phone call with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Kremlin said on Tuesday, saying they had agreed to deepen cooperation in the political, economic, trade and humanitarian spheres.

The accused, a 37-year-old Romanian and a 54-year-old Greek, tampered with the vessels by pouring more than 20 kg of steel pellets into an engine block, puncturing freshwater lines, removing fuel tank caps and disabling fuses in the onboard electronics, according to the investigators.

The sabotage was discovered during pre-departure checks as one of the ships, the corvette "Emden", was preparing for its inaugural journey to the port city of Kiel.

The activities could have led to significant damage if left undetected, the prosecutor general's office said, adding that investigations were still ongoing.

The two men were arrested in Hamburg and a village in Greece, with their residences in Hamburg, Romania and Greece searched by authorities.

According to Greek police officials and security sources, the 54-year-old man was arrested in the early morning hours inside his home in northern Greece following a European arrest warrant issued on behalf of Germany.

Among the items confiscated from his home were six mobile phones, three USB sticks, a SIM card and a hard drive, and evidence of 19 bank accounts, officials said.

According to Greek court documents, the arrested men were tasked with painting work on the corvette "Koeln" in June 2025. During the work, they manually shut the control panel, cutting power off on the vessel and risking starting a fire.

Germany's defence ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

A spokesperson for the prosecutor's office in Hamburg declined to say whether authorities suspected Russia of being behind the sabotage.

Political leaders and military officials have accused Russia of engaging in acts of sabotage, espionage, and hybrid warfare since Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The Kremlin has repeatedly denied such allegations, dismissing them as unsubstantiated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China warns Panama of 'heavy prices' to pay after CK Hutchison contract quashed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/china-calls-panama-court-ruling-ck-hutchison-port-contracts-shameful-pathetic-2026-02-03/</link><description>BEIJING, Feb 3 (Reuters) - China warned Panama on Tuesday there would be "heavy prices" to pay after a court ruling there annulled Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison's (0001.HK) , opens new tab contract to operate two ports at the Panama Canal.

China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office called the ruling by Panama's Supreme Court "absurd," "shameful and pathetic," and vowed to defend the interests of Chinese firms.

Panamanian authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Last week's court ruling annulled a key contract that Panama Ports Company, a CK Hutchison subsidiary, has held since the 1990s to operate container terminals at the canal's Pacific and Atlantic entrances.

The legal decision, which cited constitutional violations and concerns over public interest, was seen as a win for Washington amid intensifying U.S.-China rivalry over the control of global trade routes.

The ruling threatens to disrupt the Hong Kong conglomerate's proposed $23-billion sale of 43 ports in 23 countries, including the two at the Panama Canal, to a consortium led by BlackRock (BLK.N) , opens new tab and Mediterranean Shipping Company.

"The ruling ignored the facts, breached trust, and seriously damaged the legitimate rights and interests of enterprises in Hong Kong, China," the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office said on its social media account.

"China has sufficient means and tools, and sufficient strength and ability to defend a fair and just international economic and trade order," the office said.

If the Panamanian authorities "insist on having their own way ... heavy prices both politically and economically will surely be paid!" it added.

The court decision was welcomed by U.S. authorities. John Moolenaar, chair of the U.S. House Select Committee on China, called it a "win for America."

Without naming the U.S. in the statement, the Chinese office said "some country has ... used bullying tactics to force other countries to obey their will," and that Panama had "willingly succumbed" to hegemonic power.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who initially celebrated the proposed $23-billion ports sale, has called for the U.S. to " take back " the Panama Canal in the face of Chinese influence.

CK Hutchison's subsidiary last week said the ruling was inconsistent with the legal framework that had allowed it to operate the ports.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/25SD7DAJEJPL5KLMC5MZJDYYSI.jpg?auth=ccfe4b48180a49ad7c8c31a413e1e5bf6fe016edb0b0646953399fa703d88966&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudanese army says it has broken siege of famine-stricken Kadugli</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudanese-army-says-it-has-broken-siege-famine-stricken-kadugli-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 - The Sudanese army said it broke a years-long siege on the city of Kadugli on Tuesday, potentially providing tens of thousands of people a reprieve from famine and signaling a shift in the war's momentum.

The conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has displaced millions, drawn in regional powers and caused a vast humanitarian crisis since it broke out in April 2023.

Its latest frontline is the greater Kordofan region , which the RSF began sweeping through after the rainy season ended late last year.

"With God's help and guidance, your Sudanese Armed Forces and supporting forces have succeeded in opening the Kadugli-Dalanj road, after a heroic battle," the army said in a statement.

The RSF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Kadugli and nearby al-Dalanj had been under siege on and off since the start of the war. There was an escalation in fighting after the SPLM-N, which controls territory in the state and elsewhere, joined forces with the RSF last year.

The army broke the siege of al-Dalanj last week.

In Kadugli the siege caused famine conditions confirmed by a global hunger monitor last year, and in both cities civilians were subjected to devastating drone attacks that have continued since the sieges were broken, residents said.

Jan Egeland, head of Norwegian Refugee Council, said he witnessed "massive, unchecked suffering" among those who fled Kadugli to camps in SPLM-N territory.

"The mothers had one recurrent story," he said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday. "The drones are hitting their homes that are torched, and the people flee for their lives after having been starved for months," Egeland said.

People fleeing the siege of al-Fashir, which fell to the RSF in October, gave similar accounts.

Few aid agencies remain active in Kadugli or elsewhere in South Kordofan. The siege has driven up prices, according to local aid workers, with a kilo of flour reaching 80,000 Sudanese pounds (about $22).

That has put food out of reach for many, forcing them to eat leaves, while medicine and doctors are scarce, the aid workers said.

According to the United Nations, more than 80% of Kadugli's population, or some 147,000 people, have fled.

The army's advance was aided by a breakdown in the RSF's supply lines from Libya into the Kordofan region, an army source and an SPLM-N source told Reuters.

Reuters reported on Monday that Egypt had deployed drones at an airstrip near its borders with Sudan and Libya, in what experts and officials said was a sign of its deepening involvement in Sudan. Libya's Kufrah airport , a major conduit for RSF supplies, announced on January 16 it would close for one month for renovations, though airport officials denied this was linked to Sudan's war.

Egypt has not acknowledged supporting the army militarily, but has said its national security is directly linked to Sudan's.

The army's advance was largely enabled by drone attacks and by allied armed groups recently recruited from local Nuba tribes, both sources said.

Egeland said that shifts in the war's frontlines had not alleviated civilian suffering, while efforts at a settlement, led by the United States, had failed.

"The peace diplomacy has failed to prevent that armed men, ruthless men, do whatever they want with the civilian population that they first starve and then attack," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EJ2XUVMQX5PNZIA43VPUKJEZFY.jpg?auth=67624ac3b5a533dc03ad7453d7471a10b11ad8c8691bf46905df64877900322a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK ex-US ambassador Peter Mandelson quits House of Lords amid Epstein scandal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260203-uk-ex-us-ambassador-peter-mandelson-quits-house-of-lords-amid-epstein-scandal</link><description>The UK 's former ambassador to the United States, Peter Mandelson , is stepping down as a member of the upper house of parliament, it was announced Tuesday, as a scandal deepened over his ties to late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

The veteran Labour politician, former UK government minister and EU trade commissioner had announced he was resigning from the House of Lords as of Wednesday, Speaker Michael Forsyth told members.

"The clerk of the parliaments has today (Tuesday) received notification from Lord Mandelson of his intention to retire from the House, effective from February 4 (Wednesday)," Forsyth said.

The move came shortly after Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Mandelson had "let his country down" after a slew of emails released by US authorities which detailed his cosy ties with the American financier.

Starmer told ministers he was "appalled" at revelations regarding Mandelson that emerged over the weekend, according to a Downing Street readout of a cabinet meeting.

"The alleged passing on of emails of highly sensitive government business was disgraceful," the prime minister said, adding he was not yet "reassured that the totality of information had yet emerged" regarding Mandelson's links with Epstein.

Starmer also said he had asked officials to draft legislation to strip Mandelson of his peerage "as quickly as possible" and made it clear the government "would cooperate" with any police inquiries into the matter.

London's Metropolitan Police said Monday that they were reviewing reports of a possible "misconduct in a public office... to determine if they meet the criminal threshold for investigation".

Starmer has faced mounting criticism of his initial decision to appoint Mandelson as Britain's ambassador to Washington, before sacking him last September, less than a year into his post, over his ties to Epstein.

The Epstein affair is casting a long shadow over Washington and Europe, entangling some of the most prominent names in politics.

The US Justice Department on Friday released what it said would be the final batch of pages, photos and videos from the Epstein files, adding fuel to a political drama that has put pressure on President Donald Trump .

Trump spent months trying to block the disclosure of investigative files linked to Epstein, who moved in elite circles for years, cultivating ties with billionaires, politicians, academics and celebrities.

On Monday, it emerged that former US president Bill Clinton and his wife, Hillary, will testify in a US House investigation into Epstein, heading off a potential vote to hold the couple in contempt.

Neither Trump nor the Clintons have been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.

Meanwhile, the European Commission said Tuesday it will look into whether Mandelson, who served as the EU's trade chief between 2004 and 2008, broke its code of conduct over his Epstein ties.

Mandelson – a back-room architect of Labour's revival as an electoral force in the 1990s under Tony Blair – quit the party on Sunday to avoid causing it "further embarrassment" from the slew of revelations.

Bank records released on Friday by the US authorities suggested that in 2009, Mandelson, who was then business secretary, forwarded an economic briefing to Epstein intended for then-leader Gordon Brown , captioning it: "Interesting note that's gone to the PM."

Epstein also appeared to have transferred a total of $75,000 (£55,000) in three payments to accounts linked to the top Labour politician between 2003 and 2004.

Mandelson, 72, told the BBC on Sunday he had no memory of the money transfers and did not know whether the documents were authentic.

His comments were "gobsmacking" and caused the public "to lose faith in all politicians", Starmer told his cabinet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 17:29:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2fec1944-011f-11f1-aeea-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26033470028233.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Digital sovereignty (2/3): Can Europe’s businesses survive without US Big Tech?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260203-digital-sovereignty-can-european-businesses-survive-without-us-big-tech</link><description>When a German business lobby asked IT executives how they would fare without access to US technology, their reply offered a sobering reality check for champions of European autonomy .

More than 95% said they wouldn’t survive two years if the United States cut off access to its digital technologies and services, according to the survey carried out last year by Bitkom, Germany’s largest digital industry association.

Compared with earlier surveys, Bitkom’s findings pointed to growing pessimism about the resilience of German businesses at a time of heightened tensions between the Trump administration and Europe.

There is widespread fear that Europe’s businesses could end up as collateral damage in the event of a deeper transatlantic fallout, says Bertrand Trastour, global sales director for Stormshield, an Airbus subsidiary specialising in sovereign cybersecurity solutions.

“It's clearly on people’s minds,” Trastour acknowledges. “I’m using an American smartphone as we speak. What would we do without it? We don't have any viable alternatives in Europe for certain types of equipment.”

According to the Bitkom survey, an abrupt shortage of high-tech gear from the likes of Apple or Google is a key concern voiced by German business, for whom coping without US-made smartphones, laptops or tablets is inconceivable.

It's not just the American hardware that Europe’s businesses depend on. “One wonders what would happen if US software publishers were to suspend the licences they provide for European companies,” Trastour says.

Without access to customer relationship management (CRM) tools provided by California-based Salesforce, for instance, many factories in Europe would be forced to drastically scale back their operations, resulting in layoffs.

Washington could also choose to place export controls on certain advanced technologies, mirroring steps already taken to curb the rise of China’s AI industry.

Limiting chip exports to Europe would significantly curtail research and development on the continent, warns Christophe Grosbost, chief strategy officer at the Innovation Makers Alliance.

“We are very dependent on GPUs, the graphics chips sold mainly by Nvidia, which are used to run the data centres where information is stored to train AI models,” Grosbost explains.

But European companies are not entirely helpless, says Trastour, whose company provides cybersecurity solutions that are strictly “French- or European-made".

“The goal is to build technological autonomy,” Trastour explains. “We cannot completely wean off US tech, but by using European functional building blocks [software that performs specific functions] we can come up with a technological mix that offers a degree of resilience.”

Experts point to an abundance of European tools and services , many of which remain little-known.

Jitsi, a collaborative communication tool developed by Bulgaria's Emil Ivov, is touted as an alternative to Microsoft Teams. European cloud providers like France's OVH and Switzerland's Infomaniak have emerged as viable competitors to larger North American firms.

The French government announced in late January that its 2.5 million civil servants will stop using Zoom, Microsoft Teams and others by 2027 in favour of Visio, a homegrown videoconferencing system.

While the Trump administration once championed “alternative facts”, America's Big Tech firms are no fans of alternatives to their tools and platforms. Competitors are required to fend off accusations of monopoly, but they remain largely invisible, crushed by “the massive marketing budgets that tech giants have been showering on the public for decades”, says Martin Hullin, head of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at the Bertelsmann Foundation, a German think tank.

Yet there is a world beyond Gmail, Word, X, Chrome and Apple. Europe, in particular, is home to “many small companies with very interesting ideas and products that are sometimes of better quality than their American equivalents”, argues Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and a key advocate of European technological independence.

The hard part is often finding them. Who, for example, has ever heard of Olvid, a French alternative to WhatsApp and text messaging?

France’s Emmanuel Macron has sought to set an example with his “start-up nation” slogan. His government has developed a whole batch of homegrown digital tools to escape American control, aiming to replace Teams with “Visio”, Google Drive with “Files”, and WeTransfer with “FranceTransfer”.

With strained EU-US relations leading to renewed interest in technological sovereignty, some experts in the field have posted catalogues of alternative solutions online.

For each American software programme, Austrian IT developer Constantin Graf has compiled an almost exhaustive list of European alternatives. The ambitious German project Digital Independence Day is less exhaustive but more educational. Its website offers step-by-step instructions on how to switch, for instance, from PayPal to Wero, a European mobile payment system.

But ditching US tools and systems in favour of European alternatives is far from straightforward, particularly for large companies that operate internationally, warns Francesca Musiani, head of the Internet and Society Centre at France’s National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).

“Large international firms tend to build their entire productivity frameworks on a stack of highly integrated American 'bricks’ such as the cloud, collaborative tools (like Teams), CRM and AI,” she explains. Removing one “brick” risks destabilising the entire system.

Unlike government agencies, Musiani adds, private companies “cannot always invoke sovereignty or national security to justify choosing alternative solutions that are sometimes more expensive or less efficient in the short term”.

Moreover, the bigger players “tend to be risk-averse and inclined to maintain the status quo” rather than migrate thousands of employees and retrain them on new systems, notes Johan Linaker, a specialist in digital sovereignty and innovation at the Research Institutes of Sweden (RISE). This conservative culture “can be counterproductive” if a rapid shift towards European solutions is required.

Smaller, nimbler companies may be quicker to jump on the technological autonomy bandwagon but would still face a bumpy ride.

“It won't happen overnight and it will require investment in training, research and acquisition,” says Frans Imbert-Vier, CEO of technology consulting firm UBCOM and an advocate of European technological independence.

Pointing to such “invisible costs” of decoupling from American technology, Musiani warns that the process “can lead to errors, frustrations and productivity losses”, in turn resulting in a “loss of competitiveness” – particularly in the face of competition from the US.

Helping to facilitate this transition is where European authorities need to step in, says Imbert-Vier.

“In 2024, the European Union purchased €111 billion worth of American technology,” notes the UBCOM CEO, for whom part of this expenditure could have been “directed towards supporting European innovation” instead.

Martin Hullin, director of the European Network for Technological Resilience and Sovereignty at Germany's Bertelsmann Foundation, warns that sticking with a single service provider – i.e., the United States – is “very short-term thinking” that poses a long-term risk to efficiency.

He argues that companies need the courage to take decisions that might be costly in the short term but will ultimately make them more resilient.

Research published last year by Hullin and other economists concluded that Europe needs to invest around €300 billion over 10 years to establish economic sovereignty in technology.

But a failure to do so could prove even costlier in the long run, experts warn.

While decoupling “carries an economic cost, being too dependent on a monopoly across the Atlantic probably carries a greater one”, argues Trastour.

“It’s a strategic decision and it has to be made now.”

Their journey from Egypt on Monday through the frontier post and across the "yellow line" zone controlled by Israel and an allied Palestinian militia group, involved lengthy delays and the confiscation of gifts including toys, one of the women said.

"It was a journey of horror, humiliation and oppression," said 56-year-old Huda Abu Abed by phone from the tent her family is living in at Khan Younis in southern Gaza .

Her account was supported by that of another woman Reuters interviewed, and by comments from a third woman interviewed on Arab television.

In response to a Reuters request for comment, Israel's military denied its forces had acted inappropriately or mistreated Palestinians crossing into Gaza, without addressing the specific allegations made by the two women interviewed.

About 50 Palestinians had been expected to enter the enclave on Monday but by nightfall only three women and nine children had been let through, Palestinian and Egyptian sources said, with another 38 stuck waiting to clear security.

Of the 50 people waiting to leave Gaza, mostly for medical treatment, only five patients with seven relatives escorting them managed to cross into Egypt on Monday.

Abu Abed said the returnees, who were restricted to a single suitcase each, first encountered problems at the crossing where European border monitors confiscated toys they were taking home as gifts, she said.

She spent a year in Egypt for heart treatment but returned before it was finished because she missed her family. An adult daughter had also travelled to Egypt for medical treatment. An adult son was killed in December 2024 and she was not able to say goodbye to him, she said. Two other children are in Gaza.

Once through the crossing and on the Gaza side of the border, the 12 returnees boarded a bus for their journey through the Israeli-controlled zone and across the "yellow line" demarcating Israeli and Hamas-held zones.

A second woman, Sabah al-Raqeb, 41, said the bus, escorted by two four-wheel-drive vehicles, was stopped at a checkpoint manned by Israel-backed Palestinian gunmen who identified themselves as belonging to the Popular Forces, commonly known as the Abu Shabab militia.

The women's family names were read out over a loudspeaker and each was led by two men and a woman from Abu Shabab militia to a security point where Israeli forces were waiting. They were then blindfolded and handcuffed, she and Abu Abed said.

They were asked about their knowledge of Hamas, about the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war, and other issues relating to militancy, the two women said. The Palestinian anti-Hamas gunmen also said they could remain in the Israeli-held zone, Raqeb said.

"The officer asked me why I came back to Gaza. He said it was destroyed. I told him I came back for my children and family," said Raqeb, who has returned to her seven children living in a tent after leaving Gaza two years ago for what she had expected to be a short trip for medical treatment.

Abu Abed said the questioning lasted more than two hours.

In a statement denying any wrongdoing, Israel's military said there were no known incidents of inappropriate conduct, mistreatment, apprehensions or confiscation of property by the Israeli security establishment.

It said there was an "identification and screening process at the 'Regavim' screening facility, which is managed by the security establishment in an area under (Israeli military) control." It said that process followed screening by European personnel as part of a mechanism agreed upon by all parties.

The Rafah crossing, the sole route in or out for nearly all Gaza's more than 2 million inhabitants, has been shut for most of the war. It was meant to be reopened in the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas agreed in October.

Rafah, a city of a quarter of a million people, was almost entirely depopulated during the war as Israel told all residents to leave before conducting extensive demolitions that have left it a wasteland of rubble.

The city lies in a security cordon retained by Israel after its troops pulled back to the yellow line in October, and where the Popular Forces are also operating.

Since the forces' leader, Yasser Abu Shabab, was killed last year they have been led by his deputy, Ghassan Dahine. "The Fifth Unit under my command will play an important security role regarding entry and exit through the Rafah crossing," Israel's Ynet news website quoted Dahine as saying.

Some 20,000 Gazans are hoping to leave for treatment abroad. Despite the slow reopening, many of them said the step brought relief. On Tuesday, 50 Palestinians were expected to cross into Gaza from Egypt, according to an Egyptian source.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/23WWQKWSQZJXDBFH4FB7M7WYSE.jpg?auth=e7534117e395488289915cda3eb769a7f99ffd8a539b5c9b2d925b716294b4b9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutors seek 5-year ban from public office for Le Pen in appeal trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-prosecutors-seek-5-year-ban-public-office-le-pen-appeal-trial-2026-02-03/</link><description>PARIS, Feb 3 (Reuters) - French prosecutors on Tuesday requested a four-year prison sentence and a five-year ban from public office for far-right leader Marine Le Pen in her appeal trial over the misuse of European Union funds.

The announcement follows weeks of sometimes violent tumult in Minneapolis, where U.S. President Donald Trump has deployed thousands of armed, masked agents as he tries to deport more migrants than any of his predecessors.

New York Attorney General Letitia James said the state's new legal observers would be volunteer employees from her office, trained to observe, without interfering, whether Trump's immigration enforcement "remains within the bounds of the law."

"I am proud to protect New Yorkers' constitutional rights to speak freely, protest peacefully, and go about their lives without fear of unlawful federal action," James, a Democrat, said in a statement. "We have seen in Minnesota how quickly and tragically federal operations can escalate in the absence of transparency and accountability."

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which enforces immigration law, did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump, a Republican, has reserved his most aggressive surges in immigration enforcement for states governed by his political opponents, particularly California, Illinois and Minnesota. New York is home to one of the biggest and busiest DHS field offices, but Trump has not announced any major enforcement surge in the state.

He says the deportations of many migrants, including some who were legally admitted into the U.S., are necessary to reduce crime, although his argument is often contradicted by crime data.

In Minneapolis, residents have come out in protest, many blowing whistles and recording video as immigration agents in military-style gear roam the streets. Twice in January, immigration agents fatally shot U.S. citizens who had come out to protest or observe: Renee Good and Alex Pretti.

Minnesota's leaders have accused the Trump administration of going too far and violating the constitutional rights of both migrants and U.S. citizens, including their rights to observe and protest government actions.

In New York, small groups of legal observers are common at street protests, sometimes wearing the bright green hats of the National Lawyers Guild, focused on whether local police are violating rights or laws that protect freedom of speech.

But a formal state-organized effort to deploy legal observers to monitor federal law enforcement appears to be new. James, an outspoken foe of Trump who successfully sued him and his real estate firm for financial fraud, says she will use information gathered by the observers to decide whether to bring legal challenges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2A5BZXBYVLLDCEXH6IPJUVLVA.jpg?auth=813565f365dbf6f71a785f9805167b9e240fb2e47f812b32b489dea7d11ce43a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says some forces have been dispatched to Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-military-says-some-forces-have-been-dispatched-nigeria-2026-02-03/</link><description>DAKAR, Feb 3 - The U.S. has sent a small team of troops to Nigeria, the general in charge of the U.S. command for Africa said on Tuesday, the first acknowledgment of U.S. forces on the ground since Washington struck by air on Christmas Day.

President Donald Trump ordered airstrikes on what he described as Islamic State targets in Nigeria in December and said there could be more U.S. military action there.

Reuters earlier reported that the U.S. had been conducting surveillance flights over the country from Ghana since at least late November.

The top general said the U.S. team was sent after both countries agreed that more needed to be done to combat the terrorist threat in West Africa.

"That has led to increased collaboration between our nations to include a small US team that brings some unique capabilities from the United States," General Dagvin R.M. Anderson, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command AFRICOM, told journalists during a press briefing on Tuesday.

Anderson did not provide further details about the size and scope of their mission.

Defense Minister Christopher Musa confirmed that a team was working in Nigeria but did not provide further details.

A former U.S. official said the U.S. team appeared to be heavily involved in intelligence gathering and enabling Nigerian forces to strike terrorist-affiliated groups.

Nigeria has come under intense pressure by Washington to act after President Trump accused the West African nation of failing to protect Christians from Islamist militants operating in the northwest.

The Nigerian government denies any systematic persecution of Christians, saying it is targeting Islamist fighters and other armed groups that attack both Christian and Muslim civilians.

Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, and the northwest remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state in coordination with Nigerian authorities and killed multiple ISIS militants.

The strike came after Trump in late October began warning that Christianity faces an "existential threat" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VMZ4CUVL7RM45OLVKQSJMCEVCU.jpg?auth=f30556c92a1c42f3aee27a8f11225e9e7775ce863d006fab3eb9fc1d2a68d10e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ex-general quits Italy's League party, posing problem for Meloni</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ex-general-quits-italys-league-party-posing-problem-meloni-2026-02-03/</link><description>ROME, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Former army general Roberto Vannacci quit the League group, part of Italy's governing coalition, on Tuesday to set up his own far-right party, potentially complicating Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's hopes of winning re-election next year.

Vannacci shot to prominence two years ago, promoting what he said were traditional Italian values, while disparaging LGBTQ people, migrants, minorities and feminists.

Despite being forced out of the military, League leader Matteo Salvini embraced Vannacci's values and brought him into his party, making him the deputy chief in the hope he would help revive the group's faltering movement.

However, Vannacci remained aloof from much of the League hierarchy and on Tuesday confirmed that he planned to go it alone a week after trademarking the logo for a new political group called Futuro Nazionale (National Future).

"No boxer wins a fight by throwing moderate hooks," Vannacci said on X, promising to lead an uncompromising right-wing party.

Pollsters predict he could win up to 2% of the vote, not enough to enter parliament, but possibly a decisive drain on support for Meloni and her coalition allies.

"On paper the centre-left and centre-right camps are quite close together, so taking even two percentage points away from the right could be very relevant," said Lorenzo Pregliasco, who founded the YouTrend polling firm.

The next national election is scheduled for 2027.

Salvini said he was "disappointed and bitter".

"We are used to thinking that words like honour, discipline and loyalty have a precise meaning, especially for those who have worn a uniform," Salvini wrote on X, accusing Vannacci of betraying his trust.

Salvini had hoped that bringing him into the League would broaden its appeal and halt its slide in the polls.

At first the gamble seemed to pay off: Vannacci helped the League secure a respectable 9% in the 2024 European elections, briefly silencing more moderate figures in the party who were unhappy with his outspoken views.

But instead of fusing with the League, Vannacci built his own faction within the party, held rallies outside of Salvini's control and refused to contribute to party coffers, shunning standard expectations for elected officials.

Pregliasco said he could draw away voters from both the League and also Meloni's conservative Brothers of Italy party, which has become more moderate since forming the backbone of the current government.

"My right is true, coherent, identity-driven, strong, convinced, enthusiastic, pure and contagious," Vannacci said on X. "This is the only right I know."</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QNS5BARVWNMJPDRUGZ3WDNAQPQ.jpg?auth=2508eedbd4c4e931da44aa3863a0ce428a4968e781df7be63108b1bb50bfb852&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq's Maliki says he would welcome decision to replace him as PM candidate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-maliki-says-he-would-welcome-decision-replace-him-pm-candidate-2026-02-03/</link><description>Feb 3 (Reuters) - Iraq's former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, nominated by a powerful alliance of Shi'ite political parties to return to the premiership, said on Tuesday that he would welcome a decision to replace his candidacy.

Prosecutors allege Malami, in November 2022, knowingly abetted terrorism financing by refusing to prosecute suspected terrorism financiers whose case files were forwarded to him while he served as attorney general.

The pair pleaded not guilty and were ordered to remain in the custody of the Department of State Security ahead of commencement of trial on February 20 after rejecting an oral bail.

The arraignment adds to Malami's widening legal troubles, which include separate ongoing money‑laundering proceedings and a related asset‑forfeiture case before the Federal High Court.

In December, Malami was charged with 16 counts of money laundering and conspiracy involving billions of naira.

Defence lawyers argued the pair had already spent two weeks in detention and were brought to court from the hospital, but the judge insisted on a formal bail motion.

Prosecutors also claimed Malami and his son were found in December 2025 in possession of a firearm and cartridges without a valid licence.

These offences are punishable under provisions of Nigerian law.</description><pubDate>Tue, 03 Feb 2026 18:29:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey determined to take relations with Saudi Arabia to higher level, Erdogan tells crown prince</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-determined-take-relations-with-saudi-arabia-higher-level-erdogan-tells-2026-02-03/</link><description>ANKARA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan met Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Riyadh on Tuesday and told him Turkey was determined to take relations to a higher level in areas including renewable energy and defence industry, Erdogan's office said.
