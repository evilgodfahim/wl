China announced on Saturday that Zhang Youxia, second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, and another senior officer, Liu Zhenli, were under investigation for suspected serious violations of discipline and law .

"We will continue to closely monitor abnormal changes among the top levels of China's party, government, and military leadership. The military's position is based on the fact that China has never abandoned the use of force against Taiwan," Koo told reporters at parliament.

Zhang has long been seen as Xi's closest military ally, and is one of the few senior Chinese officers with combat experience, having taken part in the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam.

China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, sends warplanes and warships into the skies and waters around the island on an almost daily basis, in what Taipei views as a harassment campaign to get the government to accept Beijing's sovereignty claims.

Koo said what the ministry was looking at is not any "single leadership reshuffle that would be enough to draw conclusions".

Taiwan will use a range of joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance methods, as well as intelligence-sharing, to "grasp" China's possible intentions, he added.

"What we want is a comprehensive grasp of all indicators - military and non-military - reflecting China's intentions and actions, and then make an integrated overall assessment," Koo said, without elaborating.

China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and held its latest round of war games around the island late last month. Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 04:00:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6CKXFS5P5JP75IB2IAQ6JYGV3E.jpg?auth=2c16ad7c25879b7b55d5d73e037d0d8130d35b5215a3925ff9f34399fc102d19&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela frees more political prisoners, Rodriguez pushes back on US pressure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260126-venezuela-frees-political-prisoners-rodriguez-rejects-us-pressure</link><description>More than 100 political prisoners were freed Sunday in Venezuela, where detainees are slowly being released under pressure from the United States, the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal said.

"At Foro Penal we have verified 104 releases of political prisoners in Venezuela today," the NGO wrote on social media.

Foro Penal had earlier reported 80 political prisoners being released Sunday.

Director Alfredo Romero said on X that the group was verifying the identities of those released from jails nationwide.

Foro Penal attorney Gonzalo Himiob said the initial releases had taken place in the early hours of the day.

"This figure is not yet definitive and could increase as we proceed with verifications," he said, also on X.

The government of Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez , who took power after leftist president Nicolas Maduro was captured by US special forces early this month, has promised to release a "large number" of the hundreds of Maduro opponents languishing in prison.

In an address Sunday to oil worker's in Venezuela's eastern state of Anzoategui, Rodriguez struck a confident tone.

"Enough orders from Washington on politicians in Venezuela. Let Venezuelan politics resolve our differences and internal conflicts. Enough of foreign powers," Rodriguez said.

"It has cost this republic dearly to have to face the consequences of fascism, of extremism in our country."

Authorities in Caracas say they have freed 626 detainees since December, but Foro Penal has only recorded about half as many releases in that time.

Venezuela's political opposition and human rights groups have criticised the slow unfolding of the process.

Loved ones of detainees have been camped out outside prisons waiting for their release.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 04:00:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6deaadd2-f175-11f0-8834-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-14T180613Z-2042008953-RC261JALUC9L-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-RODRIGUEZ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Armed attack in Mexico's Salamanca kills 11</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/armed-attack-mexicos-salamanca-kills-11-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 25 (Reuters) - An armed attack in the Mexican city of Salamanca killed 11 people, the office of the attorney general in the state of Guanajuato, home to the city, said in a statement on Sunday.

The MV Trisha Kerstin 3 issued a distress signal around 1:50 am (1750 GMT Sunday), a bit over four hours after it departed the Port of Zamboanga City on the southwestern tip of Mindanao, the coast guard said in a statement.

At least 316 people have been rescued, Romel Dua, a coast guard commander, told AFP, with 15 confirmed dead and 28 still unaccounted for.

"A coast guard aircraft is also on the way to help with the operation. The Navy and Air Force also sent their assets," Dua, who is based in southern Mindanao, told AFP.

The 44-metre (144-foot), triple-decker vessel went down about five kilometres east of Baluk-Baluk Island, part of the Basilan province chain of islands off the Zamboanga peninsula.

"Based on the account of some survivors, the waters in the area were rough at the time," Philippine Coast Guard spokeswoman Noemie Cayabyab said in a televised interview.

Basilan emergency responder Ronalyn Perez told AFP that rescuers were struggling to handle the sudden influx of survivors.

"The challenge really is the number of patients that are coming in. We are short-staffed at the moment," Perez said in an interview, adding at least 18 had been brought to one local hospital.

"The ferry was sailing from Zamboanga City to Jolo Island when the incident happened," she added.

Video released by the Philippine Coast Guard showed survivors being plucked from the water and receiving medical attention.

Survivors could be heard shouting for help in the dark in a live video on Facebook.

"We cannot say for now the reason of the sinking, but we were instructed to conduct a marine casualty investigation to determine the cause," Dua said.

"As of now, we are focused on the rescue."

Survivors were being brought to the coast guard stations in Zamboanga and Isabela City, he added.

In its statement, the coast guard said the ferry had not been overloaded.

The archipelago nation of 116 million has a long history of disasters involving the inter-island ferries that ply its seas.

Many rely on cheap and poorly regulated boats and ships for transport between the country's more than 7,000 islands, despite regular accidents.

In 2023, more than 30 people were killed when a fire ripped through a ferry in the southern Philippines, while a 2015 capsizing off the western coast of Leyte Island resulted in more than 60 deaths.

In 1987, the Dona Paz ferry collided with an oil tanker in a pre- Christmas accident that claimed more than 4,000 lives. It was the world's worst peacetime disaster at sea.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:03:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/60157944-fa6c-11f0-b906-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026083659072.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone debris spark fire at two enterprises in Russia's Krasnodar region, authorities say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/drone-debris-spark-fire-two-enterprises-russias-krasnodar-region-authorities-say-2026-01-26/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Two enterprises caught fire and one person was injured in the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Russia's Krasnodar region after drone fragments fell on them, the regional emergencies centre said on Monday.

The centre did not specify what enterprises were affected. The city hosts a private refinery with a capacity of around 100,000 barrels per day, supplying fuel for both domestic use and export.

Russia's defence ministry said air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed 40 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 34 in the Krasnodar region.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:40:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines lodges 'firm representations' to Chinese embassy over 'escalating' war of words on South China Sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/philippines-lodges-firm-representations-chinese-embassy-over-escalating-war-2026-01-26/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Philippine foreign ministry said on Monday it had made "firm representations" to China's embassy and its ambassador in Manila over what it described as an "escalation of public exchanges" between them and Philippine officials over disputes in the South China Sea.

The Chinese Embassy and officials in Manila have stepped up their rhetoric in recent weeks, with the former criticising the Philippines' coast guard spokesperson and its lawmakers. Foreign Affairs Secretary Theresa Lazaro told Reuters last week that differences between states are best handled through diplomacy, not public exchanges.

The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Philippine foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday that it backed statements by Philippine officials, saying they were part of their mandate to uphold the country's sovereignty and sovereign rights. At the same time, the ministry called for "sober, professional and respectful exchanges in the public sphere".

"The Department believes that circumspection in language and actions are necessary so that the exchanges ... will not unnecessarily derail the diplomatic space needed to manage the tensions in the maritime domain," the foreign ministry said.

Manila and Beijing have been locked in a series of maritime confrontations in recent years, with the Philippines accusing China of repeatedly aggressive actions inside its exclusive economic zone, including dangerous manoeuvres, water‑cannoning, and the disruption of resupply missions.

Beijing continues to assert sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, including areas that fall within the EEZs of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 06:38:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P4CGFZPE2FJD7A6F5UXN7UJ7UE.jpg?auth=910633db2174efcacc677e8f81d2c7f68045b052af3bd1a4f612b13b78ecdfea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, South Korea agree to deepen cooperation on nuclear-powered subs, Seoul says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-south-korea-agree-deepen-cooperation-nuclear-powered-subs-seoul-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby and South Korean Defence Minister Ahn Gyu-back agreed during talks on Monday to deepen cooperation on Seoul's pursuit of a nuclear-powered submarine, South Korea's defence ministry said.

Colby is visiting Seoul on his first overseas trip in the post, which comes as Washington signals it expects South Korea to take a more leading role in deterring North Korea.

In a statement, the ministry said both sides viewed cooperation on a nuclear-powered submarine as a step that would strengthen South Korea's ability to lead the defence of the peninsula and elevate the security alliance.

The Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy released on Friday said that it expects a "more limited" U.S. role in deterring North Korea, with South Korea taking the primary responsibility.

Ahn also pressed for faster progress on the transfer of wartime operational control to Seoul and called for closer coordination on alliance follow-up measures, the ministry said.

Colby, the Pentagon's top defence and foreign policy official, said in a post on X on his arrival that South Korea is a "model ally" committed to increasing defence spending in line with U.S. regional strategy.

South Korea hosts about 28,500 U.S. troops and last year pledged to lift defence spending to 3.5% of GDP, a move that Colby and other U.S. officials have praised as strengthening Seoul's role in deterring North Korea.

Colby will also visit Japan during his Asian trip, according to media reports.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:29:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ETTYX3JHIRIGHMZJ4CU2IQMRJU.jpg?auth=93b3e562adeda5e293ce0e22e92d5ff0b0353f2a9b8a43a88e2d7efe3f4d9066&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top Chinese officials hold talks with OIC secretary general</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/top-chinese-officials-hold-talks-with-oic-secretary-general-2026-01-26/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 26 (Reuters) - China's vice president and foreign minister held talks with the secretary-general of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Monday, according to a ministry statement and the official news agency, Xinhua.

The talks in the Chinese capital of Beijing come amid heightened Middle East tension after an Iranian official said the country would treat any attack "as an all-out war against us".

Those comments followed U.S. President Donald Trump's remark the previous day that the United States had an "armada" heading toward Iran, adding it was "just in case", warning Iran not to kill protesters or restart its nuclear program.

An Iranian official in the region said on Sunday at least 5,000 were killed after a wave of protest over economic hardship.

In Monday's talks, Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for the building of a regional security partnership and the political settlement of hot-spot issues, the ministry said.

U.S. officials had said an aircraft carrier and several guided-missile destroyers would arrive in the Middle East in the coming days.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:30:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VVONZ7LYNJKDHGDIZHZOAZ632E.jpg?auth=86315efb0297c7138a29ea913a828daa2b3bf776281e43a922c9d40d0cabff32&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three dead after fire at food factory in central Greece</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/five-people-missing-after-fire-food-factory-central-greece-official-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - The bodies of three people were found on Monday as firefighters battled a blaze at a food factory near the central Greek city of Trikala, the fire brigade said, revising earlier reports that five people were missing.

Earlier, a fire brigade official told Reuters that 13 people were at the factory when the fire broke out and eight of them had managed to get out of the facility.

Thick black smoke billowed into the sky as around 40 firefighters and 13 trucks tackled the fire engulfing the industrial facility, with flames still visible across the roof of the complex.

The official said the cause of the fire, which broke out in the early morning hours, was not clear. Local media reported that a large explosion was heard before the fire.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:30:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DPBGMH5QFNNAXP4AP2EJJPMYLE.jpg?auth=5ca790d11cce3c3ce176f6900bff318e209699bf5f4b5007bd8ed9bfeaf0d501&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European leaders gather at North Sea energy summit as Greenland tensions loom</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260126-european-leaders-gather-at-north-sea-summit-as-greenland-russia-tensions-loom</link><description>European leaders meet in Germany on Monday to discuss North Sea energy and security cooperation, but fears over US designs on the Arctic island of Greenland may overshadow the talks.

The region has long worried about threats posed by Russia – but more recently tensions have surged over US President Donald Trump 's push for the autonomous territory of Denmark .

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz hosts the talks just days after Trump backed away from his threat to seize Greenland by force and level punitive tariffs against European NATO allies who stand in his way.

Trump said he had reached a "framework" agreement with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte , but this sparked both relief and confusion as the details have not been disclosed.

"We will have to pay increased attention to all parts of NATO's European territory," Merz said Thursday after an extraordinary European Council meeting.

"This concerns the North above all."

On the guest list Monday will be Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who visited Greenland on Friday, and representatives of NATO and the European Commission as well as Iceland .

Leaders from Norway , the Netherlands , Ireland , Belgium and Luxembourg are also expected, while Britain and France are sending ministers to the summit in the northern port city of Hamburg.

"Given the make-up of the meeting, I am certain that security in the High North will also be of interest to the participants," said Steffen Meyer, spokesman for Merz.

Formally, the aim of the summit is to push cross-border expansion of offshore wind energy, the hydrogen market and interconnected offshore infrastructure.

Security fears will be high on the agenda as the North and adjoining Baltic Seas have long been the targets of so-called "hybrid attacks" widely blamed on Russia.

Cargo ships linked to Russia have been suspected of sabotaging undersea communication cables and surveilling critical infrastructure.

In Germany, mysterious drone flights over airports , military bases and industrial sites have further unnerved authorities, who believe some were launched from ships sent by Russia.

Merz said last week that "maritime security" as well as "shared economic success in the North" would be topics for discussion in Hamburg.

The goal was to make the North Sea "the world's largest reservoir of clean energy", which he described as being of "crucial importance for a strong, secure and independent Europe".

At the last North Sea summit in 2023, nations agreed to build up to 300 gigawatts of wind capacity by mid-century, with an intermediate target of 120 GW set for 2030.

But based on current trends, there will be just 82 GW of installed capacity by the end of the decade, according to consultancy Baringa.

Government sources have said addressing the industry's "current difficulties" will be an issue in Hamburg.

Stumbling blocks have included logistical bottlenecks at ports, parts shortages and a grid infrastructure that struggles to handle additional and variable power.

There have also been fears about Chinese turbine makers entering the supply chain as European players seek to boost their own autonomy and industrial self-reliance.

Proponents of wind energy argue it is not only good for the climate but also for security, as such decentralised systems are more resilient to sabotage and attack than fossil fuel power plants, pipelines or oil tankers.

Simon Skillings of think tank E3G said that "we've learnt a lot over recent years from not just some of the hybrid attacks that have happened on infrastructure, but also looking at the Ukraine-Russia situation. We've learnt that dispersed assets are more resilient."

"A more dispersed infrastructure is more robust... You need basically multiple attacks rather than single attacks to knock out an energy supply."

Skillings said offshore wind farms could help boost maritime security if surveillance equipment or drones are integrated into turbines.

But there is still "very little coordination on these issues in the North Sea", he said, adding that building resilience into the system would also drive up costs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:31:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/61bc8f92-fa64-11f0-b028-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/318a040b1eae06b6674da2d0472972e8ace364fe.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to step up coordination with Nigeria to pursue Islamic State group militants</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260126-us-steps-up-cooperation-with-nigeria-to-pursue-islamic-state-group-militants</link><description>The US military is increasing materiel deliveries and intelligence sharing with Nigeria , Africom's deputy commander said, as part of a broader American push to work with African militaries to go after Islamic State group -linked militants.

The Pentagon has also kept open lines of communication with militaries in the junta-led Sahel countries of Burkina Faso , Niger and Mali , Lieutenant General John Brennan said.

The increased cooperation with Abuja follows Washington's diplomatic pressure on Nigeria over jihadist violence in the country, but also as the US military is becoming "more aggressive" in pursuing IS group-linked targets on the continent.

Under the Trump administration, "we've gotten a lot more aggressive and (are) working with partners to target, kinetically, the threats, mainly ISIS," Brennan said in an interview on the sidelines of a US-Nigeria security meeting in the Nigerian capital last week.

"From Somalia to Nigeria, the problem set is connected. So we're trying to take it apart and then provide partners with the information they need," he added.

"It's been about more enabling partners and then providing them equipment and capabilities with less restrictions so that they can be more successful."

Last week's inaugural US-Nigeria Joint Working Group meeting came roughly a month after the US announced surprise Christmas Day strikes on IS group-linked targets in northwest Nigeria.

Though both militaries seem keen on increased cooperation after the joint strikes, hanging over it all is diplomatic pressure by Washington over what Trump claims is the mass killing of Christians in Nigeria.

Abuja and independent analysts reject that framing of Nigeria's myriad, overlapping conflicts, which has long been used by the US religious right.

Charged politics were on display at the Joint Working Group meeting in Abuja, where Allison Hooker, the number three at the State Department, pushed the Nigerian government "to protect Christians" in a speech that did not mention Muslim victims of armed groups.

Africa's most populous country is roughly evenly split between a mostly Muslim north and mostly Christian south. Though millions live peacefully side by side, religious and ethnic identity remains a sensitive topic in a country that has seen sectarian violence throughout its history.

Brennan said that US intelligence would not be limited to protecting Christians.

He also said that following the US strikes in northwestern Sokoto state, American support going forward would focus on intelligence sharing to aid Nigerian air strikes there, as well as the northeast, where a jihadist insurgency by Boko Haram and rival breakaway ISWAP has raged since 2009.

Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) is "our most concerning group", he said.

Analysts have been tracking US intelligence flights over the country in recent months, though some have questioned whether air support alone can push back armed groups that thrive amid widespread poverty and state collapse in rural areas.

US-Nigerian cooperation going forward will involve "the whole gamut of intel sharing, sharing... tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as enabling them to procure more equipment," Brennan said.

The initial strikes targeted militants linked to the Islamic State Sahel Province group, typically active in neighbouring Niger, Brennan said.

Analysts have voiced concerns about ISSP's spread from the Sahel into coastal west African countries like Nigeria.

The impact of those strikes so far has been unclear, however, with local and international journalists unable to confirm militant casualties.

Asked about their effectiveness, Nigerian information minister Mohammed Idris said last week it was "still a work in progress".

In the Sahel more widely, Brennan said "we still collaborate" with the junta-led governments in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, which have broken away from their west African neighbours and largely shunned the West.

Security cooperation has been curtailed since coups toppled civilian governments across the three countries from 2020 to 2023.

"We have actually shared information with some of them to attack key terrorist targets," he said. "We still talk to our military partners across the Sahelian states, even though it's not official."

Brennan also said the US is not seeking to replace its bases in Niger after its troops were pushed out by the ruling junta.

"We're not in the market to create a drone base anywhere," he said, referencing the shuttered US drone operations in Agadez.

"We are much more focused on getting capability to the right place at the right time and then leaving. We don't seek long-term basing in any of the western African countries."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:31:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7bd57a4e-fa80-11f0-ad87-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-22T131724Z-1703878274-RC296JAZ7DJY-RTRMADP-3-USA-NIGERIA-SECURITY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel to allow 'limited reopening' of Rafah crossing once last hostage is recovered</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260126-israel-to-allow-limited-reopening-of-rafah-crossing-once-last-hostage-is-recovered</link><description>Israel said Monday it would allow a "limited reopening" of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt once it had recovered the remains of the last hostage in the Palestinian territory.

Reopening Rafah, a vital entry point for aid into Gaza, forms part of a truce framework announced by US President Donald Trump in October, but the crossing has remained closed since Israeli forces took control of it during the war in the Palestinian territory.

Visiting US envoys had reportedly pressed Israeli officials to reopen the crossing during talks in Jerusalem over the weekend.

World leaders and aid agencies have repeatedly pushed for more humanitarian convoys to be able to access Gaza, which has been left devastated by more than two years of war and depends on the inflow of essential medical equipment, food and other supplies.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said on Monday that Israel had agreed to a reopening "for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism".

The move would depend on "the return of all living hostages and a 100% effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages", it said on X.

The Israeli military said it was searching a cemetery in the Gaza Strip on Sunday for the remains of the last hostage, Ran Gvili.

Netanyahu's office said: "Upon completion of this operation, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the US, Israel will open the Rafah Crossing."

The announcement came after Gaza's newly appointed administrator, Ali Shaath, said the crossing would open " in both directions " this week.

"For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate, it is a lifeline and a symbol of opportunity," Shaath said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.

Israeli media had also reported that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner had urged Netanyahu to reopen Rafah during their Jerusalem talks.

A spokesman for Hamas's Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, said on Sunday that the group had "provided mediators with all the details and information in our possession regarding the location of the captive's body", referring to Gvili.

Obeida added that "the enemy (Israel) is currently searching one of the sites based on information transmitted by the Al-Qassam Brigades".

Except for Gvili, all of the 251 people taken hostage during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel have since been returned, whether living or dead.

A non-commissioned officer in the Israeli police's elite Yassam unit, Gvili was killed in action on the day of the attack and his body taken to Gaza.

The first phase of the US-backed ceasefire deal had stipulated that Hamas hand over all the hostages in Gaza.

Gvili's family has expressed strong opposition to launching the second phase of the plan, which includes reopening Rafah, before they have received his remains.

"First and foremost, Ran must be brought home," his family said in a statement on Sunday.

The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people.

The Israeli retaliation flattened much of Gaza, home to about 2.2 million people, a territory that was already suffering severely from previous rounds of fighting and from an Israeli blockade imposed since 2007.

In November, authorities in Gaza said more than 70,000 people had been killed there.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:31:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d45990c2-fa50-11f0-8867-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/3f21da3893f3797812582e2b98be347321c1438f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Historic winter storm kills several, causes mass travel disruption across US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260126-historic-winter-storm-kills-several-causes-mass-travel-disruption-across-us</link><description>A monster storm barreling across swaths of the United States has killed at least 10 people and prompted warnings to stay off the roads, mass flight cancellations and power outages, as freezing conditions persisted into Monday.

As the storm dumped snow , sleet and freezing rain across the wide expanse, officials cautioned that an Arctic air mass behind the system would see temperatures fall dangerously low for days, prolonging disruptions to daily life.

The US National Weather Service (NWS) told Americans to expect more of the same weather conditions into Monday morning.

New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said five people were found dead outside over the weekend in freezing temperatures. While he did not confirm the deaths were weather-related, he told reporters "there is no more powerful reminder of the danger of extreme cold".

In Texas , authorities confirmed three deaths, including a 16-year-old girl killed in a sledding accident.

Two people died in Louisiana from hypothermia, the southern state's health department said.

The PowerOutage.com tracking site showed more than 840,000 customers without electricity as of Sunday night, mostly in the US South where the storm intensified Saturday.

In Tennessee, where a band of ice has downed power lines, more than 300,000 residential and commercial customers were without electricity, while Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia – where such storms are less common – each had over 100,000 outages.

The outages are particularly dangerous as the South is being walloped by treacherous cold that the NWS warns could set records.

Authorities from Texas to North Carolina and New York urged residents to stay home due to the perilous conditions.

"Stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary," Texas's Emergency Management Division posted on X.

The storm was moving Sunday into the northeast, dumping snow and sleet on heavily populated cities including Philadelphia, New York and Boston.

At least 20 states and the US capital Washington have declared states of emergency.

Residents in the capital Washington awoke to a blanket of several inches of snow on sidewalks and roads, followed by heavy sleet.

Federal offices have been preemptively closed for Monday.

Several major airports in Washington, Philadelphia and New York had nearly all flights cancelled for the day.

Tracking site Flightaware.com showed more than 19,000 flights into and out of the country had been scrapped since Saturday.

President Donald Trump , who was riding out the storm at the White House , said on his Truth Social platform Saturday: "We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm!"

The brutal storm system is the result of a stretched polar vortex, an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes morphs into a more oval shape, sending cold air spilling across North America.

Scientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions may be linked to climate change, though the debate is not settled and natural variability plays a role.

But Trump – who scoffs at climate change science and has rolled back green energy policies – questioned how the cold front fit into broader climatic shifts.

"WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???" the Republican leader posted.

The NWS warned that heavy ice could cause "long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous or impassable travel conditions", including in many states less accustomed to intense winter weather.

Authorities warned of life-threatening cold that could last a week post-storm, especially in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, where wind chill lows were forecast to dip to extremes under -50F (-45C).

Such temperatures can cause frostbite within minutes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:54:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54183a5a-fa80-11f0-b39c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/54398d430caa0351966b436bbd448516e3d0b299.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin sticks to demand that Ukraine cede all of Donbas in talks, TASS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-sticks-demand-that-ukraine-cede-all-donbas-talks-tass-reports-2026-01-26/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that the issue of territory remained

fundamental to Russia when it came to getting a deal to end the fighting in Ukraine, the state TASS news agency reported after trilateral weekend talks in Abu Dhabi.

President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that Russia will take all of Ukraine's Donbas region - of which Moscow's forces currently control 90% - by force unless Kyiv gives it up in a peace deal.

"It's no secret that this is our consistent position, the position of our president, that the territorial issue, which is part of the Anchorage formula, is of fundamental importance to the Russian side," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the TASS state news agency.

The "Anchorage formula" refers to what Russia says was agreed between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin at a summit in Alaska last August, according to a source close to the Kremlin.

That purported agreement, according to the same source, envisages Ukraine handing Russia control of all of Donbas and freezing the front lines elsewhere in Ukraine's east and south as a condition of any future peace deal.

Kyiv has repeatedly said that it will not gift Russia territory which Moscow has failed to win on the battlefield.

State news agency RIA cited Peskov as saying that Moscow positively assessed what he called the "constructive talks" with Ukraine in Abu Dhabi.

The talks, brokered by the United States, ended without a deal, but with more talks are expected next weekend.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:34:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHA4EYDYS5JJPMSIGKKVZKSLSU.jpg?auth=f8efab9f94331a25943ce180cdc3b9ee3565be343adf418f48b58580092617d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Sudan orders UN personnel, civilians to leave parts of Jonglei State</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-sudan-orders-un-personnel-civilians-leave-parts-jonglei-state-2026-01-26/</link><description>JUBA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - South Sudan's military has ordered all civilians and personnel from the UN mission and all other charities to evacuate three counties in Jonglei State ahead of an operation there against opposition forces.

Clashes that the United Nations says are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017 have been convulsing South Sudan, Africa's youngest country, for months.

Some of the fiercest fighting has taken place in Jonglei, located in the country's east on the border with Ethiopia, where the South Sudan People's Defence Forces (SSPDF) is seeking to halt an offensive by fighters loyal to Sudan People's Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO).

An operation code-named "operation enduring peace" was "imminent," the SSPDF said in a statement on Sunday.

The military said all civilians living in Nyirol, Uror and Akobo counties in Jonglei were "directed to immediately evacuate for safety to government-controlled areas as soon as possible."

All personnel from the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and those working for non-governmental organisations were also ordered to evacuate the three counties within 48 hours.

"Our peacekeepers in Akobo remain in place, carrying out all efforts under our mandate to help de-escalate tensions and prevent conflict," a UNMISS spokesperson told Reuters. She did not say whether UN staff also remained in the other counties.

Last week SPLA-IO called on its forces to march on South Sudan's capital Juba, signalling a major escalation.

Earlier this month SPLA-IO forces seized the town of Pajut in heavy fighting in the north of Jonglei and the town's capture was seen as putting the state capital of Bor at risk.

In a statement on Sunday UNMISS said 180,000 people in the state had already been displaced by the conflict and urged South Sudan's leaders "to put the interests of their people first by stopping the fighting."

Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said in a statement on Sunday it had evacuated key staff from Akobo county after "clear instruction from the relevant authorities, and in response to the deteriorating security situation in the area."

SPLA-IO forces led by South Sudan's vice president Riek Machar battled the military in the 2013-18 civil war, which was fought along largely ethnic lines and killed about 400,000 people.

A peace deal in 2018 quieted the conflict, although localised clashes have persisted.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:34:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gold prices hit record high as investors seek safe bet amid geopolitical turmoil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260126-gold-prices-hit-record-high-as-investors-seek-safe-bet-amid-geopolitical-turmoil</link><description>Gold surged to a record high above $5,100 an ⁠ounce on Monday, extending a historic rally as investors piled into the safe-haven asset amid rising geopolitical uncertainties .

Spot gold were up 2.2 percent at $5,089.78 per ounce by 0656 GMT, after earlier touching an all-time high of $5,110.50. US gold futures for February delivery also gained ​the same amount to $5,086.30 per ounce.

The metal soared 64 percent in 2025, its biggest annual gain since 1979, driven by ‍safe-haven demand, US monetary policy easing, robust central bank purchases including China 's fourteenth straight month of buying in December, and record inflows into exchange-traded funds.

Prices have set consecutive record peaks ​over the past week and have already risen more than 18 percent this year.

The latest catalyst "is effectively ​this crisis of confidence in the US administration and US assets, that was set off by some of the erratic decision-making from the Trump administration last week", said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com.

Meanwhile, a ‌rising yen dragged the dollar broadly lower on Monday, with markets on alert for possible intervention in the yen and investors cutting dollar positions ahead of this week's Federal Reserve meeting.

A weaker dollar makes greenback-priced ‍gold more affordable for holders of other currencies.

Analysts expect gold prices to climb further toward $6,000 this year on mounting global tensions as well as strong central-bank and retail demand.

"We expect further upside (for gold). Our current forecast suggests that prices will peak at around $5,500 later this year," said Philip Newman, director at Metals Focus.

"Periodic pullbacks are likely as investors take profits, but we expect each correction to be short-lived and met with strong buying interest," Newman added.

Spot silver advanced 4.8 percent to $107.903, after hitting a record of $109.44.

China experts said Xi’s move against his long-term ally and Politburo member Gen. Zhang Youxia also concentrates even more power in the president's hands, makes the already secretive command of China’s military more opaque, and suggests that a near-term attack on Taiwan is less likely.

"Zhang's removal means that truly nobody in the leadership is safe now,” said Jonathan Czin of the Washington-based Brookings Institution, who called the investigation “astonishing”.

Czin, who spent years as a top China analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and, in 2021-2023, served as the director for China at the United States National Security Council, added that the probe marked a “profound shift” in Chinese politics.

The change is remarkable as past purges targeted people who may have had some overlap with Xi but lacked strong personal ties. This time around, the purge has crossed into what Czin has described as the " asteroid belt , opens new tab " of Xi's political solar system.

Both Xi and Zhang are princelings, children of former senior officers. The 75-year-old general was initially expected to retire in 2022, but Xi kept him on the Central Military Commission (CMC), the Chinese military's top leadership body, for a third term, underscoring their closeness.

The defence ministry announced a probe on Saturday into Zhang - second-in-command under Xi as senior vice-chairman of the CMC - “for suspected serious violations of discipline and law”.

The military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi after coming to power in 2012. The purges reached its elite Rocket Force, which oversees nuclear weapons as well as conventional missiles, in 2023. Two former defence ministers were also purged from the ruling Communist Party in recent years for corruption.

“I think corruption concerns are probably real, though those are typically more a pretext to remove someone in Chinese politics," said Czin, citing how deeply entrenched graft was before Xi's campaign.

Another senior member, Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the CMC's Joint Staff Department, was also placed under investigation, effectively shrinking the seven-member body into two, with Xi at the top.

"Xi has eviscerated the People's Liberation Army (PLA) top brass like no leader before him," said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society.

In a front-page editorial on Sunday, the PLA Daily described the probe as a major achievement, adding that the two generals had "seriously undermined and violated" the Chairman Responsibility System.

Under the system, Xi, as the CMC chairman, is vested with the "supreme military decision-making." It also serves as the "institutional arrangement for practising the party's absolute leadership over the army," according to China's government , opens new tab .

“To invoke violating the Chairman Responsibility System suggests Zhang had too much power outside of Xi himself,” said Lyle Morris, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.

The PLA Daily article did not offer further details and did not provide any evidence of a power struggle. While some analysts say it suggests disloyalty, others are sceptical Zhang posed a threat to Xi's power.

“For Xi to undertake such a dramatic move suggests two things: Xi has the full support of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xi is confident in his consolidation of power over the military,” Morris said.

Zhang has in the past overseen the PLA’s procurement department which has become the target of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi, but he himself has until now been spared.

James Char, a scholar at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said that by placing Zhang under the probe, "Xi has also responded to criticisms that his PLA anti-corruption campaign has been a selective process - that his fellow princeling gets a free pass."

"Zhang had got off scot-free after his acolyte, Li Shangfu, got into trouble in the latter half of 2023,” added Char. Former defence minister Li was ousted for suspected corruption in military procurement.

But leaving the army leadership depleted and without replacements raises questions about how the world's largest military is run.

“It is honestly not clear how the chain of command should be functioning - especially since so many of the officers who would otherwise be eligible to replace the disposed members of the CMC have themselves been ousted,” Brookings’ Czin said.

Other analysts said they expect higher-level initiatives like expanding joint training to slow down until Xi can rebuild the commission.

“That could look like adding additional members, or it could involve building some sort of new apparatus around Xi as the central decision maker,” said Eric Hundman, director of research at BluePath Labs, a Washington-based security consultancy.

Asia Society's Thomas said Xi wanted to renew the military leadership and may be waiting until the Communist Party Congress next year to "thoroughly vet suitable candidates for vacancies on the CMC.”

Until then, the military will continue to push for Xi’s ambitious modernization goals, analysts said.

While China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly muscular line in regional maritime disputes, as well as over the self-ruled Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Beijing staged the largest war games to date around Taiwan late last year.

With U.S. President Donald Trump's attention elsewhere, and Taiwan scheduled for an election in 2028, Xi has time to "clean house," analysts said.

“Gutting the PLA high command suggests that Xi is not contemplating a major military escalation against Taiwan in the near term. But his crackdown is designed to elevate a cadre of more competent and loyal generals who will pose more of a threat in the future,” Thomas said.

“Xi is a man on a mission,” he added. “He will do whatever it takes to ensure the Party and its military are politically loyal and ideologically committed.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:29:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E5SXHVYSAZK5HBSIUT4UETO55Y.jpg?auth=49e9f03fcb0a818bf53e5ac0587f24992b2e6b7290d5ec3e2ac040a00862f117&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Americans hunker down, help each other under blizzard and brutal cold</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/americans-hunker-down-help-each-other-under-blizzard-brutal-cold-2026-01-26/</link><description>WASHINGTON/TULSA, Oklahoma Jan 26 (Reuters) - Tens of millions of Americans hunkered down on Monday or ventured out to help neighbors under bitter cold, blizzards of snow and lashings of freezing rain from a huge winter storm that paralyzed the eastern United States.

From New York and Massachusetts in the northeast to Texas and North Carolina in the south, roads were frozen slick with ice and buried under often more than a foot of snow.

In some southern states, residents faced winter conditions unseen in those areas for decades, with inch-thick ice coating branches, bringing down trees and power lines.

Flights were canceled, schools were shut and volunteers staffed emergency shelters to provide warmth for the needy and homeless.

"I just saw a need for getting people out of the cold," said Ryan DuVal, who owns a vintage firetruck and was driving it through the frozen streets of Tulsa, Oklahoma, looking for people who needed help.

"You know, just cruise the streets, see someone, offer a ride. If they take it, great. If not, I can at least warm them up in the truck and just get them a water, meal, something. And it's just giving back to the community like everybody should do."

Winter storm warnings covered 118 million people. An estimated 157 million were warned to bundle up against cold, ranging from sub-zero Fahrenheit temperatures (-18 Celsius) along the Canadian border to below freezing as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.

While the storm system was expected to drift away from the East Coast into the Atlantic on Monday, more Arctic air was forecast to rush in behind it, prolonging bitter cold, icy conditions over the next few days, the National Weather Service said.

Its Monday morning forecast predicted more heavy snow in the northeast, with snow also in the Appalachians and rain, some of it freezing, in the mid-Atlantic and along the southeast coast.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had mobilized National Guard troops in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley to assist with the state's emergency storm response.

Announcing that schools would be shut for a remote school day, New York City's Mayor Zohran Mamdani quipped: "I know that this may disappoint some students, so if you do see me, feel free to throw a snowball at me."

The onslaught of snow, ice and winds hit air travel especially hard, with major carriers forced to cancel more than 11,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday, according to an industry tracking service FlightAware.com. More cancellations and delays were expected on Monday, though not quite as severe.

More than 820,000 electricity customers were without power as of 4 a.m. EST (0900 GMT) on Monday across a swathe of southern states from Texas to Virginia, according to PowerOutage.us. Worst-hit was Tennessee, accounting for nearly a third of the outages.

Calling the storm "historic," President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations for a dozen states, mostly in the mid-South.

Still, despite the emergency and the danger, the winter conditions were fun for many, including in Washington DC, where a huge crowd gathered for a raucous impromptu snowball fight in Meridian Hill Park, one man wearing an astronaut space suit.

Families brought sleds to Capitol Hill, where children zoomed down the steep slope below the white-domed seat of the U.S. Congress.

"It's beautiful. It's so fun to go down Capitol Hill. It was great powder this morning. Getting a little sleety now but we're having a great time!" said a man who pushed his daughter down the hill on a purple plastic sled.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:29:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NHNRXJ7DLNONJG5VOW6BLQSB6A.jpg?auth=9075c04d758bf05050d6798231e62888bc9cb43a61aa040f68f7de53c9b4c804&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German defence minister urges Trump to apologise for Afghanistan remarks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/german-defence-minister-urges-trump-apologise-afghanistan-remarks-2026-01-26/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 26 (Reuters) - German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to apologise for remarks suggesting that America's NATO allies in Afghanistan avoided frontline service, joining a chorus of criticism from European politicians and army veterans.

Trump caused deep offence among U.S. allies when he told Fox Business Network last week that the U.S. had "never needed" the transatlantic alliance and accused allies of staying "a little off the front lines" in Afghanistan.

"It's just not right and it's disrespectful to talk about the dead of your allies in that way. They all stood there, at the side of the United States. To claim something else today is simply not true," he told a talk show on Germany's ARD public broadcaster late on Sunday.

Thousands of German troops took part in NATO's Operation Enduring Freedom and Resolute Support missions in Afghanistan and 59 were killed. The operations were launched following the al Qaeda attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.

Pistorius said he would bring up the issue the next time he spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and he urged Trump to apologise.

"That would be a sign of decency, respect and also insight," he said.

His comments follow similar statements from other European politicians including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called Trump's remarks "frankly appalling" , in a departure from his usual avoidance of direct criticism of the U.S. president.

Trump on Saturday praised "brave" British soldiers , though he made no apology for his earlier comments and he did not mention the sacrifices of other NATO allies. Britain lost 457 service personnel in Afghanistan.

Trump administration officials have been critical of European countries for failing to meet NATO spending targets and for being too dependent on the U.S. for their own defence.

Pistorius, who has been leading a drive to rebuild Germany's armed forces, said Europe had to accept it could not depend on the U.S. as it had over the past 70 years but that the German military was on an "excellent path" to achieving its goals of being back up to strength by 2029.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:30:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SILNKLFFFNL5FNJ5WQ3LEKCKGQ.jpg?auth=5961d59309ff86940ae6e64258b97432caf420507b868fa0f351e1abfd805b90&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Ukraine must cede Donbas as 'fundamental' condition of peace talks, Moscow says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260126-live-ukraine-must-cede-donbas-as-fundamental-condition-of-peace-talks-moscow-says</link><description>Ukraine’s ​military struck ⁠the Slavyansk Eko oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar ​region overnight, ‍it has said ​in a statement on ​the Telegram app.

"Strike drones were recorded hitting the plant's ‍territory and explosions were ​heard in the target area. According to preliminary ‌information, elements of ‍the primary oil processing facility were hit," the statement said.

European ‍Union countries on Monday ​gave their final approval to the bloc's plan ⁠to ban Russian gas imports by late 2027, allowing it to pass into law.

Under the agreement, the EU will halt Russian ‌liquefied natural gas imports by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by 30 September ‍2027, legalising ​EU's vow to cut ties with its former ‍top gas supplier, nearly four years after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion ​of Ukraine.

Ministers from EU countries approved the law ​at a meeting in Brussels on Monday, although Slovakia and Hungary voted against.

Hungary and Slovakia remain heavily reliant on ​Russian energy imports and want to maintain close ties with Moscow. Hungary said it would take the case to the European Court of Justice.

The ​Kremlin has said that the issue of territory remains fundamental to ⁠Russia when it comes to getting a deal to end the fighting in Ukraine, the state TASS news agency reported after trilateral weekend ​talks in Abu Dhabi.

President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ‍said that Russia will take all of Ukraine's Donbas region – of which Moscow's forces ​currently control 90% – by force unless Kyiv gives it ​up in a peace deal.

"It's no secret that this is our consistent position, the position of our president, that the territorial issue, which is part of the Anchorage formula, is of fundamental importance to the Russian side," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the TASS state news ‍agency.

That purported agreement, according to ‌the same source, envisages Ukraine handing Russia control of all of Donbas and freezing the front lines elsewhere ‍in Ukraine's east and south as a condition of any future peace deal.

The Kremlin has said the US-brokered trilateral talks in the UAE between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators had been held in a "constructive spirit" but that there was still "significant work ahead".

"It would be a mistake to expect any significant results from the initial contacts... But the very fact that these contacts have begun in a constructive spirit can be viewed positively. However, there is significant work ahead," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.

The ​Kremlin has said that the territorial issue remains ​of ‍fundamental importance ​to Russia in peace ​talks with the United States and Ukraine, Russian state media reported.

State ‍news agency ​RIA cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peksov as ‌saying that Moscow positively ‍assesses what he called "constructive talks" on Ukraine.

‍Two enterprises ​caught fire and ⁠one person was injured in the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban ​in Russia's Krasnodar ‍region after drone ​fragments fell on them, the regional ​emergencies centre have said.

The centre did not specify what enterprises were affected. The city hosts ‍a private refinery with ​a capacity of around 100,000 barrels per day, supplying ‌fuel for both domestic use and ‍export.

Russia's defence ministry said air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed 40 Ukrainian drones overnight, including ‍34 in the Krasnodar ‌region.

North ‍Korean leader ​Kim Jong Un on Sunday ⁠viewed sculptures to be displayed at a memorial for North Korean troops who ​died fighting overseas, state media KCNA ‍said on Monday.

Under a mutual defence pact with Russia, ​in 2024 North Korea sent some 14,000 soldiers to ​fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 of them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources.

Visiting the Mansudae Art Studio, Kim said the sculptures would "convey forever the legendary feats... of ‍admirable sons of the DPRK", according to KCNA, using North ​Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that a US security guarantees document for Ukraine is “100% ready” after two days of talks involving representatives from Ukraine, the US and Russia.

Speaking to journalists in Vilnius during a visit to Lithuania, Zelensky said Ukraine is waiting for its partners to set a signing date, after which the document would go to the US Congress and Ukrainian parliament for ratification.

Zelensky also emphasized Ukraine’s push for European Union membership by 2027, calling it an “economic security guarantee.”

The Ukrainian leader described the talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as likely the first trilateral format in “quite a long while” that included not only diplomats but military representatives from all three sides. The talks, which began on Friday and continued Saturday, were the latest aiming to end Russia’s nearly four-year full-scale invasion.

Over 3,600 flights were canceled and 714 were delayed as of early Monday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware, following more than 11,000 cancellations reported on Sunday.

The number of cancellations and delays was expected to rise as the day progressed.

Low pressure south of New England is expected to move east over the Atlantic on Monday, bringing heavy snow to parts of the Northeast and freezing rain across sections of the Mid-Atlantic, the U.S. National Weather Service said.

Snow is also expected along the Appalachian region, while rain will spread along the Southeast coast as a cold front moves offshore, the agency said.

American Airlines (AAL.O) , opens new tab accounted for the largest share of disruptions on Monday, with nearly 570 flights canceled and about 57 delayed, followed by Republic Airways, JetBlue Airways (JBLU.O) , opens new tab and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) , opens new tab .

Boston's Logan International Airport, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport were among the hardest hit.

Major U.S. carriers rolled out sweeping travel waivers and flexible re-booking options to assist passengers whose travel plans were disrupted by the cancellations.

Airline operations are highly interconnected, meaning cancellations can leave aircraft and crews out of position, complicating efforts to restore normal flight schedules.

The storm also impeded road travel. The Federal Emergency Management Agency warned that driving conditions could become dangerous as blizzard-like conditions, strong winds and ice spread further.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of customers across several U.S. states, from Tennessee to the Carolinas, reported power outages, with Tennessee reporting the highest number of cases.

More than 820,000 customers were without electricity as of early hours on Monday, according to data from PowerOutage.us.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:56:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VVQECZMNEVMOVOPKHO4JLKOT6A.jpg?auth=6fa5ebf1f952c28e5b06bc170ea32f02a0081adc4a4aac4a09574f491ba63e0e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ethiopia declares end of Marburg outbreak that killed nine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/ethiopia-declares-end-marburg-outbreak-that-killed-nine-2026-01-26/</link><description>ADDIS ABABA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Ethiopia has declared the end of an outbreak of Marburg virus, the World Health Organization said on Monday, after the disease killed at least nine people.

"Ethiopia has officially declared the end of its first-ever Marburg virus disease outbreak following enhanced surveillance with no new confirmed cases," WHO said on X.

Marburg often causes severe headaches and leads to haemorrhaging.

Duterte's defence had said the elderly politician, who is being held in The Hague over murders during his war on drugs , could not stand trial due to cognitive decline .

Judges said in a statement that a report by independent medical experts found that Duterte would be able to understand and participate in his case.

They recalled that for someone to be deemed fit to take part in their case it is enough that they have a broad understanding of the procedures, not that they operate at their highest level.

"The Chamber is satisfied, in law, that Mister Duterte is able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings," the judges said.

They also set a new date for his confirmation of charges hearing, an important step towards a trial.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:56:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GREYG4LAPBM5NAZOT6VBDDGYHA.jpg?auth=fe67aa5857d17925bab1541ab270a187b494d19564742a63fa0227d33cb92785&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia receives first Rafale advanced fighter jets from France, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-receives-first-rafale-advanced-fighter-jets-france-official-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Indonesia has received three Rafale fighter jets from France in the first deliveries from a multi-billion-dollar defence deal between the two countries, a defence ministry official told Reuters on Monday, marking a major upgrade to the country's ageing military hardware.

Jakarta, France's main arms client in Southeast Asia, has placed orders for as many as 42 Rafales, built by Dassault Aviation (AM.PA) , opens new tab , as well as French frigates and submarines, as the archipelago steps up defence spending under President Prabowo Subianto, a former special forces commander.

"The aircraft have been handed over and are ready for use by the Indonesian Air Force,” Defence Ministry spokesperson Rico Ricardo Sirait said in a message in response to a Reuters query - the first confirmation that Indonesia has possession of the advanced military aircraft after striking an $8 billion deal with France in 2022 and expanding it last year.

Sirait said the three aircraft arrived on Friday and were stationed at Roesmin Nurjadin Air Base in Pekanbaru, located on the western island of Sumatra.

Three more jets are expected to arrive later this year, he added.

Indonesia has been one of the biggest players on the international fighter jet market as it looks to upgrade its aircraft, setting aside big budgets for defence spending.

It has been considering a number of options alongside the Rafales, including China's J-10 fighter jets and U.S.-made F-15EX jets. For the longer term, it has also signed a contract to buy 48 KAAN fighter jets from Turkey , a fifth-generation aircraft powered by General Electric F-110 engines that are also used in fourth-generation Lockheed Martin F-16 jets.

Reuters also reported that Indonesia and Pakistan discussed a potential deal earlier this month for Jakarta to buy combat jets and killer drones.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:57:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F5DMKR7MFVJ4DC4INQX2W7CM6Q.jpg?auth=d5308b05f3cfd873cf11949308bea57a8e4fbe1cc18065dba69004ff33c3d2be&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU launches probe of Musk's Grok AI chatbot over sexualised images</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260126-eu-launches-probe-of-musk-grok-ai-chatbot-over-sexualised-images</link><description>The European ​Commission has launched an ⁠investigation into Elon Musk 's AI chatbot Grok over the production ​of explicit ‍imagery , Regina Doherty, a ​member of the European parliament ​representing Ireland , said in a statement on Monday.

Carney is making all-out efforts to diversify Canada's alliances beyond the U.S. , its top ‌trade partner. In Davos last week, he earned a rare standing ovation for saying the old rules-based order is over and called on middle powers like Canada to build coalitions to shape a fairer, more resilient world.

His viral speech followed an agreement with China to slash tariffs on electric vehicles and canola and open up to C$7 billion ($5.11 billion) in export markets as he tries to double non-U.S. exports over the next decade.

Carney is also resetting relations with India after his predecessor Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in 2023. India has denied those claims.

Prime ‌Minister Narendra Modi attended the Group of 7 summit on Carney's invitation last year and several of Carney's ministers have traveled to India.

"I have ​a feeling in the first week of March is what we are looking at," said High Commissioner Patnaik on Carney's visit during a weekend interview.

Carney's office declined to comment. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday Carney would visit Australia in March to address parliament.

Canada's Energy Minister Tim Hodgson is visiting India this week and said the timing of Carney's trip was not yet set.

“There ‍are plans for the Prime Minister to visit at some point this year, it will depend on the progress we make,” Hodgson said in a Sunday interview.

Formal negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India should also start in March, Patnaik said. The countries agreed to restart stalled trade talks in November.

Carney will sign smaller agreements with the Indian government on nuclear energy, oil and gas, the environment, AI and quantum computing as well as deals ⁠on education and culture during his visit, Patnaik said.

A 10-year C$2.8 billion uranium supply deal is likely to be included, he added.

Hodgson did not confirm the deal, but said Canada is happy ‍to sell uranium under the Canada-India nuclear cooperation agreement as long as India is prepared to abide by International Energy Agency safeguards.

"We know that India is a major nuclear country and it has major plans ‌to grow ‌its civilian use of nuclear energy," Hodgson said. "So that would be one of the topics I expect that we will discuss with my counterpart."

Between Hodgson's visit and Carney's, both countries will be announcing agreements around energy and mining, Patnaik said, adding that a pact on critical minerals and crude and LNG transactions will be the most prominent ones.

“We need to focus on economies that are large and growing. India squarely falls into that category. India is a growing user of critical minerals that Canada can supply," Hodgson said.

Both countries are moving with a sense of urgency after ⁠two years of stalled talks, and a ⁠renewed impetus to move fast to make ​sure countries hit by U.S. tariffs forge their own path, Patnaik said.

"Now we are living in a world where the natural rules-based order which gave a certainty to the world is not functioning," he said, referring to Carney's speech at Davos.

"(We) should work together to have an agreement that protects us from the vagaries of the international order," he added.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs on Canada if it signed ‍a deal with China.

Carney responded that Canada respects its commitments under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to not pursue free trade agreements with non market economies.

Patnaik said India is also seeking new agreements.

India and the EU are expected to announce on Tuesday the conclusion of for a free trade pact.

Within a year of starting formal negotiations with Canada, a CEPA pact could be signed, Patnaik added.

India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman are ​also likely to visit Canada very soon, he said.

Patnaik said that there is a court case ongoing in Canada ‍on four people accused of the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. If evidence comes out that there were Indians involved, India will take action, he said.

He said India's National Security Advisor will visit Ottawa next month ​as part of regular engagements between the two countries to exchange intelligence and discuss security measures.

The call was the first between the two leaders since To Lam was unanimously reappointed as head of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party for the next five years last Friday.

Xi, in a congratulatory message to Lam, described the two nations as a "community with a shared future" and said Beijing was willing to strengthen communications with Hanoi.

"China and Vietnam should stay the course and remain unwavering in their aspirations, working together to advance development," Chinese state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as saying.

The two communist-ruled states have a long history of mistrust and territorial disputes, including over South China Sea boundaries, although their Communist parties have remained officially close.

Xi urged Lam to "jointly oppose hegemonism and bloc confrontation", state media reported, although he did not mention any particular country.

China and the U.S. reached a one-year tariff truce following talks between Xi and President Donald Trump in South Korea last October, although the average U.S. duties on Chinese exports still stands at 47.5%.

Vietnam has in recent years deepened engagement with Washington. Last year it pledged to cut tariffs on several U.S. products and moved to approve Starlink services, part of efforts to stave off U.S. levies due to its large bilateral trade surplus.

Trump's administration has accused Vietnam of serving as a transshipment point for Chinese goods.

In Monday's call, Xi said the two sides must "strengthen confidence, uphold fundamental principles while advancing innovation, and guard against and defuse various risks and challenges".</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:50:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WZWKWGUIURKYXIEB26B32GCANI.jpg?auth=ceac5ac731dafba309cbfa548a8e2ec8daa44ad6c684d54b8675f3a51b832ab9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China warns citizens against Japan visits during longest annual holiday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinese-airlines-extend-free-cancellations-japan-related-flights-october-2026-01-26/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 26 (Reuters) - China on Monday warned its citizens against travelling to Japan during the Lunar New Year, its longest public holiday, as Beijing's anger over a comment Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made in early November about democratically governed Taiwan showed no signs of abating.

Citing "a surge in crimes targeting Chinese citizens" and earthquakes, the Chinese foreign ministry said nationals "face serious security threats in Japan," according to a statement it released.

Beijing has issued similar warnings following Takaichi's remark in November suggesting that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

The remark infuriated Beijing, which has responded with export curbs , flight cancellations, and vitriolic state media commentaries . Its defence ministry warned Tokyo of a "crushing" military defeat if it were to use force to intervene over Taiwan.

Major Chinese airlines including Air China (601111.SS) , opens new tab , China Eastern (600115.SS) , opens new tab and China Southern Airlines (600029.SS) , opens new tab , on Monday extended their free-of-charge change and cancellation policies for Japan-related flights until October 24. The airlines first announced the policies in November in the wake of Takaichi's remark and then last month extended them until this March.

The number of Chinese tourists to Japan plunged 45% in December, but overall tourist numbers to Japan hit a record high, Japan's tourism minister said last week.

While Takaichi has not retracted her November remark, she has tempered it by reaffirming Japan's position on China's "One China policy". She has also said that China’s characterisation of her remarks are inconsistent with facts.

At a January 19 press conference to announce a snap election, Takaichi observed that: "China has conducted military exercises around Taiwan, and economic coercion is increasingly being used through control of key supply-chain materials." She added that: "The international security environment is becoming more severe."

While warning its nationals to shun trips to Japan, Beijing has been upbeat about a "tourism boom" with another of its eastern Asian neighbours - South Korea - as it seeks to shore up ties with Seoul following the rupture with Tokyo.

Buoyed by visa-free policies, the numbers of South Korean tourists to China and Chinese visitors to South Korea have been on the rise.

"This two-way tourism boom is a microcosm of the growing economic exchanges and cooperation between China and South Korea," state-run tabloid Global Times said in a editorial published on Sunday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:50:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UZU72BCHIFL5HKRIW4NNTRLLMM.jpg?auth=6cb355494104410ee97bf4424d5b50d6b522f709bd121d52ac6972a4b93c807a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czechs fundraise over $6 mln to buy generators for freezing Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/czechs-fundraise-over-6-mln-buy-generators-freezing-ukraine-2026-01-26/</link><description>PRAGUE, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Czechs have collected more than $6 million in just five days in a grassroots fundraising effort to buy generators, heaters and batteries for Ukraine, where hundreds of thousands are freezing in subzero temperatures after Russian attacks on power plants.

Ukrainian engineers have been working around the clock in hazardous conditions for weeks since Russia escalated its attacks on Ukraine's grid during a cold snap that has seen temperatures plunge to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 F).

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy declared an energy emergency after the Russian strikes.

The European Commission said on Friday it would send 447 emergency generators worth 3.7 million euros ($4.39 million).

The darekproputina.cz initiative has been collecting donations for Ukraine since Russia's full invasion in 2022 , including campaigns to buy a Blackhawk helicopter and a tank as well as drones, ammunition and medical supplies worth more than 55 million euros.

Its latest effort raised 126 million crowns ($6.16 million) from 74,745 donors from last Wednesday until Monday morning, and another roughly 15 million crowns is on the way from donors, organiser Martin Ondracek told Reuters.

"Over the weekend we booked two generators - the diesel-fuelled boxes that come on a truck - for 8 million crowns each that should go to two smaller health facilities," Ondracek said.

The initiative cooperated with three funds in Ukraine to avoid lengthy logistical and customs delays but is also in talks with Czech suppliers as not everything is available on the spot, he added.

"There are about 30 people working on this, we need to spend the money as fast as possible," Ondracek said, adding there was a particular demand for chemical heaters and batteries.

"Batteries are key for people to charge when power is available so they have at least some power for a kettle or charging phones."

A police statement said a multi-agency security team was pursuing the attackers, and the area had been secured as operations continued.

"We urge the public to remain calm and vigilant, and to cooperate with the security agencies," the statement added.

Al Shabaab, which controls large swathes of southern and central Somalia, frequently carries out cross-border attacks on Kenyan military and civilian targets. Security analysts say the assaults are aimed at pressuring Kenya into withdrawing its troops from peacekeeping missions in Somalia.

In June 2023, seven people were killed in two separate incidents in the same region. Police said at the time they suspected members of al Shabaab were responsible for one of the attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:50:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland hopes to prevent cable damage with new surveillance centre</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/finland-teams-up-with-eu-baltic-sea-states-enhance-undersea-infrastructure-2026-01-26/</link><description>HELSINKI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Finland's Border Guard hopes to prevent damage to critical undersea infrastructure in the Gulf of Finland with a maritime surveillance centre it plans to set up in cooperation with other Baltic Sea states and the EU Commission, it said on Monday.

The Baltic Sea region has been on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The most recent incident occurred on New Year's Eve when Finnish authorities seized a cargo vessel en route from Russia to Israel on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable.

While NATO has boosted its military presence in the region with frigates, aircraft and naval drones, the Finnish surveillance centre is part of a joint action plan that the European Commission proposed to enhance the security of submarine cables in February last year, the Border Guard said.

"We are developing, and we have the need for, broader preventive measures, even before any harm has occurred," Mikko Hirvi, Head of Maritime Safety and Security at the Finnish Border Guard, told Reuters.

The preventive measures include sensors in the seabed, artificial intelligence solutions for enhanced and real-time analysis of maritime traffic and exchanging information on vessels with allies, he added, declining to comment on which capabilities were already operational.

Hirvi said the surveillance centre would be built gradually, drawing on the Border Guard's existing capabilities, and that Finland planned also to seek EU funding for it.

After a Chinese container ship sailed on after damaging a gas pipeline and cables in the Baltic seabed in 2023, Finnish authorities have boarded and seized two vessels - the oil tanker Eagle S in December 2024 and the cargo vessel Fitburg in December 2025 - on suspicion that they had severed undersea cables by dragging their anchors.

By seizing the ships, authorities managed to prevent further damage from happening, Hirvi said.

Mikko Simola, commander of the Gulf of Finland Coast Guard District, said factors to be monitored included unusual deviations in vessels' speed or course.

"For the past year in particular, we have focused on obtaining real-time information about vessel deviations," he told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:46:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VAJNB7TCHNOIJN5V623GD5YOIQ.jpg?auth=d717d42ac5ae7a75ec8fc85a27befb184d0cdd4d6016545fe3a5efc44a39095e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French senator on trial for allegedly drugging lawmaker to assault her</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-french-senator-trial-allegedly-drugging-lawmaker-assault-her-2026-01-26/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A former French senator went on trial on Monday accused of spiking a lawmaker's drink with ecstasy with the intention of sexually assaulting her.

Joel Guerriau, 68, who resigned as a senator over the case in October 2025, allegedly administered lawmaker Sandrine Josso with "a substance liable to alter her discernment or control over her actions, in order to commit rape or sexual aggression", a court document showed.

The centre-right politician also faces charges related to the possession and use of ecstasy, the document read. Guerriau has denied the charges against him.

The case has resonated in France following the 2024 conviction of Dominique Pelicot , who was found guilty of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, Gisele, and inviting dozens of strangers to assault her while she was unconscious.

The Pelicot trial attracted headlines worldwide and raised awareness about drug-facilitated assaults .

Josso told investigators she felt unwell after drinking a few sips from a glass of champagne offered to her by Guerriau at his apartment to celebrate an electoral win.

She told them the champagne did not taste normal and that if she had not managed to leave the flat she was certain Guerriau would have assaulted her, convinced he wanted to "satisfy an urge", according to the court document.

A toxicology test later revealed traces of ecstasy in her blood, and ecstasy was also found in Guerriau's apartment, the document stated.

If found guilty, he could face a jail sentence of up to five years and a fine of 75,000 euros ($88,950). His lawyer was not immediately available for comment.

The former senator's Horizons party, which is part of French President Emmanuel Macron's governing alliance, told French media following the accusations in November 2023 that Guerriau had been suspended with immediate effect.

The trial runs until Tuesday.

Parliament last year approved changes to France's rape law to include consent, bringing the legislation more into line with more than a dozen other European countries in a move that was given new impetus by the Pelicot mass rape trial.

Here are some reactions from governments and regulators in January:

The European Commission on January 26 opened an investigation into whether Grok disseminates illegal content such as manipulated sexualised images in the EU. The probe will examine whether X properly assessed and mitigated risks as required under the bloc's digital rules.

The Commission had on January 8 extended a retention order sent to X last year to retain and preserve all internal documents and data related to Grok until the end of 2026.

Britain's media regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation into X to determine whether sexually intimate deepfakes produced by Grok violated its duty to protect people in the UK from content that could be illegal, under the country's Online Safety Act framework.

In France, government ministers referred sexually explicit Grok-generated content circulating on X to prosecutors and alerted French media regulator Arcom to check the platform's compliance with EU rules.

Germany's media minister Wolfram Weimer also said EU rules provided tools to tackle illegal content and alleged the problem risked turning into the "industrialisation of sexual harassment".

Italy's data protection authority warned that using AI tools to create "undressed" deepfake imagery of real people without consent could amount to serious privacy violations and, in some cases, criminal offences.

Swedish political leaders have also condemned Grok-generated sexualised content after reporting that imagery involving Sweden's deputy prime minister was produced from a user prompt.

India's IT ministry sent X a formal notice on January 2 over alleged Grok-enabled creation or sharing of obscene sexualised images, directing the content to be taken down and requiring a report on the actions being taken within 72 hours.

Japan also probed X over Grok, stating that the government would consider every possible option to prevent the generation of inappropriate images.

Indonesia's communications and digital ministry said it had blocked access to Grok, a move digital minister Meutya Hafid said was meant to protect women and children from AI-generated fake pornographic content, citing Indonesia's strict anti‑pornography laws.

Malaysia restored access to Grok for its users after X implemented additional safety measures, its communications regulator said on January 23.

The Philippines will reinstate access to Grok after its developer pledged to remove image-manipulation tools that had sparked child-safety concerns, the country's cybercrime investigation unit said on January 21.

California's governor and attorney general said on January 14 they were demanding answers from xAI amid the spread of non-consensual sexual images on the platform.

Canada's privacy watchdog said it was widening an existing investigation into X after reports that Grok was generating non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes.

Brazil's government and federal prosecutors gave xAI 30 days to prevent the chatbot from spreading fake sexualised content, according to a joint statement on January 20.

Australia's online-safety regulator eSafety said on January 7 it was investigating Grok-generated "digitally undressed" sexualised deepfake images, assessing adult material under its image‑based abuse scheme and noting current child-related examples it had reviewed did not meet the legal threshold for child sexual abuse material under Australian law.

HOW HAS xAI RESPONDED?

xAI said on January 14 it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal". It did not identify the countries.

It had earlier limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features only to paying subscribers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:47:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YDM7ZFTLJJI5LHSR4QJR6TOHHY.jpg?auth=39c4516da4f7542d06b530b413e5dfb1bc77949b544c232b9c0c94ce5cd253de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ackman donates $10,000 to Minneapolis shooting victim Alex Pretti's family, WSJ reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ackman-donates-10000-minneapolis-shooting-victim-alex-prettis-family-wsj-reports-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Billionaire Bill Ackman donated $10,000 to a fundraiser for the family of Alex Pretti, who was fatally ​shot by immigration agents in Minneapolis over the ‌weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a spokesman for Ackman.

The GoFundMe page that intended to support Pretti's "loved ones" raised over $1 million as of Monday morning and listed Ackman's ‌donation.

Ackman's Pershing Square declined a Reuters request for ​comment.

Pretti is the second American to be fatally shot by federal immigration officers this month in Minneapolis, ‍where Trump, a Republican, has deployed thousands of armed and masked agents in a deportation effort with little precedent.

Trump told the Wall Street Journal ⁠in an interview published on Sunday that his ‍administration was "reviewing everything and will come out with a determination" about ‌the ‌shooting, as officials in his administration defended it even as video evidence contradicted their version of events.

Ackman previously donated $10,000 to a GoFundMe for Jonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs ⁠Enforcement officer who ⁠fatally shot ​Renee Good, the first Minneapolis shooting victim this month.

The billionaire, however, wrote at the time that he also aimed to support ‍Good's family, "but it was already closed as it had achieved its $1.5 million fundraising objective."

"I was simply continuing my longstanding commitment to ​assisting those accused of crimes of ‍providing for their defense," Ackman wrote earlier in January.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:47:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GWTJYJMEZZJHHH67TWD6CYWMZE.jpg?auth=3ce38657ea711950932422770021af1808c5c1f037a019245eb2fa20d58c8ba6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French lawmakers to vote on social media ban for under-15s</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260126-french-lawmakers-to-vote-on-social-media-ban-under-15s</link><description>French lawmakers on Monday were set to vote on draft legislation to ban social media for under-15s , an effort championed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to protect children from excessive screen time.

The legislation, which also provides for a ban on mobile phones in high schools, follows Australia banning social media for under-16s in December, a world first.

As social media has grown around the world, so has concern that too much screen time is arresting child development and contributing to declining mental health in minors.

"The emotions of our children and teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated, either by American platforms or Chinese algorithms," Macron said in a video broadcast on Saturday.

The French bill proposed by centrist lawmakers will be examined from 4:00pm (1500 GMT) and, barring any surprises, is expected to be given the green light by the lower house, the National Assembly. The legislation would then go to the Senate upper house.

Authorities want to move quickly, with measures to be enforced from the start of the 2026 school year for new accounts.

Former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal , who leads lawmakers from Macron's Renaissance party in the lower house, said on Monday he hoped the bill would be passed by the Senate in mid-February.

"This means that in a month's time, it could be adopted and that on September 1, the ban will come into force for new accounts," he added.

He added that "social media platforms will then have until December 31 to deactivate existing accounts" that do not comply with the age limit.

In addition to combating the impact of screens and social media on the mental health of young adolescents, Attal stressed that the measure would help oppose "a number of powers that, through social media platforms, want to colonise minds".

"France can be a pioneer in Europe in a month: we can change the lives of our young people and our families, and perhaps also change the destiny of our country in terms of independence," he said.

France's public health watchdog ANSES said this month that social media such as TikTok , Snapchat and Instagram had numerous detrimental effects on adolescents – particularly girls – while not being the sole reason for their declining mental health.

The risks listed are numerous, including cyberbullying and exposure to violent content.

The legislation stipulates that "access to an online social networking service provided by an online platform is prohibited for minors under the age of 15".

The draft bill excludes online encyclopaedias and educational directories from the ban.

For the ban to become a reality, an effective age verification system will have to be put in place. Work on such a system is currently underway at the European level.

Macron has also backed a ban on pupils having mobile phones in high schools.

In 2018, France already banned children from using mobile phones in "colleges", the middle schools children attend between the ages of 11 and 15.

But former prime minister Elisabeth Borne expressed reservations about the measure on Monday.

"It's more complicated than that," she told broadcaster France 2.

"We first need to make sure that the ban is properly enforced in middle schools."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:48:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ea26c60-f2c5-11f0-8087-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/79748f2b2f9084e83220ff4614f89ed9963fcd4d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain expels Nicaraguan ambassador in diplomatic tit-for-tat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-expels-nicaraguan-ambassador-diplomatic-tit-for-tat-2026-01-26/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Spain has ordered the expulsion of Nicaragua's ambassador and another Nicaraguan diplomat, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday, a day after Nicaragua expelled Spain's ambassador and his deputy from Managua.

Relations between the two countries have been strained for years over Madrid's recurring criticism of President Daniel Ortega's crackdown on opposition figures, civil society and independent media, as well as its backing for European Union sanctions tied to human rights and democratic backsliding.

The ministry said the move was strictly reciprocal and described Managua's decision to expel the Spanish diplomats as unjust.

"Spain will continue working to maintain the best possible relations with the brotherly people of Nicaragua," it added.

The spat follows earlier diplomatic frictions, including Spain recalling its ambassador to Nicaragua , opens new tab for consultations in 2021. Relations were later reset with new ambassadorial appointments in 2023.

The Spanish envoy in Managua, Sergio Farre, had been appointed to the posting only in December, according to the official state gazette. The Nicaraguan government has yet to provide an official explanation for the expulsions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:29:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel retrieves remains of last Gaza hostage, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-retrieves-remains-last-gaza-hostage-military-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Israel has retrieved the remains of the last remaining hostage held in Gaza, the military said on Monday, fulfilling a key condition of the initial phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.

The remains of police officer Ran Gvili's have been identified and will be returned for burial, the military said in a statement.

Israel has said that it will reopen Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the enclave's main gateway to the world, once Gvili's remains are returned or the search operation for his body concludes.

Gvili had been held in Gaza since he was killed at Kibbutz Alumim during Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire in October under pressure from regional powers and Trump, who called the deal a first step toward a "strong, durable and everlasting peace".</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:29:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/72HQQ4I4QROKXMCQHO72T4C5UE.jpg?auth=b48e78043716da4a5ca595039394d401b7c7e157a1ecf48f4fa70441d2c5e71c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia withdrawing troops from airport in northeast Syria, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-withdrawing-troops-airport-northeast-syria-sources-say-2026-01-26/</link><description>QAMISHLI, Syria, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Russia is withdrawing forces from an airport in northeastern Syria, moving to end its military presence in a corner of the country where the Damascus government is trying to seize control from Kurdish forces, five Syrian sources said.

Russia has stationed forces at Qamishli airport in the northeast since 2019, a relatively small deployment compared to its air base and a naval facility on Syria's Mediterranean coast, both of which it is expected to maintain.

Government forces under President Ahmed al-Sharaa have taken swathes of northern and eastern Syria from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces this month, as Damascus aims to assert its authority over the entire country.

A fragile ceasefire between the sides was extended on Saturday for 15 days.

Two of the sources said Russian forces had begun a gradual withdrawal from Qamishli airport last week. Some of the forces were expected to move to in western Syria while others would return to Russia, one Russia's Hmeimim air base of the sources said.

Another Syrian security source on Syria's western coast said Russian military vehicles and heavy weaponry had been transported from Qamishli to the Hmeimim military airport over the last two days.

There was no immediate comment from Russia's defence ministry. Russian daily Kommersant reported last week, citing an unnamed Syrian source, that the Syrian government might ask Russian forces to leave the base once it had pushed the Kurds out because "there’s nothing for them (the Russians) to do there".

A Reuters journalist saw Russian flags still flying at Qamishli airport on Monday, where two planes bearing Russian markings were parked on the runway.

Russia, a close ally of Syria's ousted President Bashar al-Assad, has established ties with Sharaa since he seized power some 14 months ago.

Sharaa told Russian President Vladimir Putin last year he would honour all past deals struck between Damascus and Moscow, a pledge suggesting Moscow's two main military bases in Syria are safe.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:30:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/735I65KFZZOP5KAA7FGOOITYWE.jpg?auth=b957769356da39998d012fd05ab12400d765123ed4d3d048c84034cd28241048&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Islamic State‑linked militants kill 22 in eastern Congo, UN report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/islamic-statelinked-militants-kill-22-eastern-congo-un-report-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>KINSHASA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Islamic State‑linked militants killed at least 22 civilians in a village in eastern Congo's Ituri Province early on Sunday, according to an internal U.N. report and local civil society leaders, the latest in a series of deadly attacks in the region.

The U.N. report seen by Reuters said the assailants struck Apakolu, about 25 km (15 miles) northwest of Eringeti in Ituri province’s Irumu territory, at around 0400 GMT on Sunday, and abducted an unknown number of people.

Christophe Munyanderu, head of the local rights group known by its French acronym CRDH, based in Irumu, said 25 civilians had been killed, including 15 men whose bodies were found inside a house and seven others along a road.

The attackers were identified as members of the Allied Democratic Forces , a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo that is recognised by Islamic State as an affiliate.

The U.N. report said Sunday's attack in Apakolu came two days after ADF fighters attacked the nearby village of Kazaraho, where they clashed with the army and local militia groups.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in Kazaraho and said it also abducted and killed three Christians.

In a separate incident, local officials said ADF fighters attacked the village of Musengo in Lubero territory, North Kivu province, on Saturday night, burning houses, shops and a Catholic church.

Colonel Alain Kiwewa, administrator of Lubero territory, told Reuters that two Congolese soldiers were killed during the army’s response. He said 14 houses were destroyed, along with the local health centre and part of the church.

Congo's army and Ugandan forces have pursued operations against the ADF, but the group's raids persist across the region.

The ADF were responsible for 138 killings in eastern Congo in November, according to a tally published last week by the U.N. human rights office, making them one of the region's most lethal armed groups.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:30:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Marshall Islands' nuclear past and precarious future explored in London exhibition</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/marshall-islands-nuclear-past-precarious-future-explored-london-exhibition-2026-01-26/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A group of artists is shining a light on the impact of climate change, rising sea levels and nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands after travelling to the remote Pacific nation as part of an expedition.

The "Kõmij Mour Ijin/Our Life is Here" exhibition at London's National Maritime Museum features paintings, sculptures, photos and video installations exploring the nation's dark history and the threat facing its inhabitants.

Led by Cape Farewell, a cultural art and climate project founded by artist David Buckland, a team of artists, writers, scientists and filmmakers set sail to the Marshall Islands in 2023.

They visited various atolls, including Bikini, where the U.S. carried out nuclear bomb tests from 1946 to 1958, such as "Castle Bravo" in 1954 - the largest U.S. bomb ever detonated.

"‘Our Life is Here’... refers to them. It's how they could construct their life in among the terrible history and the potential future," Buckland told Reuters.

"The atolls are six feet above sea water, that doesn't take much of the Pacific Ocean to rise, to actually make them uninhabitable. So that threat is hanging over them."

On show at the exhibition, which opened in late November and runs until June, are works exploring the threat of rising flood waters as well as photographs of Marshall Islanders both by international and local artists.

Home to around 40,000 people, the Marshall Islands is one of the countries most vulnerable to rising sea levels, which are projected to put 96% of the capital Majuro , opens new tab at risk of frequent flooding, according to a 2021 World Bank study.

Last year was among the planet's three warmest on record , the World Meteorological Organization said earlier this month, as EU scientists also confirmed average temperatures have now exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming for the longest since records began.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:31:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's shifting political scene: defections to Nigel Farage's Reform</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-shifting-political-scene-defections-nigel-farages-reform-2026-01-15/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK Party is benefiting from a raft of high-profile defections from the centre-right Conservative party, with former interior minister Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick both switching sides this month.

Led by the veteran Brexit campaigner, the anti-immigration Reform UK party is currently leading opinion polls in Britain, positioning itself as a genuine threat to both Prime Minister Keir Starmer's governing centre-left Labour Party and the Conservatives, who lost a 2024 election after 14 years in power.

Should Reform UK's popularity translate into victory in the next election, likely in 2029, it would upend a political system dominated by Labour and the Conservatives for a century.

Here is a list of some former Conservatives who have joined Reform UK in the last year.

Braverman, a current member of parliament who was interior minister (Home Secretary) in 2022-23, announced on Monday that she was joining Reform , accusing her former party of lying to voters on immigration.

A former lawyer, Braverman, 45, has long argued Britain should leave the European Convention on Human Rights, one of Reform UK's key policies.

A current member of parliament, Jenrick came second to Kemi Badenoch in the 2024 race to lead the Conservatives. He joined Reform on January 15, hours after she fired him , saying he was plotting to defect.

Before he switched sides, Jenrick, 44, had been the Conservatives' justice spokesperson, using that position to build a personal profile on key issues such as immigration and crime that many saw as a platform for a future challenge to Badenoch's leadership.

The former lawyer held several ministerial positions in governments in the late 2010s and early 2020s, including the role of housing minister from 2019-2021.

Nadhim Zahawi is a former UK finance minister who joined Reform in January 2026, when he was no longer a sitting member of parliament.

His two-month stint as chancellor came during a chaotic period for the Conservatives, and he is best known publicly for driving British efforts to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine.

Zahawi, 58, co-founded the polling company YouGov. He was born in Iraq and came to Britain as a refugee when he was a child.

Danny Kruger, a current member of parliament, had been a leading Conservative figure until September 2025 when he defected to Reform UK, becoming the first sitting member to do so.

The 51-year-old is a former aide to prime ministers Boris Johnson and David Cameron and had served as welfare spokesperson for the Conservatives until he quit the party.

"This is my tragic conclusion: the Conservative Party is over, over as a national party, over as the principal opposition," he said at the time of his defection.

Nadine Dorries, 68, was culture minister for a year in 2021-2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister. A best-selling author, she stepped down as a member of parliament in 2023.

She defected to Reform UK in September 2025, when she wrote that her decision had been based on the feeling that "a sense of dread" was spreading across British communities.

"I believe that the only politician who has the answers, the knowledge and the will to deliver is Nigel Farage," she said at the time.

Jake Berry lost his parliamentary seat to Labour in 2024. He had served as chair of the Conservative Party for a short period in 2022 and had previously been a junior minister in the governments of Theresa May and Boris Johnson.

The 47-year-old defected to Reform in July 2025.

"I've always believed that change comes with challenging the old order, in shaking up the system when it isn't working," he said at the time.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:31:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CWOKJ5XMGVN4TMC63IVZX2JVBQ.jpg?auth=385319cffb9790c45854cf2e8cf09871cd2a0eb962ab780a8ddf5f78143c3a8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel retrieves remains of last Gaza hostage, Netanyahu says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260126-israel-retrieves-remains-of-last-gaza-hostage-netanyahu-says</link><description>The remains of the final hostage in Gaza have been recovered, Israel 's military said Monday, clearing the way for the next phase of the ceasefire that paused the Israel-Hamas war.

The announcement that the remains of Ran Gvili had been found and identified came a day after Israel’s government said the military was conducting a “large-scale operation” in a cemetery in northern Gaza to locate them.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “an incredible achievement” for Israel and its soldiers, telling Israeli media that “I promised we would bring everyone home and we have brought everyone home." He said Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, that sparked the war, was among the first to be taken into Gaza.

The return of all remaining hostages , living or dead, has been a key part of the Gaza ceasefire’s first phase, and Gvili’s family had urged Israel’s government not to enter the second phase until his remains were recovered and returned.

Netanyahu’s office said Sunday that Israel would open the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which Palestinians see as their lifeline to the world, once the search for Gvili was finished. It has been largely shut since May 2024, except for a small period in early 2025.

Israel and Hamas had been under pressure from ceasefire mediators including Washington to move into the second phase of the US-brokered truce, which took effect on October 10.

Israel had repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili’s remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.

Israel’s military had said the large-scale operation to locate Gvili’s remains was “in the area of the Yellow Line” that divides the territory.

The October 7, 2023 attack killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer known affectionately as “Rani,” was killed while fighting Hamas militants.

Before Gvili’s remains were recovered, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others had been returned to Israel since the ceasefire, most recently in early December. Israel in exchange has released the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians to Gaza.

The next phase of the 20-point ceasefire plan has called for creating an international stabilisation force, forming a technocratic Palestinian government and disarming Hamas.

Israeli forces on Monday fatally shot a man in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood, according to Shifa Hospital, which received the body. The man was close to an area where the military has launched the search operation for Gvili, the hospital said.

Another man was killed in the eastern side of Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, which received his body. The circumstances of his death were not immediately clear.

More than 480 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire since October 10, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by UN agencies and independent experts.

The Foreign Press Association on Monday asked Israel’s Supreme Court to allow journalists to enter Gaza freely and independently.

The FPA, which represents dozens of global news organizations, has been fighting for more than two years for independent media access to Gaza. Israel has barred reporters from entering Gaza independently since the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, which triggered the war, saying entry could put both journalists and soldiers at risk.

The army has offered journalists brief, occasional visits under strict military supervision.

FPA lawyers told the three judge panel that the restrictions are not justified and that with aid workers moving in and out of Gaza, journalists should be allowed in as well. They also said the tightly controlled embeds with the military are no substitute for independent access. The judges are expected to rule in the coming days.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:32:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b3510726-f18a-11f0-9895-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25355673486164.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Third batch of Iranians deported by US to return home, Tasnim reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/third-batch-iranians-deported-by-us-return-home-tasnim-reports-2026-01-26/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A third group of Iranians deported from the United States is returning home, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Monday, amid heightened tension between Washington and Tehran following Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests .

"These people, who have been under pressure to leave (the U.S.) for two months, made their return journey via Cairo and Kuwait," Tasnim said. "Fourteen people arrived at Imam Khomeini International Airport on a flight today, and the rest will return in the coming weeks." Tasnim did not clarify the group's total number.

Facilitation of the transfers has required an unusual degree of coordination between two adversaries. Last week, President Donald Trump renewed warnings to Tehran over the killing of protesters and any move to restart its nuclear program.

In September, officials said the U.S. had identified about 400 Iranians to be deported , with a first flight carrying 120 people returning to Tehran via Qatar’s capital.

A second group of 55 returned to Iran in December, with Iran's foreign ministry accusing Washington of conducting deportations on "political grounds and anti-migrant policies."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:57:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Western Balkan truck drivers block border cargo terminals over EU entry rules</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/western-balkan-truck-drivers-block-border-cargo-terminals-over-eu-entry-rules-2026-01-26/</link><description>Gevgelija, North Macedonia, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Truck drivers across four Western Balkan countries began a blockade of border cargo terminals on Monday in protest over restrictive EU entry rules that have left drivers facing deportation for exceeding Schengen visit limits.

The blockade was halting transport through a critical corridor that links the EU with Turkey and the Middle East.

More than 100 truck drivers were deported last year for exceeding the 90 days they were allowed to stay in the EU, with another 100 deportations announced last week, said Bosnia's Logistika, which represents 47,000 workers.

In Gevgelija, the biggest border crossing between Greece and North Macedonia, around 100 trucks with North Macedonia's flags blocked the cargo terminal. Drivers from Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia blocked borders in their respective countries.

The truckers demand an extension to how long they are allowed to stay in the Schengen free travel area, as with the large amounts of freight they transport, they reach the visit limit quickly.

"It's putting our economy at risk and the whole Balkans economy at risk. The drivers may lose their jobs, the transport companies will shut down," Filip Stojanov, a 26-year old truck driver from North Macedonia, said in English.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:58:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5OSKT6H3QRIVPAVTYW44MNRY3M.jpg?auth=eaddd4c02948fe8dc5865c17886046cd4e2b9160d3394432aec80b6210735083&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France pays tribute to fallen soldiers in Afghanistan after Trump’s false NATO troops claim</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260126-france-pays-tribute-to-fallen-soldiers-in-afghanistan-after-trump-s-false-nato-troops-claim</link><description>A senior French government official said Monday the memory of the French soldiers who died in Afghanistan should not be tarnished following President Donald Trump 's false assertion that non-US troops from NATO countries avoided the front line during that war.

Alice Rufo, the minister delegate at the Defence Ministry, laid a wreath at a monument in downtown Paris dedicated to those who died for France in overseas operations. Speaking to reporters, Rufo said the ceremony had not been planned until the weekend, adding that it was crucial to show that “we do not accept that their memory be insulted."

In October 2001, nearly a month after the September 11 attacks, the US led an international coalition in Afghanistan to destroy al Qaeda, which had used the country as its base, and the group’s Taliban hosts.

Alongside the US were troops from dozens of countries, including from NATO, whose mutual-defence mandate had been triggered for the first time after the attacks on New York and Washington. In an interview with Fox Business Network in Davos, Switzerland, Trump on Thursday claimed that non-US NATO troops stayed “a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistan.

Ninety French soldiers died in the conflict.

“At such a moment, it is symbolically important to be there for their families, for their memory, and to remind everyone of the sacrifice they made on the front line,” Rufo said.

“I have seen the statements, in particular from veterans’ associations, their outrage, their anger, and their sadness,” Rufo said, adding that trans-Atlantic solidarity should prevail over polemics.

“You know, there is a brotherhood of arms between Americans, Britons, and French soldiers when we go into combat.”

After his comments caused an outcry, Trump appeared to backpedal and heaped praise on the British soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. He had no words for other troops, though.

On Saturday, a day after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned his remarks as "appalling", he appeared to have changed position – at least as far as British troops were concerned.

"The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America!" Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

"In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. It's a bond too strong to ever be broken," Trump said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:36:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4f051baa-fac6-11f0-beb5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026522521484.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven dead, one seriously injured in Sunday plane crash in Maine, according to FAA</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/7-dead-1-seriously-injured-plane-crash-maine-airport-cnn-reports-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Seven people were killed and one person was seriously injured on Sunday when a private jet crashed as it was taking off from an airport in Bangor, Maine, according to preliminary information released by the the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday.

The deal paves the way for free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European nations and India, which together make up a quarter of the world's gross domestic product and a market of 2 billion consumers.

"It will be a balanced, forward-looking deal for better economic integration with the EU. The deal will propel trade and investment between both sides," said India Trade Secretary Rajesh Agrawal.

Trade between the two sides stood at $136.5 billion in the fiscal year through March 2025.

The formal signing would take place after legal vetting expected to last five to six months, an Indian government official aware of the matter said.

"We expect the deal to be implemented within a year,” the official added.

The agreement comes days after the EU signed a pivotal pact with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.

During the same period, New Delhi finalised agreements with Britain , New Zealand and Oman.

The spate of deals underscores global efforts to hedge against the United States as President Donald Trump's bid to take over Greenland and tariff threats on European countries test longstanding alliances among Western nations.

After nearly two decades of on-off negotiations, the deal will see India open up its vast and guarded market, the world's largest, to free trade with the EU, its biggest trading partner.

India and the EU pushed to close the deal after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to fast-track negotiations last year.

Two-way talks, relaunched in 2022 after a nine-year lull, gathered momentum after Trump imposed import tariffs on several trading partners, including a 50% tariff on goods from India.

An India-U.S. trade deal collapsed last year after a breakdown in communication between their two governments.

Both the EU and India had been locked in last-minute give and take over cars and steel trade, among the final points of contention.

The EU had sought sharp cuts by India in import duties on its cars that can exceed 100%, while India - a major steel producer - has been pushing the EU to reduce trade curbs to its steel exports.

Reuters reported on Sunday that India was planning to slash tariffs on cars imported from the EU to 40% from as high as 110% as part of the deal.

Negotiations excluded some sensitive farm and dairy items, as New Delhi maintains the need to protect millions of subsistence farmers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:38:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QUXLR4H4WFNURDWTRXQAAPWHCQ.jpg?auth=26149076b593bce21102346efa9c4c76a02e81c9b6f0f8284729b8abf4ae4258&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>As Russia bombs, Ukraine's artists squeeze frozen paint from the tube</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/russia-bombs-ukraines-artists-squeeze-frozen-paint-tube-2026-01-26/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 26 (Reuters) - In his cramped Kyiv studio where icicles hang from the tap in the bathroom sink, surrealist painter Yuriy Denysenkov reckons he can work a bit more today if he can just keep the room warm enough so paint will still squeeze from the tube.

Russia's relentless bombardment of Ukraine's heating and power system has left millions of Ukrainians facing the coldest and darkest winter yet after four years of war.

"The paint freezes and it's hard to squeeze it out," he says, managing to squirt a streak of dark blue onto a palette.

"If I do it quickly like this, I can even get a bit warmer," he says as he makes quick brush strokes on a moody picture of a child sticking a toe into a puddle in the countryside with a dog.

In another studio, steam billows from Oleksandr Liapin's lips as the 70-year-old dabs at a painting of an astonished-looking white bunny in a room with a candle on the ceiling - painted in bright yellow, pink and orange in a naive style.

It's minus 10 Celsius (14 F) outside, but it's nudged a bit above freezing inside, thanks to a gas camping stove that boiled up a kettle.

At least three members of the art collective are currently serving in the military - one of whom is missing in action. Liapin's weapon is his paintbrush.

"The world sees that we're living on and fighting. That's why they're helping us," Liapin said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:38:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PIPLM3OCLFPJPFO4KIB4RDR3MY.jpg?auth=89419da3d230cf968d9faaeaba4d81e2771531c7f004b5ccf30ef5c06a59d8e2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanon's Hezbollah chief says group concerned with confronting US threat against Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanons-hezbollah-chief-says-group-concerned-with-confronting-us-threat-against-2026-01-26/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The leader of Lebanon's Iran-aligned Hezbollah movement, Naim Qassem, said on Monday that his group was concerned about confronting Washington's threat against Iran, particularly any threat against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Tensions between Iran and the United States have grown following a severe crackdown on protests across Iran in which thousands were killed in the past few weeks, which President Donald Trump said could lead to a U.S. response. Tehran said any attack on Khamenei would trigger a "holy war".

"We are concerned with what is happening and targeted by potential aggression. We are determined to defend ourselves. We will choose in due course how to act, whether to intervene or not... but we are not neutral," Qassem said in a televised address.

The Hezbollah leader said mediators had told the group the U.S. and Israel were considering hitting it in case there was an attack on Iran, saying that a war on Iran could ignite the entire region this time.

Hezbollah was severely weakened in 2024 during cross border fighting with Israel that Hezbollah said was in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

U.S. prosecutors allege Mohamed and his father Nazar conspired to commit fraud and launder money through their gold exporting firm, Mohamed’s Enterprise, to enrich themselves and defraud the government of Guyana.

The men, who were indicted in Florida but deny wrongdoing, were briefly detained in October . They are contesting the extradition proceedings in court.

“The process was very smooth. No hiccups. No delay. In less than five minutes, I was elected leader of the opposition, ready to serve the people of this country,” Mohamed told journalists after the vote.

His political party, We Invest in Nationhood, is less than a year old but became the top opposition force in parliament in September's election, winning 16 of 65 seats.

The Guyanese government, which Mohamed has accused of persecuting him because of his entry into politics, has said making him opposition leader could taint the legislature.

The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers have crossed into the Middle East region, which comes under the U.S. military's Central Command, the officials told Reuters.

Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an "armada" heading toward Iran, but hoped he would not have to use it.

The warships began deploying from the Asia-Pacific region earlier this month, as tensions between Iran and the United States escalated following a crackdown on protests across Iran.

Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated. The president said he had been told that killings were subsiding and that he believes there is currently no plan for the executions of prisoners .

The U.S. military has in the past surged forces into the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive.

However, the U.S. military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran's nuclear program.

In addition to the carrier and warships, the Pentagon is also moving fighter jets and air-defense systems to the Middle East.

Over the weekend, the U.S. military announced that it would carry out an exercise in the region "to demonstrate the ability to deploy, disperse, and sustain combat airpower."

A senior Iranian official said last week that Tehran would consider any attack as an "all-out-war against us."

The United Arab Emirates said on Monday that it will not let its airspace, territory or territorial waters be used for any hostile military actions against Iran.

United Nations Special Rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, also told Reuters in an interview via video link that families were facing demands for ransoms of $5,000 to $7,000 to retrieve the bodies of loved ones, a crushing burden amid Iran's mounting economic woes.

Anti-government protests that swept across Iran since December have triggered the bloodiest crackdown by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, drawing international condemnation. Iran has blocked internet access since January 8.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA has put the unrest-related death toll at 5,937, including 214 security personnel, while official figures put the death toll at 3,117. Reuters has been unable to independently verify the numbers.

Sato, who is also a professor at Birkbeck University in London, said she too could not independently verify the death toll but believed casualties far exceeded official figures.

"There's been many reports of hospital staff (from multiple provinces across Iran) reporting that the security forces have raided their hospital," she said, as well as families showing up the next day and their loved ones no longer being there.

The Iranian mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the reports.

Medical staff in Iran who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity confirmed some of the reports to which Sato referred.

"Dozens of patients were in our hospital with gunshot wounds. They had undergone surgery, and then the Revolutionary Guards came and took them all away. We don’t know what happened to them," said one doctor in the northern city of Rasht.

One nurse and two doctors at hospitals in Tehran also told Reuters that members of the Revolutionary Guards and police had visited their facilities seeking records of protesters who had been hospitalised and then discharged, in order to arrest them.

"They even checked every room in the hospital, looking for wounded protesters,” said the nurse.

Such actions create a chilling effect, deterring people from seeking medical care and risking death or a worsening of their health condition due to fears of detention, Sato said.

Such behaviour is also a serious violation of medical neutrality, she added. Under the Geneva Conventions, doctors, hospitals and patients must be protected to ensure impartial care.

Unarmed protesters across Iran's 31 provinces have been shot in the chest and head - targeting vital organs - in a sign of lethal force used indiscriminately by security forces, Sato said, citing reports. International law permits such force only as a last resort, proportionately.

"In those incidents, that would indicate that they are unlawful deaths and arbitrary killings," she said, adding that recent reports had also documented a surge in eye injuries caused by pellets.

Of the reported demands from Iranian authorities for ransom money, Sato said: "This practice really compounds grief with extortion."

Sato said Iranian attempts to label the protesters as "terrorists" or "rioters" was deeply problematic and was intended to justify a brutal crackdown on what she described as a local, organic movement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:31:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2AGR2OGXT5JUNHKE5OMGOFSFTY.jpg?auth=d0d6100d70fbf9dd47ca53b20ebac15c079152a01b826eb4d551e8c5a4a2f694&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy declares state of emergency after storms in southern regions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/italy-declares-state-emergency-after-storms-southern-regions-2026-01-26/</link><description>ROME, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Italy's government on Monday declared a state of emergency for southern regions battered by a violent storm last week, pledging swift financial aid to rebuild roads and businesses hit by the severe weather.

Relentless rain, powerful winds and waves as high as nine metres (30 ft) battered Sicily, Sardinia and Calabria for two days, pushing water inland and overwhelming coastal defences.

Authorities have estimated that the damage ran to more than 1 billion euros ($1.19 billion) but despite the scale of the destruction, officials reported no casualties.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government set aside an initial 100 million euros to address the initial needs of the hardest-hit areas, Civil Protection Minister Nello Musumeci said in a statement.

"In the coming days, the government will adopt a new interministerial measure to allow the restoration and reconstruction of the damaged infrastructure," Musumeci said.

Sicily alone suffered around 740 million euros worth of damage, the regional government said last week, but the island's governor, Renato Schifani, warned on Monday that the final amount could be double that.

The sea flooded streets in popular hotspots near Taormina, wrecking infrastructure such as wastewater treatment facilities, and raising concerns over the forthcoming tourist season. In Catania, a section of sidewalk collapsed on the seafront.

Land subsidence, probably triggered by the bad weather, is now threatening the town of Niscemi, in central Sicily, and around 1,000 people have had to be evacuated from their homes, the civil protection said in a statement.

Sardinia was also badly hit. Beniamino Garau, the mayor of Capoterra in the south of the island, said the sea had pushed about 100 metres inland.

In Calabria, the regional administration said the storm caused "major damage to agricultural business...with serious repercussions for the rural economy" in one of Italy's least developed areas.

Extreme weather events have become more frequent in Italy in recent years. Floods have devastated cities across the country, killing dozens of people and amplifying risks of landslides and floods also in historically less exposed areas.

However, locals said regional civil protection alerts issued ahead of the storm had persuaded people to stay at home, preventing any deaths or serious injuries.

Rutte told advocates of a European force separate from the U.S.-led NATO alliance to "keep dreaming", and said Russian President Vladimir Putin would "love" the idea as it would stretch Europe's armies and make them weaker.

Speaking to the European Parliament in Brussels, Rutte said European nations should continue to step up to take more responsibility for their own security, as Trump has demanded - but within the transatlantic alliance.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares and European Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius have both raised the prospect of a European force in recent weeks.

Without referring explicitly to either proposal, Rutte gave the general idea short shrift, insisting Trump and the U.S. remained strongly committed to NATO, despite the uncertainty caused by Trump's demands that NATO member Denmark cede control of Greenland.

"I think there will be a lot of duplication and I wish you luck if you want to do it, because you have to find the men and women in uniform - they'll be on top of what is happening already," he said.

"It will make things more complicated. I think Putin will love it. So think again."

Rutte told the lawmakers that if Europe really wanted to go it alone, it would cost far more than the 5% of GDP that NATO nations have agreed to spend on defence and security-related investments.

"You have to build up your own nuclear capability - that costs billions and billions of euros. You will lose then, in that scenario ... the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the U.S. nuclear umbrella. So hey, good luck."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:32:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RBAR3QLQRNKA7GSC4Q4EPDRLZM.jpg?auth=a769f2dd529c6cb87e9f87be0e6e5ff9346646028565914b203d7efe574981e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria military to try officers over alleged plot to topple government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-military-try-officers-over-alleged-plot-topple-government-2026-01-26/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A probe by Nigeria's military found that some of the 16 officers arrested last year for misconduct may have been plotting to overthrow the government and they will now face trial, the Defence Headquarters said in a statement on Monday.

The statement said the investigation uncovered firm cases against several, including "allegations of plotting to overthrow the government," but gave no details of the plans or how many of the 16 were involved.

Defence spokesperson Major-General Samaila Uba said the officers were detained in October and those now accused of plotting a coup will face a military judicial panel.

If found guilty the officers would face the death penalty.

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, alleged troops broke into his residence overnight into Saturday in the Magere suburb of Kampala, assaulted staff and choked his wife , Barbara Kyagulanyi, forcing her to seek medical treatment.

Wine, who has been in hiding following the East African nation's disputed presidential election , said he was not at home at the time.

Kainerugaba, who is also President Yoweri Museveni's son, dismissed the accusations in a post on X, saying the army "do not beat up women."

"They are not worth our time. We are looking for her cowardly husband not her," Kainerugaba said, referring to Wine and his wife.

Wine, a pop-star-turned-politician, has accused Ugandan security forces of harassment since the January 15 presidential election, which President Museveni won with 71.6% of the vote.

Wine, who finished second, has rejected the result , alleging fraud.

It is unclear why the military is searching for him.

Rights groups and the opposition have long accused Museveni's government of using the military to suppress dissent, accusations the government denies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:33:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6ALIX4ONWJOPRG5LA5WHQ6KYIA.jpg?auth=29ea2acad582d41acb0454176c4618171159333ed15bec76124ec13f7912c2c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French ex-senator goes on trial over allegedly spiking MPs drink to sexually assault her</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260126-french-ex-senator-goes-on-trial-over-allegedly-spiking-mps-drink-to-sexually-assault-her</link><description>A ‍former French senator ​went on trial on Monday accused of spiking a lawmaker's drink with ecstasy with the ⁠intention of sexually assaulting her.

Joel Guerriau, 68, who resigned as a senator over the case in October 2025, allegedly administered lawmaker Sandrine Josso with "a substance liable to alter her ​discernment or control over her actions, in order to commit rape or ‍sexual aggression", a court document showed.

The centre-right politician also faces charges related to the possession and use of ecstasy, ​the document read. Guerriau has denied the charges against him.

The case has ​resonated in France following the 2024 conviction of Dominique Pelicot , who was found guilty of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, Gisèle, and inviting dozens of strangers to assault her while she was unconscious.

The Pelicot trial attracted headlines worldwide and raised awareness about drug-facilitated assaults.

Josso told investigators she felt unwell after drinking a few sips from a glass of champagne offered to her by Guerriau ‍at his apartment to celebrate an electoral win.

She told them the champagne did not taste normal and that ​if she had not managed to leave the flat she was certain Guerriau would have assaulted her, convinced he wanted to "satisfy an urge", according to the court document.

A toxicology ‌test later revealed traces of ecstasy in her blood, and ecstasy was also found in Guerriau's apartment, the document stated.

If found guilty, he ‍could face a jail sentence of up to five years and a fine of 75,000 euros ($88,950). His lawyer was not immediately available for comment.

The former senator's Horizons party, which is part of French President Emmanuel Macron's governing alliance, told French media following the accusations in November 2023 that Guerriau had been suspended with immediate effect.

The trial runs until Tuesday.

Parliament last year approved ‍changes to France's rape law to include consent, bringing the legislation more into line with more than a ‌dozen other European ​countries in a move that was given new impetus by the Pelicot mass rape trial .</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:34:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7c975106-fad9-11f0-8ad3-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026473862799.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to send border czar to Minneapolis, judge considers legality of immigration raids in Minnesota</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260126-trump-to-send-homan-architect-of-his-anti-immigration-policy-to-minneapolis-amid-shooting-scrutiny</link><description>US President Donald Trump announced Monday he is sending a top official to Minnesota as outrage grew over his administration's militarised immigration raids and the shooting dead of a second protester in Minneapolis .

Trump said that Tom Homan, his point man for border security, would arrive in the state later and "will report directly to me".

The high-profile assignment suggested that the 79-year-old Republican president is seeking to regain control over a rapidly deteriorating political and security situation.

In a separate post, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Homan “will be managing ICE operations on the ground in Minnesota to continue arresting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens".

Minneapolis has become ground zero in the clash between Trump and growing numbers of Americans over his nationwide immigration crackdown.

In Congress, Democrats are threatening to hold up funding for the US government unless immigration enforcement agencies are reformed.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) , an agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been transformed under Trump into the United States' most heavily funded law enforcement body. But polls show growing anger over its frequently brutal tactics.

A huge rally took place in bitter cold in Minneapolis on Friday to protest the raids and the point blank shooting by an ICE agent of protester Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three on January 7.

Then on Saturday, immigration agents gunned down Alex Jeffrey Pretti, also 37, after having already tackled him to the ground. Like Good, the intensive care unit nurse was a US citizen.

New rallies erupted after his death in Minneapolis, New York and other major cities.

Trump has so far dismissed concerns. His first reaction to Pretti's killing was to suggest that the nurse had come intending to shoot at the police.

Pretti was carrying a pistol with him at the time but never removed it and had apparently already been disarmed when he was shot. He was licensed to carry a weapon.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Sunday accused Trump of pushing a "flat-out insane" narrative.

Trump repeated the insinuation that Pretti was to blame when he told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday: "I don't like any shooting ... but I don't like it when somebody goes into a protest and he's got a very powerful, fully loaded gun."

A federal judge in Minneapolis was to consider Monday whether the deployment of federal officers – many of them masked, heavily armed and unidentified – violates the state of Minnesota's sovereignty.

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer.

In arguments before US District Judge Katherine Menendez, lawyers for the state and Twin Cities argued the situation is so dire on the street as to require the court to halt the federal government’s immigration enforcement actions.

The judge will hear arguments from state and city lawyers that the federal deployments amount to an occupying force.

Also under consideration is a bid to force federal officials to preserve evidence related to Pretti's killing.

Menendez asked attorneys where she should draw the line between legitimate law enforcement response and one that violates the Constitution.

The lawsuits highlight the deep rift between local and federal law enforcement over the deployment, dubbed "Operation Metro Surge".

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit “legally frivolous” and said Minnesota "wants a veto over federal law enforcement.” They asked the judge to reject the request or to at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Trump's immigration raids have focused deliberately on Democratic-run cities, pitting mayors and governors against the president.

Local police have repeatedly confronted federal agents and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called out the state's National Guard to push back against the federal forces.

Trump will also be watching signs of growing disenchantment from his Republican Party in Congress. The party is usually in lockstep with Trump but it has only a slender majority.

One of the most prominent cautions came from House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer, who signaled Sunday that federal agents should withdraw from Minneapolis – an intervention that would normally be unheard-of from a figure considered one of Trump's staunchest loyalists.

Trump told the Journal that the immigration agents would leave Minneapolis "at some point".</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:34:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ff1e551c-fad3-11f0-8617-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014601305166.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain busts cocaine ring that used offshore floating bases</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-busts-cocaine-ring-that-used-offshore-floating-bases-2026-01-26/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Spanish police have broken up a vast cocaine trafficking operation that used speed boats to bring the drug onshore from floating bases in the Atlantic, seizing 10 metric tons of the drug and arresting 105 suspects.
Police said on Monday that a year-long investigation in cooperation with law enforcement in countries including Cape Verde, Colombia, France, Portugal and the U.S. showed the group brought an estimated 57 tons of cocaine to Europe in the period.
Speed boats -- operating at night from rivers in southern Spain, the northwestern Galicia region and the Canary Islands, as well as from Portugal and Morocco -- navigated far into the Atlantic to offload drugs from transport and storage ships.
"They managed to create genuine aquatic platforms where pilots would remain at sea for over a month at a time, carrying out several successive operations", while other members used sophisticated equipment to monitor security agencies' communications and movements, a police statement said.
Officers seized 30 boats, 70 vehicles and numerous pieces of high-tech communications and surveillance equipment.
The investigation also showed that at one point the group paid as much as 12 million euros to the family of a deceased crew member in order to buy their silence.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:58:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US security team flags drone threat at Milano Cortina Games</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-security-team-flags-drone-threat-milano-cortina-games-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. officials helping to safeguard Americans at next month's Winter Olympics are stepping up planning for potential drone disruptions from illicit filming over venues to worst-case scenarios involving explosive payloads.

The threat of drone attacks has drawn growing attention since the war in Ukraine demonstrated their lethal capabilities, and the U.S. government has recently ramped up spending on anti-drone technology .

Drones have also disrupted airspace across Europe in recent months, while low-cost unmanned aircraft have become an everyday challenge for major sporting events.

"Our authorities are constantly on the lookout," Tim Ayers, Director of the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), said in an interview.

Ayers described drones as "a massive issue" that host nations and visiting security teams now treat as a standing threat category.

Italian police and their military counterparts are preparing restrictions and monitoring systems around outdoor mountain venues for the Milano Cortina Games, where drones are harder to control and easier to conceal, U.S. officials said.

Legitimate drone use - such as television broadcasts - can be approved under a credentialing system, but security planners expect fans to attempt flights regardless.

As part of preparations, U.S. officials recently convened a high-level drone symposium in Italy, bringing American specialists to brief their Italian counterparts and establish direct communication channels for rapid problem-solving during the Games.

"The Italians have primacy, it's their country," Ayers said. "We're there as a backstop to share information and expertise as needed."

Security officials pointed to the Paris Olympics as a recent case study. While authorities planned for the possibility of drones being used to deliver harmful devices, the more common incidents involved spectators trying to capture unauthorised footage or conduct activity that could resemble surveillance.

In those cases, officials said, host-nation forces focus on identifying and apprehending operators, enforcing no-drone zones and deploying counter-unmanned aircraft systems to force drones down, take control of them or block them electronically.

The American effort is coordinated by DSS through an interagency body that plans security support for major events outside the United States, officials said.

The group draws support from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and the intelligence community, among others.

U.S. officials said planning for an Olympics typically begins years in advance, with agents embedded on the ground.

Becky McKnight, a DSS special agent based in Milan for nearly two years, said her day-to-day work has focused on relationship-building with Italian law enforcement and venue security managers and repeatedly visiting Olympic clusters across northern Italy to understand terrain, travel choke points and command structures.

"Some of these venues, when we first went out there two years ago, most of them hadn't been built," she said.

Beyond drones, officials cited cyber incidents as a major concern, including scenarios in which payment systems or ticketing access could be disrupted.

Officials also anticipate protests - both issue-driven demonstrations and routine anti-Olympics activity - as well as opportunistic crime targeting tourists.

Organisers have said they are taking every precaution to deliver a safe Games for athletes and fans.

For U.S. citizens traveling to Italy, officials urged enrollment in the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) for safety messages about significant disruptions such as protests or transit issues.

They also advised avoiding flashy jewelry, staying aware of surroundings and expecting delays.

"Patience is going to be required," Ayers said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:36:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4S4I33VVKVI6LHTG672DHQKFJY.jpg?auth=fc294bcd3ad6dca049857c3d7a1ee7f03dec5f9484283050a24ed3833d5e8d39&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico president asks Korean counterpart for more BTS concerts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/mexico-president-asks-korean-counterpart-more-bts-concerts-2026-01-26/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Huge demand to see K-pop boy band BTS, among the world's most popular artists, has led Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to formally request of her counterpart, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, that he help arrange more concerts in Mexico.

"Everyone wants to go," Sheinbaum said at her daily morning press conference on Monday, adding that she had sent a diplomatic letter to South Korea's Lee seeking more concerts.

"Around 1 million young people want to buy tickets, but there are only 150,000 tickets available," she said.

The chart-topping band is set to embark on a global tour in April , shortly after they launch their first new album in three years. The band has been on hiatus since 2022 while its members undertook South Korea's mandatory military service.

The new tour launched a worldwide scramble for tickets , particularly in Mexico, one of K-pop's largest fan bases, where many people missed the initial rush and others complained to the consumer watchdog about problems with sales.

Mexico's consumer watchdog said it has launched a probe into Ticketmaster and is sanctioning resale platforms StubHub (STUB.N) , opens new tab and Viagogo for "abusive and disloyal practices" over the BTS ticketing process, without giving more details.

Tickets were selling on Ticketmaster from about 1,800 pesos to as much as 17,800 pesos for VIP tickets (around $100 to $1,030), but on resale platforms on Monday the tickets were selling from 11,300 to 92,100 pesos (more than $5,300).

The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The watchdog agency said it would help develop new guidelines to better regulate ticket sales to concerts and festivals, with prices and locations established ahead of the tickets' release.

Ticketmaster, which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment (LYV.N) , opens new tab , has faced other controversies in Mexico, including in 2022 when it reimbursed around $1 million to customers after more than a thousand fans reported being denied access to a Bad Bunny concert at Mexico's Estadio Azteca.

At the time, Ticketmaster criticized resellers and fraudulent ticket vendors and called for stronger control measures.

BTS's new album "Arirang" is slated for release in March and the world tour will begin in Goyang, South Korea, on April 9. Just three concerts have been scheduled in Mexico, all in Mexico City's GNP Seguros Stadium, from May 7 to May 10.

"The final toll may be significantly higher, a stark reminder that this route remains the deadliest migration corridor in the world," the IOM stated.

Three people - including twin girls about one year old - were confirmed dead in Lampedusa, Italy, after a search-and-rescue operation for a boat that left Sfax, Tunisia, the International Organization for Migration said in a statement. They died of hypothermia, according to their Guinean mother, a survivor. A man also died from the same cause, the IOM added.

Survivors from the same boat said another vessel departed simultaneously but never arrived and its fate remains unknown, the IOM said.

Over the past 10 days - amid a violent Mediterranean storm triggered by Cyclone Harry - several boats are believed to have gone missing, leaving hundreds unaccounted for, according to the IOM. Search efforts have been hampered by poor weather.

The agency is verifying a survivor's report from another boat, rescued by a commercial vessel near Malta, of a shipwreck where at least 50 people could be missing or dead. Separately, 51 people are feared dead after a wreck off Tobruk, Libya, the IOM said.

"Smuggling migrants on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats is a criminal act," the IOM said.

"Arranging departures while a severe storm was hitting the region makes this conduct even more reprehensible, as people were knowingly sent to sea under conditions amounting to a near-certain risk of death," it added.

In 2025, at least 1,340 people died in the Central Mediterranean, according to the agency's figures.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:38:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5WD4VPWQFRMAXEUUQQ3XNHPQKM.jpg?auth=73127635b7a329295ff84328acf96238197dd1774ae08cc4743a0ef3c026c3f3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary to summon Ukrainian envoy over what PM Orban says is election meddling</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungary-summon-ukrainian-envoy-over-what-pm-orban-says-is-election-meddling-2026-01-26/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday that Hungary would summon Ukraine's ambassador over what Orban said were attempts to interfere in a Hungarian parliamentary election due on April 12.

Orban has intensified his anti-Ukraine campaign in the past weeks, and has sought to associate Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar with Kyiv and the EU executive in Brussels as the campaign heats up.

As Hungary's economy stagnates, Orban's Fidesz party trails the opposition Tisza in most polls.

In a campaign primarily targeting rural voters, Orban has portrayed Ukraine as unworthy of financial support, framing the April vote as a choice between war and peace and echoing his past anti-migrant campaigns.

Orban, who has kept close ties with Moscow, has repeatedly refused to support European Union aid for Ukraine, and has launched a "national petition" asking voters to sign up to say they do not want to help pay for the war.

"Last week, Ukrainian leaders and even the president himself made grossly insulting and threatening statements against Hungary ... Our national security services have ... concluded this is a coordinated attempt to interfere in Hungarian elections," Orban said in a video.

The Ukrainian foreign ministry gave no immediate response to a request for comment.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last Thursday criticised Europe for being a "fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers" lacking the courage to act decisively. He also said Europe should not allow its capitals to become "little Moscow".

"Every 'Viktor' who lives off European money while trying to sell out European interests deserves a smack upside the head," Zelenskiy said in a speech in Davos.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:38:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7AZZDRVMTRJENDI3RNG5SKZW5Y.jpg?auth=8fff77da3ca252ce2f638968a10aec8affd199faa0adea8242fb9b0920000b35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula holds call with Trump, agrees to visit Washington</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-holds-call-with-trump-agrees-visit-washington-2026-01-26/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva held a phone call with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump on Monday and agreed to visit Washington soon, the Brazilian government said in a statement.

The two leaders discussed several issues during the 50-minute call, including the situation in Venezuela, Trump's proposed Board of Peace and the fight against organized crime.

Regarding Venezuela, the Brazilian president stressed the importance of "preserving peace and stability in the region," the statement said.

Lula has criticized the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who was deposed earlier this month and taken to New York to face drug-trafficking charges. The Brazilian president had condemned the move as the crossing of "an unacceptable line."

Lula emphasized to Trump on Monday the need to work for the welfare of the Venezuelan people.

Lula also suggested that Trump's new proposal for a Board of Peace be limited to the situation in Gaza, as global powers worry the initiative launched last Thursday could assume a wider role and rival the United Nations.

Brazil's president also called for Palestinian representation on the board, according to the statement.

Lula said last week that Trump was attempting to create a "new U.N." and be its sole owner, yet the U.S. president has said the Board of Peace would work alongside the U.N.

The Brazilian government's statement did not say whether Lula accepted Trump's invitation to join the initiative.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:38:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PLE3E2N57JM3HGDNX6SSAEWIRY.jpg?auth=a5f25e40a692b6e0d96c69d694c1fa2b31e84f6815f2fcb216f34fb92d8e4c3a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's National Assembly debates banning under-15s from social media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/frances-national-assembly-debates-banning-under-15s-social-media-2026-01-26/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - France's National Assembly debated legislation to ban children under 15 years old from social media on Monday, amid growing concerns about online bullying and mental health risks.

The bill proposes banning under-15s from social networks and "social networking functionalities" embedded within broader platforms, and reflects rising public angst over the impact of social media on minors.

It now passes to the Senate before a final vote in the lower house.

President Emmanuel Macron has pointed to social media as one factor to blame for violence among young people. He is urging France to follow Australia, whose world-first ban for under-16s on social media platforms including Facebook (META.O) , opens new tab , Snapchat (SNAP.N) , opens new tab , TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab came into force in December.

Macron wants the ban in place in time for the start of the next academic year in September.

"With this law, we are setting a clear boundary in society and saying social media is not harmless," centrist lawmaker Laure Miller told the chamber as she presented the bill.

"Our children are reading less, sleeping less, and comparing themselves to one another more," she continued. "This is a battle for free minds."

Australia's social media ban is being studied in countries including Britain, Denmark, Spain and Greece.

The European Parliament has called for the European Union to set minimum ages for children to access social media, although it is up to member states to impose age limits.

There is broad political and public support in France for curbing minors' access to social media, and the bill was expected to pass in a vote later on Monday evening.

Far-right lawmaker Thierry Perez said the bill responded to a "health emergency".

"Social media has allowed everyone to express themselves, but at what cost to our children?” Perez said.

The French ban would require platforms to block access to young teenagers through age‑verification mechanisms compliant with European Union law.

Enforcing such bans can be difficult. Australia's government acknowledged the rollout of its ban would be bumpy after children claiming to be under 16 flooded the country's social media feeds with messages gloating about their continued ability to access networks.

The French legislation also extends an existing ban on smartphones in junior and middle schools to cover high schools.

A Harris Interactive survey in 2024 showed 73% of the public supported a ban on social media access for under-15s.

Teenagers on the streets of Paris were split in their views. Some said they acknowledged the dangers associated with social media. Others felt a ban was excessive.

The two military policemen were stopped on Sunday by an armed Israeli while they were carrying out a site inspection ahead of a planned visit by EU ambassadors to a village near Ramallah.

According to a government source, the Israeli, believed to have been a settler, forced the two men to kneel at gunpoint and subjected them to an improvised interrogation.

The soldiers were travelling in a vehicle with diplomatic licence plates and carrying diplomatic passports.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani wanted the Israeli ambassador in Rome to receive a "strong protest" over the incident, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Italy's embassy to Israel has already submitted a formal protest to the Israeli government, contacting the foreign ministry, the Israeli military, the police and the Shin Bet domestic security agency.

The two policemen returned unharmed to Italy's Consulate General in Jerusalem following the incident.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:39:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European countries including UK lose measles elimination status</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/european-countries-including-uk-lose-measles-elimination-status-2026-01-26/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Britain and several other European countries have lost their measles elimination status, the World Health Organization said on Monday, after a jump in infections across the continent.

Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan also lost their status, and the WHO urged countries to boost vaccination rates, particularly among under-protected populations, to prevent the viral disease infecting more children.

Measles is entirely preventable by vaccination, but is very contagious, and so is among the first illnesses to rebound when vaccination rates decline. It commonly causes symptoms including high fever and a rash, but can also lead to serious long-term complications and even death.

Health experts have warned that rising outbreaks worldwide point to a resurgence of other preventable illnesses in populations increasingly mistrustful or skeptical of vaccines since the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The UK's change of status reflects a broader challenge we're facing across the WHO European Region," the U.N. health agency said on its website. Several other European countries already have regular measles transmission, according to the WHO, including France and Romania.

Canada lost its elimination status last year, and the U.S. is working to retain its status as infections mount.

WHO committees in each region decide whether a country is measles-free using case rates. To be considered measles-free by the WHO, a country must have no locally transmitted cases of the same strain for 12 months or longer.

The decision to strip certain European countries of their status was made last September based on data from 2024. But the WHO only released the information on Monday after getting sign-off from every country involved.

To keep measles at bay, vaccination rates must exceed 95%, the WHO estimates. Yet in the UK, only 84.4% of children had the two doses needed for full protection in 2024. Government data showed 2,911 confirmed cases in England that year, the most since 2012.

On Monday, the UK Health Security Agency said all children should be vaccinated to protect themselves from measles. The UK was first given elimination status in 2016, before losing it in 2018 then regaining it in 2021.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:25:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y6LIZDTBHZNHPBTDB5HVYYWCLQ.jpg?auth=3672eccce8102824ca09e54237a7a3f9a3efa5d150406406f112aae9a65fb988&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least two injured in Russian attack on dwellings, school in Ukraine's Kharkiv</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/least-two-injured-russian-attack-dwellings-school-ukraines-kharkiv-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Russian forces on Monday launched a drone and missile attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, hitting apartment buildings, a school and a kindergarten and injuring at least two people, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram.

The poll, conducted nationwide between Friday and Sunday, gathered responses before and after immigration officers on Saturday killed a second U.S. citizen in Minneapolis during confrontations with protesters over Trump's deployment of immigration agents to cities across the U.S.

Just 39% of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing on immigration, down from 41% earlier this month, while 53% disapprove, the poll found. Immigration was a brighter spot for Trump's popularity in the weeks following his January inauguration. In February, 50% approved and 41% disapproved.

Trump's overall approval rating sank to 38%, tying the lowest level of his current term as it dropped from 41% in the prior Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted January 12-13.

Some 58% of poll respondents said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have gone "too far" in their crackdown, while 12% said they had not gone far enough and 26% said the agents' efforts were "about right." About nine in 10 Democrats said the agents have gone too far, compared to two in 10 Republicans and six in 10 independents.

The poll, conducted online nationwide, gathered responses from 1,139 U.S. adults and had a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:26:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PX3XXPERHNIIHKEFDE5FP535NA.jpg?auth=730e1f96ea241489166457290dcfb817367e19ec63ce23da58d720c217fc9f2a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's state TV airs several ‘forced confessions’ after protest crackdown, activists say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260126-iranian-state-tv-airs-several-forced-confessions-after-protest-crackdown-activists-say</link><description>The man faces the camera with his face blurred as dramatic music pounds in the background.

"I made a mistake," he says, his voice trembling as an unseen interrogator presses him about the deaths of members of Iran 's security forces. "If I'd known, I would not have done it."

According to one rights group, at least 240 such "forced confessions" have been broadcast by Iranian state television in recent weeks – an "unprecedented" quantity – after authorities arrested thousands of people in the wake of protests that shook the country's clerical leadership.

Questioned by an interviewer, detainees are shown confessing to a variety of alleged offences ranging from committing violence against members of the security forces, to accepting money from monarchists or Iran's foes, or sharing images with banned groups or media outlets.

In some cases, people are accused of merely following accounts of opponents of the Islamic republic on social media.

Activists say the so-called confessions are extracted by psychological and physical torture , and are a familiar tactic used in the past by Iranian authorities against detainees who in some cases have subsequently been executed.

Amnesty International termed the scenes "propaganda videos", saying it had received reports "authorities are forcing detainees to sign statements they have not been allowed to read and to give forced 'confessions' to crimes they did not commit as well as to peaceful acts of dissent".

The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Mai Sato, told the UN Human Rights Council that such "false confessions" seek to "reinforce the state's narrative that protesters are dangerous criminals".

Iran's feared judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei appeared to take the lead earlier this month by personally interrogating detainees in sessions broadcast by state TV.

"Coerced televised confessions in totalitarian regimes such as Iran have multiple key functions, including that of manufacturing political legitimacy, creating a false, official narrative such as framing peaceful protesters as violent agents of foreign influence, and deterring dissent," Roya Boroumand, director of the US-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran, told AFP.

The demonstrations started in late December sparked by economic grievances but grew into a mass movement against the Islamic republic, with huge street protests from January 8, when authorities imposed an internet blackout.

Thousands were killed in an ensuing crackdown on the protests, which have for now abated, with the authorities blaming the unrest on Iran's enemies, including Israel and the United States.

More than 41,000 people have been arrested in the crackdown, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which has recorded 240 instances of "forced confessions".

One video widely circulating on social media Monday showed a teen, identified by users as 18-year-old Shervin Bagherian, being questioned over the killing of a member of the security forces and then told he would face charges that could see him executed.

In another widely shared case, a man was shown admitting to having sent footage of the protests to US President Donald Trump via social media accounts.

Such broadcasts have in the past been used ahead of executions.

In one notorious case, the formerly Paris-based dissident Ruhollah Zam, who according to supporters was abducted from Iraq by Iranian security forces, was subjected to an interrogation on Iranian TV before his execution in December 2020.

Foreigners have also been subjected to the same treatment.

French citizen Cécile Kohler was shown in October 2022 on Iranian television making what activists described as a "forced confession" before being sentenced on espionage charges her family vehemently rejects.

She and fellow French citizen Jacques Paris were released late last year but are still unable to leave Iran.

The US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) said that in the wake of the protests, the forced confessions were being broadcast by Iranian state television on an "unprecedented scale".

"These false confessions are routinely used as the sole evidence to convict, including in capital cases where the death penalty may be imposed," it added.

"By forcing dissidents to publicly 'confess' to actions such as 'colluding with foreign powers', the state legitimises its repression as necessary to protect national security and, bypassing the presumption of innocence, uses the televised confessions as proof of guilt to justify severe punishment such as executions," said Boroumand.

"These broadcasts also aim at humiliating and destroying dissidents' credibility while reminding the public of the high cost of challenging the state," she added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fcc39166-da6b-11eb-b621-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2c47c04f7580c96190ffadb683830c7c96b80e2a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria's Sharaa to meet Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, Syria TV says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrias-sharaa-meet-putin-moscow-wednesday-syria-tv-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa will meet Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday in Moscow, pro-government Syria TV reported on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:47:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6IWFVYAQPZMR5BRMEVJ7EGM4AM.jpg?auth=d5f92e85d8ce78153bb90982b832c55b43f9dddee8904c7bca3ba17c4d262750&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian ex-Olympic snowboarder pleads not guilty to US drug charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/canadian-ex-olympic-snowboarder-pleads-not-guilty-us-drug-charges-2026-01-26/</link><description>SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan 26 (Reuters) - Ryan Wedding, a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder, pleaded not guilty to charges of becoming a cocaine smuggling kingpin responsible for multiple drug-related murders in a U.S. federal court in Santa Ana, California, on Monday.

Wedding was flown to California after being arrested in Mexico City on Thursday .

Wedding, 44, is accused of leading a transnational drug trafficking network and working with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel to transport hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the U.S. and Canada. He was on the FBI's "Top 10 Most Wanted" list and the U.S. government had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction.

Wedding, who competed for Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, faces charges including conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to tamper with a witness. Prosecutors accused him of ordering several drug-related murders, including that of a U.S. federal witness in Colombia in January 2025 before he could testify against him, the department said.

Prosecutors also accuse him of directing the murders of two people and the attempted murder of a third in Ontario, Canada, in November 2023 over a stolen drug shipment, and of ordering the killing of another person in Canada in May 2024 over a drug debt.

If convicted of the most serious charges, he could face a sentence of life in prison.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:25:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/63AUSINPBBIHJILRJQBRSTV5YM.jpg?auth=15dfdc416ea9469f28cb62e20da0152a73e8d17252dcef1b68e3f78f773fdd72&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he is raising tariffs on certain South Korean imports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-says-he-is-raising-tariffs-certain-south-korean-imports-25-2026-01-26/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Monday he was increasing tariffs on South Korean imports into the U.S. related to autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals to 25% while accusing the ally's legislature of "not living up" to its trade deal with Washington.

"South Korea's Legislature is not living up to its Deal with the United States," Trump wrote on social media.

"Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."

South Korea's presidential Blue House did not have an immediate comment.

South Korea had been working to implement a deal announced with Washington in November that was going to lower U.S. tariffs against its exports. More recently, South Korea has engaged with Washington to explain Seoul's probe of U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N) , opens new tab , stemming from a mass data leak.

Trump has used the leverage of tariffs throughout his second term in office in his foreign policy.

"I think they know the terms," the official told reporters when asked about the terms of talks with Iran. "They're aware of the terms."

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an "armada" heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.

Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated. The president said he had been told that killings were subsiding and that he believes there is currently no plan for the executions of prisoners.

A U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday, expanding Trump's capabilities to defend U.S. forces, or potentially take military action against Iran.

The U.S. military has in the past surged forces into the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive.

However, the U.S. military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran's nuclear program.

Iran will treat any attack "as an all-out war against us," a senior Iranian official said on Friday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:48:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VKTA3H3XS5IR7BWZCFTFTKEU2U.jpg?auth=52f6f8692452354272193dad4a93df2ca930890f5e4cde4bdc0956eb60ada16e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US believes Hamas disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-believes-hamas-disarmament-comes-along-with-some-sort-amnesty-us-official-2026-01-26/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The United States believes disarmament by Hamas militants in Gaza comes along with some sort of amnesty for the Palestinian group, a U.S. official said on Monday.

The official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, spoke to mark the return of the remains of the last Israeli hostage held by Hamas. Israel and the United States are pressuring Hamas to disarm as part of a plan in which Gaza will be redeveloped.

The official said there is confidence among U.S. officials that Hamas will disarm.

"We are listening to many of their people talk about disarming. We think they're going to. If they don't disarm, then they've breached the deal. We think disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty and candidly we think we have a very, very good program to disarm," the official said.

The Israeli embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a question on whether Israel would agree to amnesty for Hamas members if they give up their weapons.

Under President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza plan, once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries, under the plan.

The Israeli military said on Monday that the remains of the last remaining hostage held in Gaza, police officer Ran Gvili who was held hostage for more than 840 days - have been identified and will be returned for burial.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:49:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VHPE5BDRAJIK3G37PKTWNW4JIA.jpg?auth=ec2dcdf067d76eb83deb93433c87344743ac732e6ca7050aef7d00cbc832938e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rift at influential Silicon Valley venture firm shows tech's divide over ICE shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/rift-influential-silicon-valley-venture-firm-shows-techs-divide-over-ice-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Heated political rhetoric over the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by immigration agents in Minneapolis on Saturday spilled into Silicon Valley as partners at an influential venture firm distanced themselves from a colleague who defended the killing.

The death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti was one of five shootings this month involving federal agents conducting immigration enforcement, including the fatal shooting of Minnesota woman Renee Good . At least six immigrants have died this month in federal immigration detention , an unusually rapid pace.

The Pretti shooting has drawn anger across the U.S. political spectrum as the administration of Republican President Donald Trump backed the agents even as video evidence contradicted its version of events.

The back-and-forth on social media highlights an ongoing political fracture at the heart of the U.S. tech industry where some executives have abandoned the sector's longstanding reputation for progressive social values to publicly back Trump's policies.

After Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois said , opens new tab on social media on Saturday that law enforcement had not shot an innocent person and that illegal immigrants commit crimes daily, the firm's founder, Vinod Khosla, and partner Ethan Choi , opens new tab both disavowed the comments. The firm is notable for having backed companies including OpenAI, DoorDash (DASH.O) , opens new tab and Instacart.

"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way," Khosla said in a post on X , opens new tab . "There is politics but humanity should transcend that," Khosla added.

Several other tech executives including Jeff Dean , opens new tab , chief scientist at Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab Google DeepMind AI lab, and Microsoft (MSFT.O) , opens new tab Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz , opens new tab praised Pretti, who was an intensive-care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

Billionaire Elon Musk has led the charge to the politically conservative right, with hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign donations to Trump's 2024 campaign and support for his anti-immigration moves. This has led to public clashes with the likes of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic donor.

Musk has not commented on the Pretti shooting, while Hoffman echoed Khosla's message that humanity should transcend politics.

Wary of government retaliation, tech executives have spent the past year largely silent on policies impacting their businesses including the chaos surrounding the H-1B visa program and U.S tariffs.

Executives have instead sought to improve ties with Trump, contributing millions to his inauguration a year ago and backing his manufacturing push with tens of billions in pledged spending, which some analysts have called empty posturing.

Urging tech CEOs to break their silence, more than 450 employees from firms such as Google, Meta Platforms (META.O) , opens new tab , Salesforce (CRM.N) , opens new tab and OpenAI signed a letter on Saturday , opens new tab urging their top executives to pressure the White House to withdraw ICE from U.S. cities, cancel all contracts with ICE and to speak out publicly against ICE's violence.

"The wanton brutality ... has removed any credibility that these actions are about immigration enforcement. Their goal is terror, cruelty, and suppression of dissent," they said in the letter.

The workers noted that Trump had said he refrained from deploying federal agents to San Francisco after Nvidia (NVDA.O) , opens new tab CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff advised against the action.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:50:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OV7DDB5ZVBMTLM2QRPFW4ILOYA.jpg?auth=7ecb75acbc18d6811e431bab6ef90d55bf856e865bb708fa0176eb33f2886ef1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hezbollah says Israeli strike killed Al-Manar TV presenter in southern Lebanon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hezbollah-says-israeli-strike-killed-al-manar-tv-presenter-southern-lebanon-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah said on Monday that an Israeli strike in the country's south killed TV presenter Ali Nour al-Din, who worked for the group's affiliated Al-Manar television station.

The group said the killing portends "the danger of Israel's extended escalations (in Lebanon) to include the media community".

The Israeli military said later on Monday that al-Din was a Hezbollah militant who recently worked to rehabilitate the group's artillery capabilities in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Lebanon agreed to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in 2024 to end more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which culminated in Israeli strikes that severely weakened the Iran-backed militant group. Since then, the sides have traded accusations over ceasefire violations.

Lebanon has faced growing pressure from the U.S. and Israel to disarm Hezbollah. The group's leaders fear that Israel could dramatically escalate strikes across the battered country, aiming to push the Lebanese government for quicker action to confiscate Hezbollah's arsenal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 23:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens to raise tariffs on South Korean goods to 25 percent</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260127-trump-threatens-to-raise-tariffs-on-south-korean-goods-to-25-percent</link><description>US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would raise tariffs on South Korean goods including autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals, taking aim at the country for “not living up to” an earlier trade pact struck with Washington.

The increase would bring tariff levels from 15 percent to 25 percent.

“South Korea’s legislature is not living up to its deal with the United States,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

He added that he was increasing tariff rates “because the Korean legislature hasn’t enacted our historic trade agreement, which is their prerogative”.

South Korea ’s presidential office said it had not been informed about the tariff hike plans in advance.

It said Trade Minister Kim Jung-kwan, currently in Canada , would head to Washington for talks on the issue with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

Trump’s apparent about-face comes months after Washington and Seoul struck a trade and security deal, capping a period of tense negotiations.

The agreement was finalised after Trump met his South Korean counterpart Lee Jae Myung in October and included investment promises by South Korea alongside tariff cuts by the United States.

Under the pact, Washington would maintain levies of up to 15 percent on South Korean goods including vehicles, car parts and pharmaceuticals.

Crucially, the deal’s terms brought US tariffs on South Korean cars down from a 25 percent level.

Trump’s latest threat, if enacted, would reverse that.

The auto industry accounts for 27 percent of South Korea’s exports to the United States , which takes in nearly half of the country’s car exports.

A reversal to a higher tariff level could also put South Korean exports at a disadvantage compared with economies such as Japan and the European Union , which have both struck deals for a 15 percent US tariff.

The Trump administration has yet to issue formal notices to enact the changes.

The US president’s threat targeting South Korea is his latest against key trading partners in recent days.

Over the weekend, Trump warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China , he would impose a 100 percent tariff on all goods coming across the border.

Earlier in January, Trump also threatened to slap tariffs on multiple European nations until his purchase of Greenland is achieved. He has since backed off the threat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 01:53:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e73d5c04-fac9-11f0-bcc6-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-26T093638Z-2099064647-RC29HHABFS6W-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-AFGHANISTAN-GERMANY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In possible thaw, Trump and Minnesota's governor talk after fatal shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-send-border-czar-homan-minnesota-2026-01-26/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz each struck a conciliatory tone on Monday after a private phone call in a sign the two sides were seeking to defuse a crisis over the Trump-ordered deportation drive that has claimed the lives of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.

In another apparent signal of a thaw in the standoff, a senior Trump administration official confirmed reports that Gregory Bovino, a top U.S. Border Patrol official who has been a lightning rod for criticism from Democrats and civil liberties activists, will be leaving Minnesota along with some of the Border Patrol agents deployed to the Midwestern state.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Trump's designated border czar, Tom Homan, would be tasked with overseeing the Minnesota operations. Trump said earlier in the day that Homan was being dispatched to Minnesota.

Later on Monday, a different person familiar with the matter said Bovino has been removed from his role as Border Patrol "commander at large" and will return to his former job as a chief patrol agent along California's El Centro sector of the U.S.-Mexico border. The source said he would then soon retire.

Another source confirmed Bovino would return to the El Centro sector but did not provide further details.

Word of Bovino's demotion was first reported by The Atlantic on Monday, citing an official from the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and two other people with knowledge of the change. The Atlantic also said Bovino was expected to retire soon.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin disputed those reports, posting on X: "Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties."

Following his phone call with Walz, Trump said he was "on a similar wavelength" with the Democratic governor, weeks after ordering thousands of heavily armed federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in a deportation drive over the staunch opposition of state and local authorities.

Walz's office said he and Trump held a "productive call" in which the president said he would consider reducing the number of immigration agents in the state. He said Trump also agreed to direct the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the state could conduct its own investigation into the Pretti shooting.

Trump and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also said they had spoken together by telephone. Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, the president said that "lots of progress" was being made following their discussion.

Frey said Trump had "agreed the present situation can't continue," adding that it was understood that some federal agents "will begin leaving" the Twin Cities on Tuesday.

The unexpected burst of telephone diplomacy came two days after a 37-year-old intensive-care-unit nurse, Alex Pretti, was shot and killed by federal agents on a Minneapolis street during a confrontation between the immigration officers and protesters.

The killing of Pretti, the second U.S. citizen fatally shot by immigration agents since the Trump administration deployed a force of 3,000 federal officers to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area several weeks ago, has prompted a sharp public backlash against the mass deportation operation. Opinion polls show waning support for Trump's immigration enforcement tactics.

A new Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday showed some 58% of poll respondents said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have gone "too far" in their crackdown, while 12% said they had not gone far enough and 26% said the agents' efforts were "about right."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:48:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ACGLVBHV45IEZBAHFBNNB3Y3NE.jpg?auth=c3e00e0b6651a858509ee04727505adb9bc8ef3f99ea28749975b52c1a4b7cf4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fearing China clash, Japan asks fishermen to avoid flashpoint islands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/fearing-china-clash-japan-asks-fishermen-avoid-flashpoint-islands-2026-01-27/</link><description>ISHIGAKI, Japan, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hitoshi Nakama, 76, sees himself as a frontline defender of Japan's claims to disputed islands in the East China Sea, where he regularly evades Chinese coast guard ships to harvest the bountiful waters.

But since late last year, some Japanese officials have been discreetly urging Nakama and his peers to steer clear of the remote outcrops - known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China - to avoid escalating a diplomatic clash with Beijing , according to Nakama and three other people with knowledge of the requests.

The requests, reported for the first time by Reuters, signal an abrupt shift after years in which Tokyo tacitly accepted such trips, used by some fishermen as a way to assert Japan's control of the uninhabited islets and surrounding seas.

The islands, administered by Japan but also claimed by China, have long been a flashpoint in relations between the two Asian powers. Ties have deteriorated since Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi angered China in November by commenting on how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

U.S. President Donald Trump later that month asked Takaichi, a staunch nationalist who became prime minister in October, not to further inflame the tensions . Reuters couldn't determine whether the pleas to the fishermen were ordered by Takaichi or linked to the appeal from the United States, Japan's security backer.

Takaichi's office and Japan's foreign ministry declined to address questions about the requests to fishermen. The foreign ministry said in a statement that the islands were an inherent part of Japan's territory and that it had repeatedly lodged diplomatic protests over Chinese incursions.

The warnings issued to fishermen illustrate a catch-22 for Tokyo: Fishing underlines Japan's control of the islands but risks triggering a more serious confrontation with Chinese coast guard vessels that could escalate rapidly, according to more than a dozen people interviewed by Reuters, including fishermen, Japanese officials and security analysts. Yet a pullback may lead China to more assertively press its claims, some of these people said.

China's foreign ministry told Reuters some right-wing Japanese had repeatedly entered the waters of the islands "in the name of 'fishing' to provoke and cause trouble", adding that maritime issues should be addressed through dialogue and consultation.

A Trump administration official declined to address questions about the president's November call with Takaichi but said the U.S. opposed unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea.

As tensions with China flared in November, the pleas to fishermen began.

Hiroaki Hayashi, a businessman who chairs a nationalist group that helps fund Nakama's fishing trips, told Reuters he received a request from a Japanese coast guard official to stop Nakama from going on a planned voyage at the end of that month. Nakama reluctantly opted to steer clear, Hayashi said.

Another fisherman, Kazushi Kinjo, 53, said he had been planning to fish around the islands during a week-long voyage that started on November 26. But just before he set sail, and while at sea, he received calls from multiple officials urging him to avoid the Senkaku islands.

"They've never said anything like that to me before," he said, declining to identify the officials. Kinjo said he briefly transited the waters around the islands on the way back to his home port but didn't stop to fish.

A few weeks later, Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama - previously an adviser to the Senkaku Islands Defence Association, the nationalist group that supports Nakama - hosted the fisherman in Tokyo on December 19.

During their 20-minute meeting, she asked about his previous visits to the islands and remarked that "small incidents can grow bigger and lead to war", Nakama said. He interpreted the message as a request to stay away, though she didn't say so directly, he said.

"What she was really saying was that she didn't want me to go," Nakama told Reuters as small waves rocked his boat in his home port of Ishigaki, where he serves as a local councillor.

Katayama's office declined to comment on the meeting. The Japan Coast Guard said it informs relevant parties about the security situation in waters surrounding the islands as necessary, but declined to discuss specifics.

Ishigaki Mayor Yoshitaka Nakayama said Japanese officials appeared concerned about the risk that fishermen could be detained or subjected to inspections by Chinese authorities during a period of heightened tensions with Beijing.

"If someone should actually be detained it would escalate into a much bigger international issue, so I think that is what the government wants to avoid," he told Reuters at his office.

China in recent years has stepped up efforts to enforce its sweeping maritime claims, notably in repeated confrontations with Philippine vessels in which Chinese coast guard ships used water cannons , opens new tab .

The last major maritime dispute between China and Japan erupted in 2010, after Japan's coast guard detained the captain of a Chinese fishing boat that collided with Japanese vessels near the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Relations soured further in 2012 when Japan nationalised several of the then-privately owned islands.

Washington has committed to defending the islands under its security treaty with Japan, meaning any clash there risks drawing in the United States.

"It's kind of the touch paper for further deterioration between Japan and China, because China is really pushing its claims on the islands. It is phenomenally tense around there at the moment," said Robert Ward, Japan chair at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Chinese coast guard ships were spotted near the islands on a record 357 days last year, according to Japan's coast guard. The islands lie more than 300 kilometres from mainland China, about 150 kilometres from Japan's nearest inhabited territory, and about 170 kilometres from Taiwan, which also claims them.

Fishing has long been associated with the islands.

After Japan first claimed them in the late 19th century, a skipjack tuna processing plant was established on the main Uotsuri Island until it was abandoned in the 1930s.

In 1977, before Beijing began more assertively pressing its claims and scaring off fishermen, there were at least 164 Japanese fishing trips to the islands, according to a Japanese government-commissioned research report.

Last year, there were only eight documented visits by Japanese fishing vessels, down from 18 in 2024, according to the Japan Coast Guard.

Nakama and his nationalist backers say they are determined to reverse the decline in fishing around the islands, arguing that such activity helps demonstrate Japan's control.

Paul Midford, a professor of international studies at Meiji Gakuin University in Yokohama, said while that argument has merit, it can lead to escalation as both sides try to outdo each other to demonstrate control.

Yet a complete lack of Japanese economic activity could invite China to flood the area with its own ships, said IISS's Ward. "The need for Japan to keep showing it has a pulse in the Senkaku Islands is really important," he said.

Kinjo said his motivation is money, not politics.

"I earn my income there... a substantial income," he said, describing the seas as a treasure trove of red snapper, a local delicacy.

While rough winter seas may help keep fishermen away for now, Kinjo and Nakama said they were determined to return soon, despite the risks.

"I'll go there for as long as I have this boat. I'll keep on going," Nakama said, as he sat on an ice box on the deck of his ship.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:48:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JYCZYFJ5TNK6VPP3JEE7IRTW5I.jpg?auth=8be81778698de4cf9ca350007f8f25134023a2309caff9122524a7739b9b25f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan-US alliance would crumble if Tokyo ignored Taiwan crisis, PM Takaichi says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japan-us-alliance-would-crumble-if-tokyo-ignored-taiwan-crisis-pm-takaichi-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but distanced herself from previous comments that suggested a possible military response in such an event.

Takaichi expressed her latest views on a nationally broadcast TV programme late on Monday, where an opposition party leader criticised her for igniting tensions with China with the earlier remarks.

Ties between Japan and China have sunk to the worst level in years after Takaichi said in November that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. Beijing has responded with export curbs, flight cancellations and vitriolic commentaries, repeatedly demanding a retraction.

China claims sovereignty over the democratically-governed island of Taiwan.

“I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not about Japan going out and taking military action if China and the United States come into conflict (over Taiwan)," Takaichi said on the live TV show, referring to the comments she made in parliament in November.

"If something serious happens there, we would have to go to rescue the Japanese and American citizens in Taiwan. In that situation, there may be cases where we take joint action.

"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground."

Takaichi did not elaborate.

With an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.

Japan's pacifist constitution prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces a "threat to its survival."

Takaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:49:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MWFJRP4QE5NE7L7PCHTAVAJN4Y.jpg?auth=fbb8fc94cdd054609e384170d42ff25a005177a3e35c413723e314645d752f47&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia heatwave raises bushfire threat as Melbourne braces for hottest day in 17 years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/australia-heatwave-raises-bushfire-threat-melbourne-braces-hottest-day-17-years-2026-01-27/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A major heatwave across Australia's southeast raised bushfire threats, with Melbourne forecast to record its hottest day in nearly 17 years on Tuesday, and hundreds of residents in rural towns were ordered to immediately evacuate their homes.

Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said the temperature in Melbourne could hit 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) with severe to extreme heatwave conditions expected to peak on Tuesday and Wednesday, before gradually easing later in the week.

The heatwave has raised the fire danger across Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, where a fast-moving bushfire in the Otways region has burned about 10,000 hectares (24,000 acres).

Officials warned that strong winds forecast for later in the day could further spread the blaze, threatening homes.

"It's the change that's going to come through about 5 p.m. (0600 GMT) with some really punchy winds that is likely to do most of the damage and drive that fire further," Country Fire Authority Chief Officer Jason Heffernan told ABC News.

Emergency services have doorknocked about 1,100 homes and sent text messages to around 10,000 phones urging residents to leave the region, Heffernan said.

Total fire bans were declared across Victoria, as officials tried to lower the risk of new fires.

Organisers of the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam in Melbourne said matches on the outside courts and roof closures would follow its extreme heat condition protocols. Wheelchair matches have been postponed to Wednesday.

In inland towns, the temperature is expected to reach the high-40s. The town of Ouyen, with a population of just over 1,000 and 440 km (273 miles) northwest of Melbourne, is likely to touch 49 degrees Celsius (120.2 Fahrenheit), the weather bureau said.

Local butcher Nathan Grayling told ABC Radio that he would try to keep his business as dark and cool as possible, with most residents expected to stay indoors.

"If we get everything done, we might knock off early and go down the local pub for a beer," Grayling said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:50:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines, U.S. hold joint sail in disputed South China Sea shoal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/philippines-us-hold-joint-sail-disputed-south-china-sea-shoal-2026-01-27/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Philippine and U.S. militaries sailed together at a disputed South China Sea shoal this week, Manila's armed forces said on Tuesday, performing joint exercises to boost interoperability between the two treaty allies.

The joint sail was held in the Scarborough Shoal in South China Sea waters lying within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, which China also claims as part of its territory. It was the 11th "maritime cooperative activity" involving the United States and the Philippines since November 2023 .

"The successful conduct of these activities enhanced coordination, tactical proficiency, and mutual understanding between allied forces," the Philippine armed forces said in a statement.

The joint sail showcased the Philippines' frigate Antonio Luna, a Philippine coast guard offshore patrol vessel, as well as two military planes and a helicopter.

The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command deployed the USS John Finn, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer and an MH-60R Seahawk helicopter.

Military engagements between the treaty allies have soared under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has pivoted closer to Washington in response to China's growing presence in the South China Sea.

China claims sovereignty over nearly all the South China Sea, including parts of the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:50:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rescue efforts under way after Philippine ferry sinks, leaving 18 dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rescue-efforts-under-way-after-philippine-ferry-sinks-leaving-18-dead-2026-01-26/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Search and rescue operations continued on Tuesday for 10 people still missing after a passenger boat capsized off a southern Philippine province, with the death toll rising slightly to 18, the Philippine Coast Guard said.

Captain Noemie Cayabyab, a spokesperson at the PCG, said the total number of people on board had been revised to 344, down from the earlier figure of 359, after verifying that 15 people listed on the manifest did not board the vessel.

The number of rescued passengers remained at 316, Cayabyab told reporters.

The accident occurred at 1:50 a.m. (1750 GMT) on Monday while the passenger vessel, MV Trisha Kerstin 3, was en route to Jolo in Sulu province after departing from Zamboanga. The PCG said the vessel has an authorised passenger capacity of 352.

The PCG said it was not yet prepared to conclude why the ferry sank, with the investigation still ongoing.

Sea accidents are common in the Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands with a patchy maritime safety record.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:51:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOLHBEEHXJNRLOIGJBNBIMZKEU.jpg?auth=83687700548717eca58693d8a9be4eb1708853eec76e1ff41a9d900c98e28bcf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gavin Newsom accuses TikTok of suppressing content critical of Trump</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260127-gavin-newsom-accuses-tiktok-of-suppressing-content-critical-of-trump</link><description>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused TikTok on Monday of suppressing content critical of President Donald Trump as he launched a review of the platform’s content moderation practices to determine whether they violated state law.

The step comes after TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, said it had finalised a deal to set up a majority US-owned joint venture that will secure US data, to avoid a US ban on the short video app used by more than 200 million Americans.

“Following TikTok ’s sale to a Trump-aligned business group, our office has received reports, and independently confirmed instances, of suppressed content critical of President Trump,” Newsom’s office said on X, without elaborating.

“Gavin Newsom is launching a review of this conduct and is calling on the California Department of Justice to determine whether it violates California law,” it added.

The White House and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Newsom, a Democrat , and Trump, a Republican , have long been critical of each other.

Last week’s TikTok deal was a milestone for the firm after years of battles with the US government over Washington’s concerns about risks to national security and privacy under Trump and former president Joe Biden .

ByteDance said TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC would secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures, in a deal praised by Trump.

With more than 16 million followers on his personal TikTok account, Trump credited the app with helping him win the 2024 election.

The deal provides for American and global investors to hold 80.1% of the venture, while ByteDance will own 19.9%.

Each of the joint venture’s three managing investors – cloud computing giant Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX – will hold a stake of 15%.

The US and Chinese governments had signed off on the deal, a White House official said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:51:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/974766ca-ba16-11f0-ac6d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25309178500980.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICC judges rule former Philippine president Duterte fit for trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260127-icc-judges-rule-former-philippine-president-duterte-fit-for-trial</link><description>Judges at the International Criminal Court have ruled that former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte , 80, is fit to attend pre-trial hearings and will hold a confirmation of charges hearing on February 23, the court said on Monday.

His defence had argued that Duterte, who is being held in The Hague over murders committed during his war on drugs , could not stand trial due to cognitive decline.

Judges said in a statement that a report by independent medical experts found that Duterte would be able to understand and participate in his case.

They recalled that, for someone to be deemed fit to take part in proceedings, it is sufficient that they have a broad understanding of the procedures, not that they operate at their highest level.

“The Chamber is satisfied, in law, that Mr Duterte is able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings,” the judges said.

It is rare for international courts to find suspects, even elderly ones, wholly unfit for trial. The ICC has never found a suspect unfit to stand trial, despite petitions from several other defendants.

Duterte served as president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022 and was arrested and taken to The Hague last March.

Duterte’s counsel, Nicholas Kaufman, said in a statement that the defence was disappointed after being denied the chance to present its own medical evidence and to question the findings in court.

“The defence will seek leave to appeal this decision and argue that Mr Duterte was denied due process,” Kaufman said.

According to ICC prosecutors, Duterte created, funded and armed death squads during his war on drugs, when thousands of alleged narcotics peddlers and users were killed.

Judges also set a new date for his confirmation of charges hearing. Prosecutors want to charge Duterte with three counts of murder as a crime against humanity involving more than 75 victims, but under the ICC system judges must confirm the charges after separate hearings before the case can move to trial.

According to police, 6,200 suspects were killed during anti-drug operations under Duterte’s presidency. Activists say the real toll was far higher, and the ICC prosecutor has said as many as 30,000 people may have died.

Duterte has long insisted he instructed police to kill only in self-defence and has consistently defended the crackdown, repeatedly telling supporters he was ready to “rot in jail” if it meant ridding the Philippines of illicit drugs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:51:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2ad07288-3024-11f0-8979-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_46DE29D.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney walked back Davos comments in call with Trump, US treasury chief says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-carney-walked-back-davos-comments-call-with-trump-bessent-tells-fox-news-2026-01-27/</link><description>OTTAWA/ WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, in a call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, "aggressively" walked back some of the comments he made during a speech in Davos last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday.

"I was in the Oval (Office) with the president today. He spoke to Prime Minister Carney, who was very aggressively walking back some of the unfortunate remarks he made at Davos," Bessent said in an interview on Fox News' "Hannity" program.

Carney, whose office did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Monday, received a rare standing ovation in Davos for a speech in which he urged nations to accept the end of a rules-based global order.

After Carney's speech, Trump revoked Canada's invitation to join a so-called Board of Peace that the U.S. president says aims to resolve global conflicts. Trump also threatened on Saturday to impose a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa followed through on a trade deal with U.S. rival China .

At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Carney called on nations to accept that a rules-based global order was over and pointed to Canada as an example of how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimized by American hegemony.

Carney, during his speech in Davos, Switzerland, did not directly call out Trump or the U.S. by name. However, the prime minister said "middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu."

Many world leaders and industry titans present responded with a standing ovation. Trump was critical of that speech.

"Of course, Canada depends on the U.S.," Bessent said in his interview.

The Canadian prime minister traveled this month to China to reset the countries' strained relationship and reached a trade deal with Canada's second-biggest trading partner after the U.S.

Bessent said on Monday "it would be a disaster for Canada" if Trump imposed further tariffs on Canadian goods.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 04:49:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHANO5NMQZNRFCIP7IE3CIDTEM.jpg?auth=50f2bcf106d8a85b0c186a8f89acc4a7296953a36b98ebdaacdab4a5ba0b88e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why has President Trump threatened to raise US tariffs on South Korea again?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/why-has-president-trump-threatened-raise-us-tariffs-south-korea-again-2026-01-27/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he was hiking tariffs on autos and other goods imported from South Korea to 25%, citing Seoul's failure to legislate a trade deal agreed last year that capped U.S. levies on the items at 15%.

It was not immediately clear what prompted Trump's outburst on social media platform Truth Social on Monday, but South Korea has faced delays implementing the deal and there has also been tension over perceived mistreatment of U.S. technology firms.

Under the deal that Trump and President Lee Jae Myung agreed when the U.S. leader visited South Korea in October 2025, Seoul pledged $350 billion of investments into strategic U.S. industries in return for tariffs being capped at 15%.

South Korean Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol this month told Reuters, however, "it is unlikely" that the investment could begin in the first half of this year, citing administrative reasons and currency market volatility.

Any investment decisions will need to follow a multi-layered governance structure involving the project management committee, orchestrated by South Korea's trade and finance ministers, who will then evaluate commercial viability and legal alignment.

The won's near 7% decline against the dollar in the past six months has been a major source of concern for the country's financial authorities, prompting them to verbally support the South Korean currency several times as it approaches levels unseen since the global financial crisis.

Authorities are worried that the planned $350 billion outflow of funds to the U.S. could further weaken the won. In his interview with Reuters on January 16, Finance Minister Koo said "not a lot (of investment) can be made under the current forex situation, at least for this year."

Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong also said this month he would not agree to any investment outflows to the U.S. if currency markets became unstable.

For the U.S. trade deal, the South Korean government plans to establish a fund to raise foreign currency without destabilising the onshore dollar-won market, a step that needs a special law to be enacted through the National Assembly.

Debate had initially swirled over the need for parliamentary approval, with some officials arguing it was unnecessary since the memorandum of understanding with the United States was non-binding.

Some South Korean lawmakers demanded the bill be pushed through a fast-track process, a mechanism that allows bills to be voted on quickly, but given the scale of the investment involved the idea was opposed by many.

On November 26, the ruling Democratic Party submitted a bill to establish a policy investment vehicle and to define the fund's governance and operating rules, but the bill has been sitting at the parliament's standing committee for two months due to disagreements among lawmakers.

Although President Lee's Democratic Party holds the majority in the 300-member parliament, the bill must pass through the finance committee, which is currently chaired by the opposition People's Power Party.

On Tuesday, the finance ministry said it planned to ask parliament for cooperation and the ruling party said it was ready to work with the opposition to speed up the bill's passage.

Japan and South Korea had both agreed separate but somewhat similar trade framework deals with Washington last July, but Tokyo has implemented the agreement more quickly.

Japan's parliament approved its U.S. trade pact on December 3 and held the first panel consultation to discuss the first project on December 23 to kick-start Tokyo's planned $550 billion U.S. investment.
WHAT OTHER TRADE FRICTIONS ARE THERE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA?

A source familiar with the internal U.S.-South Korea discussions cited the perceived mistreatment of U.S. tech companies as a trigger point.

A major data breach late last year at Coupang (CPNG.N) , opens new tab , a U.S.-listed e-commerce company operating in South Korea, has escalated into a dispute that now threatens to hurt broader trade relations between the countries.

Coupang, South Korea's largest online retailer, alleges that the country's regulators singled out the company with public criticism and raids, wiping out market value in a loss for U.S. investors.

South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-Seok used his meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Washington last week to deny allegations of discriminatory treatment of the company.

Vance requested that the issue be managed well by the two governments to avoid misunderstanding and escalation, Kim said after the meeting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:27:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XLDF45OT4FK6HM7UL6SFJKHLPI.jpg?auth=00715a4f4f109202695a33540a5cb57775c49483c497a069a5fe1e51f38875b0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Twenty-three soldiers died in Indonesia's West Java landslides, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/twenty-three-soldiers-died-indonesias-west-java-landslides-official-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Twenty-three soldiers trapped in landslides in Indonesia's West Java have been confirmed dead, a navy spokesperson said on Tuesday.

The decision was unanimously agreed during the House's plenary session on Tuesday, said deputy house speaker Saan Mustopa.

On Monday, a parliamentary commission overseeing finance had endorsed Thomas as the new deputy governor, eliminating two other career central bankers.

"Hopefully this mandate can be carried out with integrity and wisdom also give significant contribution in strengthening monetary policy, maintaining financial stability, and supporting sustainable economic growth," Mustofa said.

After the appointment, Thomas will be formally sworn in by the Supreme Court, though the timing is still unclear.

Thomas’s nomination had already sparked investor concerns about the independence of Bank Indonesia, driving the rupiah to a record low of 16,985 per dollar last week. It later recovered after BI kept rates unchanged in an effort to shore up the currency.

When asked about the market's concerns on Monday, Thomas said he can only be judged on his work, adding that he had already resigned from Prabowo's Gerindra party in December.

He also emphasised the importance of "synergy" between the central bank, fiscal policymakers and other authorities in supporting the country's economic growth. But he stressed that nothing should compromise the central bank's independence.

"The law (which regulates) Bank Indonesia's independence is very strong," he said. "Second, I went through all the processes required by the law."

Misbakhun said Thomas was approved because he was seen as a figure who "can be accepted by all parties" and has the vision of creating synergy between fiscal and monetary policies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5PPJNLI3VFLF3ENLF42J3ZW34I.jpg?auth=2c46ef6be20b41bc4396e77d9988085d7a1ab2e72e17c3c46490410c83aa1f17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Xi says China, Finland should uphold international system, advance multipolar order</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-says-china-finland-should-uphold-international-system-advance-multipolar-2026-01-27/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping told Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Tuesday that Beijing was ready to work with Helsinki to uphold a U.N.-centred international system and advance a multipolar world based on economic globalisation, according to state news agency Xinhua.

Xi also said Beijing hoped Finland would play a constructive role in promoting the healthy and stable development of China-EU relations, Xinhua reported.

Orpo's visit to China comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's volatile foreign policy decisions and confrontational approach toward allies push European countries to diversify their foreign relations.

It also comes amid heightened attention on Arctic security at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, after Trump's threat to seize Greenland and prevent China and Russia from expanding their influence in the region.

Those threats appeared to have eased after Trump said the U.S. had secured permanent access to the Danish territory, but Arctic security remains a growing strategic concern for Finland, its NATO partners and China.

The Arctic is becoming increasingly important to international trade as shrinking ice packs open up new and faster shipping routes, cutting transit times between Asia and Europe nearly in half.

Speaking on the sidelines of Davos last week, Finland's President Alexander Stubb said he wanted NATO to agree to an Arctic security deal at its July summit, similar to the big increase in defence spending that it committed to last year.

One-third of Finland's territory lies above the Arctic Circle, while China calls itself a "near-Arctic state" and has ambitions to build a "Polar Silk Road".

Xi also called on Tuesday for the two sides to collaborate more in areas including energy transition, agriculture, and forestry, and welcomed Finnish enterprises to "swim freely" in the "vast ocean" of China's market.

Orpo, who is in Beijing from January 25 to 28, told Xi that he looked forward to continued discussions on bilateral cooperation and international issues.

Orpo referenced the "candid and constructive talks" Xi had with Finland's president during his 2024 state visit to Beijing.

In talks with Xi, Stubb raised an ongoing string of incidents involving damage to undersea power cables, gas pipelines and telecoms in which Chinese-registered ships have been implicated. A Chinese ship captain is facing allegations of criminal damage in a Hong Kong court in one of the cases.

Stubb also raised the issue of North Korean support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which he said NATO and the EU considered a provocation.

Orpo reiterated Stubb's invitation to Xi to visit Finland at a mutually convenient time, and said Finland's speaker of parliament Jussi Halla-aho had invited top lawmaker Zhao Leji to visit.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:38:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZSVDSLAZJNJJVBYTRI6O2UIEM4.jpg?auth=2b109c62635e88f20691c0554c6e307e3ee5fe0e7e6ed1ecef834bfcc3079e92&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel to seek new security deal with the US, FT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/israel-seek-new-security-deal-with-us-ft-reports-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - Israel is preparing for talks with the Trump administration on a new 10-year security deal, seeking to extend U.S. military support even as Israeli leaders signal they are planning for a future with reduced American cash grants, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

Gil Pinchas, speaking to the FT before stepping down as chief financial adviser to Israel's military and defence ministry, said Israel would seek to prioritise joint military and defence projects over cash handouts in talks that he expected to take place in the coming weeks.

The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular business hours.

"The partnership is more important than just the net financial issue in this context  ... there are a lot of things that are equal to money," Pinchas told the FT. "The view of this needs to be wider."

Pinchas said pure financial support - or "free money" - worth $3.3 billion a year, which Israel can use to purchase U.S. weapons, was "one component of the MOU (that) could decrease gradually."

In 2016, the U.S. and Israeli governments signed a memorandum of understanding for the 10 years through September 2028 that provides $38 billion in military aid, $33 billion in grants to buy military equipment and $5 billion for missile defence systems.

Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped to "taper off" Israeli dependence on U.S. military aid in the next decade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:38:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PD6YXQ7XWZOMLBBWYYWUKJUSJU.jpg?auth=d174b0ab71f225df9bf1107999665dec554e9bbf3ab0a5a5bd514605216f608a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US links security guarantees for Ukraine to peace deal ceding Donbas, FT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-links-security-guarantees-ukraine-peace-deal-ceding-donbas-ft-reports-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has signalled to Ukraine that U.S. security guarantees depend on Kyiv agreeing to a peace deal likely requiring it to cede the Donbas region to Russia, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing eight people familiar with the talks.

Washington has also indicated it could offer Ukraine more weapons to strengthen its peacetime army if Kyiv agreed to withdraw forces from the parts of the eastern region it controls, the newspaper said.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that a U.S. document on security guarantees for Ukraine was " 100% ready " and Kyiv is now awaiting a time and place for it to be signed.

Zelenskiy has consistently said that Ukraine's territorial integrity must be upheld in any peace deal to end the war.

Ukraine is increasingly uncertain whether Washington will commit to security guarantees, a senior Ukrainian official told the Financial Times, saying the U.S. "stops each time the security guarantees can be signed."

Kyiv wants the guarantees confirmed before conceding any territory. However, the U.S. believes Ukraine must give up the Donbas for the war to end and is not pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin to drop that demand, the report added.

"This is totally false — the US's only role in the peacemaking process is to bring both sides together to make a deal," Anna Kelly, the deputy White House press secretary, told FT.

A person familiar with the U.S. position told the newspaper that Washington was "not trying to force any territorial concessions upon Ukraine," adding that security guarantees depend on both sides agreeing to a peace deal.

The Kremlin said on Monday the question of territory remained fundamental to any deal to end the fighting in Ukraine, the TASS news agency reported after weekend talks in Abu Dhabi.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:38:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QDEOARKAI5J7HLJTFD6TEAA6GM.jpg?auth=22ff80174d58fc9c248f7c11512d406e9bdd0e0b5f3c3164f5c8f249d61971d3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Extreme cold, relentless snowfall grip millions in wake of deadly US storm</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260126-extreme-cold-grips-millions-as-us-digs-out-of-deadly-snowstorm</link><description>Perilously cold temperatures threatened millions of Americans Monday in the wake of a sprawling winter storm that left at least 23 people dead as it knocked out power and paralysed transportation.

A frigid, life-threatening Arctic air mass could delay recovery as municipalities from New Mexico to Maine tried to dig out following the storm, which dropped a vicious cocktail of heavy snow and wind, along with freezing rain and sleet.

Forecasters warned that much of the northern half of the country will see temperatures that are "continuously below freezing through February 1", and "record low temperatures tonight across the South are particularly dangerous in the wake of the weekend winter storm with many still without power", the National Weather Service said in an X post.

While skies began clearing in parts of the country, relentless snowfall in the northeast meant parts of Connecticut saw over 56 centimetres of snow, with more than 40.6 centimetres recorded in Boston, Massachusetts.

The storm was linked to at least 23 deaths, according to a compilation of state government and local media reports, with causes including hypothermia as well as accidents related to traffic, sledging, ATVs and snowplows.

One man was found in the snow unresponsive with a shovel in his hand.

In New York City, eight more people were found dead amid plummeting temperatures, and an investigation to determine the causes was underway. It was not known if all of these fatalities were storm-related.

Electricity began blinking back on across the south, but as of Monday evening, well over 550,000 customers remained without it, according to the tracking site Poweroutage.com.

Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana — southern states unaccustomed to intense winter weather — were especially impacted.

Approximately 190 million people in the United States were under some form of extreme cold alert, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.

The Great Lakes region's residents woke up to extreme temperatures that could cause frostbite on exposed skin within minutes. In parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the NWS reported early Monday morning temperatures as low as -30.6C, with windchills exacerbating the bite.

Over the weekend, nearly half of the states in the contiguous US received at least a foot of snow, 30.5 centimetres, and in many cases far more. The NWS said New Mexico's Bonito Lake accumulated the highest US total over the weekend with 78.7 centimetres.

Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell told journalists that trees were continuing to fall under the weight of encrusted ice across the Tennessee capital city — sometimes knocking out power that had already been restored.

Nashville and other municipalities across the country were establishing emergency warming shelters.

NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli told AFP this storm recovery was particularly arduous because so many states were impacted — meaning northern states with more winter supplies were unable to share their resources with less-prepared southern regions.

"A lot of those locations don't have the means or the resources to clean up after these events," she said. "We're particularly concerned about the folks in those areas that are without power right now."

At least 20 states and the capital Washington were under states of emergency in order to deploy emergency personnel and resources.

The snowfall and biting icy pellets that pummeled cities left impassable roads along with cancelled buses, trains and flights — thousands of departures and arrivals were scrapped over the weekend.

The storm system was the result of a stretched polar vortex, an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes morphs into a more oval shape, sending cold air pouring across North America.

Scientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions may be linked to climate change, though the debate is not settled and natural variability plays a role.

Dave Radell, a NWS meteorologist based in New York, said that the character of this storm's snow was "very dry" and "fluffy", meaning the wind could lash it around with ease, impeding roadway-clearing efforts and visibility.

"That makes it even more challenging," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:38:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09957522-fae1-11f0-b258-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/b4737fa3600f6ccaa231ecad5a6268e0c7476228.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea fires projectile towards sea, South Korea's military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-projectile-towards-sea-south-koreas-military-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - North Korea launched an unidentified projectile towards the sea off its east coast, South Korea's military said on Tuesday.

President Donald Trump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House , after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterisation that authorities had not substantiated.

Saturday's fatal shooting of Pretti, an ICU nurse, by Border Patrol agents ignited political backlash and raised fresh questions about how the operation was being run.

Bovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.

A person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis.

The departure accompanies a softer tone from Trump on the Minnesota crackdown, including the president's touting of productive conversations with the governor and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

The mayor said he asked Trump in a phone call to end the immigration enforcement surge, and Trump agreed that the present situation cannot continue. Frey said he would keep pushing for others involved in Operation Metro Surge to go and planned to meet Homan on Tuesday.

Trump and Democratic Governor Tim Walz spoke in a phone call and later offered comments that were a marked change from the critical statements they had exchanged in the past.

“We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” the president wrote in a social media post.

Walz, in a statement, said the call was “productive" and that impartial investigations into the shootings were needed. Trump said his administration was looking for “any and all” criminals the state has in their custody. Walz said the state Department of Corrections honours federal requests for people in its custody.

Meanwhile, attorneys for the administration, the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul appeared Monday before US District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is considering whether to grant requests to temporarily halt the immigration operation.

She said the case was a priority, but in an order later Monday, she told the federal government’s attorneys to file an additional brief addressing, among other things, the assertion by the state and cities that the purpose of Operation Metro Surge is to punish them for their sanctuary laws and policies.

Lawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued the situation on the street is so dire that it requires the court to halt the federal government’s enforcement actions.

“If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don’t think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

The judge questioned the government’s motivation behind the crackdown and expressed scepticism about a letter Attorney General Pam Bondi recently sent to Walz asking the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

“I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?” Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her.

The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. Pretti's shooting added urgency to the case.

News of Bovino's departure didn't stop dozens of protesters from gathering outside a hotel where they believed Bovino was staying. They blew whistles, banged pots and one person blasted a trombone. Police watched and kept them away from the hotel entrance.

In court Monday, an attorney for the administration said about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were on the ground, along with at least 1,000 Border Patrol officers.

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, took under advisement a request from the Justice Department to lift an order he issued late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday’s shooting.

Attorneys for the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension told the judge they can’t trust the federal government to preserve the evidence, citing the lack of cooperation the state is getting from federal authorities after they said they were blocked from the scene.

But the federal government’s attorneys argued that the temporary restraining order should be dissolved because its investigators are already following proper preservation procedures, and they’d object to “micromanaging” from the court what evidence the state can examine while the federal investigation is ongoing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:31:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0150f98c-fac7-11f0-8c54-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2256971194.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU and India to announce 'mother of all deals' representing 25% of global GDP</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260126-eu-and-india-to-announce-mother-of-all-deals-representing-one-third-of-global-trade</link><description>India and the European Union announced Tuesday the "mother of all deals", a huge trade pact to create a market of two billion people, reached after two decades of negotiations.

EU chiefs and Prime Minister Narendra Modi hope the pact, which Modi said was concluded on Monday, will help shield against challenges from the world's two leading economies, the United States and China .

The agreement will cut or eliminate tariffs on almost 97 percent of European exports, saving up to 4 billion euros ($4.75 billion) annually in duties, the 27-nation bloc said.

“A mother of all deals," Modi said Tuesday in the capital New Delhi, where he met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.

"This deal will bring many opportunities for India's 1.4 billion and many millions of people of the EU," Modi said, adding the agreement "represents about 25 percent of global GDP, and one-third of global trade".

The EU has eyed India – the world's most populous nation – as an important market for the future.

"Europe and India are making history today," von der Leyen said in a statement, a day after she and Costa were feted as guests of honour at India's Republic Day parade.

"We have created a free trade zone of two billion people, with both sides set to benefit."

EU officials said the deal was the most ambitious India had ever signed, and European companies would benefit from so-called "first mover advantage".

Europe's key agricultural, automotive and service sectors stand to gain.

New Delhi sees the European bloc as an important source of much-needed technology and investment to rapidly upscale its infrastructure and create millions of new jobs.

Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 percent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60 billion in trade in services.

Under the agreement, India is expected to ease market access for key European products.

Tariffs on cars will be gradually lowered from a top rate of 110 percent to as low as 10 percent, while duties on wines progressively go down from 150 percent to as low as 20 percent.

Currently at 50 percent, tariffs on processed foods – including pasta and chocolate – will be eliminated, according to the EU.

Von der Leyen said she expected exports to India to double, and that the EU would "gain the highest level of access ever granted to a trade partner in the traditionally protected Indian market".

European firms will get privileged access to the Indian financial services and maritime transport market, the bloc said.

For India, it would boost sectors including textiles, gems and jewellery, and leather goods, as well as the service sector, Modi said.

Talks went down to the wire on Monday, focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU's carbon border tax on steel , according to sources familiar with the discussions.

The accord comes as both Brussels and New Delhi have sought to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls.

India and the EU were also expected to conclude an accord to facilitate movement for seasonal workers, students, researchers and highly skilled professionals, and a security and defence pact.

"India and Europe have made a clear choice. The choice of strategic partnership, dialogue and openness," von der Leyen wrote on social media. "We are showing a fractured world that another way is possible."

India is on track to become its fourth-largest economy this year, according to International Monetary Fund projections.

New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for key military hardware for decades, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base.

Europe is doing the same with regard to the United States.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:31:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6709cf6e-f9d8-11f0-83ca-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/780c77f4c7d27ef869b427599e1265988633d46f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Azerbaijan arrests three men for planning embassy attack at behest of Islamic State offshoot</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/azerbaijan-arrests-three-men-planning-embassy-attack-behest-islamic-state-2026-01-27/</link><description>BAKU, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Authorities in Azerbaijan said on Tuesday they had arrested three individuals planning an attack on a foreign embassy in the capital Baku at the instructions of Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), the Afghan offshoot of Islamic State.

In a statement, the State Security Service said the three men, whom it named, had conspired with members of ISIS-K, obtained weapons and planned to attack a foreign embassy before they were apprehended by security forces.

The statement did not name the foreign embassy. One of the men was born in 2000, and the two others in 2005.

Islamic State-Khorasan, or ISIS-K, claimed responsibility for the 2024 Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow which left at least 145 people dead.

There have been a number of Islamic State-linked plots foiled in the majority-Muslim regions of Russia, where the group is listed as a banned terrorist organisation, and in Central Asia.

Azerbaijan, a South Caucasus country of some 10 million people bordering Russia and Iran, is a secular country with a predominantly Muslim population, the majority of whom are Shiites.

In its statement, Azerbaijani authorities said the suspects had been arrested on charges of "preparation for terrorism" on the basis of religious hostility. They said the investigation was ongoing.

In a separate case, an Azerbaijani court sentenced a man affiliated with ISIS-K to 13 years in prison on terrorism charges last October after finding him guilty of plotting an attack on a synagogue in Baku with a Molotov cocktail in December 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:51:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's opposition keeps poll lead, backed by younger generation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-opposition-keeps-poll-lead-backed-by-younger-generation-2026-01-27/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hungary's centre-right opposition Tisza party has kept its 10 percentage point opinion poll lead over Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz in January, a fresh poll showed late on Monday.

Fidesz had stronger support only among voters older than 59 and living in villages and small towns, the poll found.

Nationalist Orban, in power since 2010, faces a strong challenge for the first time in 16 years in a parliamentary election due on April 12. Tisza is led by former government insider Peter Magyar.

The vote is set to have major implications for Europe and its far-right political forces. Orban, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has frequently clashed with the EU over the steady erosion of democratic values in Hungary, which he denies.

The new poll, conducted between January 19-24 by Zavecz Research and published on news website Telex, showed that among decided voters Tisza had 49% support, up from 47% in November, while Fidesz polled 39% up from 38% in November. The far-right Mi Hazank (Our Homeland) party was backed by 5% of decided voters.

According to the survey, Tisza had overwhelming support with 41% versus 22% for Fidesz among voters younger than 39, but Fidesz led 38% to 35% in the voter group aged older than 59. Among those with only primary school education, Fidesz led 38% to 27% for Tisza.

Most polls show Fidesz trailing Tisza despite voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation in Hungary. Pro-government pollsters show a Fidesz lead.

Orban has framed the 2026 election as a choice between war and peace, portraying Ukraine as undeserving of support and his government as the only safe choice.

Tisza, which swept into politics in 2024, has said it would curb corruption, unlock billions of euros of frozen European Union funds to boost the economy and firmly anchor Hungary in the EU.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:51:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6V7ORONRFPWNNOUUBVFOZHFO4.jpg?auth=c94e48fa00b3b8324da16042ac474a19a551fe34addb55150f73df46af5ddf08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark and Greenland prime ministers to visit Berlin and Paris</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-greenland-prime-ministers-visit-berlin-paris-2026-01-27/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland said on Tuesday they will visit Berlin and Paris to shore up support amid U.S. President Donald Trump's recent threats against the Arctic island.

Denmark's Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's Jens-Frederik Nielsen will meet with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday and French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday, official schedules showed.

Trump's demands for control of Greenland have shaken transatlantic relations and accelerated European efforts to reduce dependence on the United States, even as Trump last week withdraw tariff threats and ruled out taking Greenland by force.

Frederiksen and Nielsen will discuss "the current foreign policy situation and the need for a strengthened Europe" in their meetings, the Danish prime minister's office said.

The two will also attend the Welt Economic Summit in Germany on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:51:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BL2AJJOGSJO7XFWFRAS3SE3CW4.jpg?auth=1d0c5a65ce05ebbba99d26ba718e7dc7fe6e2de18975b5f3fff9613d7282c00d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russian military chief visits troops in eastern Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260127-live-russian-military-chief-visits-troops-eastern-ukraine</link><description>The Ukrainian air force said on Tuesday Russian troops had launched 165 drones - 135 of them neutralised by air defence units.

"Our energy system came under attack and there was quite serious damage. All crews are at work to eliminate all the negative consequences quickly," Syniehubov said in a video posted on Telegram.

"About 80% of the city of Kharkiv and Kharkiv region ‍is without electricity," he added.

Russian President ​Vladimir Putin's special ⁠envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, said on Tuesday that Ukraine's ​withdrawal ‍from the Donbas ​region was the path ​to peace.

"Donbas withdrawal is the path to peace for Ukraine," Dmitriev said on X.

Russia ‍controls about 90 percent ​of the Donbas region and Putin has repeatedly ‌said that if Ukraine ‍does not give up the rest, then Russia will take it by force.

An ‍infrastructure ​facility in Ukraine's ⁠western region of Lviv came under ​Russian ‍attack, Regional Governor ​Maksym Kozytskyi said ​on Telegram.

Kozytskyi did not specify what type of ‍facility was attacked, ​adding that all relevant services were ‌working at the scene.

According to ‍preliminary information, no one was hurt in the attack, ‍he said.

Russian ​forces captured ⁠17 settlements and took control of more than ​500 ‍square kilometres of ​territory in Ukraine so ​far in January, Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, said in a video released on Tuesday.

Gerasimov made the claim while visiting troops in western Ukraine, where he "inspected the progress of combat missions conducted by formations and units of the Zapad (West) force group", the ministry wrote on Telegram, without providing details on when or where the visit took place.

In a video of Gerasimov's visit aired by the defence ministry, he said that Russian troops "continue their offensive along all lines".

FRANCE 24 was unable to immediately verify battlefield accounts from ‍either side.

The ‍Trump administration ​has signalled to Ukraine ⁠that US security guarantees would depend on Kyiv first ​agreeing to ‍a peace deal likely ​requiring it to cede the ​Donbas region to Russia, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing eight people familiar with the talks.

Washington ‍has also indicated it ​could offer Ukraine more weapons to strengthen its peacetime ‌army if Kyiv agreed to withdraw‍ forces from the parts of the eastern region it controls, the newspaper said.

The deal is expected to double EU exports to India by 2032 by eliminating or reducing tariffs in 96.6% of traded goods by value, and will lead to savings of 4 billion euros ($4.75 billion) in duties for European companies, the EU said.

The EU will cut tariffs on 99.5% goods traded over seven years, with tariffs to be cut to zero on Indian marine goods, leather and textile products, chemicals, rubber, base metals and gems and jewellery, India's trade ministry said in a statement.

"Yesterday, a big agreement was signed between the European Union and India," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said earlier.

"People around the world are calling this the mother of all deals. This agreement will bring major opportunities for the 1.4 billion people of India and the millions of people in Europe," he said.

The accord would open up India's vast and highly guarded market, with New Delhi slashing tariffs on cars to 10% over five years from as high as 110%, according to an EU statement, benefiting European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

India is also slashing tariffs on alcoholic beverages like wines to 75% immediately from 150%, which would be lowered to 20% gradually. Tariffs on spirits will be lowered to 40%, the EU said.

The deal will also cut tariffs on a slew of EU goods coming to India including machinery, electrical equipment, chemicals and iron and steel, the EU said.

"Europe and India are making history today," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on social media. "This is only the beginning."

Trade between India and the EU stood at $136.5 billion in the fiscal year through March 2025.

The formal signing of the India-EU deal would take place after legal vetting expected to last five to six months , an Indian government official aware of the matter has said.

"We expect the deal to be implemented within a year," the official added.

The agreement comes days after the EU signed a pivotal pact with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.

During the same period, New Delhi finalised pacts with Britain, New Zealand and Oman.

The spate of deals underscores global efforts to hedge against trade with the United States as President Donald Trump's bid to take over Greenland and tariff threats on European nations test longstanding alliances among Western nations.

An India-U.S. trade deal collapsed last year after a breakdown in communications between their two governments.

Talks between India and the EU were relaunched in 2022 after a nine-year lull, and gathered momentum after Trump put tariffs on several trading partners, including a 50% tariff on goods from India.

For India, the tariff cuts with the EU will lead to more exports in labour intensive sectors that will help partly offset the impact of U.S. tariffs, said Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official.

He said the deal will also give an immediate price advantage for EU products in India because of relief from its high tariffs, for instance up to 110% on cars.

During Starmer's visit from Wednesday to Saturday, he will meet with President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Qiang, and China's top legislator, Zhao Leji, said Guo Jiakun, spokesperson at the foreign ministry, at a regular news conference.

Starmer will lead a delegation of more than 50 British companies and institutions from sectors including finance, healthcare and manufacturing, China's commerce ministry said in a separate statement released on Tuesday.

Trade and investment documents are expected to be signed during the British prime minister's visit, it said.

"At the Olympics, ICE's Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the US Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations," the agency said in a statement.

"All security operations remain under Italian authority."

It added: "Obviously, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations in foreign countries."

The potential presence of ICE agents at the February 6-22 Games has sparked huge debate in Italy, following the outcry over the deaths of two civilians during an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis .

Italian authorities initially denied the presence of ICE and then sought to downplay any role, suggesting they would help only in security for the US delegation.

US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are attending the opening ceremony in Milan on February 6.

On Monday, the president of the northern Lombardy region, which is hosting some of the Olympic events, said their involvement would be limited to monitoring Vance and Rubio.

"It will be only in a defensive role, but I am convinced that nothing will happen," Attilio Fontana told reporters.

However, his office then issued a statement saying he did not have any information on their presence, but was responding to a hypothetical question.

Thousands of ICE agents have been deployed by President Donald Trump in various US cities to carry out a crackdown on illegal immigration.

Their actions have prompted widespread protests, and the recent killings of US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti , both 37, on the streets of Minneapolis sparked outrage.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 08:38:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/342e3576-fb59-11f0-84a7-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-26T112954Z-501327942-UP1EM1Q0VXSLA-RTRMADP-3-OLYMPICS-2026-PREVIEW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A boat carrying 25 french tourists capsized off the Omani coast, three killed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/boat-carrying-25-french-tourists-capsized-off-omani-coast-three-killed-2026-01-27/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A boat carrying 25 French tourists capsized off the Omani coast, three people were killed, the Omani police said on Tuesday in a post on X.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:33:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After 844 Days, Israelis to turn off clock marking time since October 7 attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/after-844-days-israelis-turn-off-clock-marking-time-since-october-7-attack-2026-01-27/</link><description>TEL AVIV/CAIRO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A clock in a Tel Aviv square that became a rallying point for Israelis demanding the release of hostages taken during the October 2023 Hamas attack will be turned off on Tuesday, 844 days after it began counting their captivity.

The shutdown follows the discovery in Gaza of the body of the last remaining hostage , which was announced by the Israeli military on Monday. Ran Gvili, 24, was an off-duty police officer recovering from an injury, who was killed fighting militants that had infiltrated Israel during the 2023 attack.

Gvili's mother, Talik, speaking to reporters late on Monday, after her son's body was recovered, thanked those who had supported the family during the 27 months since the 2023 attack.

"We have a closure. Rani returned home an Israeli hero, really, an Israeli hero and we're the most proud of him in the world," she said.

In Israel, the return of the last hostage has been anticipated as a moment of national healing. The Hamas attack, the bloodiest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, was widely seen as the most traumatic event in the country's history.

It also completes a core aspect of the initial phase of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war . The second stage, which Washington announced had started earlier this month, includes the reopening of Gaza's Rafah border with Egypt.

Nour Daher, a 31-year-old Palestinian in Gaza, said that he was waiting for the border to reopen so he could seek medical treatment for a heart defect outside of the war-torn territory.

"I have the medical referral papers. I registered with the WHO (World Health Organization). Now I’m waiting for my name to appear on their lists,” he said. “Last time I checked, they told me they were waiting for a country willing to take my case.”

"I am hopeful my problem will finally end," said Daher, describing near-daily bouts of severe palpitations.

Since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attacks, thousands of Israelis had gathered almost every week in Tel Aviv at a place that came to be known as Hostages Square, calling for the release of all of the hostages in captivity.

Ran Gvili's sister, Shira, along with former hostages and family members, is due to take part in a public ceremony at the Tel Aviv square Tuesday as the clock is turned off, The Hostages and Families Forum, which rallied public support for those taken on October 7 and their families, said.

Gvili was shot while defending Kibbutz Alumim, a community in Israel's south near the border with Gaza. He was taken to Gaza by militants from another Palestinian militant group that joined the Hamas attack, Islamic Jihad, according to Israeli officials.

Handing over all the remaining living and dead hostages was a core commitment of the first phase of the deal, though other parts have not been fulfilled. It is not clear how the next stage will be implemented, which includes the reconstruction and demilitarization of Gaza. The Israeli military remains in control of 53% of Gaza, with Hamas in control of the rest.

Four Israeli soldiers and over 480 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October as part of the U.S. plan to end the war. Both Israel and Hamas have repeatedly accused each other of truce violations.

On Tuesday, Israeli forces killed four Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip, according to the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. An Israeli military spokesperson said they were not aware of any incidents in northern Gaza on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:36:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7LC4QUMXYBOYBPFIQ3KEXOZIGE.jpg?auth=cf94389e9a67b42c9fdea04323ad057d8f1848186a11bb725fa4d1207dd3f82b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Hamas seeks role for its police in Gaza ahead of disarmament talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-seeks-role-its-police-gaza-ahead-disarmament-talks-sources-say-2026-01-27/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Hamas is seeking to incorporate its 10,000 police officers into a new U.S.-backed Palestinian administration for Gaza, sources say, a demand likely to be opposed by Israel as the militant group debates whether to surrender its arms.

Islamist group Hamas retains control of just under half of Gaza following an October ceasefire deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump . The agreement ties further Israeli troop withdrawals to Hamas giving up its weapons.

The 20-point plan to end the war , now in its second phase, calls for the governance of Gaza to be handed to the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, a Palestinian technocratic body with U.S. oversight that is meant to exclude Hamas.

In a letter to staff on Sunday, seen by Reuters, Gaza's Hamas-run government urged its more than 40,000 civil servants and security personnel to cooperate with the NCAG but assured them it was working to incorporate them into the new government.

That would include the roughly 10,000-strong Hamas-run police force, four sources familiar with the matter said, a demand that has not been previously reported. Many of them have been patrolling Gaza as Hamas reasserts its grip in areas under its control.

It was not immediately clear whether Israel, which has adamantly rejected any Hamas involvement in Gaza's future, would agree to the civil and security workers' inclusion in the NCAG.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Hamas' plans for its police force and workers point to wide gaps between Hamas and Israel, backed by the U.S., as Trump pushes ahead with his plans.

Last week, Trump hosted a signing ceremony to establish his "Board of Peace" that will serve as a transitional administration to set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza. The framework includes a provision barring "foreign terrorist organizations" from participating in governance.

Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem told Reuters the group was prepared to hand over governance to the 15-member NCAG and its chair, Ali Shaath, with immediate effect.

"We (have) full confidence that it will operate on the basis of benefiting from qualified personnel and not wasting the rights of anyone who worked during the previous period," Qassem said, referring to the inclusion of the 40,000 personnel.

The four sources said Hamas is open to the NCAG restructuring ministries and sending some workers into retirement. Mass dismissals risked chaos, the sources said.

Hamas and NCAG Chair Shaath have not yet met in person to discuss governance, a Hamas official said. Shaath's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Another issue was whether Sami Nasman, the former Palestinian Authority general assigned to oversee security under the NCAG, would be able to operate effectively, a Palestinian official said.

Nasman, originally from Gaza, moved to the occupied West Bank after Hamas routed Palestinian Authority forces from the enclave in 2007 following a brief civil war. A Hamas court in Gaza later sentenced him in absentia, accusing him of instigating chaos. Nasman denies this.

Trump's administration wants to see heavy weapons decommissioned immediately, with "personal arms registered and decommissioned by sector as (the) NCAG police become capable of guaranteeing personal security," according to a document shared by the White House last week.

A U.S. official said on Tuesday that Hamas fighters would be granted some sort of amnesty .

The militant group is still believed to possess rockets, which several diplomats estimated to number in the hundreds. It is also estimated to possess thousands of light weapons, including rifles.

Hamas recently agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions and with mediators, sources said. However, two Hamas officials told Reuters that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

A Palestinian official close to the disarmament talks said the U.S. had approached Hamas to explore potential disarmament mechanisms involving parties including Israel, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey.

"Hamas has spoken about the possibility of neutralising arms, which could be achieved if there is a truce, and it is ready for a long-term ceasefire — five years or a little longer," the official said.

"But Hamas strongly believes that a serious political negotiation process must begin on Palestinian statehood, whereby weapons and fighters would come under the authority of the State of Palestine," the official said.

Hamas is not the only militant group in the enclave to possess arms. A source in a Gaza faction allied with Hamas said other groups were discussing disarmament but worried about being left defenseless.

In remarks to parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that the next phase of the Gaza deal "is not reconstruction."

Rather, he said, "the next phase is demilitarization of the Strip and disarming Hamas."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HNZKFCVSCZI7NDGKKKMFGO2GIA.jpg?auth=94bda4059f42f9da4b7122324080e4b9a00f2d26274531b3b47a5e9513a42c26&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indian tourist state of Goa weighs social media ban for children</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/indian-tourist-state-goa-weighs-social-media-ban-children-2026-01-27/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - India's top tourist state of Goa is considering an Australia-like social media ban for children, as concerns grow over the risks of such use to their mental health in a nation with more than a billion internet users.

Among the top markets for tech giants such as Meta (META.O) , opens new tab , Google's YouTube and X, India is estimated to have many users younger than 18, but it lacks national curbs on social media, or even suggestions that the federal government plans one.

Authorities in Goa are examining Australia's law to study how to regulate minors' access to social media platforms, said Rohan Khaunte, the state's infotech minister.

"If possible, (we will) implement a similar ban on children below 16 for usage of social media," he told reporters this week. "Details will follow."

The southern state of Andhra Pradesh, with a population of more than 53 million, has said it is looking into similar measures. Goa by contrast, is the smallest state by area, with a population estimated at over 1.5 million.

India's IT ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Meta, Google and X also did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the plan.

Andhra Pradesh recently set up a panel of senior ministers to make recommendations within a month after studying such global regulation efforts, media said.

Last year, Australia became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, deactivating 4.7 million teen accounts in the first month.

France, Indonesia and Malaysia are among other countries watching the Australian rollout with a view to adopting similar laws.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:29:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQQC5IGD3VNB3DWMSPE6MJHKVQ.jpg?auth=5b35449a594d090dc1c1c0bb1542fb1093d5c0d2c87bbd4d3d6a907c6892605e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan bids farewell to last giant pandas as pair leave for China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japan-bids-farewell-last-giant-pandas-pair-leave-china-2026-01-27/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Japanese panda lovers bid an emotional farewell to the country's last two giant pandas, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei, as they left Tokyo's Ueno Zoo for China on Tuesday.

Spectators, braving the winter cold and some wearing panda hats and waving flags, held up their smartphones to record the moment as a truck carrying the zoo's star attractions left for Narita Airport.

The departure of the four-year-old twins for a breeding facility in China leaves Japan with no giant pandas for the first time in more than five decades.

Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei have been beloved by so many people, and so my feelings are complicated," said Ueno Zoo's director, Yutaka Fukuda. "I feel gratitude and also anticipation at the possibility of future breeding endeavours, but I also feel sadness at their departure."

While their move to China has been planned for some time, the pandas' departure has been viewed as a reflection of deteriorating China-Japan relations in recent months.

In November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response . That triggered a furious response from Beijing, which views the democratically governed island as its own territory.

China, in what has been called panda diplomacy, has a history of loaning out pandas to reward its allies, though it has sometimes taken them back to express displeasure. Native to China, giant pandas typically return home after the loan agreement ends - and cubs born overseas are no exception.

The twins were born in the zoo in June 2021 and have been its top draw since their parents departed in 2024.

Giant pandas first arrived in Japan from China in 1972 following the normalisation of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:57:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IPMPMUHZZZIUVPCCVAAJJIWFWM.jpg?auth=f5c9653fb62779f72d2dec0977892a652f979ccef326bb057b35c694e4402e7b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China calls for closer defence ties with Russia in ministers' talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-calls-closer-defence-ties-with-russia-ministers-talks-2026-01-27/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China's Defence Minister Dong Jun told his Russian counterpart on Tuesday that Beijing was willing to enhance strategic coordination with Moscow and jointly improve their capacity to respond to risks and challenges, state media reported.

The executive order establishing Golden Dome, signed on January 27, 2025, set an aggressive timetable to field a comprehensive homeland missile-defense system by 2028. A year later, however, the program has yet to spend much of the $25 billion appropriated last summer, as officials continue to debate fundamental elements of its space‑based architecture.

According to two U.S. officials, work to finalize the architecture of the missile defense shield is still underway, and large‑scale execution of funds has not begun. The money is available, the officials said, and significant amounts could be released in the coming days once key decisions are made.

“The Golden Dome office continues to meet the goals outlined in Executive Order," a Pentagon official said in response to Reuters' questions.

"The implementation plan and associated technologies are dynamic; however, the foundational elements of the architecture are now established. The specifics of architecture are classified.”

WEAPONS IN SPACE DEBATE

Golden Dome envisions expanding existing ground‑based defenses such as interceptor missiles, sensors and command‑and‑control systems while adding more experimental space‑based elements meant to detect, track and potentially counter incoming threats from orbit. These would include advanced satellite networks and still‑debated on‑orbit weaponry.

One source of delay has been internal debate over classified space‑based equipment, one of the officials said. A defense industry executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the systems under discussion likely involve communications standards. Another executive said they could be anti‑satellite capabilities, raising questions about how such weapons would align with a defensive missile shield.

The U.S. has historically opposed anti-satellite weapons over concerns about space debris, and criticized China in 2007 for conducting an anti-satellite missile test.

The space-based architecture remains one of the issues that must be decided before General Michael Guetlein, the program's director, can move forward with what is anticipated to be a series of procurement contracts for existing weaponry, the first U.S. official and industry executives said.

The Space Force awarded about a half dozen small-value Golden Dome contracts in November to build competing missile defense prototypes, including awards to Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) , opens new tab , True Anomaly, Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab and Anduril, sources previously told Reuters. Those contracts, valued around $120,000 each, represent the first tangible steps in a program Trump has said will eventually cost $175 billion.

Since December, there has been at least one classified briefing for defense companies on the architecture, the U.S. officials said.

Tom Karako, a weapons security expert at the Washington‑based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said much of the past year had been consumed by security reviews, staffing decisions and the approval of complex plans. He said the Golden Dome project was unlikely to be fully completed by 2028.

"There is a lot that can be done in the next three years in terms of better integrating what we already have, but there's no question that there will be things that will be implemented and evolve after 2028.”

Another unresolved issue surrounding Golden Dome is the role Greenland could play.

Trump has recently linked U.S. control of the Danish territory to the missile defense initiative, repeatedly saying that acquiring Greenland is “vital” to the project. Defense experts note, however, that existing agreements already allow expanded U.S. military operations on the island. One U.S. official said Greenland is not part of Golden Dome’s proposed architecture.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:29:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BFTJAXSVHJMDZKU2AVLHYI34UQ.jpg?auth=dab5b28b8f261133d9158594610c003ea124980a7f18bbcfa518d0cde05d51b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany plans crackdown on far-left militants after Berlin power grid attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-plans-crackdown-far-left-militants-after-berlin-power-grid-attack-2026-01-27/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Germany will step up efforts to fight left-wing militants after activists claimed responsibility for an attack on a power station in January that caused the longest electricity blackout in Berlin since World War Two, the interior minister said.

"Our security agencies will be significantly reinforced in the fight against left-wing extremism," the minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said on Tuesday.

He added that 1 million euros was on offer for information leading to the perpetrators of the January attack, which was suspected to have been carried out by a far-left activist organisation called the Volcano group. The incident left 45,000 households without power in freezing temperatures.

Germany's domestic intelligence agency will devote more staff to left-wing militancy, Dobrindt said, adding that new legislation is being prepared to expand the digital investigative powers of security authorities. The measures would cover automated data analysis, biometric facial recognition and the storage of IP addresses.

In its latest report, the domestic intelligence agency said left-wing motivated crime was up 38% in 2024 although the number of leftist violent crimes had fallen by 27%.

Dobrindt said the move, as well as a planned law to protect critical infrastructure, would not lead to a reduction in the fight against other forms of radicalism.

"We have had a lot of success with a right-wing extremism, Islamist terrorism ..

One is a spindly stick about 80 centimetres long that could have been used for digging in the mud. The other is a smaller, more mysterious handheld chunk of willow or poplar wood that may have been used to shape stone tools, according to research published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Scientists think ancient humans wielded a whole litany of tools made from stone, bone and wood. But it's particularly difficult to find evidence of wooden tools today because wood rots so quickly. Such tools are only preserved in specific environments like in ice, caves or underwater.

The newest tools, found in Greece's Megalopolis basin, were possibly buried quickly by sediment and preserved by a wet environment over time. For years, researchers have found other remnants at the site, including stone tools and elephant bones with cuts on them. While scientists didn't directly date the wooden tools, the site is about 430,000 years old, which provides insight into the objects' age.

“I’ve always just been thrilled to be able to touch these objects," said study author Annemieke Milks with the University of Reading.

Human remains haven't been found at the site yet, so it's not yet clear who used the tools. The owners could have been Neanderthals, early human ancestors or someone else.

The site in Greece probably has more gems from the past that are waiting to be found, said archaeologist Jarod Hutson with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. But the unassuming appearance of these two new tools makes them harder to interpret.

“It’s difficult to get excited about these because they don’t strike you immediately as wooden tools. And we don’t know what they were used for,” said Hutson, who was not involved with the new study.

Other examples of ancient wooden tools include a set of spears from Germany and 300,000-year-old Chinese digging sticks that may have been used to harvest plants.

The new find offers a rare look into the varied collection of tools used to survive – a glimpse at a “little known aspect of the technology of early humans”, study author Katerina Harvati with the University of Tübingen said in an email.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:37:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8b9e148c-fb6a-11f0-a6a1-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026669508001.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Suspected Boko Haram militants kill seven Nigerian soldiers, capture 13, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/suspected-boko-haram-militants-kill-seven-nigerian-soldiers-capture-13-sources-2026-01-27/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Suspected Boko Haram militants killed seven Nigerian soldiers and captured 13 others including their commanding officer on Monday in northeastern Borno state, two security sources said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:52:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran summons Italian ambassador over push for EU clampdown on Revolutionary Guards, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-summons-italian-ambassador-over-push-eu-clampdown-revolutionary-guards-2026-01-27/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Iran's foreign ministry summoned Italy's ambassador over Rome's efforts to place the Revolutionary Guards on the European Union's terrorist register , state media reported on Tuesday.

The clashes pitting government forces against fighters loyal to the Sudan People’s Liberation Army‑in‑Opposition (SPLA‑IO) are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017, according to the United Nations.

The government said its forces had repelled rebel advances in Jonglei, which stretches from the border with Ethiopia to central South Sudan.

“The ongoing security operation in Northern Jonglei State is a lawful and necessary measure aimed at halting the advance of rebel forces, restoring public order, and safeguarding civilians,” information minister and government spokesperson Ateny Wek Ateny said in a statement.

"The Government calls upon the SPLM/A in Opposition to immediately cease hostilities... Any actions that undermine the (2018) Agreement pose a serious threat to peace and jeopardize the ongoing transitional process," he added.

South Sudan's military on Sunday ordered all civilians and personnel from the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and other charities to evacuate three counties in Jonglei ahead of its operation against opposition forces.

A spokesman for the U.N. Secretary‑General Antonio Guterres said the mission had shared concerns that the fighting could put hundreds of thousands of civilians at risk.

"The mission also warns that escalating hate speech is fuelling ethnic tensions and risks drawing civilian communities into the conflict," the spokesman said.

UNMISS on Sunday said at least 180,000 people in Jonglei had already been displaced by the fighting.

The 2013-18 civil war between President Salva Kiir's forces and those loyal to his vice president, Riek Machar, was fought along largely ethnic lines and cost about 400,000 lives.

Machar is currently on trial for treason after an ethnic militia with historic ties to the SPLA-IO overran an army base in the northeastern town of Nasir last year.

He has denied the charges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:55:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, US, Germany and France urge adherence to ceasefire in Syria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uk-us-germany-france-urge-adherence-ceasefire-syria-2026-01-27/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 27 - Britain, the United States, France and Germany on Tuesday welcomed the 15-day extension of the ceasefire between the Syrian government and Kurdish forces, and urged all parties to strictly adhere to the agreement.

Thousands of kits, including pencils, exercise books and wooden cubes to play with, have now entered the enclave, UNICEF said.

"We have now, in the last days, got in thousands of recreational kits, hundreds of school-in-a-carton kits. We're looking at getting 2,500 more school kits in, in the next week, because they've been approved," UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said.

COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows into the Gaza Strip, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Children in Gaza have faced an unprecedented assault on the education system, as well as restrictions on the entry of some aid materials, including school books and pencils, meaning teachers had to make do with limited resources, while children tried to study at night in tents without lights, Elder said.

During the conflict some children missed out on education altogether, facing basic challenges like finding water, as well as widespread malnutrition , amid a major humanitarian crisis.

"It's been a long two years for children and for organizations like UNICEF to try and do that education without those materials. It looks like we're finally seeing a real change," Elder stated.

UNICEF is scaling up its education to support half of children of school age - around 336,000 - with learning support. Teaching will mainly happen in tents, Elder said, due to widespread devastation of school buildings in the enclave during the war which was triggered by Hamas' assault on Israel on October 2023.

At least 97% of schools sustained some level of damage, according to the most recent satellite assessment by the U.N. in July.

Israel has previously accused Hamas and other militant groups of systematically embedding in civilian areas and structures, including schools, and using civilians as human shields.

The bulk of the learning spaces supported by UNICEF will be in central and southern areas of the enclave, as it remains difficult to operate in the north, parts of which were badly destroyed in the final months of the conflict, Elder said.

The Hamas-led attack in October 2023 killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 Palestinians, Gaza's health authorities say. More than 20,000 children were reported killed, including 110 since the October 10 ceasefire last year, UNICEF said, citing official data.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:56:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V2IWSTFNMZIETEANVTHADUBOEE.jpg?auth=895a53bf2319b48082a0abe12d9a0810239c34fb036732b428eaadc3bf898337&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia PM Albanese visits East Timor to discuss security, gas</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/australia-pm-albanese-visits-east-timor-discuss-security-gas-2026-01-27/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will flag Australia's desire for deeper security and energy ties when he addresses East Timor's parliament on Wednesday, in his first visit to the northern neighbour as leader.

The visit comes as the tiny Catholic nation, also courted by China, continues to push to build a liquefied natural gas plant on its south coast, instead of the Australian city of Darwin.

Albanese will address East Timor's parliament and meet its President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao.

According to excerpts of his speech shared in advance, Albanese will recall cooperation between Timorese and Australian soldiers during the World War Two as an example of the history and values that make the two nations friends.

"We look towards a shared future. A new deeper partnership in security, in energy and economic resilience," he is expected to tell the parliament.

Ramos-Horta said last month he was confident a major gas project would be developed with Australia after decades of delays.

Australia's Woodside Energy (WDS.AX) , opens new tab and East Timor agreed in December to study a 5 million metric ton project at the Greater Sunrise fields, an area containing an estimated 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas that Australia has been discussing, initially with Indonesia, since the 1980s.

The national oil company Timor Gap holds more than 56% of the field located about 140 km (87 miles) south of East Timor and more than 400 km from Darwin.

With a population of 1.4 million people, East Timor became a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in October and is seeking to build its fragile economy.

East Timor signed a strategic agreement with China in 2023 for infrastructure and development, which Ramos-Horta has previously said did not cover military cooperation.

Australia has been East Timor's largest aid and security partner since its independence from Indonesia in 2002, supported by Australian peacekeepers.

China's assertiveness in efforts to form security ties with developing countries in close proximity to Australia have raised alarm bells in Canberra, and a shake-up of Australia's defence has refocused on protecting its northern approaches.

East Timor is around 700 km (450 miles) north-west of Australia.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:56:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LURQF3VZYVLXPNU6XK75KYUAJM.jpg?auth=3dca36a16a6fd7a2774454c14104cb4fc7184544e6b7ddf758442679a10ea541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Honduras' Asfura to take office after razor-thin election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-asfura-take-office-after-razor-thin-election-2026-01-27/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Conservative politician and businessman Nasry Asfura will be sworn in as president of Honduras on Tuesday after a closely fought election marred by allegations of fraud and political tension fueled by U.S. interference .

Asfura, 67, will serve a four-year term until January 2030. He has pledged to fight poverty, corruption and crime, and to revive the economy in one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.

He also pledged to restore diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which were severed by outgoing President Xiomara Castro in 2023. Such a move would be a major diplomatic setback for China in Central America.

A former mayor of Tegucigalpa from 2014 to 2022, Asfura will be inaugurated after months of electoral chaos in Honduras, fueled by a last-minute endorsement from U.S. President Donald Trump, a deeply troubled vote-counting process and a razor-thin victory of 26,000 votes over centrist candidate Salvador Nasralla .

Washington said in recent days it aimed to begin negotiations "as soon as possible" on a bilateral trade agreement with Honduras.

Still, Asfura enters office facing a delicate balancing act. While his party holds a simple majority, he will need the support of rival parties - including those that alleged voter fraud - in order to ratify international treaties or amend the constitution.

Asfura campaigned on a message of "work and more work," promising to attract investment, create jobs and impose austerity in government spending. He is expected to emphasize that agenda in his inaugural address on Tuesday.

"In Honduras, everything is urgent," said political analyst Luis Leon in Tegucigalpa. "But two issues will determine whether people feel the government is responding: public health and investment to generate jobs."

Last year, government health workers went on strike for nearly a month to protest overdue pay as well as shortages of medicines and supplies.

Iran's currency, the rial, meanwhile fell to a record low of 1.5 million to $1.

The arrival of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and guided missile destroyers accompanying it provide the US the ability to strike Iran, particularly as Gulf Arab states have signalled they want to stay out of any attack despite hosting American military personnel.

Two Iranian-backed militias in the Middle East have signalled their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran after US President Donald Trump threatened military action over the killing of peaceful protesters or Tehran launching mass executions in the wake of the demonstrations.

Iran has repeatedly threatened to drag the region into a war, though its air defence and military are still reeling after the June war launched by Israel against the country. But the pressure on its economy may spark new unrest as everyday goods slowly go out of reach of its people.

Tuesday's new figures came from the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran. The group verifies each death with a network of activists on the ground in Iran.

It identified the dead as including at least 5,777 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 86 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating. The crackdown has seen over 41,800 arrests, it added.

Monitors and human rights groups have struggled to assess the death toll given authorities cutting off the internet and disrupting calls into the Islamic Republic.

Iran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labelled the rest “terrorists”. In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.

That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution .

The protests in Iran began on December 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two weeks of internet blackout – the most comprehensive in its history.

Iran’s UN ambassador told a UN Security Council meeting late Monday that Trump’s repeated threats to use military force against the country “are neither ambiguous nor misinterpreted”. Amir Saeid Iravani also repeated allegations that the US leader incited violence by “armed terrorist groups” supported by the United States and Israel , but gave no evidence to support his claims.

Iranian state media has tried to accuse forces abroad for the protests as the theocracy remains broadly unable to address the country's ailing economy, which is still squeezed by international sanctions, particularly over its nuclear program.

On Tuesday, exchange shops offered the record-low rial-to-dollar rate in Tehran.

Already, Iran has vastly limited its subsidised currency rates to cut down on corruption. It also has offered the equivalent of $7 a month to most people in the country to cover rising costs. However, Iran's people have seen the rial fall from 32,000 to $1 just a decade ago – which has devoured the value of their savings.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:52:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3348bccc-fb85-11f0-83c1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26012611948846.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain to pay $24 million in compensation to victims of high-speed train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-pay-24-million-compensation-victims-high-speed-train-crash-2026-01-27/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Spain will pay out 20 million euros ($24 million) in compensation to the victims of last week's high-speed train crash that killed 45 people and left more than 150 injured, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said on Tuesday.

The nation is still reeling from the January 18 disaster in Adamuz near the southern city of Cordoba that caused one of the highest death tolls from a train crash in recent European history and the highest in Spain since 2013.

The families of those killed will receive 216,000 euros each within no more than three months, made up of 72,000 euros in tax-exempt aid from the government and an advance insurance payment of 72,000 euros. Another 72,000 euros will be paid from passengers' mandatory travel insurance.

"We know that ordinary procedures and legal timelines do not always respond to the vital urgency of a tragedy like this," Puente said, adding that victims could not afford to wait years to receive support.

"Economic uncertainty cannot be compounded on top of the emotional pain."

Payments to those injured will range from 2,400 euros to 84,000 euros, according to Puente.

The minister has come under public pressure since the Adamuz crash and other incidents that same week, including the death of a train driver in Catalonia and two other accidents without fatalities. The main opposition People's Party has demanded his resignation.

Asked about his future, Puente told reporters he had a calm conscience, performing his job to the best of his abilities and making every effort to communicate all available information to citizens.

Catalan commuter rail service Rodalies also faced heavy disruptions last week after many drivers refused to work over safety concerns, leaving thousands stranded, while a software failure collapsed its train traffic control centre on Monday.

European countries are in the midst of hiking defence spending , under pressure to do so by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and unnerved by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"These are weapons that can reach far behind enemy lines... this is decisive in modern warfare," Peter Froelich, the defence policy spokesperson for the opposition Conservatives, told parliament on Tuesday.

Norwegian daily Aftenposten, citing anonymous sources, on January 24 reported that the government has selected South Korean defence contractor Hanwha Aerospace's (012450.KS) , opens new tab Chunmoo artillery system, beating U.S. Lockheed Martin's (LMT.N) , opens new tab HIMARS.

Some members of Norway's parliament have said the Nordic country should help develop a European missile alternative, but this has been dismissed as too time-consuming and costly by government officials charged with making the selection.

The South Korean system met all requirements set by Norway for the ground-based artillery, including the ability to fire at a range of up to 500 km (310 miles), and had the quickest delivery time, according to the Aftenposten report.

Norway's defence ministry, which is expected to soon announce the contract winner, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ministry has said it plans to acquire 16 launch systems along with an undisclosed number of rockets for a total cost of 19.5 billion crowns ($2.0 billion).

Hanwha Aerospace last year signed an agreement with Polish defence company WB Electronics to form a joint venture producing missiles in Poland, including for the Chunmoo rocket artillery, ensuring manufacturing on European soil.

Niscemi, a town of about 25,000 in south-central Sicily, sits on a plateau that authorities say is gradually collapsing toward the plain below. More than 1,500 people have had to be evacuated.

Buildings were overhanging the edge after large sections of the slope gave way. A car was left with its front end poking into the chasm.

"Let's be clear: there are homes on the edge of the landslide that are uninhabitable," the civil protection head Fabio Ciciliano told reporters in Niscemi, saying residents from the affected areas would be permanently relocated.

"Once the water has drained away and the moving section has stopped or slowed, a more accurate assessment will be made ... The landslide is still active," he added.

On Monday, the Italian government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni declared a state of emergency for Sicily, Sardinia and Calabria, the three southern regions battered by the violent storm last week.

Extreme weather events have become more frequent in Italy in recent years. Floods have devastated cities across the country, killing dozens of people and amplifying risks of landslides and floods also in historically less exposed areas.

The administration set aside 100 million euros ($119 million) for the initial needs of the areas worst hit by the recent storm. But local authorities estimate damage at over 1 billion euros after powerful winds and waves pushed the sea inland overwhelming coastal defences, destroying homes and businesses.

In Niscemi, the sudden evacuations have fuelled anxiety and anger among residents, some of whom say earlier landslides went unaddressed.

"I have been told that I have to leave, even though I don’t have anything (collapse) in the house or underneath," Francesco Zarba said.

"We had the first landslide 30 years ago, and no one ever did anything."

European travel to the United States has dipped since President Donald Trump's election in November 2024, with many tourists deterred by greater scrutiny at border crossings.

Although a recent rise in violence tied to ICE detentions in the city of Minneapolis has amplified fears among some, data from World Cup watchers and Amadeus show that bookings are up, particularly among England and Scotland fans.

Of the bookings made for the time frame of the tournament, which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 37% were in the month since the draw.

However, the data does not show whether more recent immigration raids in the U.S. have had an impact on 2026 bookings. And a major sports event does not guarantee a travel boost to the host country, as shown by the 2024 Paris Olympics .

"The tournament is a chance to see the most talented football players in the world and fans will go almost anywhere to watch the finest, whatever the policies and politics of the host country," said travel analyst Paul Charles.

"However, safety is a key factor too, so visitors will be hoping that calm prevails in host cities and that their travel insurance will remain valid for their planned trips in June and July," added Charles, who is CEO of consultancy The PC Agency.

The largest spike of bookings per day was seen for the first match in New York City between Brazil and Morocco, with over 2,500 flight bookings, the Amadeus data shows.

Hotel bookings in Canada and Mexico have also risen, with the average occupancy of hotels in Mexico City on the nights ahead of three planned matches there at 21%, up from 4% for the same time last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:30:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AKNC3K7RX5LUPDT32NBLISNKKY.jpg?auth=53f95d8490ff714f9a7181f20c821795e8318312cb8541664854bd40e53c1f57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria hopes to hold new integration talks with Kurdish forces on Tuesday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-hopes-hold-new-integration-talks-with-kurdish-forces-tuesday-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Syrian government hopes to hold new round of integration talks with Kurdish forces as early as today, a Syrian government official told Reuters on Tuesday.

"We call upon all parties to strictly adhere to the ceasefire ‍and to exercise their ​utmost restraint. We urge all external parties to join ‌us in pursuit of peace and de-escalation ‍of violence," the four nations said in a joint statement published by the UK government.

The joint statement was released following a meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot , British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, German Minister of State Serap Guler, and US special envoy Tom Barrack.

Syria's government and Kurdish forces on Saturday extended a truce by 15 days after the Kurds lost large areas to government forces during weeks of clashes.

Days later, France, Germany, UK and the US called on "all parties to swiftly agree to a permanent ceasefire, and to resume as soon as possible negotiations aiming at the peaceful and sustainable integration of northeast Syria into a unitary and sovereign state that effectively respects and protects the rights of all its citizens".

The statement came as the ‍Syrian ​government on Tuesday said it hopes ⁠to hold new round of integration talks with ​Kurdish ‍forces as ​early as today, an official told Reuters.

The talks would focus on practical ‍ways to implement ​the ceasefire agreement mediated by the US, the official said. ‍

The recent clashes between Syria's military and Kurdish forces are a "setback" and a "plot" to derail the PKK peace process with Turkey , a spokesman for the Kurdish militant group told AFP on Tuesday.

"The developments in Syria and the larger Middle East have a direct effect on the peace process in Turkey," said Zagros Hiwa, spokesman for the political wing of the Kurdistan Workers' Party.

The attacks "against the Kurds are a plot and conspiracy against the peace process and they indicate a setback in the process", he said.

Following the SDF's recent loss of territory to Syria's government, the Kurdish forces in Syria find themselves now restricted to Kurdish-majority areas in the country's north.

Turkey is a close ally of Syria's new leadership that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, and which is now seeking to extend state control across Syria.

Ankara is simultaneously leading a drive to reach a settlement with the PKK – listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies.

Last year, the PKK said it was ending its four-decade insurgency in favour of democratic means but the process has largely stalled amid the stand-off in Syria.

Turkey accuses the Syrian Kurdish forces of being an offshoot of the PKK.

Hiwa said the PKK's "commitment to the peace process is a strategic issue".

But he added that "the new strategy does not exclude the urgency of self-defence against genocidal attacks".</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:31:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8bb9b436-fb87-11f0-8278-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026644019210.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Human trafficker who tortured migrants in Libya jailed for 20 years in Netherlands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/human-trafficker-who-tortured-migrants-libya-jailed-20-years-netherlands-2026-01-27/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - An Eritrean people trafficker who tortured African refugees and migrants in camps in Libya was jailed for 20 years on Tuesday by a Dutch court, with a judge saying he had "no regard for human dignity".

Judges said 42-year-old Amanuel Walid - known as Tewelde Goitom - ran a migration route to Europe via Libya. He was convicted on charges of membership of a criminal organisation, human trafficking and extortion.

Prosecutors, whose investigation focused on the period between 2014 and 2019, said Walid's group detained thousands of African migrants in warehouses and tortured them to extort ransoms from their families.

"You and your co-perpetrators have treated (migrants) in a ruthless and merciless manner with no regard for human dignity and this, it seems, only to extort as much money as possible from vulnerable and helpless people seeking a better future," presiding judge Rene Melaard said.

During his trial Walid, who was extradited to the Netherlands in 2022, only spoke to tell judges he was the victim of mistaken identity and to invoke his right to remain silent. Judges ruled on Tuesday that the man in the dock was Walid.

The trial is the largest human trafficking case ever in the Netherlands and one of the few in Europe looking into criminal networks trafficking migrants through Libya.

Since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi during a NATO-backed uprising in 2011, Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the Mediterranean.

Under the concept of universal jurisdiction, Dutch law broadly allows cases to be brought against foreign nationals for crimes committed abroad if the victims are in the Netherlands.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:02:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK prosecutors charge former lawmaker Conor McGinn with sexual assault</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-prosecutors-charge-former-lawmaker-conor-mcginn-with-sexual-assault-2026-01-27/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - British prosecutors on Tuesday charged a former Labour Party member of parliament, Conor McGinn, with one count of sexual assault, following a police investigation into an alleged incident in July 2022.

McGinn, 41, was suspended as a Labour member of parliament in 2022 following a formal complaint and then sat as an independent MP until 2024 when he stood down from parliament at a national election.

McGinn could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the allegation of sexual assault was made by a woman in 2022, and prosecutors had determined there was sufficient evidence to bring a charge.

Jessica Walker, deputy chief crown prosecutor of CPS London South, said it was in the public interest to do so.

McGinn is expected to appear in court next month.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:02:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration sued over 2 deaths in boat strike off Venezuela's coast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-sued-over-2-deaths-boat-strike-off-venezuelas-coast-2026-01-27/</link><description>BOSTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Family members of two men killed in a U.S. missile strike against a suspected drug boat near Venezuela filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Tuesday, alleging the pair were murdered in a "manifestly unlawful" military campaign targeting civilian vessels.

Civil rights lawyers filed the lawsuit in Boston's federal court, marking the first court challenge to one of the 36 U.S. missile strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean authorized by President Donald Trump's administration that have killed more than 120 people since September.

Family members of Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo—two Trinidadian men who were among six killed during an October 14 strike —in the lawsuit say the two men did fishing and farm work in Venezuela and had been returning to their homes in Las Cuevas, Trinidad when they were attacked.

"These are lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theater, which is why we need a court of law to proclaim what is true and constrain what is lawless," Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement.

His group and the American Civil Liberties Union filed the novel lawsuit under the Death on the High Seas Act, a maritime law that allows family members to sue for wrongful deaths occurring on the high seas, and the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law that allows foreign citizens to sue in U.S. courts for violations of international law.

The lawsuit was filed by Lenore Burnley, Joseph's mother, and Sallycar Korasingh, Samaroo's sister, and seeks only damages from the U.S. government for the two deaths, not an injunction that would prevent further strikes.

But the case could provide an avenue for a court to assess whether the October 14 strike was legal.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has framed the attacks carried out under U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's direction as a war with drug cartels, alleging they were armed groups. It has said its attacks comply with international rules known as the law of war or the law of armed conflict.

But the attacks have drawn scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans in Congress, which has not authorized attacks on the drug cartels, and condemnation from human rights groups. Legal experts have previously said the drug cartels do not fit the accepted international definition of an armed group.

Tuesday's lawsuit argues that the killing of Joseph and Samaroo outside of an armed conflict, while they were not taking part in military hostilities against the U.S. amounted to murder and should be deemed a wrongful death on the high seas and an extrajudicial killing under international law.

"If the U.S. government believed Rishi had done anything wrong, it should have arrested, charged, and detained him, not murdered him," Korasingh said in a statement. "They must be held accountable."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:53:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3BMUUAABTBOHJC5Y6UTR73HCE4.jpg?auth=a06fbde127a5bee7b0a2156990e63177fda4d4fe84bac927f5a6520b0a7ef3f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Atomic scientists set 'Doomsday Clock' closer to midnight than ever</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/atomic-scientists-set-doomsday-clock-closer-midnight-than-ever-2026-01-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Atomic scientists set their "Doomsday Clock" on Tuesday closer than ever to midnight, citing aggressive behavior by nuclear powers Russia , China and the United States , fraying nuclear arms control, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and AI worries among factors driving risks for global disaster.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the clock to 85 seconds before midnight, the theoretical point of annihilation. That is four seconds closer than it was set last year. The Chicago-based nonprofit created the clock in 1947 during the Cold War tensions that followed World War Two to warn the public about how close humankind was to destroying the world.

The scientists voiced concern about threats of unregulated integration of artificial intelligence into military systems and its potential misuse in aiding the creation of biological threats, as well as AI's role in spreading disinformation globally. They also noted continuing challenges posed by climate change.

"Of course, the Doomsday Clock is about global risks, and what we have seen is a global failure in leadership," nuclear policy expert Alexandra Bell, the Bulletin's president and CEO, told Reuters. "No matter the government, a shift towards neo-imperialism and an Orwellian approach to governance will only serve to push the clock toward midnight."

It was the third time in the past four years that the scientists moved the clock closer to midnight.

"In terms of nuclear risks, nothing in 2025 trended in the right direction," Bell said. "Longstanding diplomatic frameworks are under duress or collapsing, the threat of explosive nuclear testing has returned, proliferation concerns are growing, and there were three military operations taking place under the shadow of nuclear weapons and the associated escalatory threat. The risk of nuclear use is unsustainably and unacceptably high."

Bell pointed to Russia's continued war in Ukraine , the U.S. and Israeli bombing of Iran and border clashes between India and Pakistan . Bell also cited continuing tensions in Asia including on the Korean Peninsula and China's threats toward Taiwan , as well as rising tensions in the Western Hemisphere since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office 12 months ago.

The last remaining nuclear arms pact between the United States and Russia, the New START treaty , expires on February 5. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that the two countries agree to observe for another year the limits set under the pact, which caps each side's number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550. Trump has not formally responded. Western security analysts are divided about the wisdom of accepting Putin's offer.

Trump in October ordered the U.S. military to restart the process for testing nuclear weapons after a halt of more than three decades. No nuclear power, other than North Korea most recently in 2017, has conducted explosive nuclear testing in more than a quarter century.

No country would benefit more from a full-scale return to such testing than China, given its continued push to expand its nuclear arsenal, according to Bell, a former senior official at the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability.

Trump has upended the world order . He sent U.S. forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, threatened other Latin American countries, vowed to restore U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere, talked about annexing Greenland and imperiled transatlantic security cooperation.

Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and there is no end in sight. Among the weapons Russia has used is the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile . Russia released video in December of what it said was the deployment of the Oreshnik in Belarus, a move meant to boost the Russian ability to strike targets across Europe.

"Russia, China, the United States and other major countries have become increasingly aggressive and nationalistic," Bell said.

Their "winner-takes-all great power competition" undermines the international cooperation needed to reduce risks of nuclear war, climate change, misuse of biotechnology, potential AI-related hazards and other apocalyptic dangers, Bell said.

Bell also cited Trump's domestic actions against science, academia, the civil service and news organizations.

Maria Ressa, a 2021 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for her journalistic efforts exposing abuses of power in the Philippines including how social media platforms were used to spread disinformation, participated in the announcement.

"We are living through an information Armageddon - the crisis beneath all crises - driven by extractive and predatory technology that spreads lies faster than facts and profits from our division," Ressa said in a statement.

Spain's economic growth has by far outpaced most European peers in the past two years, at least in part boosted by an openness to immigration that has dynamised key sectors like hospitality and care, and bolstered the welfare state.

Migration Minister Elma Saiz told a news conference irregular migrants who have lived in Spain for at least five months as of the end of 2025 and have no criminal record, as well as those who had applied for asylum before the end of the year, would be eligible for the accelerated residence permit.

Some 500,000 people, mostly from Latin America, stand to benefit from the measure, according to government estimates.

The permit will be valid for a year - or five in the case of children -- and renewable. After 10 years, the migrants could become citizens, or even quicker if they are from Latin America countries or refugees.

"We are strengthening a migration model based on human rights and integration, compatible with economic growth and social cohesion," Saiz told reporters, noting that economists across the region have attributed Spain's falling unemployment and strong growth in part to its openness to migrants.

Research from think tank Funcas suggests that around 840,000 people, a third of all non-EU migrants in Spain, were undocumented at the start of last year, a sharp increase from eight years ago when the figure stood at roughly 100,000.

A citizen-backed proposal to legalise undocumented migrants signed by 700,000 people and backed by 900 rights groups and the Catholic Church was filed over a year ago, but stalled in parliament, where disputes with splinter parties across the political spectrum have crippled the government's ability to approve legislation.

In its current form, the decree can be enacted by the cabinet within a few weeks' time without parliamentary approval. Conservative opposition leader Alberto Nuñez Feijoo has vowed to overturn the government's migratory policies if his party wins the next election, taking place at the latest next year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:54:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudan's army says it breaks siege of southern city, survivors recount hunger and death</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-army-says-it-breaks-siege-southern-city-survivors-recount-hunger-death-2026-01-27/</link><description>AL-OBEID, Sudan, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Sudan's army says it has broken a long siege of the southern city of al-Dalanj by RSF paramilitary forces, during which survivors said many people were killed in drone and artillery strikes as hunger spread and medicines became scarce.

One survivor told Reuters that residents had been reduced to eating leaves and animal skin, and that some children had died of hunger. Others said people had died because they could not get the medicines they needed or leave to get treatment.

The siege of al-Dalanj began soon after war broke out in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). It intensified after the RSF joined forces last year with the SPLM-N, a rebel group that controls territory in the region.

In a statement released late on Monday, the Sudanese army said "the armed forces and supporting forces were able to forcibly and decisively open the road to Al-Dalanj, after carrying out a successful military operation."

The RSF did not respond to a request for comment on the army statement. Residents of al-Dalanj reported heavy drone attacks on Tuesday.

The victory, if sustained could signal a momentum shift after several RSF gains late last year.

Al-Dalanj is one of the largest cities in oil-producing South Kordofan province on Sudan's southern border. Greater Kordofan has become the latest centre of fighting since the RSF captured al-Fashir , the army's last holdout in the western Darfur region, in October.

More than 25,000 people have been displaced from South Kordofan since then, according to the UN's human rights office.

During a visit to Sudan last week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights warned Sudanese and RSF officials to ensure that "crimes" committed during and after the takeover of al-Fashir "are not repeated" in South Kordofan, according to a statement.

Residents who fled al-Dalanj before Monday described witnessing drone and artillery attacks, echoing accounts from al-Fashir during the RSF siege. Reuters was unable immediately to confirm their accounts.

"We left because of the hunger and humiliation," said Haja Bahareldin, who spoke to Reuters with other women sheltering in a camp outside the city of al-Obeid to the north. "We couldn't find work... we couldn't find food."

She said one of her children died of hunger along the way and her two twins died after her arrival.

"Now I have no small child to carry in my arms," she said.

The Kordofan towns of al-Obeid and Kadugli have also been the scene of intense recent fighting. In Kadugli, while drone attacks have eased in recent days, the siege has caused sky-high prices and a scarcity of medicine as doctors flee along with others who can afford to, aid workers say.

In November, Kadugli was declared by international monitors to be in famine. International experts said al-Dalanj was likely to be experiencing the same, though the siege made data-gathering impossible.

Tambula Silia, another woman from al-Dalanj, said residents of the city had been reduced to eating leaves and animal skin and added: "For four or five months I didn't have a single piece of bread for me or my child."

Zakia Ramadan, who said she fled to al-Dalanj from the nearby town of Habila after the RSF took it, said four of her children had died of hunger while sheltering there.

Salma Mohamed, a resident of al-Dalanj, told Reuters it had been impossible to get her father out of the city when he needed a heart operation.

"We had to roam around until he died, we didn't find a way to get him treatment," she said.

Those who do manage to flee face a dangerous journey, also mirroring the stories of those who fled al-Fashir . Silia said that, among those who fled with her from al-Dalanj, "some were taken by the RSF and we don't know where to."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:54:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sheinbaum does not deny report Mexico halted oil shipment to Cuba</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sheinbaum-does-not-deny-report-mexico-halted-oil-shipment-cuba-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday did not deny a media report that Mexico had halted a crude oil shipment to Cuba, saying that Mexico's oil shipments were a sovereign decision.

The closed town of Severomorsk, the headquarters of Russia's Northern Fleet on the Barents Sea's Kola Bay, is home to Russia's most important naval command. It controls Russia's biggest fleet of ballistic missile submarines and extensive arsenals of nuclear warheads, missiles and repair yards.

Andrei Chibis, the governor of the wider Murmansk region, said on Tuesday that power had been restored to Severomorsk. Electricity supplies were cut to the northern city of Murmansk and Severomorsk on January 23.

Five pylons, two of them almost 60 years old, collapsed about 7 km (4 miles) from Murmansk on January 23, according to local media. Two dated from 1966, two from 1982, and one from 1988, according to the Severomorsk online news site.

Russia's so-called "closed towns," usually around major defence or nuclear installations, have much stricter controls than most other places. Entry is controlled and special permissions are needed to visit.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:55:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria rescues 11 kidnap victims in late-night operation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-rescues-11-kidnap-victims-late-night-operation-2026-01-27/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Nigerian army said on Tuesday it had rescued 11 kidnapping victims during a late-night operation along the Kaduna–Abuja highway, thwarting an attempt by armed militants to move the captives through a forested area under the cover of darkness.

The five men, three women and three children had been held for 92 days after being abducted from the Gada Mallam Maman community in Kaduna state in October.

Troops from forward operating base Doka detected the group on January 26 using long-range surveillance equipment, the army said in a statement. Soldiers moved in after spotting the kidnappers escorting their victims along a bush track.

Kidnappings for ransom have become a major security challenge in northwestern and central Nigeria, including along the Kaduna–Abuja expressway, a major transport corridor linking the commercial capital with the federal capital territory.

Nigeria's security situation is under scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump who launched a Christmas Day airstrike over what he says is persecution of Christians. Last week, armed bandits kidnapped more than 160 worshippers from two churches in Kaduna.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:55:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>FIFA's ex-chief Sepp Blatter joins calls to boycott World Cup over Trump policies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-fifa-ex-president-sepp-blatter-joins-calls-boycott-us-world-cup-over-trump-policies</link><description>"For the fans, there's only one piece of advice: stay away from the USA!" Blatter wrote in a post on social media platform X.

Blatter called for the boycott in a post quoting comments by Swiss attorney Mark Pieth, an attorney specialising in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund. Pieth chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago.

Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.

In his interview, Pieth said warned of the dangers of travelling to the United States.

“If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA ! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”

Blatter quoted Pieth and added: “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup .”

The United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.

The international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland , and travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protesters in American cities.

Blatter's statement comes days after US citizen Alex Pretti was shot by ICE agents in Minneapolis .

Oke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.

Travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray in December, when the Trump administration announced an expanded ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.

Fans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:56:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/de15c92c-fb91-11f0-93e3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Sepp-Blatter.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge orders ICE chief to appear 'personally' in court, threatens contempt</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-us-judge-orders-ice-chief-to-appear-personally-in-court-threatens-contempt</link><description>The chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.

In a brief order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.

“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” the judge wrote.

The order comes a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the second death this month of person at the hands of an immigration law enforcement officer.

It also follows a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to order a halt to the immigration law enforcement surge. The judge said she was prioritising the ruling but didn't give a timeline.

Schlitz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” Schlitz wrote.

“Respondents have continually assured the Court that they recognise their obligation to comply with Court orders, and that they have taken steps to ensure that those orders will be honoured going forward,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, though, the violations continue.”

Messages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.

The order lists the petitioner by first name and last initials: Juan T.R. It says the court granted a petition on January 14 from the person to provide him with a bond hearing within seven days. On January 23, the person’s lawyers told the court the petitioner remained detained.

The order says Schlitz will cancel Lyons’ appearance if the petitioner is released from custody.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:56:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f30d28e0-fb8f-11f0-835c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ICE-Todd-Lyons.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge threatens ICE chief with contempt, orders court appearance</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-threatens-ice-chief-with-contempt-orders-court-appearance-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - The chief judge of Minnesota's federal court ordered the acting chief of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in court on Friday to personally explain why that agency has not complied with dozens of court orders in recent weeks.

In a filing late Monday, Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz said acting ICE director Todd Lyons must explain why he should not be held in contempt after his agency missed a deadline to provide a detainee with a bond hearing.

"This court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result," Schiltz wrote. "The court’s patience is at an end."

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. Schiltz said he will cancel Friday's hearing if the detainee is released. The judge, who sits in Minneapolis, was appointed to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush.

Schiltz's order came as protesters complain about ICE's tactics to advance President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

The move to install Homan in place of top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who sources said is leaving after having led most of Trump's crackdowns in Democratic-led cities, is part of a broader reset by the president amid some advisers' concerns that the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents could derail his immigration agenda.

Trump spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers to reassess the administration's response to Pretti's death on Saturday, according to a White House official and a source familiar with the talks.

The discussions included reducing the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota, recalibrating the ICE mission in the state to focus more narrowly on deportations rather than broad enforcement operations and exploring greater coordination with state authorities. Trump also weighed whether immigration officers should be required to have body-worn cameras, as many police officers do, according to the White House official.

The killing of Pretti, an ICU nurse shot multiple times by Border Patrol agents on Saturday during protests, has become a full-blown political crisis for Trump, with even some Republicans in Congress calling for investigations.

Coupled with the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti's shooting prompted renewed anger over the aggressive tactics of some 3,000 federal agents who have been roving the streets of Minneapolis for weeks.

Late on Monday, Minnesota's chief federal judge ordered the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, to appear for a contempt hearing on Friday after the judge said the agency failed to comply with court orders that some detainees receive bond hearings.

"The court's patience is at an end," U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote.

Bystander video of Pretti's killing was widely shared, contradicting some Trump officials' initial claims that Pretti, who was legally carrying a concealed gun but never touched it prior to being shot, posed a threat to law enforcement.

Public support for Trump's immigration enforcement tactics appeared to be waning both before and after the Pretti shooting, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. Some Republicans have voiced concern that absent a shift in tactics, Trump's mass deportation push could cost the party its congressional majorities in November's midterm elections.

The president held a two-hour meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the Oval Office on Monday evening after Noem asked to meet, a source briefed on the matter confirmed. Noem's job is not in jeopardy, the source said. The New York Times first reported the meeting.

The typically combative Trump has also struck a more conciliatory tone in public remarks. He characterized private conversations with both Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday as productive, while the two Democratic leaders offered similarly positive comments, a far cry from the vitriol the two sides had previously exchanged.

Walz's office said Trump had agreed to direct DHS to ensure state authorities could conduct their own investigation into the Pretti shooting, while Frey said on X that his understanding was that some federal agents would begin leaving the city on Tuesday.

Privately, Trump made clear to advisers he did not want to defend the agent's actions or attack Pretti, after Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller labeled Pretti an "assassin" and Bovino suggested he intended to "massacre" officers, among other attacks from administration officials. Video footage of the incident verified by Reuters contradicted those allegations.

Senior aides were asked not to target Pretti publicly, and the president discussed distancing himself from public comments made by Miller and Noem, the White House official said.

Bovino, who said the officers who killed Pretti were the true victims in Saturday's shooting, is expected to depart Minneapolis along with some Border Patrol agents deployed with him, a senior administration official told Reuters on Monday.

Another person familiar with the matter said Bovino had been stripped of his specially created title of "commander at large" of the Border Patrol and would return to his former job as a chief patrol agent along California's El Centro sector of the U.S.-Mexico border, before retiring soon after.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin disputed those reports, posting on X on Monday: "Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties."

DHS officials described the incident as an attack by Pretti, saying agents fired in self-defense after he approached them with a handgun, even though video showed Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as agents wrestled him to the ground.

It also showed officers removing a firearm from his waistband after he was subdued, moments before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner.

In another sign that support for Trump's immigration drive in Minnesota was weakening, a leading Republican candidate for governor in the state, Chris Madel, dropped his bid on Monday, saying the crackdown had gone too far.

"I cannot support the national Republicans' stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so," he said in a video statement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:32:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZ4FJHZTWZI5NFFJ3HT4AHNEBM.jpg?auth=8e977a6792a8bfd98ef6da32493a5845c22f8d874d9ed236ecf98c23b7cf0fa9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU adds India in rush for trade deals after Trump's return</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-adds-india-rush-trade-deals-after-trumps-return-2026-01-27/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The European Union concluded negotiations on a free trade agreement with India on Tuesday, in the latest of a series of deals designed to offset the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and reduce reliance on China.

EU trade in goods with the United States was worth 873 billion euros ($1.04 trillion) in 2024 and with China 736 billion euros, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat, respectively 17% and 15% of the EU's trade with the rest of the world.

The following are the EU's concluded deals and ongoing negotiations:

The deal was struck with the South American bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in December 2024, just a month after Trump's re-election, and some 25 years after talks began.

The agreement is the EU's largest in terms of tariff reductions, removing over 4 billion euros of annual duties on EU exports such as cars and allowing EU companies to bid for public contracts in Mercosur on the same terms as local suppliers.

The deal has though proved contentious . Critics, such as France, say it will lead to cheap imports of South American foodstuffs, such as beef, undercutting EU farmers. Green groups also say it will lead to further deforestation.

The agreement was signed this month, but the European Parliament has referred it to the EU's top court , which could lead to a two-year delay. Proponents such as Germany want it to be applied on a provisional basis as soon as possible.

The European Commission says the agreement could boost EU exports to Mercosur by 39%. EU-Mercosur goods trade totalled 111 billion euros in 2024.

In January 2025, on the eve of Trump's inauguration, the EU revived a stalled free trade agreement with Mexico . The agreement updated a trade accord of 2000, which only covered industrial goods, by adding services, government procurement, investment and farm produce.

The EU believes the update, which awaits approval in the bloc, will increase trade between the two that has risen by over 300% since 2000. In 2024, their merchandise trade was worth 82 billion euros.

The EU finalised negotiations with Indonesia in September.

The deal will remove some 600 million euros of duties on EU products, including chemicals, machinery, milk powder and cheese.

Indonesia aims to grow its exports of palm oil, coffee and textiles and needs the deal as its economy grows and it loses the preferential access the EU grants to poorer developing countries.

EU goods trade with Indonesia was 27 billion euros in 2024. Indonesia has said it wants the pact to enter force by January 2027 and expects bilateral trade to double in the first five years.

The EU's trade agreement with India is less ambitious than those with other partners, not achieving full liberalisation in sectors such as cars and excluding government procurement, energy and raw materials or investments in manufacturing.

However, the two sides still refer to it as the "mother of all deals", with large-scale tariff reductions and a combined population of 2 billion people.

EU-India goods trade was 120 billion euros in 2024. The EU estimates its goods exports to India will double by 2032, with nearly 4 billion euros of tariff savings.

The European Union has also accelerated trade negotiations with other ASEAN countries. It resumed talks with Malaysia in January 2025, and had held three sets of negotiating rounds this year with both the Philippines and Thailand. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic has said he wants to wrap up these negotiations by 2027 .

The EU launched negotiations with the United Arab Emirates in May 2025.

It has also said it expects to resume negotiations with Australia early this year after they were shelved in 2023. A deal could also see the EU increase its access to critical minerals like lithium and rare earths.

Combined EU goods trade with these countries was 211 billion euros in 2024.

The death in August of Raphael Graven, alias Jean Pormanove, live on the 200,000-follower video channel he shared with Owen Cenazandotti and Safine Hamadi shocked France and drew the ire of government ministers.

Cenazandotti, 26, and Safine, 23, have denied responsibility for 46-year-old Graven's death, which followed a 12-day live marathon of physical and verbal abuse against him.

But they are now being held on charges including assault, incitement to hatred, abuse of a vulnerable person and recording and broadcasting violent images, said Damien Martinelli, chief prosecutor in the Mediterranean city of Nice.

Prosecutors first opened a probe against the group in December 2024, months before Graven's death, when they encountered footage of him being insulted and struck, having his hair pulled and being shot with paintball guns .

All three streamers were held in January last year but released after they insisted the on-screen violence was all part of "an act aimed at creating buzz so as to earn money".

Graven died on August 18 during a livestream in which he and another man were struck and insulted by his younger colleagues, though an autopsy has since ruled out "intervention by a third party" playing a role in his death.

Ministers in August announced separate legal action against the Australia-based Kick platform, which is also under investigation by Paris prosecutors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:33:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fb87b0fe-fb93-11f0-a6c0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/Capture-213.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Families of two killed in US strikes near Venezuela sue the Trump administration</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-families-of-two-killed-in-us-strikes-near-venezuela-file-suit-against-trump-administration</link><description>Family members of ‍two men killed in ​a US missile strike against a suspected drug boat near Venezuela filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Tuesday, alleging the pair were ⁠murdered in a "manifestly unlawful" military campaign targeting civilian vessels.

Civil rights lawyers filed the lawsuit in Boston's federal court, marking the first court challenge to one of the 36 US missile strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean authorised ​by President Donald Trump 's administration that have killed more than 120 people since September.

Family members of Chad ‍Joseph and Rishi Samaroo – two Trinidadian men who were among six killed during an October 14 strike – in the lawsuit say the two men did fishing and farm work in ​Venezuela and had been returning to their homes in Las Cuevas, Trinidad when they were attacked.

"These ​are lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theater, which is why we need a court of law to proclaim what is true and constrain what is lawless," Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement.

His group and the American Civil Liberties Union filed the novel lawsuit under the Death on the High Seas Act, a maritime law that allows family members to sue for wrongful deaths occurring on the high seas, and the Alien Tort Statute, a ‍1789 law that allows foreign citizens to sue in US courts for violations of international law.

The lawsuit was filed by Lenore Burnley, Joseph's mother, and Sallycar Korasingh, Samaroo's sister, ​and seeks only damages from the US government for the two deaths, not an injunction that would prevent further strikes.

But the case could provide an avenue for a court to assess whether the October 14 strike was legal.

The ‌Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has framed the attacks carried out under US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth 's direction as a war with drug cartels, alleging they ‍were armed groups. It has said its attacks comply with international rules known as the law of war or the law of armed conflict.

But the attacks have drawn scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans in Congress, which has not authorised attacks on the drug cartels, and condemnation from human rights groups. Legal experts have previously said the drug cartels do not fit the accepted international definition of an armed group.

Tuesday's lawsuit argues that the killing of Joseph and Samaroo outside of an armed conflict, while they were not taking part ‍in military hostilities against the US amounted to murder and should be deemed a wrongful death on the high seas and an extrajudicial killing ‌under international law.

"If the ​US government believed Rishi had done anything wrong, it should have arrested, charged, and detained him, not murdered him," Korasingh said in a statement. "They must be held accountable."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:33:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ecd0b04-fb95-11f0-8825-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25351715660539.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran welcomes any process to prevent war, president tells Saudi crown prince in phone call</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-welcomes-any-process-prevent-war-president-tells-saudi-crown-prince-phone-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a phone call that Tehran always welcomes any process, within the framework of international law, that prevents war, Iranian media reported on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:30:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L6Y6CSX3ZJOUFGDXNJIEQJBA4A.jpg?auth=283480254b11f0fbe0705e3815dcda2681de4cdeb92bc4b6e1c5f91f7ab9bd92&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian Kurdish enclave on alert amid shaky ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/syrian-kurdish-enclave-alert-amid-shaky-ceasefire-2026-01-27/</link><description>QAMISHLI, Syria, Jan 27 (Reuters) - With Syria's Islamist-led government bearing down on Kurdish forces, residents of their last major enclave are on alert, mindful of last year's violence against other minority groups and determined to preserve their self-rule.

In the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli in the northeast, a mechanic, a storekeeper, and a student were among those taking part in a nighttime volunteer patrol this week, vowing to defend their area and putting little faith in a shaky ceasefire.

"We're going out to guard our neighbourhoods, to stand with our people and protect our land," said Yazan Ghanem, 23. "This is our land. We won't accept any outside interference in our areas."

It reflects simmering tensions despite the U.S.-backed ceasefire, which was extended on Saturday for 15 days. Some clashes have taken place since then.

Having taken swathes of the north and east from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government is pressing its demand for the integration of the remaining Kurdish-run enclaves with the state.

The SDF is clinging on in its northeastern enclave - one of several where Kurds - an oppressed group under the ousted Assad dynasty - established de facto autonomy during the civil war.

While Sharaa has repeatedly vowed to uphold Kurdish rights - he recognised Kurdish as a national language earlier this month - the residents patrolling Qamishli on Monday had little confidence in the former al Qaeda commander.

"We have fears and doubts about the government because, quite simply, wherever it has entered, there have been massacres and killing," said Radwan Eissa, brandishing a gun.

Fears among Syrian minorities grew last year during several bouts of violence in which the Sunni Muslim-led government clashed with members of the Alawite community in Syria's coastal region, and Druze communities in Sweida province, with government-aligned fighters killing hundreds of people.

Sharaa has promised accountability.

A senior Syrian government official said Kurdish fears were "understandable" based on abuses committed by army personnel in Sweida and some violations carried out by troops as they pressed into Kurdish-held areas in recent weeks.

The official said two people had been arrested for the recent abuses and a third was on the run, but being pursued. “We are keen to learn from past experiences, and we did,” he added.

The prosecutor general last year pressed charges against some 300 people linked to armed factions affiliated with the Syrian army over the violence in the coastal region, and around 265 who belonged to Assad-era paramilitary groups.

Human Rights Watch said on January 25 that both parties appeared to have committed abuses that violated international law during the current escalation in the northeast.

Government forces have advanced to the outskirts of SDF-held Hasakah, an ethnically mixed city some 70 km (45 miles) south of Qamishli. They have also encircled Kobani, or Ain al-Arab, a Kurdish-held town at the Turkish border.

The SDF has vowed to protect Kurdish regions.

In an interview with Kurdish broadcaster Ronahi on Sunday, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said dialogue continued with Damascus, and that after the 15-day period "serious steps" would be taken towards integration.

"Our forces are ready for war and political solutions," he said. "The Kurds must get their rights in this region, and join the Syrian state," he said.

The Syrian official said the January 18 integration deal aimed to reassure Kurds by stipulating that Syrian troops would not enter Kurdish areas and by spelling out how local communities would be able to delegate their own representatives.

The SDF's territory grew as it partnered with the United States against Islamic State in Syria.

But its position weakened as Washington deepened ties to Sharaa over the last year. President Donald Trump said on January 20 Washington was trying to protect the Kurds.

Syria's dominant Kurdish group, the PYD, follows a political doctrine emphasising leftism and feminism.

Giwana Hussein, a 23-year-old Qamishli student, said she hoped the ceasefire showed that both sides wanted a political solution. She urged Damascus to let Kurds run their own affairs, and said she was afraid that if the government took control, women's rights would be marginalised.

The Syrian official said the government wanted to ensure a new constitution addressed Kurdish concerns, but said that it could only come after an integration deal was agreed and implemented. "Once we merge, we can discuss everything," the official said.

Ivan Hassib, a Kurdish activist critical of the PYD, said Sharaa's decree recognising Kurdish rights was positive but only a first step, saying they must be enshrined in the constitution and not limited to cultural rights: "The lasting solution ... is for the Kurds and other groups to obtain some form of autonomy."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:30:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q3WTZK2XDFJAZNEOWEGG2DXW3Y.jpg?auth=ba3ac5e698ed5911be15bb22de0259dde7f9ffe16af6b2bef42ab46b5eac670e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN experts denounce Switzerland for sentencing students over Gaza protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-experts-denounce-switzerland-sentencing-students-over-gaza-protests-2026-01-27/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.N. human rights experts have protested to Bern after a group of students were sentenced for trespassing after taking part in pro-Palestinian protests at a Swiss-funded university, they said in a statement on Tuesday.

Around 70 students at the Swiss university ETH Zurich took part in peaceful sit-in in May 2024 , opens new tab as part of student demonstrations in several cities during the Gaza war before being dispersed by police.

Students who took part in the protests were opposing the Swiss facility's partnerships with Israeli universities, the U.N. experts said.

“Peaceful student activism, on and off campus, is part of students’ rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and must not be criminalised,” the U.N. experts said, adding that they had written to the Swiss government and the university to raise the issue.

A spokesperson for the Swiss Federal Ministry of Justice and Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An ETH Zurich spokesperson did not immediately respond.

Five students have so far been sentenced for trespassing, resulting in suspended fines of up to 2700 CHF ($3,516.08), legal fees of over 2,000 CHF ($2,604.85) and a conviction on their criminal records which are frequently sought by prospective employers, the U.N. experts said.

Ten others who appealed the charges await sentencing and two others were acquitted, they said.

“I’m always positive,” Lili Keller-Rosenberg says with a glint in her eye. She wears lipstick, has an impeccable blow-dry and wears a carefully chosen dress, because she insists on being elegant in all circumstances. "A lesson in dignity," as she puts it.

That philosophy has stayed with her from her experience in the concentration camps. "Every morning at Ravensbrück, my mother would wake us half an hour before the others, because she was absolutely determined that we wash ourselves. She would tell us: 'They've taken everything from us. We have nothing left, not even a name, but we must not bow our heads. Let's be dignified. Let's look proper,'" she remembers, 80 years later, at the hotel in Lille where we have arranged to meet.

Lili Keller-Rosenberg was born on September 15, 1932, in more hopeful times. "In a warm home with wonderful parents," she says. "They came from Budapest, Hungary, where there was already anti-Semitism . They chose to settle in France because it's the country of human rights . That's where we were born – in the north of France, my two brothers and I," she says.

But she later had her childhood stolen.

In the few family photos that survived World War II , there are smiling faces. Her mother, Charlotte, was a seamstress. Her father, Joseph, was employed in a dyeworks. It was a state of simple happiness in the small house in Roubaix. But the conflict gradually intruded into daily life. At 10 years old, in June 1942, Lili was forced to wear the yellow star of David.

"It didn't shock me. I thought it was pretty. I wore it without asking too many questions," she remembers.

The parents tried to protect their three children and never spoke of the war until the day when the threat became impossible to ignore. They decided to hide the children in different families in Tourcoing, helped by the priest of a parish in Roubaix.

"It was a wonderful gesture,” she says. “They risked being deported themselves. It was very courageous.”

'The Nazis were yelling, the dogs were barking, the children were crying'

But at the end of summer 1943, without her knowing the reason, her parents decided to bring them back home. “Perhaps they imagined that there was no longer any risk." Sadly, a few months later, on October 27, at 3 o'clock in the morning, violent knocks struck at the door. The Feldgendarmerie (German military police) burst into the Rosenberg home.

The moment is engraved in Lili's memory. "They followed us everywhere, even to the toilet. We couldn't be alone. They shouted, ' Schnell, los! ' (Move, quickly!). We had to gather what was most precious. We were frantic with fear." Her youngest brother, André, was only 3 years old: "I remember he took his favourite toy, a wooden duck on wheels. He put it under his arm and followed those soldiers who pushed us down the stairs," she remembers.

The family was first taken to Loos prison in Lille. The city was under the military administration of Belgium and Northern France, an entity created by Nazi Germany. The Rosenbergs were then transferred to Saint-Gilles prison in Brussels, then to the Malines internment camp in Belgium.

"In this camp there were German SS, but also Flemish ones. One of them was particularly cruel and distributed lashes of the whip generously," Keller-Rosenberg says.

The conditions were dreadful, but the worst was yet to come. On December 13, 1943, the SS informed them that they would have to leave the camp. A search was organised first, which Lili still remembers with disgust: "We all had to get naked. We were very uncomfortable. You know, back then, we were very modest. We had to spread our legs, and bend forward. They shone a flashlight at us from below to see if we had hidden precious objects. Jewellery, for example."

Cattle cars then awaited the deportees. It was chaos: "The Nazis were yelling, the dogs were barking, the children were crying. We were pushed into a wagon and it was only once the doors were closed that we realised papa wasn't with us." Joseph was transferred to the Buchenwald camp, while the rest of the family were sent to Ravensbrück.

'Our humanity was stripped away'

After an "atrocious journey of four or five days without eating or drinking", Lili, her mother and her two brothers arrived at the Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany, the largest for women under the Third Reich. They were pushed into prison blocks. "We had a quick, cold shower. We were all shaved. Our humanity was stripped away. We were given our prisoner clothing, those grey-and-blue-striped dresses, and our prisoner numbers. Mine was 25,612." In her small voice, she repeats it in German. Five numbers forever imprinted in her mind: "From that moment on, we were nobody."

At Ravensbrück, 80 km north of Berlin, the Rosenbergs met other French women, mostly resistance fighters – including Geneviève de Gaulle , General Charles de Gaulle 's niece, and Martha Desrumaux , a union activist from northern France. There were very few children because those who were there for political reasons were arrested alone, without their families. In this hell, Lili became aware of the fate that was reserved for them:

"I understood that we had been arrested because we were Jewish and that the Nazis wanted to destroy all the Jews of Europe."

All day long, she found herself left to her own devices with her little brothers, while their mother was sent into forced labour. "We didn't dare leave our blocks. We stayed inside for fear of seeing the Nazis and their dogs. They had no feelings. We saw the inhuman way they behaved with all the prisoners."

No more games, no more laughter, no more moments of carefree innocence. "Our entertainment consisted of killing lice. We were covered in vermin. The more we killed, the more appeared." Covered in boils, they also suffered from hunger. They survived on hard bread and a disgusting black liquid. Lili says they survived thanks to their mother's love. "Without her, we were lost. It was her presence that gave us the will to live. We waited for her to return every evening, and then we could breathe again."

The 'horror in those soldiers’ eyes' when they discovered Bergen-Belsen

In February 1945, exhausted, the family was told it was time to leave Ravensbrück. As the Soviets advanced, the prisoners were gradually evacuated. The Rosenbergs were again pushed into train wagons. After a chaotic journey, the doors opened and an atrocious smell grabbed them by the throat: "I couldn't even describe it to you. We arrived in a place that felt even more sinister than Ravensbrück,” remembers Lili. “There were corpses all over the ground. We had to step over them to move forward."

The living, dead and sick were all mixed together. With horror, Lili discovered the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, known as the "camp of slow death". It was in the midst of a typhus epidemic . "I can still see those wooden carts fitted with four posts and with a grey canvas curtain. With the wind, it would lift up. You could see an arm hanging here, a leg there, a skull there. It was a Dantesque vision."

In this apocalyptic setting, the family gradually lost strength. Charlotte contracted typhus and her children could not help her. "She lay on the ground next to us. When we spoke to her, she didn't answer us. She was so strange, she seemed to be in another world. We understood nothing. She had been so formidable at Ravensbrück, she couldn't imagine returning without one of us and so she deprived herself of her meager rations to give us an extra mouthful. There, she lay on the ground, unconscious, in a terrible state," Lili remembers with vivid emotion. "We wanted to die at that moment. Death would have been preferable to this beastly life they made us lead. We let ourselves go, nothing mattered to us anymore."

But the little Rosenbergs held on despite everything. On April 15, 1945, they witnessed the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen camp by British soldiers. "I can still see the horror in those soldiers' eyes. They didn't dare move. They took a few steps back, not daring to approach us. They were horrified.” Lili remembers the cans of corned beef and packets of sweet, condensed milk the soldiers distributed, once they had got over the initial shock. In the "camp of slow death", 60,000 survivors coexisted with thousands of corpses.

Lili and her brothers were finally repatriated to France, but their mother, too ill to be transported, remained in Germany. They arrived alone at the Hôtel Lutetia in Paris, a reception centre for freed prisoners. "No one came to collect us. We had no one. We were happy to be free and back in France, but at the same time we were so sad. We had no news of our parents. What was the point of living if we were to be orphans?"

After being taken in by an aunt, the children were sent to a sanatorium in Hendaye in the Basque Country to receive medical care. Against all odds, their mother found them there. "One day, the door to our room opened. Maman was there before our eyes, frighteningly thin. Life took on meaning for us again." The family was only partially reunited. A few months later, they learned that their father had been shot by the Nazis three days before the liberation of Buchenwald.

The number of survivors is dwindling

Their health was fragile and they had very little money, but the Rosenbergs had to resume the course of their lives. They returned to settle in the north of France. "Those were hard years," Lili remembers. The decades passed and silence fell on their experience in the camps.

"People seemed to doubt what we told them. It offended us greatly. We kept silent."

Lili became a secretary and never left the north. She continues to live in Lille today. She married and had a daughter.

It was only in the 1980s that she decided to speak out, she says, when “Holocaust deniers emerged – those who dared to say that it hadn’t existed.”

Lili began sharing her story in middle schools and high schools, "to her little messengers of peace", as she likes to call them.

Meeting young people energises her. "They listen, my little messengers. It gives me the desire to continue. They're sweet and ask me good questions."

She has lost count of how many schools she has visited over the course of more than 40 years. She has spoken to hundreds of thousands of students. "Sometimes, I speak to 2,000 schoolchildren all at once,” she says.

At 93, she admits "that she would like to take a little break" because it's "not so easy to keep going back to the past". Yet projects keep coming her way. After publishing her first book in 2021, "And We Came Back Alone," a comic book will soon be dedicated to her: "Lili, Always Standing, Until the End".

Regional authorities have acquired her former house in Roubaix, with plans to make it a memorial centre honouring deported children like herself.

Lili shows no signs of stopping. Her schedule for 2026 is already full with "requests from all over France and even abroad".

Survivors of the Holocaust are increasingly rare and she is one of the last in France who can still travel.

'One day peace will come'

Tirelessly, Lili shares her family’s story. Her younger brothers are still alive and she says she's prepared to continue bearing witness until she’s at least 100 years old. "After that, we'll see!" she says, smiling.

Mixing gentleness and strength, she describes the worst of humanity on a mission to spread peace.

"I tell the children to be vigilant because everything can come back in a different form. Evil is everywhere. We must fight racism at all costs, which is a scourge of our time – anti-Semitism, which unfortunately persists, as well as xenophobia."

Lili has known evil up close. But despite that, she believes in humanity. "We can't live entire lives in war. One day peace will come. And I'll see it from up above, and I’ll rejoice."

Preliminary estimates of the number of demonstrators killed range from 6,000 – the current total of an ongoing count being carried out by NGOs – and 20,000, according to the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran , Mai Sato.

As our team observed by reviewing many videos filmed by eyewitnesses, the Kahrizak morgue in Tehran was flooded with hundreds of protesters’ bodies. According to partial counts carried out by the BBC and the NGO Human Rights Watch , the bodies of at least 200 to 400 demonstrators were brought to the site.

However, social media users and media outlets with links to the Iranian government began, the week of January 19, to explicitly deny that the massacres were taking place, claiming that the photos taken in the Kahrizak morgue were all generated by artificial intelligence.

The Fars News Agency, which is linked to the Iranian regime, has tried to make this point by sharing two images of the same moving scene: a young woman in mourning standing amidst the many wrapped bodies laid out in the morgue’s courtyard.

The first image – on the right in the screenshot above – was taken from a tweet by Israeli journalist Emy Schrader. The wide shot shows a young woman standing amidst the bodies from a distance.

The Fars News Agency said that the journalist had shared a “fake image” while claiming that “16,500 people had been killed in the riots". The agency further claimed:

"[The journalist] also used artificial intelligence to make her lie credible, but forgot to remove the Gemini AI label from the corner of the image”.

It is true that the image shared by Schrader was generated by artificial intelligence. You can see the logo for Gemini, Google’s artificial intelligence, which is added to images produced by Nano Banana, the AI image generator included in Gemini.

The second image is more zoomed in than the first and focuses on the woman in mourning. By including both images in the same post, Fars is saying that this closer up image is also fake.

However, this way of presenting the images as both false is misleading. Although the first image was indeed AI-generated, the second is authentic.

We were able to confirm that the first image – the one with the AI Gemini logo – was indeed generated by this tool by using the AI detection tool SynthID, which is integrated in the Google Lens search engine. When we uploaded this first image to Google Lens, it concluded that it was “created with Google AI” in the “about this image” section.

The second image that the Fars News Agency claimed was false is actually authentic. It is from the Telegram account of an Iranian blogger who shared the photo along with others taken in the Kahrizak morgue. The choice to include this authentic photo alongside the AI-generated image and claim that both are false is part of a strategy to deny the real repression happening in Iran.

Our team was able to verify the authenticity of a number of different videos from the Kahrizak morgue , some filmed in the same courtyard where the woman in the photo is standing. These videos helped us confirm that the scene captured in the photo did take place. Other videos and photos taken from different angles also show that there were many bodies laid on the ground of the morgue’s courtyard.

This footage allows us to establish that the image of the woman in mourning was indeed taken at the Kahrizak morgue. Using a satellite image of the morgue that was provided to our team by the satellite image company Vantor, as well as two verified videos filmed in the courtyard of the morgue, it is possible to establish where the young woman was standing: in front of the entrance to a large building with a red roof. A brown-and-beige wall appears in both videos and the photo. Moreover, a white building in the background of the photo of the young woman can be seen in the satellite image.

It is likely that the AI-generated image was produced using the authentic photo, as the woman in the AI-generated image appears very similar to the woman in the real image.

However, it seems as if the Fars News Agency was using the AI-generated image to also discredit the authentic image and, thus, the reality of the massacres believed to have been committed by the Iranian security forces. Implying that all photos of the Kahrizak morgue are false because some false images have been circulating is a manipulative narrative that the Iranian authorities are using to try to discredit any accounts of their brutal crackdown.

Jose Jeri, who took office in October after the removal of former President Dina Boluarte, has denied any wrongdoing in the three meetings he acknowledged holding between December and January with businessman Zhihua Yang.

The businessman owns Chinese import shops and holds a concession for an energy project. He has also previously been named in congressional investigations as allegedly providing logistical support to Chinese firms suspected of corruption.

The controversy has coincided with a stepped-up U.S. influence campaign in the region aimed at curtailing China's deep ties in Latin America.

"It wouldn't be surprising to see the Trump administration questioning China's investment in Peru. It did so in Mexico and Panama, and potentially using pressure tools to nudge Peru away from China," said Martin Cassinelli, a trade and investment analyst at the Atlantic Council think tank.

The case, dubbed "Chifagate" by the local media, has prompted opposition lawmakers to file impeachment motions seeking to oust Jeri, who is tasked with completing the current government's term through July. The public prosecutor's office has opened a preliminary investigation into Jeri for alleged influence peddling, which he has denied.

Peruvians will head to the polls to elect a new president on April 12. Peru, which has seen seven presidents since 2018, has nonetheless enjoyed one of the strongest growth rates in Latin America thanks in part to steady mining income.

Washington's recent capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, an ally of China and Russia, sent a message that it aims to exclude extra-regional powers from the Western Hemisphere, analysts said, a stance that places additional pressure on governments like Peru's as they navigate internal crises.

"Criticism of a Chinese businessman is also, practically, criticism of China," said Jhon Valdiglesias of the Center for Asian Studies at Peru's National University of San Marcos.

"I think it definitely casts a shadow over all relations with China," he added.

Still, disrupting Peru's deep China commercial ties won't be easy. A free trade pact, signed in 2009, propelled China to outpace the U.S. as Peru's top trading partner starting in 2015.

According to government data through November of last year, China accounts for 33% of Peru's trade, compared with 14% with the U.S.

China also controls one of Peru's largest copper mines and buys about 70% of the country's output of the metal. Chinese firms own Peru's largest power generators, and in late 2024 began operating the Chancay megaport, creating a new direct South America–Asia trade route.

Former Peruvian ambassador to China, Juan Carlos Capunay, said the South American country's economic relations with Beijing are "perhaps among the best structured administratively and politically" in recent years.

"We have several key instruments that sustain them, including a free trade agreement in force with China," he said, adding that would make it a challenge for the U.S. to dismantle or even weaken in the long term.

Even so, the Chifagate scandal has put a spotlight on some of the seamier aspects of the relationship.

"If Peruvians, who up until now looked favorably upon Chinese investment projects, are to question the credibility of that investment, new Chinese investments and government contracts will be less welcome by a society sensitive to allegations of corruption and undue favoritism for foreign companies," Cassinelli said.

Representatives of China's embassy in Peru did not respond to a request for comment.

Support appears to be eroding for Jeri, whose approval rating has dropped from 51% to 41% since the scandal broke, according to polling firm Datum Internacional.

As many as 78% of Peruvians responded to an Ipsos poll over the weekend that they perceive signs of corruption in Jeri's meetings with the businessman.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:27:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6HRFGHKWXJPC3BVNU34WIKISKM.jpg?auth=e47e81bf46b5235675e43fddb9084004a80d02469dc303435cecfc78d8eb2b51&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Captain of seized Venezuela-linked tanker now aboard U.S. vessel, wife's lawyer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/captain-seized-venezuela-linked-tanker-now-aboard-us-vessel-wifes-lawyer-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The captain of a Venezuela-linked crude oil tanker seized by the U.S. earlier this month has been taken from British territorial waters and is now aboard a U.S. coast guard vessel, a lawyer for the captain's wife said on Tuesday.

The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. military special forces, bearing a judicial seizure warrant, apprehended the Russian-flagged Marinera in the Atlantic near Iceland on January 7 after pursuing it for more than two weeks as part of Washington's efforts to block Venezuelan oil exports.

After its capture the tanker was moved to a location off the coast of Scotland.

Despite legal attempts to stop their removal, its captain Captain Avtandil Kalandadze, a Georgian, and the boat's First Officer had been taken away from Scottish jurisdiction to the U.S. coast guard vessel Munro, Aamer Anwar, the lawyer for Kalandadze's wife Natia Dzadzama, said.

On Monday, a Scottish court issued an interim order preventing the captain's removal pending a judicial review of his detention, but that was recalled in the early hours of Tuesday after hearing that Kalandadze was already outside British territorial waters, Anwar said.

"Our client's judicial review can no longer be enforced now her husband has, in essence, been abducted by the U.S. government on Scottish and British territory," he said in a statement.

There was no immediate comment from the U.S. coast guard, the devolved Scottish government nor the British government's Scotland Office.

Anwar said the other 26 crew of the Marinera, formerly known as the Bella-1, had been processed at a British army centre in Inverness. Five had chosen to travel to the United States, while the others had chosen alternative travel arrangements to their home countries, Anwar said.

Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had expected the U.S. to free the crew members which he said included two Russians, as well as Ukrainians, Georgians and Indians.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7LC7RDHUGJPY7FCSXGBAUZBMYA.jpg?auth=9b30ab024a1087fdda755df29fbd45e418e7680db721fc8f8a40dff947cf2fd2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli president to meet Bondi Beach shooting families during Australia trip</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/israeli-president-meet-bondi-beach-shooting-families-during-australia-trip-2026-01-27/</link><description>TEL AVIV, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Israeli President Isaac Herzog will meet the families of victims of the Bondi Beach shooting and members of the Australian Jewish community during a visit to the country next month, his office said on Tuesday.

President Donald Trump is waging a massive campaign to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally, which also has snared some immigrants with legal status and U.S. citizens.

Trump's administration has surged agents to several Democratic-led cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and most recently Minneapolis and St. Paul.

In Minneapolis, residents have been angered by several incidents, including the killing of two U.S. citizens, the detention of a U.S. citizen who was in his shorts, and the detention of school children, including a .

Meanwhile, six deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers are known to have occurred just this month.

Democrats have long been calling for tougher controls over immigration agent operations and practices. In the wake of Saturday's shooting of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti, they are demanding that such reforms be attached to legislation that funds the Department of Homeland Security through September.

That bill was approved last week in the House of Representatives over the objection of most Democrats. The DHS funding was attached to broader legislation that also funds agencies ranging from the Defense Department to those operating medical research, housing and education programs.

Democrats are seeking: a prohibition of ICE detentions or deportations of American citizens; a ban on masks worn by ICE agents; a requirement to wear body cameras; explicit prohibitions on excessive use of force; prohibitions on raids of churches, mosques, synagogues and other places of worship, as well as hospitals and schools; and no absolute immunity from prosecution of agents violating codes of conduct.

Other Democrats have also urged improved training for agents and requiring court-issued warrants for immigration searches and detentions.

Democrats are also seeking to separate DHS spending from the larger package, to avoid disruption to other agencies. They have offered to agree to a temporary funding measure to provide more time for the two parties to find a compromise on additional ICE restrictions.

Republicans do not want to change the funding bill and are pushing to pass it in the Senate by the January 30 deadline.

Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on Monday that the sprawling package already contains guardrails on ICE behavior.

For example, it provides $20 million for body-worn cameras, lays out protections for pregnant women in DHS custody, and prohibits the destruction of evidence involving the deaths of people in custody.

Immigration enforcement would likely be unaffected. During the last shutdown in October, DHS deemed 258,000 of its 272,000 employees "essential," which meant they stayed on the job after funding expired. While essential employees typically do not get paid during a shutdown, Trump's administration kept pay flowing for immigration agents and other federal law enforcement.

DHS has another stream of funding as well. Last year's "One Big Beautiful Bill," which was opposed by most Democrats, includes $75 billion in additional funding for ICE that allows it to significantly increase the size of its workforce and expand detention facilities, as DHS aims to meet Trump's goal of deporting 1 million people annually.

That money would be available even if Congress does not pass the DHS funding bill.

A large, widespread winter storm has hindered the ability of lawmakers to return to Washington to work on the spending legislation. Senators are expected back in town late on Tuesday, and Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday are scheduled to hold their separate policy lunches. That will be the next opportunity for the 53 Republican senators and 47 members of the Democratic caucus to try to chart their strategies in this battle.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:29:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZC6CDN3HLRN3XBG3KDFVEJLEEM.jpg?auth=618062f4fa2c7b421544bf31d8dd9f7c88a45be6838c5ac371f718a324fc23cc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU expected to approve new Iran sanctions in response to crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-expected-approve-new-iran-sanctions-response-crackdown-2026-01-27/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The EU is expected to sanction some 20 Iranian individuals and entities under its human rights rules this week but is not expected to add Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list due to opposition from France, officials said on Tuesday.

European Union foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Iran when they gather in Brussels on Thursday, and are expected to sign off on the new sanctions.

The new measures are expected to include export restrictions on components that Iran can use for the production of drones and missiles, bringing limitations into line with EU policy on Russia. Some Iranian individuals and entities will also be sanctioned for providing support to Russia, the officials said.

Set up after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces and was put in charge of Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.

While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU's terrorist list, others have been more cautious fearing that it could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran.

Iran's protests and the authorities' violent response , however, revived the debate ahead of the EU ministers' meeting this week.

Anti-government protests that swept across Iran since December have triggered the bloodiest crackdown by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, drawing international condemnation.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Monday that he will call for placing the IRGC on the EU's terrorist list, signaling a shift in Rome's position and leaving Paris as the one major holdout.

As a result, while some of the individuals expected to be sanctioned will include members of the IRGC, adding the group as a whole to the bloc's terrorist list looks unlikely for now as that would require unanimity.

"France has made it clear that they do not believe it would be useful to list the IRGC for now and want to keep communications open," said one European diplomat, adding that Paris was also worried it could harm efforts to bring back two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:29:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NTMCCZNAENKJDBGADE6K32G6HM.jpg?auth=6b144f29c74d77026d1842ae23957c00f6582f0be3a455d45c149422f8204ffb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Person critical after being shot in Border Patrol incident in Arizona, NBC News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/person-critical-after-border-patrol-shooting-arizona-nbc-news-reports-2026-01-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Border Patrol was involved in a shooting in Arizona on Tuesday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said in a statement, adding that his office was working with the FBI and Customs and Border Protection to look into the incident.

NBC News earlier reported, citing a Pima County Sheriff spokeswoman, that a person was in critical condition after being shot in an incident involving the Border Patrol in the county that includes Tucson and is located along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The circumstances of the incident were not immediately clear. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The incident comes after the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse shot multiple times by federal immigration agents on Saturday in Minnesota.

Coupled with the fatal shooting of Renee Good, also 37, earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti's shooting has become a full-blown political crisis for President Donald Trump and sparked renewed anger over the aggressive tactics of the federal agents who have been roving the streets of Minneapolis for weeks.

Trump has pursued a hardline immigration agenda since taking office last year and has surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:29:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike on passenger train in Kharkiv region kills three, prosecutors say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-drone-strike-passenger-train-kharkiv-region-kills-three-prosecutors-say-2026-01-27/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A Russian drone strike killed three people and wounded two more aboard a passenger train in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, prosecutors said on Tuesday.

Retired reservist Brigadier-General Amir Avivi told Reuters in an interview that the camp would be built in an area of Rafah cleared of tunnels built by Hamas, with entry and exit tracked by Israeli personnel.

Avivi is founder of the influential Israel Defense and Security Forum, a group representing thousands of Israeli military reservists. He does not speak on behalf of Israel's military, which declined to comment. The Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately provide comment on any plans to build a camp in Rafah.

Avivi said the camp would be used to house Palestinians who wish to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt as well as those who wish to stay.

His comments come as Israel prepares for a "limited reopening" of Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a key requirement under U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.

Sources told Reuters this month that Israel wants to ensure more Palestinians leave Gaza than are allowed in. Israeli officials have spoken in the past about encouraging Gazans to emigrate, though they deny intending to transfer the population out by force - a highly sensitive issue for Palestinians.

"There are no Gazans, almost at all, in Rafah," Avivi said. The area fell under complete Israeli military control following an October Israel-Hamas ceasefire, and most Palestinians fled for areas held by Hamas.

"You need to build infrastructure in Rafah that can host them, and then they can choose if they want to go or not," Avivi said. He said the structure would likely be "a big, organized camp" capable of hosting hundreds of thousands of people that could enforce ID checks including facial recognition.

In July, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz told Israeli media that he had ordered troops to prepare a camp in Rafah to house Gaza's population. Officials have not spoken publicly about such plans since then.

Ismail Al-Thawabta, head of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, told Reuters in a statement that the idea amounted to cover for "forced displacement".

Palestinians in Gaza , shattered by two years of Israeli attacks in the enclave, have long faced restrictions on their movement and monitoring of their online activity and phone calls by Israeli surveillance agencies.

Nearly all of Gaza's 2 million people have been forced into a narrow coastal strip from which Israeli forces withdrew under the ceasefire and where Hamas has retained control.

Trump's plan for Gaza, now in its second phase , calls for Gaza's reconstruction to start in Rafah and for Hamas to lay down its arms in exchange for further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory.

Avivi said Israel's military was preparing for a new offensive against Hamas if it refuses to give up its weapons. This could include relaunching attacks on Gaza City, the enclave's largest.

The camp in Gaza could be used to house Palestinians fleeing a renewed Israeli assault, Avivi said.

"Plans are set. The army is ready to get the command from the government, from the cabinet to renew its maneuvers in Gaza," Avivi said.

Israel's military says it has continued to carry out operations in Gaza since the ceasefire to thwart what it describes as planned attacks by militants and destroy Hamas' tunnel network under Gaza.

Israeli attacks since the ceasefire have killed more than 480 Palestinians in Gaza, health authorities there say, while the military says four soldiers have been killed in militant attacks.

Avi Dichter, a minister in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet and former head of Israel's domestic intelligence service, said disputes over disarmament could lead Israel back into war in Gaza.

"We have to get prepared for the war in Gaza," Dichter told Reuters, adding that the disarmament issue "will have to be solved by Israeli troops, the hard way."

Hamas has publicly refused to lay down its weapons. Two Hamas officials told Reuters this week that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

According to a document shared by the White House last week, the Trump administration wants to see heavy weapons decommissioned immediately, with "personal arms registered and decommissioned by sector" as the police under an interim technocratic administration in Gaza "become capable of guaranteeing personal security".

Trump has repeatedly warned Hamas that it would have "hell to pay" if it does not lay down its weapons.

A U.S. official said on Tuesday that disarmament could come along with some sort of amnesty for Hamas members.

Speaking to Israel's parliament on Monday night, Netanyahu said the next phase of the ceasefire would not include reconstruction of Gaza.

"The next phase is demilitarization of the Strip and disarming Hamas," Netanyahu said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:49:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/74456BJTOJNB3CSYVWT4HHFDEE.jpg?auth=121c22dff096495c25fb9110b53f6e314b5b4d01387651906dfde9d9bfabede9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French government survives no-confidence votes on expenditure part of 2026 budget</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-government-survives-no-confidence-votes-expenditure-part-2026-budget-2026-01-27/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The French government survived two votes of no-confidence in parliament on Tuesday over its decision to ram through the expenditure part of the 2026 budget without giving the National Assembly the final say.

A total of 267 lawmakers voted in favour of the no-confidence motion presented by the hard-left France Unbowed together with the Greens and Communists, whereas 289 votes were required to bring down the government. Only 140 lawmakers backed a second no-confidence motion, brought by the far right.

Last week the government also survived two no-confidence motions on the spending part of the bill.

The full 2026 budget bill now goes to the Senate upper house and will then have to go back to the lower house again.

Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu is then expected to again invoke article 49.3 in the Constitution to force through the full budget for 2026, which will likely trigger further votes of no confidence.

President Emmanuel Macron's government is having to circumvent parliament after months of negotiations failed to deliver a deficit-taming finance bill that would pass in a lower house where no party has a working majority.

Lecornu says the budget deficit will not exceed 5% of national output, less than the 5.4% deficit seen in 2025 but still well above the European Union's 3% cap.

The government expects the entire budget to be definitively adopted in the first half of February.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:49:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ALVWBWLUNZNN7KMZ5IHD6MOGBQ.jpg?auth=f9a035a92d95974a7f183c1a2e7ec3cd17d24a02bd510b930a29c42c53734f90&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu survives no-confidence votes as budget moves forward</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260127-french-pm-lecornu-survives-no-confidence-votes-as-budget-moves-forward</link><description>The French ‍government on Tuesday survived two ​votes of no-confidence in parliament over its decision ⁠to ram through the expenditure part of the 2026 budget without giving the National Assembly, France's lower house, the final say.

A total of 267 ​lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favour of the no-confidence motion ‍presented by the hard-left France Unbowed party together with the Greens and Communists, whereas ​289 votes were required to bring down the government.

​Only 140 lawmakers backed a second no-confidence motion, brought by the far right National Rally party.

The motions came days after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu weathered two separate, largely symbolic no-confidence challenges on Friday, triggered by his decision to ram through the income section of the 2026 state budget without a parliamentary vote.

He then announced he would do the same with the expense part of the budget, prompting the hard left to file another no-confidence motion.

The National Assembly on Tuesday rejected that motion, along with a separate one tabled by the far right.

Lecornu on Tuesday defended his decision, touting what he called a "breakthrough" budget that would boost defence spending by €6.5 billion ($7.78 billion) and urging a "long-term" view.

The bill must now be reviewed by the upper house before returning to the lower house National Assembly for final adoption.

He will have to use the same constitutional power to force the whole bill into law, which will expose him to more no-confidence votes.

The decision to use the constitutional tool known as Article 49.3 marked an about-face for Lecornu, who pledged last year to seek parliament's approval, in a bid to avoid the fate of his two predecessors who were ousted over budget negotiations.

Trump officials quickly painted the two recently shot dead - Renee Good and Alex Pretti - as aggressors and said the shootings were justified. But video and other evidence soon emerged that contrasted sharply with these accounts, fueling questions about the credibility of federal officials and doubts about their willingness to fully investigate these and other incidents.

The Reuters review included these two incidents and four others in recent months that, collectively, show a pattern in which officials rushed to defend immigration officers without waiting for key facts to emerge – in what former immigration officials called a clear break with past practice for federal agencies in such situations.

These initial representations have been challenged by video footage or other evidence, sometimes in court. In one non-lethal shooting in Minnesota, court documents emerged showing the incident began with a case of mistaken identity. A death in a detention center that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security described as an attempted suicide was later ruled a homicide by a county medical examiner.

"They are trying to control a narrative from the very start, and they don't seem to care when they're proven wrong," said David Lapan, who was the DHS press secretary in 2017, during Trump's first administration.

In response to a Reuters request for comment, DHS pointed to previous statements about the incidents involving their officers, stressing the need for officer safety as they carry out Trump's crackdown.

"We have seen a highly coordinated campaign of violence against our law enforcement," DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, adding that the department aims to "give swift, accurate information to the American people."

Here is a look at six incidents in Minneapolis, Chicago and Texas:

After Pretti, 37, was shot and killed during an encounter with U.S. Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement noting that Pretti was carrying a firearm but did not say that it remained holstered. The statement said the encounter “looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

DHS said Pretti “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun” in a post on the social network X, sharing a photo of the alleged weapon.

“The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted,” DHS said.

White House aide Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, said on X that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin.”

Video of the encounter verified by Reuters showed Pretti holding a cell phone and not a gun as he was wrestled to the ground by the agents. Video evidence also showed that an officer removed Pretti’s gun from his body shortly before the first shots were fired. He had a legal permit to carry the weapon.

In response to a Reuters request for comment on Monday, DHS said in a statement that Pretti “committed a federal crime while armed as he obstructed an active law enforcement operation” and that the situation was “evolving.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing on Monday that Trump "wants to let the investigation continue and let the facts lead."

Homeland Security described Good, the 37-year-old woman shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis on January 7, as a “violent rioter” who had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them - an act of domestic terrorism.” It said the officer who killed her “saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”

Trump said Good “ran over the ICE officer,” who he said shot her in self-defense.

Videos of the shooting taken from several vantage points – including cell phone video recorded by the officer who shot Good – conflicted with those claims .

The videos show Good in her car as agents rushed up toward her as her vehicle partly blocked the street. One of the agents, Jonathan Ross, positioned himself near the front of her car; another was standing by the driver-side window. The videos show the car moving forward, its wheels turned away from Ross, who drew his weapon and fired three shots at Good as her car went past, killing her.

Video reviewed by Reuters appeared to show Ross and the vehicle making contact, but Reuters could not determine whether Ross touched the vehicle or if it struck him.

On January 15, DHS said officers “were conducting a targeted traffic stop” in Minneapolis for Venezuelan immigrant Julio Sosa-Celis when he sped away, crashed his car and fled on foot to an apartment building.

DHS said at the time that Sosa-Celis and two other men hit an ICE officer who pursued him with a snow shovel and broom handle, prompting the shooting.

Court documents unsealed last week , opens new tab told a different story.

An FBI affidavit said the ICE officers had scanned a license plate registered with a different person suspected of an immigration violation, leading them to chase the wrong person before the alleged assault and shooting.

The affidavit said another man was driving the car and was the sole occupant - not Sosa-Celis. The car's actual driver - another Venezuelan immigrant - crashed and fled to an apartment building where Sosa-Celis was present, it said.

At the apartment building, an ICE officer trying to detain the car's driver was struck by him and Sosa-Celis with a broom – and a third man with a shovel – before the officer fired his weapon, the FBI affidavit said.

While DHS said initially that the officer “fired a defensive shot to defend his life” during the ambush, the FBI affidavit said the alleged attackers dropped the broom and shovel when they saw the officer draw his gun and were fleeing toward the apartment as he fired.

Robin Wolpert, an attorney representing Sosa-Celis, said he would plead not guilty if indicted.

Wolpert said the affidavit established that the ICE officer shot Sosa-Celis from 10 feet away as he was fleeing, which showed the officer "was not in immediate danger."

DHS did not address the FBI affidavit with the different account of the incident when asked for comment.

When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced the death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos in a Texas detention center on January 3, it said he experienced “medical distress” and that the incident was being investigated.

A January 15 report , opens new tab in the Washington Post said the El Paso County medical examiner’s office was likely to rule it a homicide, with the preliminary cause of death “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression.” The Post cited a witness who said guards were choking Lunas, who said he could not breathe, details that were absent from ICE’s statement.

DHS issued a new statement after the article was published that said Lunas tried to commit suicide and then resisted security officers and died.

The medical examiner released a report last week that found the death was a homicide due to asphyxia from neck and torso compression, according to the Post.

The death was one of six deaths in ICE detention in January, an unusually high number.

A federal judge wrote in a November opinion restricting immigration agents' use of force in Chicago that the government’s “widespread misrepresentations call into question everything that defendants say they are doing in their characterization” of the crackdown.

In one instance, Homeland Security posted on X that “rioters surrounded law enforcement” and “attacked” a van carrying detainees, an encounter that escalated until someone threw a rock at Border Patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino, hitting him in the head. Five days later, Bovino said in court that the rock had not hit him when he first deployed tear gas.

“It did almost hit me,” he said.

U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis said Bovino “lied multiple times” about why he needed to throw a tear gas canister at protesters.

Neither DHS nor Bovino responded to requests for comment about the incident and the comments by Ellis.

In the same case, Ellis also questioned authorities’ claims that they needed to use tear gas so that they could leave the scene of another operation in October, saying the agents themselves had prolonged the encounter through their actions.

“Every minor inconsistency adds up, and at some point, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything” the government said, Ellis wrote.

Homeland Security said in a statement after the ruling that officers were facing “rioters, gangbangers and terrorists” and that they had shown “incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated.”

GOVERNMENT DROPS CASE AGAINST U.S. CITIZEN SHOT BY BORDER AGENT

On October 4, Homeland Security said that several drivers “rammed” law enforcement officers in Broadview, a Chicago suburb where an immigration detention center has been the site of clashes between protesters and immigration agents.

DHS said one of the drivers, a woman, was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon” and that law enforcement was “forced to deploy their weapons and fired defensive shots at an armed U.S. citizen.”

The woman, U.S. citizen Marimar Martinez, was shot by an agent five times. She survived and was indicted on charges of impeding a federal officer with a deadly weapon.

The officer later boasted of his marksmanship in text messages shared in court.

Martinez's lawyer, Christopher Parente, told the court that footage from one of the agents' bodycams contradicted the DHS account. Martinez, 30, said that one of the agents actually rammed her vehicle with his.

Parente told Reuters Martinez left her gun in her purse on the passenger seat and never brandished it. DHS was wrong about the location of the incident – it occurred in the Chicago neighborhood of Brighton Park, not Broadview.

On November 20, government prosecutors asked the court to dismiss the case against Martinez, saying it was “reviewing new facts and information” from the months-long operation.

DHS referred any questions about federal charges to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 20:48:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PX3XXPERHNIIHKEFDE5FP535NA.jpg?auth=730e1f96ea241489166457290dcfb817367e19ec63ce23da58d720c217fc9f2a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli military rules out 'infiltration' incident on Jordan border</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-rules-out-infiltration-incident-jordan-border-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Israeli military said on Tuesday that it has no concern over a security incident near the border with Jordan after it identified around 10 suspects who approached Israel in a "suspicious and rapid" manner.

The storm started to develop on Friday and dumped snow across a large region over the weekend. The snow snarled road traffic and led to widespread flight cancellations and power outages before subsiding Monday, leaving behind bitter cold that is expected to linger.

By Tuesday, cities were mobilizing emergency responders and resources to ensure that residents, particularly homeless people, were safe, even as more than 550,000 homes and businesses across the country lacked electricity .

Ten of the storm's fatal victims were in New York City, where temperatures were the coldest they had been in eight years, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said at a news conference on Tuesday, when the low hit 8 degrees Fahrenheit.

While the 10 victims were found outside, it was not clear whether they were homeless. Mamdani told reporters Monday that some of the dead "had had interactions with our shelter system in the past. It is still too early to share a broader diagnosis or a cause of death."

New York City postponed from this week until early February an annual count of its homeless population required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development

"Outreach workers should be focused on bringing New Yorkers inside, not on data collection," Mamdani said. "Here is the bottom line, New York City: Extreme weather is not a personal failure."

Around 500 of the more than 4,000 homeless people estimated to live in the city's streets and subway have been placed in shelters since January 19, Mamdani said. Outreach workers were checking every two hours on 350 homeless people who are at particular risk due to underlying medical conditions.

In Nashville, Tennessee, a city of about 680,000 where more than 135,000 homes and businesses remain without power, the temperature is expected to drop to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by Wednesday morning with below-zero wind chills.

"Let's be clear about what this is," Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell said at a Tuesday press conference. "It is an historic ice storm."

Nashville officials said about 1,400 homeless people had filled all three of the city's homeless shelters and two overflow shelters, with police and firefighters working overtime and emergency workers checking the streets.

The Nashville Rescue Mission, a homeless charity that feeds, clothes and offers shelter year-round, typically might have about 400 people a night, but in the cold snap that number has swollen to about 7,000.

"We're always full, but we never turn anyone away," an attendant who was not authorized to speak to reporters so did not give a name told Reuters by telephone. "When the weather is bad, people come in out of the cold."

Across the country, storm-related causes of death ranged from hypothermia and exposure to cardiac incidents while clearing snow.

In Bonham, Texas, about 55 miles northeast of Dallas, three young boys died after falling in an ice pond over the weekend, though the exact circumstances were unclear, according to the local fire department.

Several hours away in Austin, Texas, a person died of apparent hypothermia while trying to shelter at an abandoned gas station, authorities said. Other hypothermia deaths were reported from Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Michigan, local media reported.

Almost 200 million Americans remain under some form of winter cold warning at least through February 1.

Forecasters are watching for another possible winter storm to impact the eastern U.S. this weekend, said David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:19:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KEJ2DPLQXVP6HBN2VTUY3KR25Q.jpg?auth=8ddeea3a49df239d29d430007ac1d07cadd6b976e2f876b1b98b6d718769f1ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says 'Cuba will be failing pretty soon'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-cuba-will-be-failing-pretty-soon-2026-01-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday "Cuba will be failing pretty soon," adding that Venezuela , once the island's top supplier, has not recently sent oil or money to Cuba .</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:20:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QNPVODQV6FOCBDJIC4M5DDUMIQ.jpg?auth=a68c574de27116967628ee687541e24ef0eee52f8d91701de9733d5f886b3ea2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Doomsday Clock' moves closer than ever to midnight, a year into Trump's term</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-doomsday-clock-moves-closer-than-ever-to-midnight-a-year-into-trump-s-term</link><description>The "Doomsday Clock" representing how near humanity is to catastrophe on Tuesday moved closer than ever to midnight as concerns mount on nuclear weapons , climate change and disinformation.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which set up the metaphorical clock at the start of the Cold War , moved its time to 85 seconds to midnight – four seconds closer than a year ago.

The announcement comes a year into President Donald Trump 's second term, in which he has shattered norms – ordering unilateral attacks abroad, deploying force at home in defiance of local authorities and withdrawing from a slew of international organisations.

Russia, China, the United States and other major countries have "become increasingly aggressive, adversarial and nationalistic", said a statement announcing the clock shift, determined after consultations with a board that includes eight Nobel laureates.

"Hard-won global understandings are collapsing, accelerating a winner-takes-all great power competition and undermining the international cooperation critical to reducing the risks of nuclear war, climate change, the misuse of biotechnology, the potential threat of artificial intelligence and other apocalyptic dangers."

The Doomsday Clock board warned of heightened risks of a nuclear arms race, with the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia set to expire next week.

"For the first time in over half a century, there will be nothing preventing a runaway nuclear arms race," Daniel Holz, a University of Chicago physicist who chairs the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, told a virtual news conference.

Trump has threatened to resume nuclear testing and is pushing a costly "Golden Dome" missile defence system that would further militarise space.

The board members also voiced alarm over Trump's crackdown in Minnesota, where he has deployed a phalanx of masked, armed anti-immigration agents who have aggressively repressed protesters and shot dead two people.

"History has shown that when governments become unaccountable to their own citizens, conflict and misery follow," Holz said.

The board also noted record emission levels of carbon dioxide, the key driver of the planet's warming temperatures, as Trump sharply reverses US policy on fighting climate change and a number of other countries have backtracked in turn.

Underpinning the threats, board members warned of a dangerous fracturing of global trust.

"We are living through an information Armageddon – the crisis beneath all crises – driven by extractive and predatory technology that spreads lies faster than facts and profits from our division," said Maria Ressa , the Filipina investigative journalist and Nobel Peace Prize winner who faced intense pressure from iron-fisted former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte , now awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court.

Ressa pointed to Trump's use of force in Minnesota and threats to seize Greenland as examples of losing "the battle for information integrity" with memes turning into reality.

"The men who control the platforms that shape what billions believe have merged with the men who control governments and militaries," she said.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, founded by Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer and other nuclear scientists at the University of Chicago, initially placed the clock at seven minutes to midnight in 1947.

It was moved closer last year but by only one second, amid guarded hopes on newly reinaugurated Trump's promises to pursue peace and cooperation.

"The problem is that rhetoric has not matched actions at all," said Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the Bulletin.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:22:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6bd48a44-74cb-11f0-956c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/e0e11439ebae56a9cb7969dbcb3b4892be931faf.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dutch politicians reach agreement on rare minority government, NOS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/dutch-politicians-reach-agreement-rare-minority-government-nos-reports-2026-01-27/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Leaders of political parties in the Netherlands have agreed to form a rare minority government, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported on Tuesday citing sources close to the parties.

"I'm hearing that the Great Country of Iraq might make a very bad choice by reinstalling Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos. That should not be allowed to happen again. Because of his insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq," Trump wrote.

He added that the country, without U.S. help, would have "zero" chance of success.

Trump's comments are the starkest example yet of the Republican president's campaign to curb Iran-linked groups' influence in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

Reuters was not able to immediately reach Maliki for comment.

His warning comes days after the alliance of Shi'ite political blocs that hold a majority in Iraq's parliament picked Maliki, who previously served two terms as the country's prime minister, for the post.

As part of Trump's pressure campaign, Washington has also threatened senior Iraqi politicians with U.S. sanctions targeting the Iraqi state should armed groups backed by Iran be included in the next government, Reuters reported last week.

Maliki is a senior figure in the Shi'ite Islamist Dawa Party. His tenure as Iraq's prime minister from 2006 to 2014 was a period marked by sectarian violence, a power struggle with Sunni and Kurdish rivals, and growing tensions with the U.S.

He stepped down after Islamic State seized large parts of the country in 2014 but has remained an influential political player, leading the State of Law coalition and maintaining close ties with Iran-backed factions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:46:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TUXWTCCMYVJRVF5ALDR7PHQBDM.jpg?auth=8c94d741fbb0124e7a4cf674379823d6481cb17e0c378d2f564a0f28dfa4f781&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘We are just not stopping’: How Minnesotans turned the tables on ICE</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-we-are-just-not-stopping-how-minnesotans-turned-the-tables-on-ice</link><description>On the streets of the Twin Cities, Minnesotans have turned the surveillance state inside out. As thousands of masked, armed and armoured Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents continue to seize and detain people accused of lacking the legal status to live and work in the US, they find themselves followed and filmed at every turn by thousands of volunteers monitoring their every move.

Bound by the hope that the weight of public scrutiny will keep their neighbours safe from harm, these observers have taken to the streets to record and document the massive ICE deployment dubbed “Operation Metro Surge”, a weeks-long action that has sent some 3,000 federal agents to the North Star state.

Since December, these officers have arrested around 3,400 people through traffic stops as well as militarised raids on homes and workplaces . Many of those taken have been sent to an overcrowded detention centre on the other side of the country in Texas.

By holding these faceless agents fixed in a smartphone’s unflinching eye, many of those mobilising on the streets of Minneapolis and Saint Paul hope to one day hold their agencies accountable for their actions.

Watch more Above the law? Outrage over ICE killings in Minneapolis

These observers are only the most visible sign of a surge in non-violent resistance to ICE’s operations that has brought community and faith-based organisations, trade unions and centres for immigrant workers together in response to the raids.

As workers stay home for fear of being stopped by ICE during their commute and schools switch to remote learning as parents pull their children from class, many of these groups have set up mutual aid networks to deliver groceries and supplies straight to their doors.

Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation that brings together unions representing some 80,000 workers, said that Minnesotans’ readiness to turn out in force has its roots in the widespread demonstrations that followed the 2020 police killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd .

“This isn't the first time Minneapolis has had to respond in a powerful way under the watchful eye of the entire nation,” she said. “We're coming up on six years now, almost, of the murder of George Floyd in our communities, and we were just getting back to vibrancy and feeling like we had rebuilt from that crisis."

Glaubitz Gabiou said the aftermath of Floyd's murder laid the groundwork for how Minnesota residents would organise in the future.

In the years since, "our community groups, our unions have never ceased to continue to try to work together and create inflection points", she explained. "So we have a high level of trust. We don't all agree on everything that we're working on together here, but we know we cannot be fractured – and that we have to do this together.”

Somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 people took part on Friday in what some organisers – though not the unions, many of whom have “no-strike” clauses in their collective bargaining agreements – dubbed a general strike following the fatal shooting of poet and mother Renee Good. Some 700 hundred businesses also closed their doors for the day of action.

ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Good three times as she drove away from a traffic stop – a shooting that quickly spread across social media, filmed from several different angles.

As the ICE operation drags on, unions and community organisations continue to organise regular trainings on nonviolent direct action , as well as “constitutional observer” trainings that encourage participants to document law enforcement interactions – without, the trainers stress, obstructing or escalating the situation.

Glaubitz Gabiou said that the urgency of recording what was happening on the streets was hammered home during the starkly partisan coverage of the protests that followed Floyd’s killing.

“There have been a lot of untruths, even going back to George Floyd and a lot of things that have happened in our community without the cameras rolling,” she said. “And so now that the cameras are rolling … this is about people telling the truth. People are making up lies … they're trying to make you not believe what you’re seeing with your own eyes – and it cost a life. But we need to tell people, ‘Believe what you are seeing. This is what is happening.’ And that person should still be here with us today.”

That person, of course, is Alex Pretti . Pretti, a registered intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital and a member of the American Federation of Government Employees union, was shot dead by a federal Border Patrol officer on Saturday while filming ICE agents with his phone.

After standing between a woman and the agent that pushed her down, Pretti was dragged to the ground, disarmed of the handgun he was legally entitled to carry and shot 10 times .

“Our union members and our workers are a part of this amazing, beautiful constitutional observer network that is out filming what is happening in our communities – and it got one of our union members killed on Saturday,” Glaubitz Gabiou said.

In the wake of Pretti’s killing, senior figures within the Trump administration insisted the agents had been acting in self-defence . Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, a staunch advocate for militarised mass deportations , both accused Pretti of being a “ domestic terrorist ” without offering any evidence to support their claims.

Then commander-at-large for the US Border Patrol, Gregory Bovino, accused Petti of attempting to “ massacre ” the ICE agents. As more and more footage of the shooting made its way onto social media, these claims quickly fell apart. Bovino was later transferred from Minneapolis.

Stephanie Schwartz, assistant professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said that on-the-ground efforts to record ICE’s often brutal encounters with the public might not necessarily find the audience they needed.

“I think we need to be mindful of what we see, what is algorithmically put on my feed and other’s feeds, and how we already know  – and there's been reporting – on how some of those images have been altered.

Not only are today's algorithms highly personalised, she notes, but fake images made with AI are more prevalent than ever.

"So we don't necessarily know what different audiences are seeing,” she said.

“There is an effort from folks on the ground in Minnesota – and this is so exceptionally important – to provide that kind of ... truth of images and description of what is actually happening, contrary to some of the distorted images that have been circulated, including by government accounts.”

The footage of federal immigration agents shooting two people dead seems to have fuelled more significant opposition to Trump’s agenda. Senate Democrats have said they will not vote for a spending bill this week that would further fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both ICE and CBP.

Blocking the package would lead to a partial government shutdown – although both agencies would likely continue operating , with last year’s "One Big Beautiful Act" having already allocated $170 billion over four years for immigration enforcement.

Schwartz said that despite the deepening public backlash to Trump’s high-profile campaign of mass deportations, the administration's continued efforts to swell the ranks and budget of ICE was not just about cracking down on undocumented migrants.

“The question of whether that spectacle is backfiring for the administration – I don't think so,” she said. “I think that if we take a step back and look at what the goals are here, it’s to consolidate executive power. And they've consolidated executive power in a number of other ways that are unrelated to immigration. But what immigration does through organisations or arms of the federal government, like Customs and Border Protection and ICE, is give them coercive power and the threat of the use of force.”

She cited a letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , urging him to allow the Department of Justice access to the state’s voter rolls in return for putting an end to ICE’s crackdown. Critics say voter data could be used to cast doubt on future election results or disenfranchise certain voters.

While resisting at the grassroots level is important, Schwartz said, more action is needed among the political class.

“What we need is leadership to attenuate the broader structure of how the executive is using ICE and immigration enforcement to consolidate power,” Schwartz said. “So, for example, that starts with funding for ICE and an evaluation of ICE’s mission. I wouldn't say that [the public response in Minnesota] is not an important counterweight – it’s an absolute necessity. But it is not sufficient with these broader patterns in mind.”

In the Twin Cities, the struggle continues. Glaubitz Gabiou said that Pretti’s killing had only galvanised a public already set on holding ICE to account for a crackdown that has now claimed the lives of at least two Minnesotans.

“It's having the opposite of a chilling effect,” she said. “After the murder of Renee Good, the desire for our non-violent direct-action trainings and our constitutional observer trainings went through the roof. We are training thousands of people across this community every day, and as quickly as we can get the trainings up and staffed and posted, they are filling up."

The momentum is on the side of the protesters, she said.

“I think this is why you're starting to see some of the cracks in the administration now – because we just are not stopping.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:47:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/38b74538-fbb8-11f0-843d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26025054091259.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim: party congress to unveil plans for nuclear-war deterrent, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-party-congress-unveil-plans-nuclear-war-deterrent-kcna-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the upcoming congress of the ruling Workers' Party will unveil next-stage plans for further strengthening the country's nuclear war deterrent, KCNA state news agency reported on Wednesday.

Kim directed a successful test of a large-caliber multiple-rocket launch system on Tuesday, KCNA said. The drill demonstrated significant upgrades to the weapon's strike power, mobility and accuracy, it quoted him as saying.

It is an important policy of the ruling Workers' Party to build a reliable offensive capability and deterrence strategy to thwart an enemy attempt to spark an armed conflict, he said.

"This test will be a source of excruciating mental agony and serious threat to the forces that attempt to provoke a military confrontation with us," Kim said.

South Korea and Japan on Tuesday condemned the launch of possible short-range ballistic missiles by the North towards the sea off its east coast. North Korea has defied a United Nations ban against it on ballistic missile development.

Kim did not elaborate on his comment about the upcoming congress of the ruling party, which is expected to take place some time in the next several weeks. The country has not announced the dates.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:25:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OF65KDY5PRITDMBVW6QN3EBLIE.jpg?auth=79973233e322340a5e34ad730dec006776781f38877c4f3df78b33fad77c2cca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nicaraguan court finds long-time Ortega adviser guilty of money laundering</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/nicaraguan-court-finds-long-time-ortega-adviser-guilty-money-laundering-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - A Nicaraguan court declared Bayardo Arce, a long-time ally and economic adviser to President Daniel Ortega, guilty of money laundering, the Nicaraguan Attorney General’s Office said in a statement on Tuesday.

Arce, who was also one of the nine Sandinista commanders that governed the Central American nation in the 1980s, was found guilty alongside his personal assistant, Ricardo Bonilla. Arce's wife and her brother, who are both in exile, were named as co-conspirators in the scheme.

Arce has been imprisoned for six months, after he was detained in July . The ruling against him comes three days after his family from exile told newspaper El Pais that he had been arrested without a warrant, held incommunicado and subjected to mistreatment, and now fear for his life due to his age and serious health conditions.

According to the family, Arce was not formally charged or brought before a judge. Nicaragua's government has not said when or if Arce faced a trial, and on Tuesday did not provide a sentence.

Judges said the defendants ran a long-running $2.71 billion money-laundering scheme that involved tax fraud and used shell companies, bank accounts and financial transactions to hide the origin and destination of funds.

Arce had been the last of the Sandinista commanders to back Ortega, who has increasingly been cracking down on dissidents and isolating the country from global diplomacy.

Relatives told El Pais that Arce is a political prisoner caught in an internal purge led by Ortega's wife Rosario Murillo against figures seen as obstacles to a family succession of power. Murillo now holds the role of co-president alongside Ortega.

Murillo, who also serves as the government's spokesperson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:25:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French ex-senator found guilty of spiking MP's drink to sexually assault her</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260127-french-ex-senator-found-guilty-of-spiking-mp-s-drink-to-sexually-assault-her</link><description>A French court Tuesday found a former senator guilty of drugging a woman lawmaker with ecstasy with intent to sexually assault her, and sentenced him to four years in prison, of which 18 months must be behind bars.

The high-profile trial of former senator Joel Guerriau comes months after France was stunned by a case that saw Frenchman Dominique Pelicot jailed for 20 years for repeatedly drugging his then-wife so he and dozens of strangers could rape her.

Guerriau, 68, has been on trial since Monday for allegedly using a synthetic drug known as MDMA or ecstasy to spike a glass of champagne that National Assembly MP Sandrine Josso was drinking in November 2023.

Josso said shortly after late Tuesday's verdict that it was a "huge relief". Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal.

French prosecutors had sought a four-year prison sentence for the former senator, who described the drugging of his friend of 10 years as an accident and called himself an "idiot".

Guerriau, who has denied any sexual motivation against Josso, resigned from the upper house in October. He was expelled from the centre-right Horizons party soon after.

On Monday, a visibly distressed Josso, 50, said she thought she would die after going to see Guerriau at his apartment in the French capital's chic 6th district.

She told the Paris court that she had gone to see Guerriau "with a light heart to celebrate his re-election. As the evening went on, I discovered an attacker".

She was the only guest at his Paris home that evening, and after he poured her a glass in the kitchen, she noted it tasted sweet and sticky.

"I thought maybe it was a bad champagne. Then he insisted that we toast again. I found that odd," she said in court.

Josso described soon feeling unwell with a racing heart rate, and she left hurriedly before going to hospital.

A toxicology report revealed a high dose of the drug in her blood and ecstasy was also found at Guerriau's flat.

Her lawyer, Arnaud Godefroy, said the lawmaker has struggled with the consequences of what had happened to her.

"Six months off work, physical treatment, psychological and psychiatric follow-up, nightmares, flashbacks, dissociation," said Godefroy.

Josso said she had to have four teeth removed because of the stress that caused her to grind her teeth.

Guerriau said he had poured the powdered ecstasy into a glass the day prior to their celebration to help calm a panic attack, but then decided against taking it, placing the glass back in the cupboard.

"In short, I am an idiot," he concluded.

Earlier Tuesday, prosecutor Benjamin Coulon argued that Guerriau "deliberately placed" MDMA in Josso's champagne and requested a five-year ban from public office.

He also demanded that the former senator be placed on the sex offenders' register, in addition to the jail term.

Guerriau, who served as a senator from 2011 to 2025, had voted for the law creating the offence of administering a harmful substance with intent to commit rape or sexual assault , Coulon said.

The prosecutor stressed that, as an elected official, Guerriau was duty-bound to "set an example".

But he also said that Guerriau had no criminal record and had "devoted part of his life to the functioning of French democracy".

The centrist politician "did not act on his intentions, it is true, no gestures were made towards Ms Josso, but he did administer drugs to her with the aim of raping her", argued Coulon.

If he drugged her, he said ironically, was it "to steal her wallet?"

One of the politician's lawyers, Henri Carpentier, said that as soon as the case came to light, "the emotion was unanimous, the disgust legitimate".

"Emotion is a bad adviser, it erases all nuance," he warned.

France last year adopted the principle of consent into the definition of the crime of rape, following other European countries like the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7c975106-fad9-11f0-8ad3-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026473862799.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netanyahu vows to disarm Hamas, demilitarise Gaza after last hostage returned</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260127-netanyahu-vows-to-disarm-hamas-demilitarise-gaza</link><description>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel would shift its focus to disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza following the return of the last hostage from the Palestinian territory.

He added that no reconstruction work would take place in Gaza until those two objectives were achieved.

Netanyahu also vowed to block the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza, insisting Israel would maintain security control over both the territory and the occupied West Bank, despite widening international recognition of Palestinian statehood.

The US-sponsored Gaza ceasefire plan, in effect since October 10, stipulated the return of all hostages held in the territory under its first phase, and Hamas’s disarmament under the second.

“Now we are focused on completing the two remaining tasks: disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza of weapons and tunnels,” Netanyahu said during a televised press conference.

“It will be done the easy way or it will be done the hard way. But in any case it will happen.

“I’m hearing even now claims that Gaza’s reconstruction will be allowed before demilitarisation – this will not happen,” he said.

Militants took 251 hostages during the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the Gaza war . Israeli forces on Monday brought home the remains of the last captive, Ran Gvili.

Though Hamas said the return of Gvili’s body showed its commitment to the ceasefire deal, it has so far not surrendered its weapons.

The group has repeatedly said disarmament is a red line, but has also suggested it would be open to handing over its weapons to a Palestinian governing authority.

In his remarks on Tuesday, Netanyahu said the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza “hasn’t happened and it will not happen”, claiming credit for having “repeatedly blocked” the implementation of a two-state paradigm.

The war in Gaza, which has left much of the territory in ruins, has accelerated international calls for Palestinian statehood, with several Western countries last year formally recognising a Palestinian state.

But Netanyahu insisted Israel would continue to “exercise security control from the Jordan River to the sea, and that applies to the Gaza Strip as well”.

The premier also alluded to recent remarks by US President Donald Trump on Iran, which he has previously threatened to attack over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.

The United States has deployed an aircraft carrier strike group to the region, prompting warnings from Iran that it would not hesitate to defend itself.

“President Trump will decide what he decides; the State of Israel will decide what it decides,” Netanyahu said.

But, he added, “if Iran makes the grave mistake of attacking Israel, we will respond with a force that Iran has never seen”.

Trump told the Axios news site on Monday that the United States had “a big armada next to Iran”, but said he believed talks were still an option.

“They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions,” he said.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian criticised US “threats” in a call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday, saying they were “aimed at disrupting the security of the region”.

Israel fought a 12-day war with Iran last June, striking military targets across the country and killing a number of the Islamic republic’s senior military leaders and nuclear scientists.

Iran responded with ballistic missile attacks targeting Israeli cities.

The United States briefly joined the conflict with strikes on key nuclear facilities before declaring a ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 23:25:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1c0f4b12-fbcf-11f0-bacf-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25363751835660.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US intelligence raises doubts about Venezuela leader's cooperation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-intelligence-raises-doubts-about-venezuela-leaders-cooperation-2026-01-28/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate with the Trump administration by formally cutting ties with U.S. adversaries, four people familiar with the reports said in recent days.

U.S. officials have said publicly they want the interim president to sever relations with close international allies like Iran, China and Russia, including expelling their diplomats and advisers from Venezuela.

But Rodriguez, whose swearing-in ceremony was attended by representatives of those countries early this month, has yet to publicly announce such a move. She became president after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3.

The U.S. intelligence reports said it was not clear if she is fully on board with the U.S. strategy in her country, according to the sources, who declined to be identified by name.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled on January 15 to Caracas, where he discussed the country's political future with Rodriguez. Reuters could not determine if those conversations changed the intelligence agencies' opinion.

Washington wants to rein in its foes' influence in the Western hemisphere, including in Venezuela, where Trump seeks to exploit the OPEC nation’s vast oil reserves.

If Rodriguez were to break ties with the U.S. rivals, it would open more opportunity for U.S. investment in Venezuela’s energy sector. But failure to control Rodriguez could undercut Washington’s efforts to direct the country’s interim rulers from afar and avoid a deeper U.S. military role.

The Central Intelligence Agency and the Venezuela government did not respond to requests for comment.

Asked for comment, a senior Trump administration official, who declined to be identified, said U.S. President Donald Trump "continues to exert maximum leverage" over Venezuela's leaders and "expects this cooperation to continue."

The CIA has previously assessed that officials loyal to Maduro, including Rodriguez, were best positioned to govern the country following his ouster.

But critics of Trump's Venezuela strategy have expressed doubts about the wisdom of keeping Maduro's loyalists in place as the country's interim leaders. The concerns about Rodriguez' reliability were present prior to the U.S. military operation, said two sources.

For Venezuela, the U.S. directive means abandoning its closest allies outside the region. Iran has helped Venezuela repair oil refineries while China has taken oil as repayment for debt. Russia has supplied weaponry, including missiles, to Venezuela's military.

Trump has also cited communist-led Cuba as another U.S. foe he wants Venezuela to abandon. Havana has provided security and intelligence support while receiving cut-rate Venezuelan oil.

Since Maduro's removal, Rodriguez, whose deep ties to the oil sector are crucial to keeping the country stable, has taken steps to stay in favor with Washington including releasing political prisoners and authorizing the sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States.

In a speech on Sunday, Rodriguez said she has had “enough” of U.S. intervention. Still, U.S. officials have also held positive calls with her in recent days, according to two of the sources.

The Trump administration does not see an immediate alternative to working with Rodriguez, given it has publicly backed her so strongly, two of the sources said.

But U.S. officials are developing contacts with senior military and security officials in case they decide to change their approach, a source briefed on Venezuela policy said.

The recent intelligence reports also found that opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is not currently able to run the country successfully in part because she lacks strong ties to the country’s security services or oil sector, the sources said.

Some observers and Machado's movement say it won a 2024 election that year by a huge margin, though the state backed a Maduro victory. She remains popular with Venezuelans.

Trump told reporters last week he wanted Machado “involved” in the country’s leadership, without providing details.

One person familiar with the administration’s discussions with Machado said she is well-liked by the White House and is considered a longer-term option for a leadership position in Venezuela.

The separate source briefed on Venezuela policy suggested that for now, Machado could be considered for an advisory role but no firm decision had been made. Representatives for Machado did not respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:49:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K7MFX3Z5AROMTDDXXYUQBL4UXI.jpg?auth=a20dc16f4bd5485f4989153ac1316093f4841e853f87e3a383b01cd4b45a004c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After toppling Hasina, young Bangladeshis turn back to old guard</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/after-toppling-hasina-young-bangladeshis-turn-back-old-guard-2026-01-28/</link><description>DHAKA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Dhaka University student Sadman Mujtaba Rafid defied his parents and police to join protests that toppled former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , convinced the rallies were essential to ensure democracy prevailed over dynastic rule.

But ahead of the February 12 parliamentary election - the first since the upheaval - some of Rafid’s optimism has faded.

“We dreamt of a country where all people regardless of gender, race, religion would have equal opportunity,” the 25-year-old said. “We expected policy changes and reforms, but it is far away from what we dreamt of.”

Tens of thousands of young Bangladeshis, frustrated by years of repression and a lack of jobs and economic opportunity under Hasina’s rule, poured into the streets in 2024, eager for radical change and a “New Bangladesh”.

But while the elections will deliver a government without Hasina for the first time since 2008, there has been no major reform and no new viable alternative party has emerged, according to many, leaving the battle for government mostly between former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami .

Opinion polls put the established, but tarnished, parties as frontrunners.

Reuters spoke to more than 80 students under 30, mostly in the capital Dhaka. Most expressed excitement about voting in a freer election but were disappointed with the choice of candidates.

Under 30s, popularly known as Gen-Z, drove the uprising and make up more than a quarter of Bangladesh’s 128 million voters.

“They are politically active and will in all likelihood go to vote and affect the electoral outcome,” said political analyst Asif Shahan, who teaches at Dhaka University.

Most were expected to back the newly-formed National Citizens Party (NCP), spearheaded by some of the uprising's leaders, but it has struggled for their support .

An alliance with the hardline Jamaat-e-Islami may have further undermined its appeal.

"They have lost the moral high ground,” said Shudrul Amin, a 23-year-old archaeology student at Jahangirnagar University. "Voters who wanted a ‘New Bangladesh’ free from the baggage of the past now feel they are being forced to choose between the old guard and a student‑Islamist alliance.”

Shama Debnath, a 24-year-old Hindu, said politics remained “trapped in an ‘either this or that’ framework” with no new vision or choices.

The interim government of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has also disappointed many in Gen-Z after it failed to rein in mob violence targeting journalists and minorities.

“After a year, I feel the spirit of the July revolution is completely lost,” said Hema Chakma, a 23-year-old Buddhist student. “I am not saying the previous situation was good, but I feel the violence has increased a lot and the interim government is not taking any steps."

Interviews with young Bangladeshis also betrayed unhappiness with the economy, the spark for the revolt that led to Hasina’s eventual exile in India.

NCP’s spokesperson Asif Mahmud, 27, who rose to prominence during the protests and served in Yunus’ government, said the party was constrained by being new and having mostly younger members. It also lacked resources, grassroots organisation and financial muscle, he added.

Mahmud stressed the alliance with Jamaat was strategic rather than ideological and there would be no move towards sharia law.

“We will work to fulfill expectations of the youth in the present and also in the future as promised," he said.

Despite their misgivings, most Gen-Z Bangladeshis told Reuters they remained hopeful about the election itself, where 300 seats are being contested.

There will be a simultaneous referendum on reforms to state institutions, including term limits for prime ministers, stronger presidential powers and greater independence for the judiciary and election authorities.

Willingness to vote was as high as 97% among those aged 18 to 35, with an almost even split between BNP and Jamaat, according to a recent poll by the Bangladesh Youth Leadership Center, a youth‑focused leadership platform.

“People are going to vote and that is enough,” said 26-year-old student activist Umama Fatema, a key figure in the 2024 uprising, adding that only a democratically elected “stable government” could steer Bangladesh.

For some, that means the BNP.

“Given that the new students’ party has shattered our hopes, I have decided to vote for BNP," said 25-year-old Maisha Maliha, saying she believed the country needed a strong, united political party with enough people on the ground.

Others say the Islamists should have a chance. “We have seen BNP before, so Jamaat seems like a new option,” said 20-year-old Erisha Tabassum.

Tasnim Jara, a doctor who returned from Britain to join the NCP but quit because of the Islamist alliance, is now contesting as an independent, determined to help foster what she calls a “genuinely new political culture”.

The 31-year-old spent two frantic days going door-to-door to collect the 5,000 signatures required to validate her nomination.

"The July uprising created hope that people like us, who were never part of the old political guard, could finally enter politics and change how it is practised," said Jara.

"I do believe there is hope for a genuine political alternative in Bangladesh. But it will not emerge overnight," she said.

Such efforts still resonate with some young voters.

H.M. Amirul Karim, a 25-year-old English literature student, said: "I continue to dream that even if not now, the desire for a new political structure will become a reality. I am not ready to give up.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:49:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W4XRVJP44RNX7P26R2LK7AWP5Y.jpg?auth=f09a0cd59a0cdd8a173fcd63ee5e5f90076b21cbc43ebc2579c28a38b52e0403&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN experts condemn US move to strip migrant children of legal aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/un-experts-condemn-us-move-strip-migrant-children-legal-aid-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.N. human rights experts on Tuesday denounced the Trump administration's decision last year to cut legal aid for unaccompanied children in U.S. immigration proceedings.

The condemnation came days after U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk urged the Trump administration to ensure that its migration policies respect individual rights and international law.

"Denying children their rights to legal representation and forcing them to navigate complex immigration proceedings without legal counsel is a serious violation of the rights of children," said the independent experts, who are appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The White House dismissed the experts and said it had made attempts to locate children it says were smuggled into the United States under the previous administration, without elaborating with specific examples.

"No one takes the U.N. seriously because of their extreme bias and selective outrage – they should be praising the Administration for protecting children, not lying about our policies," Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said.

In February, the U.S. Department of the Interior ordered legal service providers working with the children to stop work and cut their funding. The providers sued over the move and a federal judge later temporarily restored the funding for the program.

The cuts came amid President Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown , including an effort to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant children who entered the U.S. without their parents.

The U.N. experts called the deportations unlawful and said they breached international human rights law prohibiting the removal of vulnerable groups, including children at risk of human trafficking.

They also condemned the administration's $2,500 offer to get the unaccompanied children to voluntarily leave the U.S.

"Child-sensitive justice procedures should be guaranteed in all immigration and asylum proceedings affecting children," said the experts, who have been in contact with the U.S. government on the issue.

More than 600,000 migrant children have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or legal guardian since 2019, according to government data.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:49:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EXASSVHJ3ZO5RJ4VMQVMJ6PU6Y.jpg?auth=9a113b89c5711e05b231e2b2f6f68996e3b2174dfcc864f780fed584c0bf38cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump backs down on immigration enforcement push after Minneapolis shootings</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260128-trump-backs-down-on-immigration-enforcement-push-after-minneapolis-shootings</link><description>President Donald Trump ’s border czar, Tom Homan, met with the Minneapolis mayor and the Minnesota governor on Tuesday in a show of detente, as the White House sought to ease unrest gripping the city after two US citizens were shot dead by federal agents.

Homan was put in charge of the Minneapolis immigration enforcement surge in place of US Border Patrol "commander at large" Gregory Bovino, who sources said was being demoted and reassigned after having overseen most of Trump’s crackdowns in Democratic-led cities.

The move was part of a broader reset by the Republican president – who faces mounting political pressure – to soften his administration’s aggressive deportation tactics.

Some advisers have expressed concern that national outrage over Saturday’s killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, and the administration’s immediate defence of the agents who shot him, could derail Trump’s broader immigration agenda.

As they did after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month, some administration officials initially responded to Pretti’s killing by accusing him of "domestic terrorism," a claim belied by witness video verified by Reuters that showed he posed no threat.

Homan’s job in Minneapolis is to "recalibrate tactics" and improve cooperation with state and local officials, a source with ties to the White House said, adding: "The goal is to scale back, eventually pull out."

Speaking of the Minnesota situation on Fox News on Tuesday, Trump said his administration was "going to de-escalate a little bit."

"I don’t think it’s a pullback. It’s a little bit of a change," the president said. Asked whether he retained confidence in US Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem, whose role in the crisis brought calls for her dismissal or impeachment from leading Democrats on Capitol Hill, Trump said: "I do."

The president met with Noem, at her request, for two hours in the Oval Office on Monday evening, a source briefed on the matter confirmed.

A senior Trump administration official said Homan would move away from the broad, public neighbourhood sweeps that Bovino had conducted in Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis and other cities and adopt a more traditional, targeted approach.

In a statement, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he had reiterated to Homan his request that the enforcement action, known as Operation Metro Surge, "come to an end as quickly as possible," and that city leaders would remain in touch with Homan. The 30-minute meeting included the city’s police chief.

In a separate meeting with Homan, Governor Tim Walz said he had outlined the state’s priorities, including impartial investigations into the two shootings and a reduction in the 3,000-strong force of federal agents deployed to the city. Homan and Walz agreed to continue working toward those goals, the governor said.

Announcing his plan to send in Homan, the subject of a US Justice Department bribery probe that was abruptly closed last year, Trump on Monday sought to cast his designated "border czar" as a neutral figure in the Minnesota crisis who "knows and likes many of the people there."

In weekend talks between the president and his advisers, discussions included reducing the number of agents in Minnesota, focusing the mission more narrowly on deportations, and exploring greater co‑ordination with state authorities, according to a White House official.

The killing of Pretti, a veterans hospital intensive care nurse shot multiple times by Border Patrol agents during daytime protests, has turned into a full-blown political crisis for Trump, with even some Republicans in Congress calling for investigations.

Coupled with the January 7 shooting of Good, a mother of three, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti’s death sparked renewed anger over the heavily armed federal agents on the Minneapolis streets.

Late on Monday, Minnesota’s chief federal judge threatened to hold the acting head of ICE , Todd Lyons, in contempt for his agency’s failures to comply with court orders that some detainees receive bond hearings.

Public support for Trump’s immigration enforcement tactics appeared to be waning both before and after the Pretti shooting, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. The issue has put Republicans on the defensive ahead of November’s midterm elections , when the party’s narrow congressional majorities are at stake.

The typically combative Trump characterised private conversations with both Walz and Frey on Monday as productive, while the two Democratic leaders offered similarly positive comments, a far cry from the vitriol the sides had previously exchanged. Walz and Frey were among several Democratic state and local officials subpoenaed one week ago in a Justice Department probe into whether their opposition to Operation Metro Surge amounted to a crime.

At the White House on Tuesday, Trump expressed sympathy for Pretti’s family and said he would be "watching over" the investigation into his killing.

While Trump stood by Noem, the three top Democrats in the US House of Representatives and the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee said they would seek to initiate impeachment proceedings against her unless she was fired. Any impeachment would require some level of support from Republicans, who control the House, to move forward.

Privately, Trump has made clear to advisers he did not want to defend the agents’ actions or attack Pretti, after Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller labelled Pretti an "assassin" and Bovino suggested he intended to "massacre" officers.

Widely shared video contradicted those claims , showing Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as agents wrestled him to the ground.

It also showed officers removing a firearm from his waistband after he was subdued, seconds before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner who lived half a mile from the scene.

Speaking with reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, Trump said that Pretti "certainly shouldn’t have been carrying a gun" at the time, comments that put him at odds with gun rights groups and some Republicans .</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:50:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a58d508a-fbd6-11f0-9e8b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26024612046944.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>TikTok settles landmark social media addiction lawsuit ahead of trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260127-tiktok-settles-landmark-social-media-addiction-lawsuit-ahead-of-trial</link><description>TikTok agreed to settle a landmark social media addiction lawsuit just before the trial kicked off, the plaintiff’s attorneys confirmed.

The social video platform was one of three companies – along with Meta’s Instagram and Google’s YouTube – facing claims that their platforms deliberately addict and harm children. A fourth company named in the lawsuit , Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.

Details of the settlement with TikTok were not disclosed, and the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At the core of the case is a 19-year-old identified only by the initials “KGM,” whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials – essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury and what damages, if any, may be awarded, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

Joseph VanZandt, co-lead counsel for the plaintiff, said in a statement Tuesday that TikTok remains a defendant in the other personal injury cases, and that the trial will proceed as scheduled against Meta and YouTube.

Jury selection starts this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. It's the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. The selection process is expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day through at least Thursday.

“This was only the first case – there are hundreds of parents and school districts in the social media addiction trials that start today, and sadly, new families every day who are speaking out and bringing Big Tech to court for its deliberately harmful products,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the nonprofit Tech Oversight Project.

KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Importantly, the lawsuit claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.

“Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,” the lawsuit says.

Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.

“Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants’ products,” the lawsuit says. “They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.”

The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children , citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.

“Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,” Meta said in a recent blog post. "But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse."

A Meta spokesperson said in a statement Monday the company strongly disagrees with the allegations outlined in the lawsuit and that it's “confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.”

José Castañeda, a Google Spokesperson, said Monday that the allegations against YouTube are “simply not true.” In a statement, he said “Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work."

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal bellwether trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.

In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.

TikTok also faces similar lawsuits in more than a dozen states.

In New Mexico, meanwhile, jury selection begins next week for trial on allegations that Meta and its social media platforms have failed to protect young users from sexual exploitation, following an undercover online investigation. Attorney General Raúl Torrez in late 2023 sued Meta and Zuckerberg, who was later dropped from the suit.

Prosecutors have said that New Mexico is not seeking to hold Meta accountable for its content but rather its role in pushing out that content through complex algorithms that proliferate material that can be harmful, saying they uncovered internal documents in which Meta employees estimate about 100,000 children every day are subjected to sexual harassment on the company’s platforms.

Meta has said it uses sophisticated technology, hires child safety experts, reports content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and shares information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:50:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/33600438-d626-11f0-8f3f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-09T031523Z-863589627-RC2QCIAR4COP-RTRMADP-3-AUSTRALIA-SOCIALMEDIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador says ICE agent tried to enter consulate in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-says-ice-agent-tried-enter-consulate-minneapolis-2026-01-28/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent tried to get into Ecuador's consulate in Minneapolis on Tuesday but was prevented from entering the premises by consulate staffers, the country's Foreign Ministry said.

The attempted entry prompted the Foreign Ministry to send a "note of protest" to the U.S. Embassy in Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, demanding such incidents "not be repeated," the ministry said in a statement.

The statement carried a headline referring to the incident as an "attempted incursion into the Ecuadorean Consulate in Minneapolis by ICE agents."

It said the consulate staff members' actions to prevent ICE entry ensured the protection of Ecuadorean nationals who were in the building at the time.

The incident occurred during a mass deportation operation being conducted by some 3,000 heavily armed agents of ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol deployed to Minnesota under orders of President Donald Trump several weeks ago.

Neither the State Department nor the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, immediately responded to requests from Reuters for comment.

Ecuador's Foreign Ministry provided few other details. But eyewitnesses working in retail shops near the consulate said they saw immigration agents try to enter the building.

"I saw the officers going after two people in the street, and then those people went into the consulate and the officers tried to go in after them," said one woman, who asked not to be named, citing a fear of retribution by the federal government.

The agents "weren’t able to enter the consulate, from what I could see," she said.

Under an international treaty, a country's embassies, consular offices and other diplomatic compounds are regarded as sovereign territory of that nation, protected under diplomatic immunity from unauthorized entry by agents of other governments.

Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, Trump's immigration enforcement drive in Minneapolis has led to fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens on the streets of Minnesota's most populous city, sparking weeks of protests there and across the country.

As political pressure for a de-escalation of tensions mounted, Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, met on Tuesday with the mayor of Minneapolis and the governor of Minnesota, seeking to defuse the crisis.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 03:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/24BJC65WGJLAHDM6H4I6H3MCFA.jpg?auth=39ba8499ac6fde5ba64802fd9c16a14122e8b819fb7b08420e5b3c213ed28c86&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Search for 32 people missing in Indonesia landslide hampered by rain as death toll rises to 34</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/death-toll-indonesias-landslides-rises-34-official-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Search operations for the 32 people still missing after a landslide in Indonesia's West Java were hampered by rain on Wednesday morning, the country's disaster mitigation agency said, as it raised the death toll to 34.

The landslide hit Pasir Langu village in Bandung Barat region early on Saturday, triggered by heavy rains starting a day earlier.

The village was located in a hilly area of the province about 100 km (62.14 miles) southeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.

"It's raining in the landslide site this morning but all the rescuers are ready to continue the search, waiting for the right timing," the agency's spokesperson Abdul Muhari told Reuters.

The death toll rose to 34 from the previous count of 20. Another 23 people survived the disaster.

Twenty-three soldiers were killed while conducting border patrol training, the Indonesian Navy said on Tuesday.

It was not immediately clear whether the latest death toll included those soldiers, Muhari said.

A team is currently working at the scene to identify the bodies found by rescuers, Muhari added.

At least 800 rescuers, military and police personnel along with nine excavators have been deployed to find the remaining missing people.

Nearly 700 residents of the stricken village have been evacuated to local government buildings, the agency said earlier.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 03:45:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CHKQ67G7HFLN7N3YTWC7FUFT4M.jpg?auth=b2cd79284f51efb53594776d579b4b16d522a8ef5b7bc6a2764c02c1c9ee810c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court set to rule in bribery trial of former first lady</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-court-set-rule-bribery-trial-former-first-lady-2026-01-28/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A South Korean district court is set to deliver on Wednesday its ruling in the trial of Kim Keon Hee, the wife of ousted ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol, who could face a jail term if found guilty on charges that include bribery.

The ruling, which can be appealed by the former first lady or prosecutors, comes in a series of trials following investigations into Yoon's brief imposition of martial law in 2024 and related scandals involving the once-powerful couple.

Prosecutors demanded 15 years in jail and fines of 2.9 billion won ($2 million) over accusations that include accepting luxury Chanel bags and a diamond necklace from South Korea's Unification Church in return for political favours.

Other charges to be decided by the Seoul central district court include manipulation of stock prices and violations of political funding laws, by receiving opinion polls from a power broker in return for influencing the choice of poll candidates.

Kim "took advantage of the status of the president's spouse to receive money and expensive valuables, and has been widely involved in various personnel appointments and nominations," special prosecutor Min Joong-ki said in December.

Kim had denied all the charges.

The Unification Church said the gifts were delivered to her without expecting anything. Its leader Han Hak-ja, who is also on trial, has denied that she directed it to bribe Kim.

Yoon, who was ousted from power last April, also faces eight trials on charges including insurrection, after his failed bid to impose martial law in December 2024.

He has appealed against a five-year jail term handed to him this month for obstructing attempts to arrest him after his martial law decree.

Video showed a man surging toward the U.S. lawmaker at the lectern and spraying a stream of liquid at her. A large man immediately grabbed him and took him to the ground. Omar took a few steps toward the man with her hand raised before he was subdued and she continued her presentation after a brief break.

Minneapolis police said officers at the scene observed the man use a syringe to spray an unknown liquid at Omar. Police immediately arrested him for third-degree assault and said Omar was uninjured. Forensic scientists responded to process the scene, police said.

"He sprayed something on her," a woman at the town hall could be heard saying, while at least one woman commented on the foul odor. "I need a napkin," Omar remarked as the man was taken away, before she said, "We will continue."

Omar was criticizing ICE and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when the man charged at her and called for her to resign in the wake of the shooting death of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis in recent weeks during President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement surge.

"ICE cannot be reformed, it cannot be rehabilitated, we must abolish ICE for good, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must resign or face impeachment," Omar said as the crowd in the town hall applauded.

The man then charged at her and sprayed the liquid at her before saying: "You must resign."

Omar has frequently come under political attack from Trump, who once called her "garbage."

During a speech in Iowa on Tuesday, Trump said Omar did not love the United States.

"They have to show that they can love our country, they have to be proud," Trump said when talking about immigrants. "Not like Ilhan Omar," he added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 03:46:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C47OO74JPFJVLHCAA26RP6L244.jpg?auth=3d2f95915624fa0872124cbe19fd761d2e907d8f814cac9b53364a981263eced&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan-born pandas Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei arrive home in China's Sichuan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/japan-born-pandas-xiao-xiao-lei-lei-arrive-home-chinas-sichuan-2026-01-28/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 28 (Reuters) - China's giant pandas Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei arrived safely in Sichuan on Wednesday, China's panda research base said in a social media post, following an emotional goodbye from fans in Tokyo where the pair were born and raised.

Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei arrived at Chengdu's Tianfu International Airport on 1 a.m. on Wednesday, a WeChat post by the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda showed. They reached the centre in Ya'an, Sichuan, at 6 a.m. on Wednesday, where they will undergo quarantine.

The twin pandas were born in Tokyo's Ueno Zoo in 2021. Their parents Shin Shin and Ri Ri returned to China in 2024.

Since its founding in 1949, China has used panda diplomacy to boost its international image and cement ties with other countries by gifting or loaning out pandas. The pandas typically return home after the agreement ends, and pandas born overseas like Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei usually go to a Chinese breeding program between the age of two and four.

Pictures on the WeChat post showed the pandas' crates being unloaded from a Sichuan Airlines plane and then transported to a truck while workers in white protective suits look on.

Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei have "continuously put up bridges of friendship between the people of China and Japan" and "made a positive contribution to promoting friendship between the peoples of the two countries", the research centre said.

The panda's journey coincided with a low point in Sino-Japanese relations. In November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan would respond militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan. China, which regards Taiwan as a wayward province, reacted angrily to the comment and advised citizens against travelling to Japan .</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:44:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HDZBB5RBPNLWJK5Z74SQIMKB7Q.jpg?auth=0a0c15da3296afe5219df185236d63572475938af673420392979f3ff8635dbc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thai parties tap nationalist mood as Cambodia clashes roil rural voters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-parties-tap-nationalist-mood-cambodia-clashes-roil-rural-voters-2026-01-28/</link><description>KANTHARALAK, Thailand, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Thai lawmaker Phumin Leethiraprasert has switched party allegiances in his re-election campaign for a February 8 poll , aiming to show voters he can make tough decisions to help border communities scarred by clashes with neighbouring Cambodia.

"I am not running for Pheu Thai this time around because of the border conflict," said Phumin, 62, referring to the party of billionaire former premier Thaksin Shinawatra that dominated swathes of Thailand's mainly agrarian northeast for decades.

Nationalist sentiment has surged across Southeast Asia's second largest economy after a perception that the Pheu Thai-led administration's handling of a border crisis led to the worst fighting with Cambodia in decades, killing 149 people.

"Bombs hit our homes, and our people died," the former doctor, who has forged new ties with one of the political parties racing to harness the nationalist fervour in the final stretch of the campaign, told a small crowd at a rally.

Voters angered by the damage in his district of Kantharalak had urged Phumin to defect, he said last week.

So he is now running as a candidate of the Kla Tham Party, an ally of the ruling Bhumjaithai, which took power after the border row led to the removal of Thaksin's daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra , who was then prime minister.

Anger and anxiety linger in the area after 19 Thais were killed and hundreds of thousands evacuated from border communities, such as Kantharalak, in two bouts of fighting in July and December.

"We have to make them afraid," said Uthai, a 58-year-old in the village of Sam Meng, referring to Cambodia. "We have been too soft."

Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a second ceasefire in late December, ending weeks of clashes following the collapse of a July truce brokered with the help of U.S. President Donald Trump .

Many voters are backing the Thai army's plans for a border wall along parts of the 817-km (508-mile) land frontier, Phumin said, though construction has yet to begin.

"They don't want to see border crossings reopened or trade with Cambodia resume."

In the midst of the intense border fighting, Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul dissolved parliament in December after fewer than 100 days in power, setting the stage for snap polls, designed to gain from the wave of intense nationalism unleashed.

At rallies, Anutin and his Bhumjaithai expressed strong support for the military and the construction of the border wall, a policy echoed by other conservative, pro-army groups.

That has forced key rivals, the progressive People's Party, which is leading in the polls, and Pheu Thai, to redraw campaign planks to avoid appearing unpatriotic, said political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.

"They are being portrayed as not nationalist enough, not patriotic enough, and not anti-Cambodian enough," he said, describing the efforts of pro-military parties to undercut the competition.

The People's Party, long associated with calls for military reforms, has softened its anti-establishment stance, underlining plans to exert diplomatic pressure on Cambodia to ensure stable ties with Thailand.

Pheu Thai, facing widespread criticism over Thaksin's once- close ties with former Cambodian premier Hun Sen, is redoubling efforts to show it is committed to defend Thailand's sovereignty.

"We can live alongside them," said Samrong Narasa, whose home in the village of Sam Meng, about 10 km (6 miles) from the border, was destroyed by Cambodian shelling in December.

"But we don't want to be friends with them," added the 52-year-old, who wants the new government to do more to protect people and their livelihoods.

Under the deal, agreed between the two countries before Starmer took office, Rwanda would have been paid to take in migrants who had illegally arrived in Britain.

Rwanda's government said in a statement posted on X that it had submitted a notice to The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration, arguing Britain had breached the financial arrangements of the deal.

Rwanda said that Britain had in 2024 requested it to forgo two payments of 50 million pounds ($69 million) due in April 2025 and April 2026 in anticipation of the formal termination of the treaty underlying the deal.

The East African country said it was prepared to agree, provided that the treaty was terminated and new financial terms were negotiated and agreed.

"Discussions between Rwanda and the United Kingdom did not however ultimately take place and the amounts remain due and payable under the treaty," the government said on X.

The request, which Reuters is the first to report, is the latest sign of efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to influence health policy globally.

Anti-vaccine groups, including one founded by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have for decades claimed that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used in vaccines, is linked to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, despite many studies showing no related safety issues .

In June last year, Kennedy cut $300 million in annual funding for Gavi, which helps the world's poorest and lower-income countries buy vaccines to prevent diseases such as measles and diphtheria.

Kennedy, who has long promoted anti-vaccine views contrary to scientific evidence, says the group ignores safety issues with the immunizations it provides. Gavi says vaccine safety is its utmost concern.

“Until a plan for removal of thimerosal-containing vaccines is developed and the plan initiated, the United States will withhold future new funding,” an official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Reuters.

The official would not comment on when the request was made, but claimed Gavi has so far refused to develop such a plan. A Gavi spokesperson confirmed the request to remove thimerosal from its portfolio, and said the group remained in contact with the U.S. government on the subject.

"While we very much hope to find a pathway to welcoming the U.S. back as a donor, any decision related to Gavi’s portfolio would require a decision by Gavi’s board and input from preceding governance committees, which will be guided by scientific consensus," the spokesperson said.

Thimerosal is mainly used to ensure vaccines in multi-dose vials remain stable. That helps immunization campaigns in low- and middle-income countries because multi-dose vials are cheaper and simpler to distribute, Gavi and the World Health Organization say.

The preservative has largely been phased out in high-income countries, where vaccines usually come in a single-use format, although its use is not prohibited. Under Kennedy, the U.S. moved last summer to stop use of influenza vaccines containing thimerosal, representing around 5% of flu shots given in the country, despite U.S. health agencies having declared them safe.

The U.S. official said the request of Gavi aims to bring its policies in low- and middle-income countries in line with the U.S., Canada, and most European nations.

The safety of thimerosal has been studied for decades, after concerns were raised in the 1990s about exposure to mercury in vaccines, according to the WHO.

No compelling scientific evidence has been found to suggest that there is a risk, particularly when compared to the dangers of keeping children unprotected against deadly diseases, the WHO says.

The U.S. request applies both to the remaining $300 million that the Biden administration had pledged to Gavi with Congressional approval, but which is still outstanding, and to any future funding, the official said.

The U.S. previously contributed around 13% of Gavi’s funding, and the organization has embarked on a series of cost-cutting measures to try to address the shortfall, which has been exacerbated by cuts from other high-income nations.

The Trump administration has cut billions of dollars in health funding internationally and withdrawn from the WHO .

The U.S. government has said it is still committed to global health and is pursuing bilateral agreements with countries under Trump's ‘America First’ agenda.

Last week, the U.S. health department said a hepatitis B vaccine study in Guinea Bissau would help inform global policy.

The study, funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is now undergoing further ethical review after international criticism.

Hello and welcome to this liveblog covering the situation in Greenland.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced plans to meet the leaders of Denmark and Greenland in Paris on Wednesday for a "working lunch", aimed at reaffirming European solidarity and France’s support for Greenlandic sovereignty following US President Donald Trump 's threats to seize the Danish territory earlier this month.

Trump backed down on his threat to seize Greenland after meeting with NATO chief Mark Rutte last week.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Denmark was open to “deeper and stronger” military cooperation with the United States but stressed that Danish sovereignty was a red line.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 06:40:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b28a57b6-fc11-11f0-b9c4-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-62GL44T.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Starmer heads to China as Western alliances face strain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-starmer-heads-china-western-alliances-face-strain-2026-01-28/</link><description>EN ROUTE TO BEIJING, Jan 28 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will arrive in Beijing on Wednesday evening for a visit aimed at strengthening political and business ties with China as relations between Western countries and the U.S. become more volatile.

On the plane to China for the first visit by a British leader since 2018, Starmer said the country cannot afford to ignore the economic opportunities presented by China, the world's second-largest economy, while it must remain vigilant about potential security threats.

"It doesn't make sense to stick our head in the ground and bury it in the sand when it comes to China, it's in our interests to engage," he said. "It's going to be a really important trip for us and we'll make some real progress."

Travelling with a delegation of more than 50 business leaders, Starmer will meet with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang on Thursday before travelling to Shanghai on Friday for talks with local executives.

The visit could mark a critical shift in ties between Britain and China after years of deep acrimony over Beijing's crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong, China's support for Russia in the Ukraine war and allegations by British security services that China regularly spies on politicians and officials.

For China, the visit offers the country a chance to portray itself as a stable and reliable partner at a time of global disorder.

The trip comes at a time when there is a flurry of diplomacy between Western countries and China as they hedge against the unpredictability of the U.S.

Starmer's trip follows weeks of tensions with Trump over his threats to seize Greenland, his criticism of Britain's deal to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago - including an island with an important U.S.-UK air base - to Mauritius, and his comments that NATO allies avoided front-line combat during the war in Afghanistan.

Starmer will arrive just days after Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if that country's prime minister, Mark Carney, signed a trade deal with China.

But Starmer insisted Britain could continue to strengthen economic ties with China - without angering Trump - because of his country's long history of working closely with the U.S.

"The relationship we have with the U.S. is one of the closest relationships we hold, on defence, security, intelligence and also on trade and lots of areas," he said.

Starmer was reluctant to be drawn on what he would discuss with Chinese leaders, or if he would bring up the fate of Jimmy Lai, the former Hong Kong media tycoon who was convicted in December of national security crimes. He also declined to say whether he would ask China to pressure Russia to end the Ukraine war.

Asked if Britain and China could strike a deal that would allow more visa-free travel, Starmer said he hoped to make some "progress" in that area.

Starmer repeatedly defended his decision to visit China, saying it would help him deliver on his plan to drive economic growth and improve living standards in Britain.

But his strategy has drawn fierce criticism from some British and U.S. politicians who say he is underestimating the security threats posed by China.

Starmer distanced himself from comments made by Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week when he said the rules-based global order was a thing of the past and called on the world's middle powers to work together to avoid being victimised by American hegemony.

"I'm a pragmatist, a British pragmatist applying common sense," Starmer said, rejecting the idea that his government must choose between the U.S. and Europe.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:27:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IHG3WBBX4BJ5VOEKNEMLKAEJBM.jpg?auth=699b789340d9b7d00253c7578b740946fd2639473da0c0f50d847e58a3fc7e4d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan shows off F-16 jets rapid response amid tensions with China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/taiwan-shows-off-f-16-jets-rapid-response-amid-tensions-with-china-2026-01-28/</link><description>CHIAYI, Taiwan, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Taiwan's air force showcased its ability to rapidly replenish and get back in the air its most advanced F-16 fighter jets in a readiness drill on Wednesday, designed to demonstrate combat-oriented training.

Taiwan's air force scrambles on an almost daily basis to monitor and warn off Chinese aircraft which routinely fly around the island. Taipei views the incursions as part of an ongoing harassment campaign to test and tire out the much smaller Taiwanese forces and exert political pressure.

President Lai Ching-te's administration, as part of a defence modernisation programme, has pushed for more combat-realistic training that relies less on set-piece performances and more on simulating actual combat.

At the Chiayi air base in southern Taiwan, personnel loaded up U.S.-made AIM-9M Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM anti-aircraft missiles onto a Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab F-16V fighter jet to get the aircraft quickly back in the air.

"This ensures that, in the shortest possible time, the aircraft can complete ammunition resupply and refuelling and quickly go out on the attack," weapons loading officer Wu Bo-jhih told reporters.

Taiwan routinely holds drills ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts next month, though these are the first to take place in front of the media since China held its latest round of war games around the island in late December.

Pilot Shih Shun-de said it was important to let people know just how fast the air force can react.

"The scramble drill lets the public see the results of the air force's realistic, combat-oriented training," he said.

China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, despite the objections of the government in Taipei.

The repeated scrambling to see off China's air force also gives real-life experience for Taiwan's fighter pilots in terms of seeing China's air force and tactics up close.

During the height of the Cold War the two air forces had regular dogfights over the Taiwan Strait, but no shots in anger have been fired in decades.

Speaking at the presidential office in Taipei on Wednesday during a promotion ceremony for senior officers, Lai said that the military's training must be more practical, more flexible, and closer to real combat.

"At the same time, we must develop a range of enemy-defeating strategies with agility, using technology and artificial intelligence to build a defence force that is effective, credible, and modernised," he added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OMLGSNIGXFLBDHUVJMSMRVVU5Q.jpg?auth=f56f4d36d54947788c8cfbf6ad31566d9b20e4873eb937b33e62a34f78d93f30&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran executes man accused of spying for Israel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-executes-man-accused-spying-israel-2026-01-28/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Iran executed a man on Wednesday who was accused of spying for Israel, the Iranian judiciary's media outlet Mizan reported, naming him as Hamidreza Sabet Esmaeilipour.

The eight-page document, still subject to change, says the EU will also explore the possible transfer of defence technology to Hanoi, as both sides seek closer cooperation on "trusted" telecom networks - at a time when Chinese companies have won contracts in Vietnam's 5G development.

The statement is scheduled to be signed when the European Council President Antonio Costa meets Vietnam's leaders in Hanoi on Thursday, days after the ruling Communist Party reappointed To Lam as the country's top leader.

The two countries will upgrade diplomatic ties to Vietnam's highest level, similar to the United States, China and Russia. An EU-Vietnam free trade agreement entered into force in 2020.

While not binding, the document carries political weight and includes indirect criticism of the international strategies of the United States, China and Russia.

The European Council declined to comment on the draft document and Vietnam's government did not respond to a request for comment.

Vietnam has significant but largely untapped deposits of rare earths and gallium. Hanoi has signalled interest in developing processing capacity for rare earths, whose global supply and refining is dominated by China. But progress has been limited, in part because Vietnam lacks the technology to fully exploit its resources.

The EU and Vietnam want to promote "trade and investment in goods, services, and technologies that support sustainable mining and processing" for critical minerals, as they eye closer cooperation in the sector, the document said.

Vietnam is also a key supplier of tungsten, a hard metal used in defence and electronics, and Western diplomats have warned of the risk of Chinese interest in a major mine in Vietnam. China's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

The draft statement identifies semiconductors as another priority area for deeper cooperation, including supply chains.

Vietnam is a major player in chip packaging, testing and assembling, hosting operations by Intel (INTC.O) , opens new tab and Amkor Technology (AMKR.O) , opens new tab among others. Earlier this month Vietnam began building its first semiconductor production facility.

Suppliers of ASML (ASML.AS) , opens new tab , the Dutch global leader in chipmaking machines, have moved some production to Vietnam, and the company is exploring expanding its supply chain and supplying potential customers there, the Vietnamese government said earlier this month after a high-level meeting in Hanoi. ASML was not immediately available for comment.

Expanding cooperation on "trusted communications infrastructure" is also a priority, said the document, citing 5G and satellite connectivity. European firms Ericsson (ERICb.ST) , opens new tab and Nokia (NOKIA.HE) , opens new tab are developing Vietnam's 5G network, but last year Hanoi awarded smaller construction contracts to Chinese companies, including Huawei, despite Western concerns about security.

Both sides intend to boost security cooperation, while the EU will consider the transfer of "non-sensitive technology and know-how", the document said.

EU nations are also interested in investing in Vietnamese infrastructure, including railways, according to the document, as Vietnam wants to build a nationwide high-speed network, its largest-ever project.

EU President Costa warned of "coercive trade practices" and "challenges to sovereignty and international law" in an opinion piece published by Vietnam's state news agency on Wednesday.

The draft statement reaffirmed support for a "rules-based international order" and for strengthening the World Trade Organization, at a time when the U.S. imposes tariffs and undermines multilateral bodies.

It urged respect for "territorial integrity" and called for a "just and sustainable peace in Ukraine", which is under attack from Russia, a long-time close partner of Vietnam. It also said the two countries agreed to consider deeper maritime security cooperation, as they called for stability in the South China Sea, where China's territorial claims conflict with Vietnam's.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:29:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5C34JBJJH5PPFM47TV3YIUV7SE.jpg?auth=d5d7253068f003046e76082124e46e14ca7d2c10aeb4935b57bb095f391f7d9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones damage port infrastructure, hurt three in Ukraine's Odesa, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drones-damage-port-infrastructure-hurt-three-ukraines-odesa-governor-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - Russian drones damaged port infrastructure in Ukraine's southern region of Odesa, on the Black Sea coast, the regional governor said on Wednesday.

The White House is also evaluating whether the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents who gunned down a nurse failed to follow "clear guidance" to "create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors", deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told AFP.

"We are evaluating why the CBP team may not have been following that protocol," Miller said in a statement.

At the town hall Tuesday night, Omar had just spoken about the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and demanded that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem "resign or face impeachment," when a man sprang up from the front row, made a remark and sprayed the lawmaker, as security leapt to grab him.

Omar raised a fist and stepped toward the attacker before returning to the podium to say: "Here's the reality that people like this ugly man don't understand: We are Minnesota strong. And we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw on us."

Omar is a frequent target of President Donald Trump – who continues to defend Noem despite her oversight of federal immigration agents who shot and killed two US citizens this month, saying Noem would not step down and was doing a "very good job".

But after days of protests following 37-year-old Alex Pretti's death , Trump told Fox News "we're going to de-escalate a little bit", while adding that it was not a "pullback".

Trump also admitted that Gregory Bovino, a hardline Border Patrol commander who is now expected to leave Minneapolis , was "a pretty out-there kind of a guy" whose presence may not have helped the situation, and sent top US border security official Tom Homan to meet with officials in the city.

Trump told reporters that he rejected the "assassin" label used by a top aide to describe the 37-year-old nurse, adding that he wants "a very honorable and honest investigation".

But he criticized Pretti for carrying the licensed firearm that was taken off him before he was shot.

"I don't like that he had a gun, I don't like that he had two fully loaded magazines," the president said.

After meeting with Homan Tuesday, Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement they discussed the "serious negative impacts this operation has had on Minneapolis," and the city "will not enforce federal immigration laws."

Just weeks after federal immigration agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis, Pretti's death sparked national outrage and added to a litany of complaints of abusive tactics.

Good, a mother of three, was shot by an agent at point blank range in her car on January 7.

The killings capped months of escalating violence in which masked, unidentified, and heavily armed ICE and border patrol agents have grabbed people they accuse of violations off the streets.

Despite multiple videos showing that Pretti posed no threat, Bovino and Noem initially claimed Pretti had intent to kill federal agents, calling him a "domestic terrorist."

Republican Senator Rand Paul said Tuesday that agents involved in the shooting should be put on administrative leave, later adding that the immigration enforcement leaders would testify before the Congress next month.

Centrist Democratic Senator John Fetterman said "grossly incompetent" Noem should be fired.

The turmoil could even result in a fresh US government shutdown, with Democrats calling for broad reforms to federal immigration operations at DHS and threatening to block approval of it funding, as part of the spending bills that go up for votes in the Senate later this week.

The judicial branch also pushed back on Trump's actions in Minneapolis Tuesday, when a US judge blocked the deportation of a five-year-old boy and his father who were detained last week in another incident that went viral.

Liam Conejo Ramos – wearing a fluffy blue hat and his school backpack – was photographed being detained by a federal agent, who school officials said was using the preschool student as "bait" to draw out his family, who are asylum seekers from Ecuador .

At a protest at the Minnesota State Capitol Tuesday, veteran Brian Furgen, 55, told AFP that Americans need immigration and customs enforcement agents who "know how to do the job without harming the community, without killing people, without hurting people, without imprisoning people that are law abiding."

"That's what they are doing here, that's ridiculous."</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:29:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/68abab3e-fc04-11f0-a5e4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/4bde21b7aa4389804d7e8a26fb7000aa4bf77f13.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fire hits luxury hotel in French Alps, scores evacuated</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/fire-hits-luxury-hotel-french-alps-scores-evacuated-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Scores of people were evacuated after a fire swept through a five-star hotel in the ski resort of Courchevel in the French Alps late on Tuesday, officials said.

Officials said over 90 people were evacuated from the hotel last night, while the nearby Hotel Le Lana, which has nearly 200 guests, was also being evacuated on Wednesday morning due to risk as the fire was still ongoing. Staff and guests took refuge in other hotels, the local government said.

While Trump's policies have strained ties with traditional U.S. allies, China has turned its focus to fostering ties with key partners, including Canada and India, analysts say.

As a result, the world's second-largest economy's trade surplus hit a record $1.2 trillion in 2025, monthly forex inflows touched $100 billion, the largest ever, and the global usage of China's currency, the yuan, has expanded.

When British Prime Minister Keir Starmer lands in China on Wednesday evening hoping to reinvigorate recently strained business ties, analysts and experts say Beijing is expected to further expand its global political and economic influence.

Backed by its $20 trillion economy and $45 trillion worth of stock and bond markets, China is emerging as a "steady partner" for many countries, said Aleksandar Tomic, economics professor at Boston College.

"I think China has done a good job and rightly so to position itself as the reliable and stable trade partner," said Derrick Irwin, co-head of intrinsic emerging markets equity at Allspring Global Investments.

"They basically said, look, you've got a massive trade partner in the U.S. that's become a little more uncertain. We can offer predictability and certainty. And I think that's very fair."

Starmer's four-day visit to China will be the first by a British prime minister since 2018 and follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney earlier this month, the first Canadian prime minister to visit Beijing since 2017.

During Carney's visit the two nations signed an economic deal to tear down trade barriers and forge a new strategic relationship. Carney described China as "a more predictable and reliable partner".

But China is not alone in eyeing new trade pacts to de-risk from the United States. India and the European Union struck a long‑delayed trade deal on Tuesday that will slash tariffs on most goods, boosting two‑way trade to potentially double European exports to the South Asian country by 2032.

While the world's two largest economies have been locked in geopolitical disputes for the past few years, Trump's return to the White House in January 2025 sharply escalated tensions on multiple fronts, including trade and technology.

Trump raised tariffs on China to over 100% in April, before partially reversing and settling for a temporary truce, while Beijing boosted its exports to non-US markets and rolled out support measures for its private enterprises and markets.

Chinese shipments to the U.S. fell 20% in 2025, but rose 25.8% to Africa, 7.4% to Latin America, 13.4% to Southeast Asia and 8.4% to the European Union last year.

"Many countries previously have not been China-friendly are now kind of pivoting to China ... because the United States is becoming a lot less predictable," Tomic said. "The more the U.S. gets difficult to deal with, the more it opens up for China."

Despite the trade tensions with the U.S., China's economy, under deflationary pressure at home due to weak domestic consumption and a long-term property sector slump, has met the government's target of 5% growth in 2025.

In recent months China has taken a raft of measures to boost foreign investment, including pilot programmes in Beijing, Shanghai and other regions to expand , opens new tab market access in services such as telecoms, healthcare and education.

The country recorded the largest-ever monthly forex inflows of $100.1 billion in December, according to bank settlement data from its forex regulator. Its official forex reserves hit a 10-year high of $3.36 trillion.

Its financial market has emerged robust from trade disputes with the Shanghai index climbing 27% over the past year, outperforming U.S. equities, the market turnover hitting a record high and the yuan expanding its global usage.

With the dollar becoming less appealing to investors due to Trump's erratic approach to trade and international diplomacy, Beijing is also pushing ahead with its ambition to bolster the global usage of yuan, said bankers with knowledge of the matter.

Some of the big global banks are scrambling to boost yuan liquidity in offshore hubs and put in place frameworks for faster payment settlements in yuan in trade corridors of China and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, they added.

"We have seen quite a few cycles of China trying to internationalise yuan and then pulling back," said a banker at a global bank with China presence. "This time it's different ... Trump policies are very conducive for boosting yuan usage."

More than half of China's cross-border transactions are now settled in yuan, from almost none 15 years ago, while nearly half of China's overseas bank lending is now in renminbi, according to the latest data from the PBOC and SAFE.

But some foreign policy analysts caution against China's new, friendlier economic and political playbook.

Despite the new trade pacts, Patricia Kim, a foreign policy fellow at Washington-based Brookings Institution, said distrust of the U.S. does not translate into trust in Beijing for U.S. allies and partners.

"Many of these countries harbour deep concerns about China's approach to trade, its use of economic coercion, and unresolved maritime and historical disputes," Kim said.

"In the current moment, China may appear more restrained or pragmatic when compared with the Trump administration's extreme rhetoric and actions. But Beijing's actual behaviour has not been especially reassuring."</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 08:33:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MSPYQIX35ZJGDPLHBD55WBRDOI.jpg?auth=ab4c8da757543fb784acdeea8a69a2ac9d492c72ae53db5e35c515499dc8f838&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Record-breaking Australia heatwave fuels bushfires, cuts power to thousands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/record-breaking-australia-heatwave-fuels-bushfires-cuts-power-thousands-2026-01-28/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A record-breaking heatwave baked Australia's southeast for a fifth straight day on Wednesday, fanning bushfires and straining the power grid, leaving thousands of properties without electricity.

The heatwave is the worst seen in Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, since the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires that killed 173 people and is not expected to ease until the weekend, authorities said.

"We are now into day five of the severe to intense heatwave here in Victoria and we are starting to see some of those impacts," said Victorian Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch.

"An extreme heat warning is still in place, and we are expecting to see eight consecutive days of severe to extreme intensity heatwave."

David Crock, a forecaster from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, said the heat was being driven by climate change and called the temperatures "very unusual".

"The severity of this heatwave is comparable to the heatwave in January 2009, and also the heatwave in January 1939," Crock said.

"The data shows a long-term increase in heatwave frequency and intensity, particularly since the year 2000 due to climate change."

Crock said a host of temperature records had been broken in Victoria on Tuesday. "About 20 stations, mostly across western Victoria saw either all-time records or January records fall," he said.

Towns in the Mallee region reached a high of 48.9 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit), the hottest temperature ever recorded in the state.

The conditions in Victoria had eased slightly on Wednesday, while the upper western region of the state of New South Wales and south-western Queensland state recorded temperatures above 48 C (118 F) by the late afternoon.

Around 11,000 properties were without power in Victoria, down from 105,000 a day earlier. Firefighters were also battling six major fires, with three out of control.

A blaze at Carlisle River in the Otways region has burnt more than 11,000 hectares (27,181 acres) and destroyed at least 16 buildings.

"This fire at Carlisle River is a long way from over," said Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management Victoria.

"We are early in the summer. We'll see the heating of the environment and winds come again well before that fire is fully contained."

Many communities in the state are still recovering from large bushfires at the start of the month, also triggered by a severe heatwave. More than 400 homes and 400,000 hectares of land have been lost so far.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 08:33:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CPVEWZJN3JO4JCWOGCJWQT6KH4.jpg?auth=d064b3800463650245864564f731688ce23a0ac83b6f2c4b7b1cc9e7f4dc8e09&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Starmer spoke to Ukraine's Zelenskiy Tuesday afternoon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/britains-starmer-spoke-ukraines-zelenskiy-tuesday-afternoon-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy Tuesday afternoon, a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement.

Albanese, on his first visit as leader to Australia's northern neighbour, struck a new partnership agreement with Gusmao on Wednesday covering deeper defence ties between the two nations, border security and economic development.

The visit comes as the tiny Catholic nation, which is being courted by China, continues its push to build a liquefied natural gas plant on its south coast instead of piping the gas to a plant in the Australian city of Darwin.

After decades of delays, Australia's Woodside Energy (WDS.AX) , opens new tab and East Timor agreed in December to study a 5 million metric ton project for the Greater Sunrise fields, an area containing an estimated 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas that Australia has been discussing, initially with Indonesia, since the 1980s.

A joint statement from the two leaders, distributed by Australia, said the two countries "share an ambition for Greater Sunrise to be developed as soon as possible for the benefit of both states."

Australia said it will establish an infrastructure fund in East Timor, allocating 10% of total state revenue from the project, "funded entirely from Australia’s share of future revenue."

"This commitment will see at least a third of Australia’s revenue from the project being provided to Timor-Leste via the Infrastructure Fund," the statement said.

The statement noted East Timor's preference for the onshore processing of gas.

"Australia will support any commercially viable solution to develop Greater Sunrise proposed by the Sunrise Joint Venture consistent with the Maritime Boundary Treaty," the statement said.

The national oil company Timor Gap owns more than 56% of the field, located about 140 km (87 miles) south of East Timor and more than 400 km from Darwin.

The governments will accelerate negotiations for the project and they urged the Sunrise Joint Venture to present a development concept as soon as possible, the statement said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 08:34:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LURQF3VZYVLXPNU6XK75KYUAJM.jpg?auth=3dca36a16a6fd7a2774454c14104cb4fc7184544e6b7ddf758442679a10ea541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Montenegro could face fuel shortages due to truckers blockade</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/montenegro-could-face-fuel-shortages-due-truckers-blockade-2026-01-28/</link><description>BELGRADE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Montenegro could face fuel shortages due to region-wide protests and a blockade of the Adriatic port of Bar by truck drivers over restrictive EU entry rules that have left them facing deportation for exceeding Schengen visit limits.

The port of Bar is the biggest entry point for overseas fuel imports into Montenegro, which has no oil refining capacity of its own. It also houses the country's largest fuel depots.

Blockades of border crossings in Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and North Macedonia that began on Monday have halted transport along a critical road corridor linking the EU with Turkey and the Middle East.

In a statement late on Tuesday, the Montenegrin Energy Ministry said it asked oil companies for information on stocks, and on the estimated period during which regular fuel supplies could be maintained.

It said current supplies had effectively been reduced to the fuel available at petrol stations, which would allow the market to operate for only a few more days.

The ministry also urged people to avoid purchasing excessive quantities of fuel at petrol stations.

Montenegrin police said earlier the truckers have a permit to protest until midday on Thursday.

The truckers are demanding an extension of the allowed stay in the Schengen free travel area, saying that with the large volumes of freight they transport, they reach the visit limit quickly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:35:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel to hold funeral for last hostage recovered from Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-hold-funeral-last-hostage-recovered-gaza-2026-01-28/</link><description>MEITAR, Israel, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The remains of the last Israeli captive recovered from the Gaza Strip were set to be buried on Wednesday in a funeral that will help Israel turn the page after one of the most tramautising periods in its history.

Ran Gvili, an off-duty police officer, was killed fighting militants during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. He was then seized and taken back into Gaza by the Islamic Jihad militant group, Israeli officials say.

Gvili was among about 250 people abducted during the attack, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and set off the war in Gaza in which Palestinians health authorities say Israel kill more than 71,000 Palestinians.

Many of the hostages were released during two short ceasefires, but dozens died in captivity. Under the terms of an October deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Hamas and other groups agreed to return the remaining hostages, alive or dead, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.

Gvili, who was the last to be released, will be buried in his hometown of Meitar in southern Israel. His casket will be driven there in a procession beginning in Camp Shura, a facility where Israel has identified victims of the October 2023 attack.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog were expected to deliver eulogies at the funeral, expected to began at 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT)

The return of the last hostage and his burial will mark a moment of national healing for Israelis. The Hamas attack, the bloodiest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, was widely seen as the most traumatic event in the country's history.

It also completes a core aspect of the initial phase of Trump's plan to end the war. The second stage, which Washington announced had started earlier this month, includes the reopening of Gaza's Rafah border with Egypt.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:36:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/75BNR334GJNZ3BWSCUCTQLQS2A.jpg?auth=78fdb7deedc05fb3a6f90f3763bb84f8b256bbee7cefad82e2177f0806ed8440&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey urges US to resolve Iran disputes one by one, says Iran ready for nuclear talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-urges-us-resolve-iran-disputes-one-by-one-says-iran-ready-nuclear-talks-2026-01-28/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkey's foreign minister on Wednesday urged the U.S. to resolve its disputes with Iran "one by one" instead of through a sweeping deal, saying this would avoid humiliating Iranian officials, and added that Tehran was ready for talks on its nuclear programme.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that Washington had an "armada" heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

Tehran brutally cracked down on anti-government protests earlier this month, leading to the death and arrest of thousands of people. Officials blamed the unrest on "armed terrorists and rioters" linked to Iran's foes, the United States and Israel. Rights groups describe the protests as the biggest since the 1979 revolution.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan reiterated that Turkey opposed any foreign intervention or attack on Iran, saying it would be "wrong to start the war again."

"My advice always to the American friends: close the files one by one with Iranians. Start with nuclear, close it, then the other, then the other," Fidan said.

"If you put them as a package all of them, it will be very difficult for our Iranian friends to digest," he said. "It sometimes might seem humiliating for them. It will be very difficult to explain to not only themselves, but also to the leadership."

In June, the United States struck Iran's nuclear facilities amid heightened regional tensions with Israel over the war in Gaza. Talks on Tehran's nuclear programme - which it says is for peaceful purposes - have made little progress.

Turkey, a NATO member that shares a border with Iran, has said it reached out to both U.S. and Iranian officials. Ankara has said Tehran must be allowed to handle its domestic issues on its own, warning that any destabilisation would exceed the region's capacity to manage at this time.

Fidan has also said Israel was still looking to attack Iran.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:37:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XSKIDK3U3BJF3HB6YLZUAPFBLE.jpg?auth=7ab0404c755cbcd9068c77a6d0a0d9bb6f508d2355dfa650db17ca39a31cb0de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Post-war recovery agreement with US needs more work, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/post-war-recovery-agreement-with-us-needs-more-work-zelenskiy-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine has identified areas in an agreement with the United States on post-war recovery that need to be worked through in more depth, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday.

The Northern Territory government sold Darwin Port to Chinese company Landbridge for A$506 million in 2015, a move criticised by the United States.

The awarding of the contract came just a few years after the United States posted the first of a rotating group of U.S. Marines in Darwin. The U.S. and Australia are expanding air bases in Australia's north to host U.S. bombers.

Speaking in East Timor on an official visit on Wednesday, Albanese said his government had made it clear it wanted the port returned to Australian ownership .

"We are committed to making sure that that port goes back into Australian hands because that is in our national interest," he said.

The port's owner, Landbridge Australia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said in November the port was in a strong financial position.

China's ambassador in Canberra, Xiao Qian, told reporters at an annual press briefing on Wednesday that Beijing would "take measures to protect the Chinese company's interests" if a sale of the port were forced.

"Should Landbridge be forced to leave that port, I think it might also affect the substantive investment, cooperation and trade between Chinese companies and that part of Australia," the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported Xiao as saying.

It is not the first time Xiao has criticised Albanese's election pledge last year to return the strategically located northern port to local ownership.

"China would like to reiterate that the relevant Chinese enterprise obtained the lease for the Port of Darwin through market means," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular news conference in Beijing.

"Their legitimate rights and interests should be fully protected," he added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:38:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HPIWLG73TNPC5FCONECQDICXRE.jpg?auth=85124917808a08323b84d2526124e69cac29233a829c886e2e70c6a2722b8897&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says it did not request negotiations with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-it-didnt-request-negotiations-with-us-foreign-minister-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requesting negotiations, state media reported on Wednesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday another "armada" is floating toward Iran and that he hopes Tehran would make a deal with Washington.

The U.S. deployed additional military assets in the Gulf following nationwide protests in Iran which led to the country's bloodiest crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

"There was no contact between me and Witkoff in recent days and no request for negotiations was made from us," Araqchi told state media, adding that various intermediaries were "holding consultations" and were in contact with Tehran.

"Our stance is clear, negotiations don't go along with threats and talks can only take place when there are no longer menaces and excessive demands."

Hamidreza Sabet Esmailpour, who had been convicted of passing information to a Mossad agent, was hanged at dawn, the judiciary's Mizan news agency said.

Rights groups have previously said 12 people have been hanged on similar charges in the wake of Israel's 12-day war with Iran in June.

They have also expressed concern that protesters arrested in the wave of demonstrations this month could also face execution. The judiciary has already indicated some of those arrested could face charges of capital crimes.

Protests erupted in late December sparked by concern over the rising cost of living but turned into a mass movement against the Islamic republic that was followed by a crackdown that has seen at least thousands killed and tens of thousands arrested, according to rights groups.

Mizan said Esmailpour had been convicted of sharing intelligence with Mossad, purchasing equipment with the aim of helping Israel carry out "sabotage operations" at Iranian missile sites and moving vehicles rigged with explosives.

The last execution in Iran on charges of spying for Israel was on January 7 when a man named Ali Ardestani was put to death after being convicted of sharing information with Mossad.

Iran is the world's most prolific executioner after China , according to rights groups. Last year it hanged at least 1,500 people, according to figures from NGO Iran Human Rights.

Since the war, Iran has promised swift trials for those arrested on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.

Iran, which does not recognise Israel, has long accused its foe of conducting sabotage operations against its nuclear facilities and assassinating its scientists.

But the June war exposed Israel's deep intelligence penetration of Iran, with several key Iranian military and security figures killed in targeted strikes based on intelligence over their whereabouts.

However, rights groups have long expressed concern that innocent people are executed on the basis of confessions obtained under torture , while Israeli agents carrying out the fieldwork remain undetected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:44:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8852467a-fc20-11f0-b5fb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-24T070503Z-1523816638-RC2J7JART8LJ-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-TRUMP-USA-MILITARY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court sentences ex-first lady to 20 months in prison for corruption</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-south-korea-ex-first-lady-sentenced-20-months-prison-corruption</link><description>The wife of South Korea’s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to 20 months in prison for corruption Wednesday, as her husband awaits a verdict on high-stakes rebellion charges that could result in the death penalty or life imprisonment .

The presidential couple suffered a spectacular fall from grace after Yoon’s martial law debacle in December 2024 led to his impeachment and eventually his removal from office.

They have been jailed separately for months prior to facing criminal trials, Yoon over his martial law imposition in December 2024 and other allegations and Kim over corruption charges. Investigators say Kim wasn’t involved in Yoon's martial law enforcement.

On Wednesday, Seoul Central District Court sentenced Kim for receiving luxury gifts like a Graff diamond necklace and a Chanel bag from the Unification Church in return for promises of business favours.

“Staying close to a president, a first lady can exert significant influence on him and is a symbolic figure who represents the country together with a president,” the court said in a live broadcast of the verdict. “But the defendant exploited her position to seek personal gains.”

The ruling was still a surprise after independent counsel Min Joong-ki called for a 15-year prison term for Kim on the charges involving bribery, stock price manipulation and political funding law violations. The court acquitted Kim of charges of stock price manipulation and political funding law violations, citing a lack of evidence and other reasons.

Min's team responded that it cannot accept the ruling and will appeal to a higher court. The governing liberal Democratic Party, which led Yoon's ouster, slammed the verdict as sending a wrong signal that “abuse of power like Kim Keon Hee's can be tolerated”.

Kim’s defence team thanked the court for its verdict but said the 20-month prison term for her bribery charges was “relatively high”. Lawyer Choi Ji-woo said Min's investigation was politically driven and his team will discuss whether to appeal.

Kim has been in jail since August when the Seoul court approved a warrant to arrest her, citing the chance she might destroy evidence.

Days before her arrest, Kim apologised for causing public concern but still hinted that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as “someone insignificant”.

The ruling against Kim was made about three weeks before the court delivers its verdict on a rebellion charge against Yoon for imposing martial law briefly in December 2024.

Cho Eun-suk, another independent counsel, has demanded the death sentence for Yoon.

When Yoon was in office, Kim was embroiled in a slew of scandals that severely hurt Yoon’s approval rating and provided relentless political ammunition to his rivals. The scandals included the three charges the court dealt with Wednesday.

Many observers speculated Yoon opted to place the country under a military rule to protect his wife from possible investigations. But after a six-month probe into Yoon’s decree that wrapped up in December, independent counsel Cho's team downplayed conjecture that Kim’s troubles drove Yoon to declare martial law.

Yoon plotted for over a year to declare martial law so he could eliminate his political opponents and monopolise power and there was also no evidence of Kim's involvement, Cho’s team said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:44:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7be40baa-fc1e-11f0-849a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028052283427.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says 'we'll work something out with South Korea' after tariff threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-says-well-work-something-out-with-south-korea-after-tariff-threat-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON/SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States ​and South Korea would work out a solution, in response to a query about his surprise threat a day ‌earlier to step up tariffs to 25% on imports from the Asian ally.

The news rattled officials in Seoul who said Trump caught them by surprise with a social media post on Monday vowing higher duties on autos and other goods because South Korea had not lived up to its part in the trade deal struck last year.

As he left the White House to give a speech in Iowa, Trump told reporters, "We'll work something out with South ‌Korea." But he did not elaborate.

Trump's chief trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, said the U.S. had cut to 15% ​its tariff rate on South Korean goods from 25%, in exchange for Seoul's pledge to invest $350 billion in the United States, allow more U.S. cars into South Korea, and eliminate some non-tariff barriers.

"But, in the meantime, they haven't been able to get a bill through to ‍do the investment ," Greer said on Fox Business Network, adding that the export-heavy economy had not met commitments on agriculture, industry and digital services.

Greer said the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, which had ballooned to $65 billion during the Biden administration, was "not sustainable and it has to change."

South Korea's parliament is not expected to hold ⁠a plenary session until February to vote on bills.

Five bills that would enact the U.S. investment are pending and ruling Democratic Party members ‍have expressed hope to approve them in February.

The United States has also expressed concern that a South Korean law passed last year tightening oversight of digital ‌services ‌and proposed legislation to regulate online platforms could discriminate against U.S. companies.

A source familiar with internal discussions between the countries has said Trump may have been prompted by recent Korean regulatory actions against Coupang (CPNG.N) , opens new tab , a U.S.-listed company that has said the moves are unfair and discriminatory .

On Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Seoul reached out to the U.S. State Department after Trump's vow to raise tariffs, adding, "It is our conclusion ⁠there is no direct link to ⁠Coupang or the (proposed) online platform ​law."

South Korea's policy chief Kim Yong-beom said he hopes parliament will approve bills required to kickstart the investment in February, although outflows could take monthsto begin.

"If we are asked to review a specific (investment project), we can look at what it is," Kim said.

"But conducting a proper review requires some serious manpower and ‍budget, meaning we cannot deep dive on those reviews unless relevant law exists."

Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol told Reuters this month that South Korea plans to adopt the investment package as soon as possible, while warning it could be affected by uncertainty over a U.S. Supreme Court ruling expected soon on Trump's tariffs.

But he highlighted prospects ​for the timeline to be stretched with remarks that the planned investment of $350 billion ‍was unlikely to kick off in the first half of 2026, against a backdrop of weakness in the won currency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:30:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LOFRHYRBGVLJFDNEJVV65EI6M4.jpg?auth=8785324ad13b5699ae2cf3c85b8abd4f9624546438fef3df866f31bee1655282&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo appeals against rising anti-Semitism in weekly audience</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-appeals-against-rising-anti-semitism-weekly-audience-2026-01-28/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Pope Leo appealed against the global rise of anti-Semitism on Wednesday, marking the annual commemoration of the Holocaust during his weekly audience at the Vatican with a prayer for a world without prejudice or racism.

Various people were questioned, the Office of the Attorney General, or OAG, said in a statement, adding that the probes relate to suspected electoral fraud involving about 30,000 signatures flagged as suspicious since 2022.

The signatures were gathered for around 20 so-called popular initiatives, the OAG said.

Such national initiatives, if backed by 100,000 valid signatures within 18 months, are put to public votes under Switzerland's system of direct democracy.

Prosecutors did not say what changes to the Swiss constitution the 20 initiatives were about.

The OAG said investigation are complicated by the fact that signature collectors are not legally required to identify themselves and are often young people living abroad.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:31:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French senator found guilty of drugging lawmaker to assault her</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-french-senator-found-guilty-drugging-lawmaker-assault-her-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A former French senator was found guilty by a Paris court late on Tuesday of having spiked a lawmaker's drink with ecstasy with the intention of sexually assaulting her.

The court, in its ruling, rejected the defence's argument that Joel Guerriau, 68, may have "inadvertently" administered lawmaker Sandrine Josso with "a substance liable to alter her discernment or control over her actions, in order to commit rape or sexual aggression".

Guerriau, who resigned as a senator over the case in October 2025, was also found guilty of possession and use of ecstasy.

The case has resonated in France following the 2024 conviction of Dominique Pelicot , who was found guilty of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, Gisele, and inviting dozens of strangers to assault her while she was unconscious.

The Pelicot trial attracted headlines worldwide and raised awareness about drug-facilitated assaults .

Because of "the particular gravity of the offences committed and the high dose of ecstasy administered to Sandrine Josso without her knowledge", the court sentenced Guerriau to four years in prison, with two-and-a-half suspended, with a deferred detention order - meaning he will not go to jail as he appeals the ruling.

One of his lawyers said Guerriau intended to appeal. "The debate will resume in front of the appeals court, notably on the intention of assaulting, which my client completely contests," Henri Carpentier told Reuters.

Josso had told investigators she felt unwell after drinking a few sips from a glass of champagne offered to her by Guerriau at his apartment to celebrate an electoral win.

She said the champagne did not taste normal and that if she had not managed to leave the flat she was certain Guerriau would have assaulted her.

In its ruling, the court said that the intention to commit a rape or a sexual assault could be inferred from several elements, including Guerriau's insistence that Josso drink the ecstasy-spiked drink, his unusual and inappropriate behaviour, and browser searches on drugs and their effects in the context of sexual assault.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:58:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZDFEK5NLGJJR5LBQTAV2JBWVSY.jpg?auth=bafc58523a0312de61a3e24adced0dc00a8d78c54e732fafe0ef65e9961d29ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US singer Chris Brown in UK court ahead of October assault trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-singer-chris-brown-uk-court-ahead-october-assault-trial-2026-01-28/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. singer Chris Brown appeared in a London court on Wednesday for a brief hearing ahead of his trial later this year on charges of attacking a music producer in a London nightclub.

Brown last year denied attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm, and also a less serious charge of assault causing actual bodily harm, over what prosecutors say was an "unprovoked attack" with a bottle in 2023.

The 36-year-old attended London's Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday and spoke only to confirm his name.

Brown entered the dock and shook hands with his co-defendant Omololu Akinlolu, 39, who has also denied the charges against him. Around a dozen supporters sat in the public gallery behind them and waved as he left the dock.

The pair's trial is due to begin in October. They were both granted bail ahead of a further preliminary hearing in April.

Brown, a two-time Grammy Award winner known for hits such as "Loyal", "Run It" and "Under the Influence", was granted bail in May after paying 5 million pounds ($6.89 million) in order to begin his "Breezy Bowl XX" tour, which ended in October.

The R&amp;B star was arrested at a hotel in Manchester, northern England last year after returning to Britain for the first time since the incident.

In his latest direct intervention in another country’s politics, Trump on Tuesday warned Iraq that if it picked the Iranian-backed Maliki as its prime minister again Washington would no longer help the major oil producer and close U.S. ally.

"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos. That should not be allowed to happen again," Trump wrote, citing what he called Maliki's "insane policies and ideologies".

Trump's comments are the starkest example yet of his campaign to curb the influence of Iran-linked groups in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

They came after Iraq's main alliance of Shi'ite political blocs, which holds a majority in parliament, picked Maliki -- Iraq's first elected prime minister after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 -- as its nominee for the post following an election .

That came as a surprise for many Iraqis who have accused Maliki of pursuing sectarian policies favouring majority Shi'ites, and of driving Sunnis into the arms of ultra-violent Islamic State militants who seized a third of Iraq as security forces crumbled.

A senior figure in the Shi'ite Islamist Dawa Party, Maliki previously served two terms as prime minister from 2006 to 2014, a period marked by sectarian violence, a power struggle with Sunni and Kurdish rivals, growing tensions with the U.S., and poor public services and graft.

Maliki was pressured to step down in 2014 by an unusually broad array of critics -- the U.S., Iran, Sunni leaders and Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric -- after Islamic State's rapid territorial gains.

In 2015, an Iraqi parliamentary panel called for Maliki and dozens of other top officials to stand trial over the fall of the northern city of Mosul to IS.

But Maliki, who is in his mid-70s, remained an influential political player, leading the State of Law coalition and maintaining close ties with powerful Iran-backed factions.

He used shrewd political skills to quietly build influence through ties to armed militias, the security services and the judiciary, analysts say.

Maliki was born in 1950 in Janaja, a southern village among date groves on the Euphrates, into a politically engaged family - his grandfather wrote poetry inciting rebellion against Iraq’s British occupiers and his father was a fervent Arab nationalist.

He was briefly arrested in 1979 and then fled, narrowly escaping Saddam’s police. His family’s land was seized and dozens of his relatives were killed over the next decade. He did not see his home village again until after the U.S.-led invasion.

His political roots stretch back decades, shaped by opposition to Saddam’s authoritarian rule and a long exile that forged his ideological convictions.

Sentenced to death under Saddam for his role in the outlawed Dawa, Maliki spent nearly 25 years in exile, mostly in Syria and Iran, agitating for the dictator’s downfall. Like many exiles, he came back to Iraq after Saddam’s fall — the end of a Sunni-led regime that had long oppressed Shi'ites, and Kurds.

Little-known in Iraq before his return, Maliki was a compromise pick to lead a wobbly coalition government in 2006.

Months after becoming prime minister, Maliki signed Saddam's execution order in red ink, allowing masked gunmen to hang him. He had fulfilled his lifelong goal of wresting power from the country’s Sunnis, but his drive to entrench Shi’ite dominance would later prove his downfall.

Initially seen as a Shi'ite Islamist, Maliki's willingness to put aside sectarianism and quell violence was called into question in a leaked U.S. government memo.

"Despite Maliki's reassuring words, repeated reports from our commanders on the ground contributed to our concerns about Maliki's government," National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley wrote to President George W. Bush in the memo.

He went on to list problems including non-delivery of services to Sunni areas and the removal of Iraq's most effective commanders on a sectarian basis.

Sunni leaders blamed the dour Maliki for not reining in Shi’ite militias and focusing instead on restless Sunni provinces such as Anbar in western Iraq.

Maliki threw down the gauntlet with stunning speed in 2011 when his Shi’ite-led government demanded the arrest of a Sunni Muslim vice president -- seemingly moments after the departure of U.S. troops in December that year.

To detractors, the move called into question Maliki’s commitment to any sort of democracy.

Maliki denied having a sectarian outlook.

"I am not fighting in Anbar because they are Sunnis, as I have also fought Shi’ite militias. Al Qaeda and militias are one - they both kill people and blow them up," he told Reuters in 2014.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:58:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P5LTGA7R3FMYXIT4IJOOFUDTHM.jpg?auth=bff1b54af73c9f8696813aaca094832e628aca0870d73329dd8a1e488432cd59&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Budget slashed for Indonesia's rescue agency despite disaster surge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/budget-slashed-indonesias-rescue-agency-despite-disaster-surge-2026-01-28/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia's main rescue agency had its funding cut by a parliamentary panel on Wednesday as part of a plan to divert government expenditure to other programmes, despite concerns over the number of disasters the agency has to deal with.

Ministries and agencies have been ordered to cut budgets to make room for areas that President Prabowo Subianto has prioritised, such as his flagship free meals programmes and higher defence spending.

The parliamentary panel approved a 69.38 billion rupiah ($4.15 million) - or 4.5% - reduction in rescue agency Basarnas' budget from 1.55 trillion rupiah in the initial allocation to 1.48 trillion rupiah, commission head Lasarus said during a meeting.

Indonesia sits on the "Pacific Ring of Fire", an area of high seismic activity atop multiple tectonic plates, making it susceptible to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

In January alone, the sprawling archipelago was hit by floods and landslides. At least 34 people were killed in landslides in West Java province over the weekend, and the rescue agency is rushing to see if it can rescue 32 others who are missing.

Cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra late last year killed 1,200 people and displaced over one million residents.

The cuts in the rescue agency's budget were proposed by the Finance Ministry and required approval from the parliamentary panel.

The agency's head Mohammad Syafii, who attended the meeting, accepted the decision but said many improvements were needed to optimise his agency's functions and ability to respond quickly.

For example, he said all regions should have their own local office of the rescue agency given the frequent natural disasters in the country.

There are 514 regions in Indonesia. Currently the agency has 38 offices - one in each province.

The committee acknowledged that a series of natural disasters had struck Indonesia last year and the agency required more funds, but went ahead with the cut anyway.

"The work of Basarnas has been outstanding but their capacity to handle the problems will be limited if the budget is not sufficient," the committee's deputy head Ridwan Bae said.

What was once his most potent campaign issue is now driving unease among voters unsettled by the administration’s aggressive tactics in its immigration crackdown , including the targeting of U.S. citizens and violent measures against peaceful protesters.

Illegal immigration and inflation were the twin issues that helped Trump win the election. Now, opinion polls show a growing number of Americans, including key independent voters, are unhappy with Trump's handling of both, putting Republicans on the defensive ahead of the midterms.

The polling shows most Republicans still back Trump’s push for mass deportations, but a sizeable minority are uneasy with a heavy-handed approach by federal immigration agents, which led to the shooting deaths of a mother of three and a nurse in Minneapolis this month.

Just 39% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of immigration, the lowest since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday. While 84% of Republican respondents said they support Trump on the issue, a fifth of them said federal agents had gone "too far" in their crackdown.

If those sentiments persist, they could spell trouble for Republicans in November, when Democrats are aiming to take control of Congress and block the president's agenda.

"This was one of the president's number one advantages and it has become a political liability for him," said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. "The base is still pretty comfortable with what Trump is doing. But it's not just about the base, it's about swing voters."

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration's approach to immigration.

"President Trump wants all Americans to feel safe in their communities. That guiding principle is why the President has promised to remove dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our country, urged local Democrat leaders to work with federal law enforcement, and called for a fact-based investigation into the tragic death of Mr. Pretti," she said in a statement.

Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the December deployment of nearly 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minneapolis and St. Paul provoked a national uproar with the fatal shootings of Renee Good on January 7 and then Alex Pretti on January 24. Both were killed during confrontations with immigration agents at protests.

Trump has taken steps in recent days to ease tensions in Minneapolis, dispatching his border czar to oversee the operation and signaling a willingness to work with state officials.

It remains unclear whether these moves reflect a recognition of the political risks to Republicans in November midterms, or are simply an effort to regain control of an operation that has produced daily images of masked federal agents responding aggressively to protesters confronting them in the streets.

Trump spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers about how to recalibrate his immigration strategy, according to a White House official and a source familiar with the talks. The discussions included a possible reduction of agents deployed to Minnesota and narrowing the focus there to deportations rather than broad enforcement operations, the sources said.

Some Republican strategists warned that a renewed focus on deporting the “worst of the worst,” as Trump promised during the campaign, was necessary to retain support from moderate Republicans and independents in November.

"Americans support secure borders, and they're willing to forgive mistakes when you're cleaning up the previous administration's fiasco - provided you're seen as targeting criminals," said Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican media strategist who worked on Hispanic outreach for Trump's 2020 campaign.

"The margin for error narrows dramatically if you’re perceived as going after gardeners and taco truck ladies."

Trump's softening of his tone and sidelining of Gregory Bovino - a top Border Patrol official and a lightning rod for opponents of the crackdown - followed days of criticism from a number of Republican lawmakers and governors.

A Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, Chris Madel, made headlines for his decision to quit the race over the tactics being used by federal agents in Minneapolis and what he described as indiscriminate arrests.

Zach Duckworth, a Republican state senator who was recently activated in the Minnesota Army National Guard to support local law enforcement, said he was so alarmed by top Trump officials labeling Pretti a "domestic terrorist" that he wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel , Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and others to object to the characterization.

He told Reuters that was a "tipping point," saying many of his constituents in the Minneapolis suburbs are centrists and support removing violent criminals, but are alarmed by the scope and tactics of Trump’s operations, which have also swept up people in the country legally.

Democratic strategists see opportunity for their party, which polls show is not trusted by most Americans to handle immigration, especially after former President Joe Biden's slow reaction to stem immigrants entering the country illegally.

Michael LaRosa, a former Biden White House official, told Reuters the overwhelming opposition by Democrats to Trump's crackdown would help to drive both progressive and moderate voters to the polls in November.

While an increasing number of traditional, moderate Republicans now oppose Trump's immigration crackdown, Democrats are at risk of misdiagnosing the moment and overplaying their hand, said Scott Rasmussen, a veteran pollster.

"Where the left is making a mistake on this issue is they think they're winning a fight to build support for illegal immigrants," Rasmussen said. "Where the right, especially the MAGA right, is wrong, is they are thinking everybody voted for what's happening in Minneapolis."

In interviews with eight Trump supporters in Delano, a Republican-leaning town just 10 miles (16 km) west of downtown Minneapolis, all said they stood squarely behind the president's immigration crackdown and would vote Republican in the midterms.

But they also acknowledged that immigration agents appeared poorly trained and ill-prepared for the task before them, and expressed worries that widespread criticism of ICE's tactics could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.

Jake Blackowiak, 33, worried the controversy could contribute to the party losing at least one chamber of Congress in the midterms.

"The Republicans aren't going to be able to pass any more laws or advance the agenda he promised," he said.

Former Republican Minnesota congressman Gil Gutknecht urged the White House to clarify its enforcement targets.

"To say that all the people who are being rounded up are violent criminals is an exaggeration," Gutknecht said in an interview. "They're not all murderers and rapists."

He said it was too early to tell whether the deaths in Minnesota would impact the midterms, but the White House should continue its immigration enforcement operation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:28:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ILHTO3MIWFLBVH42QPUIGY4SXA.jpg?auth=731e64944482759727adf2644957392d57f47e85848dd92b1a93dae4e326ddf2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio to face former US Senate colleagues on Venezuela policy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rubio-face-former-us-senate-colleagues-venezuela-policy-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to testify in the Senate about President Donald Trump's Venezuela policy on Wednesday, after scrambling to keep his former colleagues from passing a resolution to rein in the administration's war powers.

Rubio, a former Florida senator and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is likely to face a far less friendly reception than he did a year ago, when the Senate approved him unanimously to serve as the nation's top diplomat.

It will be the first time Rubio has publicly faced lawmakers' questions over the January 3 raid to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Two weeks ago, Trump's fellow Republicans narrowly blocked a resolution that would have barred Trump from further military action in Venezuela without Congress' authorization, with Vice President JD Vance forced to break a tie.

Rubio is set to tout the success of the military operation and insist there was no war with Venezuela and no U.S. occupation there, according to prepared remarks submitted to the committee.

"We will closely monitor the performance of the interim authorities as they cooperate with our stage-based plan to restore stability to Venezuela," Rubio said in the remarks. "Make no mistake, as the President has stated, we are prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation if other methods fail."

Several members of Congress, some Republicans as well as Democrats, have expressed frustration with the lack of communication from Trump officials about major operations, including the capture of Maduro and the elimination of many foreign aid programs supported by Congress.

Committee Chairman Jim Risch, a Republican senator from Idaho, was expected to praise Rubio for explaining to him the administration's plans for Venezuela, despite "confusion over how it will be done."

"Today is the opportunity to publicly explain the administration’s plan for the future of Venezuela," Risch will say, according to a copy of his opening remarks shared with reporters. "After our lengthy engagements in the Middle East in years past, many Americans are concerned about so-called 'forever wars'. I know this Administration is laser-focused on avoiding these experiences."

The war powers resolution had appeared to be on track to pass the Senate after five Republicans joined Democrats in voting to advance it, in rare Republican opposition to Trump.

But Trump railed at the five, saying they should never again be elected to public office. He and Rubio made repeated calls encouraging senators to change their votes by insisting there were no U.S. troops in Venezuela, and with promises including Rubio's agreement to come before the Senate committee. Two of them, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana, flipped their positions.

The close vote reflected concern in Congress about Trump's foreign policy and growing support for the argument that Congress, not the president, should take back the power to send U.S. troops to war, as spelled out in the Constitution.

Members of Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, said Rubio had insisted the administration did not plan regime change in Venezuela just days before U.S. troops removed Maduro, and that oil company executives were told about the operation before lawmakers.

Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a senior committee member, said he had "maybe 20 questions" he would like to ask on a range of issues, including Venezuela.

Coons said the administration never presented evidence tying alleged drug trafficking to the United States or to justify acting without consulting Congress.

"No evidence was proffered to explain or justify the Article Two urgent national security concern that would justify an action by the president of the United States without timely consultation with Congress, something the secretary from his 15 years of service in the Senate knows full well should have happened," Coons said on a recent call with reporters.

Trump this month said the U.S. will run Venezuela for years, told Iranians protesting against their government that "help is on the way," and threatened military action to take Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:30:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O3E45AITMZM47A2Z5KFU5ENLSA.jpg?auth=9dcac1a0e48efcb4d28c628446608150bc33624a63f5c13fbf00cabfb668e549&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Eastern German region of Saxony-Anhalt elects new state premier</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eastern-german-region-saxony-anhalt-elects-new-state-premier-2026-01-28/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The parliament of the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt elected Economy Minister Sven Schulze on Wednesday to succeed outgoing premier Reiner Haseloff, who stepped down ahead of elections in September that could see the far-right AfD win control of the state.

Schulze, from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's centre-right Christian Union (CDU), was elected comfortably in the first round of voting, avoiding the need for run-off votes that could have embarrassed the coalition of the CDU, centre-left Social Democrats and the Free Democrats.

Haseloff, 71, had previously announced his intention to step down after 15 years in office to allow his successor time to prepare for the September election, which is expected to test the so-called "firewall" strategy of mainstream German parties that have vowed not to work with the AfD.

Saxony Anhalt, which has lagged many other German regions with a struggling economy and a range of social problems, including a declining population, has seen a surge in support for the AfD, which could win control of a state legislature for the first time in September.

According to an opinion poll published on Tuesday, the AfD stands well ahead of any of the other parties in Saxony-Anhalt with 39% support, followed by the CDU with 26%, the Left Party with 11% and the SPD with 8%.

The small hard-left BSW party, which shares some of the AfD's priorities including restricting immigration and opposition to German support for Ukraine, stood at 6% and may fall under the 5% threshold for entry to parliament, potentially helping the AfD further.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:46:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IXFDX7NOEJLL5IPX4VXB3YSHNI.jpg?auth=897a6be276cfa8111a6b4d35867e3a6ca04cb3538732e02bdd51e53cf5410c17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian-Uzbek billionaire Usmanov wins lawsuit against German newspaper, documents show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/russian-uzbek-billionaire-usmanov-wins-lawsuit-against-german-newspaper-2026-01-28/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Russian-Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov has won a legal complaint against German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung over an article it published about him, court documents obtained by Reuters show.

In a ruling dated January 23, a Hamburg court prohibited FAZ from disseminating several statements, including allegations about Usmanov's links to top Russian officials, from an April 2023 article titled "On the Kremlin's instructions".

Usmanov has a net worth of $18.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and is subject to European Union and U.S. sanctions and a travel ban that were imposed after the start of the war in Ukraine .

He has launched multiple lawsuits in Europe with the ultimate goal of having the sanctions lifted. In some, his lawyers contested statements in the media that were used as the grounds for sanctions.

Usmanov's lawyer, Joachim Steinhofel, said in remarks about the Hamburg court's decision that the statements banned from further dissemination "repeated essential parts of the reasoning behind the sanctions against Mr Usmanov."

"This (the court decision) allows for the legally substantiated assessment that the EU sanctions' reasoning is nothing more than an accumulation of defamatory, groundless, and thus illegal allegations," he added.

Last month, Germany agreed with Usmanov to close an investigation into alleged foreign trade law violations, provided that he pay 10 million euros ($11.98 million). In 2024, German prosecutors dropped a money laundering investigation against him.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:46:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WXXBLI4KFNLOLHOGUV2PACGVNA.jpg?auth=3bfb5fec84ede7dd2692d1eaa16aaf1da8b1dc5cd7e4becc29ffef2de21256b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Kristin knocks out power to 800,000 in Portugal and barrels into Spain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/storm-kristin-knocks-out-power-800000-portugal-barrels-into-spain-2026-01-28/</link><description>LISBON/MADRID, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Storm Kristin left more than 800,000 people across central and northern Portugal without electricity early on Wednesday, toppling trees and utility posts, damaging homes, and disrupting motorway and rail traffic before moving inland to Spain, authorities said.

At least one person died when a tree fell on their car in Vila Franca de Xira, on the outskirts of Lisbon, according to emergency services.

Civil protection authorities reported around 1,500 weather‑related incidents, triggered by wind gusts of up to 150 km/h (93 mph), heavy rain and even snowfall in the country of nearly 11 million people.

Grid operator E-Redes said technical teams were working to reestablish power supplies to some 855,000 clients after their initial efforts were hindered by the severe weather.

The storm then pushed east into Spain, which is still dealing with the impact of a previous system, Storm Joseph. In the coastal town of Torremolinos, strong winds felled a palm tree on Tuesday, killing a woman.

More than 160 roads across Spain were affected by snow on Wednesday, including 27 motorways on the main highway network, such as the A‑6 linking Madrid with the northwest. Snow also blanketed rooftops in parts of central Madrid but caused no major disruptions.

Spain's national weather agency AEMET warned that large areas of the country would face very strong winds, with some gusts reaching hurricane force. Authorities in parts of southern Almeria province issued a red alert due to the intensity of the winds.

Local authorities closed parks, and in some areas outdoor sports and educational activities were suspended.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:47:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DW7VJCD2ARNEZFIWS5RC6UYMRQ.jpg?auth=d8644f68255ad6e8b2aae1264e64dc412d22fd76cb9be1159243ae9c8625a58d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda court releases prominent rights activist on bail</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-court-releases-prominent-rights-activist-bail-2026-01-28/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A Ugandan court on Wednesday released on bail a prominent rights activist whose detention was seen by campaign groups as part of a widespread crackdown on dissent ahead of the country's general election that was held on January 15.

Sarah Bireete, who heads the Centre for Constitutional Governance, a Kampala-based pressure group, was detained on December 30 after questioning the accuracy of the voter register to be used in the poll. She was later charged with offences related to alleged unlawful disclosure of voters' information.

On Wednesday Magistrate Winnie Nankya Jatiko released her on bail saying "the applicant satisfied all the relevant requirements for the grant of bail".

The official results of the poll showed long-ruling incumbent Yoweri Museveni securing 71.6% of the votes. Opposition leader Bobi Wine, who is in hiding and is being sought by the military, has rejected the results.

After Bireete's detention, CCG said she was being persecuted for helping to "amplify the voices of the oppressed and marginalised". International rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been demanding her unconditional release.

The 81-year-old Museveni, already Africa's third longest-ruling head of state, will have been president of the East African country for 45 years by the time his term ends in 2031.

Rights groups and the opposition have long accused his government of using the military to suppress dissent. The government denies those accusations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:47:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PWYQ33IDJBMRBPLFECSGCSVKBM.jpg?auth=daa2f270839708107bf0e2c5c826095b6768985f86ff128d5dc900e3895370a7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli lawmakers to hold initial vote on draft budget as elections loom</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-lawmakers-hold-initial-vote-draft-budget-elections-loom-2026-01-28/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Israel's parliament was expected to take its initial vote on the 2026 state budget draft on Wednesday, in a test of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government at a time when his coalition has been beset by political fractures.

The budget, as well as an accompanying economic plan, faces an uphill battle for approval as the government has become increasingly polarized. By law it must be approved by the end of March or a snap election would be triggered.

For more than two years, parties in Netanyahu's coalition have splintered over the war in Gaza , the ceasefire in October that has halted it, and demands by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties to exempt Jewish seminary students from mandatory military service.

Netanyahu told reporters on Tuesday evening he hoped the budget would pass and was concerned over the prospect of an election ahead of an October 2026 schedule.

"We are in a very sensitive situation and I think the last thing we need right now is elections," he said at a press conference. "We'll have elections later on this year, but I think it's a mistake to have them now, and I hope that people understand that and act sensibly."

A vote was expected later on Wednesday or early Thursday morning, following what is expected to be a long debate on the floor of parliament.

The main issue threatening to topple the coalition is a military conscription bill .

Netanyahu relies on ultra-Orthodox , or Haredi, parties for support and the bill to exempt seminary students from serving has been a thorn in the coalition for months.

Haredi parties have threatened to vote against the budget if a bill is not passed. But Netanyahu's other right-wing coalition partners - as well as the opposition - feel Haredi men must share in the burden, especially after two years of fighting in Gaza and Lebanon where nearly 1,000 Israeli soldiers were killed.

A spokesperson for Moshe Gafni, who heads the United Torah Judaism party, said UTJ had not yet decided whether to support the budget in the vote. Other Haredi parties did not immediately provide comment.

Israeli media reported that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told ultra-Orthodox parties that he would not link the budget vote to the draft law and that if they did not vote for the budget, Israel should have an election.

A spokesman for Smotrich, who has said the Haredi parties would benefit from extra spending this year, did not comment on the reports.

Even if the budget gets preliminary approval, it still needs to pass two more votes by March 31 to become law.

In all, state spending would be 662 billion shekels ($214 billion) excluding debt servicing. The deficit ceiling was set at 3.9% of gross domestic product, a level the Bank of Israel deems as too high since it does not allow for a reduction in the debt burden.

"Despite all my reservations and everything included in the budget ... it must be passed," Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said on Wednesday at a meeting of parliament's finance committee.

"The deficit target must not creep up, especially given the possibility of additional expenditures due to geopolitical developments."

The budget deficit slipped to 4.7% of GDP in 2025 from 6.8% in 2023. A spike in defence costs due to the Gaza war pushed the deficit higher the past two years.

While an October ceasefire has halted most fighting, it has not stopped entirely and both sides have accused each other of violating the deal's provisions.

France, Poland, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands have been invited to take part in the video conference , which follows ridicule from officials in Donald Trump 's administration over the time it takes for the 27-country bloc to make a decision.

The idea of forging ad-hoc coalitions allowing some EU countries to pursue projects without all of them having to agree has long tempted some of its members, and has already been applied to key projects including the euro currency.

It is gaining new momentum as Europe confronts widening insecurity, sluggish growth and deep political divergences.

"Now is the time for a Europe of two speeds," German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said on Tuesday in Berlin ahead of the video conference of finance ministers.

Klingbeil wants the countries invited to the call, which is scheduled for 3 p.m. (1400 GMT), to set a concrete agenda to strengthen the sovereignty, resilience and competitiveness of Europe, a letter seen by Reuters showed.

"To survive in an increasingly unpredictable geopolitical situation, Europe must become stronger and more resilient," Klingbeil wrote in the letter to his counterparts dated Monday, adding that continuing as before could not be an option.

The invitation said it is meant as a "kick-off," and a follow-up meeting in person in the margins of the next Eurogroup should follow.

"Due to the geopolitical situation, the EU simply cannot afford to wait for all 27 members anymore," said Nicolai von Ondarza, European expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).

He pointed to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's toughening stance and willingness to press ahead in Europe without unanimity, be it on the Mercosur trade deal or Ukraine.

The move by Germany's finance minister to include only six countries for Wednesday's call could alienate other EU members, but German officials said the approach was flexible.

The advance-group approach would work in different formats, depending on who wants to join, and will not be restricted to the six countries, they said.

France has long pushed for willing EU countries to go forward without the others and is expected to join the call, as is Italy's Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti.

"An effort is being made to find a framework for discussions to seek solutions to more complex situations in a restricted format," an Italian source said.

Germany's letter includes a four-point plan to push forward an EU capital markets union, strengthen the euro and better coordinate investment in defense and secure raw materials.

Klingbeil said the coalition also needs to move faster on a Savings and Investment Union to create better financing conditions for European businesses.

On the euro, he called for cuts to red tape and enhanced sovereignty in the payment sphere to highlight the currency's role as a safe haven based on predictability and rule of law.

He urged better cooperation on defence, which he said should be firmly embedded as a priority in the next EU multiannual budget, "turning defence into an engine for growth".

Supply chain resilience for critical minerals must also be strengthened, with greater strategic engagement with international partners, he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBOORRBXWBJ27HQYDL3D6P7L5Q.jpg?auth=c47a803347e4618cc940e1cdb193bf6b66b535afbf2f5d781cec5e1658f41e48&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine summons Hungary ambassador over election meddling allegations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-summons-hungary-ambassador-over-election-meddling-allegations-2026-01-28/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine's foreign ministry said it summoned Hungary's ambassador to Kyiv on Thursday to protest over Budapest's allegations of Ukrainian meddling in the upcoming Hungarian parliamentary election.

Nationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has intensified criticism of Ukraine in recent weeks, seeking to associate Hungary's opposition leader Peter Magyar with Kyiv and the European Union executive as the election campaign heats up.

Orban and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have engaged in a public war of words, with Zelenskiy accusing Orban, without naming him directly, of trying to "sell out European interests."

In response, Orban called his counterpart "a man in a desperate position" as Ukraine approaches its fourth anniversary of full-scale war since Russia invaded in February 2022.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto criticised the Ukrainian protest on Facebook on Wednesday.

"Based on what was said at the summoning of the ambassador, we must be prepared for the Ukrainians to continue their open and crude interference in the April elections in the interests of the (opposition) Tisza party."

Orban, in power since 2010, is facing a strong challenger for the first time with most polls consistently showing Magyar's centre-right Tisza party ahead of the premier's right-wing nationalist Fidesz after three years of economic stagnation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brussels greenlights $3.4 billion Spanish state aid for highly efficient power</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/brussels-greenlights-34-billion-spanish-state-aid-highly-efficient-power-2026-01-28/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission has approved a 3.1 billion euro ($3.4 billion) Spanish state aid scheme to support electricity output from highly efficient power plants, it said on Wednesday, amid an EU push to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Support will cover new or substantially refurbished combined heat and power (CHP) plant projects using natural gas, bioliquids, biogas and solid biomass.

Natural gas projects must include equipment enabling the use of at least 10% renewable hydrogen by volume to avoid perpetuating reliance on the fossil fuel.

The European Union has current targets to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and is pushing more broadly to reduce final energy consumption to mitigate the effects of climate change.

The Spanish scheme will run for 10 years and be open to operators of CHP installations that meet the definition of high-efficiency cogeneration under the EU's Energy Efficiency Directive, the Commission said in a statement.

Aid will be granted as a remuneration premium to compensate for investments in bringing CHPs onstream and for operating costs calculated and updated quarterly, the Commission said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QKG6UKCY7BKHHI2UTXKQ5GULFQ.jpg?auth=75029be756b6171ff8146623af2fe7aebc1fb0b4894de0d062788ec5e875d4c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs defence reinforcement in the Arctic, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-backs-defence-reinforcement-arctic-macron-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France supports the reinforcement of the defence position in the Arctic, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, ahead of a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

But what is Nipah virus, and how worried should people be?

Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40% to 75%, depending on the local healthcare system's capacity for detection and management, the World Health Organization says.

However, while it can also spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Candidate vaccines are under development, although none have been approved yet.

Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999. Since then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh. India also sees sporadic outbreaks. According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a group that tracks emerging disease threats and funds the development of medical tools to protect against them, as of December 750 cases had been recorded in all, and 415 of the patients died.

Reuters traced the spread of Nipah in a 2023 series, Bat Lands .

When first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs or contaminated tissues. Since then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its natural host: fruit bats.

More specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products - like raw date palm juice - containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection, the WHO says. Human-to-human spread has been found, mainly after close contact between a sick patient and their family or caregivers.

The initial symptoms of Nipah such as fever, headaches and muscle pain are not specific and can be confused with other diseases. These can then be followed by neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and some people experience severe respiratory problems. Seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to a coma in days. Most people who get better make a full recovery, but some experience long-term neurological problems.

While Nipah is a dangerous disease with a high fatality rate, it has not yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans or spreading easily worldwide, scientists say.

However, it remains a significant public health concern, according to the WHO, particularly in countries where outbreaks are more common. It can also lead to the mass culling of farm animals such as pigs that are susceptible to the virus.

Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally - and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period.

There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although a number of candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Their Nipah vaccine uses the same technology, and began phase II testing in Bangladesh in December in collaboration with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and with funding from CEPI.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:53:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs defence reinforcement in the Arctic, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-backs-defence-reinforcement-arctic-macron-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France supports the reinforcement of the defence position in the Arctic, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, ahead of a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

Their Nipah vaccine uses the same technology, and began phase II testing in Bangladesh in December in collaboration with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and with funding from CEPI.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:54:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel steps up evictions of Palestinians from East Jerusalem</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-steps-up-evictions-palestinians-east-jerusalem-2026-01-28/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 28 (Reuters) - In Silwan in East Jerusalem, south of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Kayed Rajabi and his neighbors have been handed eviction orders in favor of an Israeli settler organization which has already taken over parts of the Palestinian district.

Rajabi's home is surrounded by buildings that have raised large Israeli flags - a sign they are owned by settlers , who he said began buying homes in 2004, and have obtained about 40 buildings in Silwan now, many via forced evictions.

Settler group Ateret Cohanim had offered to buy him and other Palestinians out, he said, but most had refused.

He said he was among 32 families in the neighborhood who have now been ordered to leave, with him and his brothers given until the end of Ramadan - mid-March - to depart under an order from Israel's Supreme Court that he showed Reuters.

"They want to force me out of the house I was born in, where my eyes first opened to life," said Rajabi, explaining that his family had lived there since 1967 and bought the land from a Jordanian officer.

Daniel Luria, the executive director of Ateret Cohanim, called Palestinians in Silwan "illegal squatters", saying the land was owned by Yemeni Jews before 1929 and that moving back was rectifying a historical injustice. Rajabi said that account was untrue.

The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Palestinians seek East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war, for a future state and say that leaving their homes there could put an end to their hopes for ever. Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said the aim is to 'bury' the idea of a Palestinian state.

Israel deems all of Jerusalem its capital - a status not recognised internationally - and has encouraged Jewish settlement of predominantly Palestinian areas . Settler incursions, sometimes violent , have ramped up since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 triggered the Gaza war.

Silwan is particularly contentious due to its proximity to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a longtime flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions.

Rajabi said that Ateret Cohanim had offered him a blank check to leave, an offer he refused. "I wouldn't sell them even a grain of soil. They told me, 'Put whatever number you want and we're ready to pay'," he said.

He said that some people in the neighborhood had sold their homes, but that most families had refused.

Luria said that Ateret Cohanim had offered Silwan residents compensation for leaving. "This is part of an unfolding Zionist dream," said Luria of the purchase of homes in Silwan.

Numerous UN Security Council resolutions have called on Israel to halt all settlement activity, but successive Israeli governments have said settlements are critical to the country's security. If Palestinians refuse orders to leave, armed police go in to evict them and diggers demolish their homes.

Rajabi said that with the high prices for rent in Jerusalem, he does not know where he and his family will go.

"People will live in the streets," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HK4GVZSJVBIRNOLOIHRJ6V7KMM.jpg?auth=41b55fb42c9506a21d1d2449e2ec571d40f2af9e592bd12fd5ee425146175eb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland says more surveillance and security needed in region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland-says-more-surveillance-security-needed-region-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Greenland's prime minister said on Wednesday there were red lines that could not be crossed in discussions with the United States, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to boost security in the region in the face of a more aggressive Russia.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen were in Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron to shore up support over U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take over the Arctic island that has been Danish territory for centuries .

Macron said France shared the view that it was necessary to reinforce defence in the Arctic.

"Given Russia's stance in the Far North, China's economic presence, and the strategic consequences of this rapprochement, we agree on the need to strengthen our defence posture in the Arctic," he said.

France also supported increased NATO vigilance and activity in the Arctic, he said. "We are ready to join."

Talks between Greenland, Denmark and the United States are due to take place to try to find a solution to the crisis, but Nielsen said Greenland had some red lines that could not be crossed, even if he hoped to come to some sort of agreement, without elaborating.

"We are under pressure, serious pressure. We are trying to push back from the outside. We are trying to handle our people who are afraid, scared," he said in a joint conversation with Frederiksen at Sciences Po University.

But he also said: "We need to do more surveillance and security in our region because of the way Russia acts now."

The U.S. demand for control of Greenland has shaken transatlantic relations and accelerated European efforts to reduce dependence on the United States, even as Trump last week withdrew tariff threats and ruled out taking Greenland by force.

Frederiksen said that what the crisis had shown was that the majority of Europeans were on the same page and had been able to unite to push back on Trump's demands, notably his threat of additional tariffs on some European states.

"I think there are some lessons learned in the last couple of weeks for Europe," she later said at a press conference with Macron and Nielsen.

Saying the world order had changed forever and questioning what may happen in Washington in the future, Frederiksen said it was vital for Europe to become stronger, but also urged transatlantic unity given it was clear Russia did not want peace.

"If we allow Russia to win in Ukraine, they will continue," she said. "The best way forward for the United States, Europe is to stick together."

The diplomatic rift between Denmark and the United States, both founding members of NATO, had seemed in recent weeks to threaten the future of the military alliance, although the conflict has since been moved to a diplomatic track.

Half of the landmass in the Arctic is Russian territory . Since 2005 Moscow has re-opened and modernised tens of Soviet-era military bases, both on its Arctic mainland and on the islands off its northern coast.

Russia says talk of Moscow and Beijing being a threat to Greenland is a myth to whip up hysteria.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7BKVULUVVZLBLNFI35KW5C24II.jpg?auth=0047a7b8746880b65bb67cc660b628a1fcfae3fce4fef596c0ba4a6110ecb0d7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells Iran to make nuclear deal or next attack will be 'far worse'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-iran-make-nuclear-deal-or-next-attack-will-be-far-worse-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons or the next U.S. attack would be far worse.

"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS - one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!" Trump wrote in a social media post.

The Republican U.S. president, who during his first White House term pulled out of world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, noted that his last warning to Iran was followed by a military strike in June.

"The next attack will be far worse! Don’t make that happen again," Trump wrote. He also repeated that a U.S. "armada" was heading toward the Islamic Republic.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requested negotiations, state media reported on Wednesday.

Trump said a U.S. naval force headed by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, was approaching Iran. Two U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday that the Lincoln and supporting warships had arrived in the Middle East.

The warships started moving from the Asia-Pacific region last week as U.S.-Iranian tensions soared following a bloody crackdown on protests across Iran by its clerical authorities in recent weeks.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations over economic privations and political repression have since abated.

He has said the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear program after the June airstrikes by Israeli and U.S. forces on key nuclear installations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TO3IMSYUEJIKHNQ3CCOCOQ6AWY.jpg?auth=2ca6bd1a9ebae916c0f5e59d3e248ee5738cdb3b50588a0a4a094dd92d5dd8e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey aims to lift trade volume with Nigeria to $5 billion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/turkey-aims-lift-trade-volume-with-nigeria-5-billion-2026-01-28/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkey aims to lift its trade volume with Nigeria to $5 billion from about $2 billion, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday following a meeting with visiting Nigerian President Bola Tinubu.

Turkey exports aircraft, helicopters, machinery, iron and steel, and chemical products to Nigeria, while Nigeria supplies crude oil and agricultural commodities to Turkey.

The two countries signed agreements covering defence cooperation, infrastructure development, trade and investment, as well as joint efforts to tackle insurgency in Africa’s Sahel region.

Erdogan did not give a timeline for reaching the new trade target but said talks had begun.

“We see significant potential in the fields of trade and investment. In today’s meetings, our commitment is to the $5 billion trade volume target, and we discussed the steps needed,” he said.

Tinubu has been promoting foreign investment to spur growth in Africa’s largest economy following reforms introduced shortly after he took office in 2023.

Tinubu said "trade, business, no restrictions, giving opportunities to those who are ready to learn, work and prosper" is critical to his growth ambition. "How do we build an inclusive economy together? How do we involve vulnerable people? How do we ensure peace in the world?" the Nigerian leader asked.

Erdogan said Turkey would support Nigeria’s fight against insurgency, drawing on its own experience combating militant groups.

"Terrorist organisations emerging particularly in Africa’s Sahel region pose a threat to the peace of the entire continent,” he said. “We discussed opportunities for closer cooperation in military training and intelligence, and we are ready to share our country’s significant experience.”

Nigerian officials are expected to hold meetings with leading Turkish defence industry companies during the visit, Erdogan added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SOCUBISPWJLMFM4SWLYXPIPNYU.jpg?auth=ac056a6d1d3d2e6cea1697976ddc0cc4209355ed8eb994a7df88f890cc668464&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia weighs expansion of premium residency program to lure rich</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-weighs-expansion-premium-residency-program-lure-talent-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is drafting plans to extend its premium residency program to a wider selection of desirable individuals, including superyacht owners, those looking to live in the kingdom's flagship development projects and top students, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The deliberations, which have not yet been finalized, are part of efforts to attract foreign capital and visitors under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan to diversify the country's economy away from oil and transform society.

The person said that people purchasing real estate at Vision 2030 construction projects, such as Riyadh's $60 billion Diriyah development, could be eligible.

Potentially offering premium residency to ultra-wealthy individuals who moor superyachts in Saudi Arabia's waters appeared aimed at encouraging visitors to the new luxury Red Sea resorts.

High-achieving students may also be included.

Premium residency is currently available based on varying criteria.

It includes executives earning more than 80,000 Saudi riyals ($21,300) per month and specialized health and science professionals earning more than 35,000 riyals per month, according to an online brochure marketing the program.

Benefits include entry without a visa, the ability to work and the ability to extend premium residency status to family members.

The Saudi Premium Residency program did not immediately respond to emailed questions from Reuters.

The move would be the latest step in trying to make Saudi Arabia more attractive to foreign visitors.

The kingdom has already implemented rules affording premium residency to anyone purchasing a property worth more than $1 million.

Last year, the once ultra-conservative kingdom loosened restrictions on alcohol , allowing non-Muslim premium residents and high-earners to purchase alcoholic beverages at a designated Riyadh store.

Since January 22, non-Saudis have been allowed to own residential and commercial property in certain parts of the kingdom, though regulations have not yet been fully rolled out.

No one was ‍injured in the blaze which started in the attic of the Hotel des Grandes ​Alpes at around 7pm (18:00 GMT) on Tuesday. It was ​still burning and belching thick clouds of smoke late on Wednesday morning, the Prefecture of the Savoie region, where Courchevel is located, said on its website.

Officials said around 200 people were evacuated from the hotel last night, while the nearby Hotel Le Lana, was ‍also being evacuated on Wednesday morning due to risk as the fire was still ​ongoing. Staff and guests took refuge in other hotels, the local government said, while 131 firefighters have been deployed.

"They are working in ‌very difficult conditions," Vanina Nicoli, the prefect of Savoie, told reporters. Four of them were harmed by the ‍smoke, she said.

Firefighters managed to prevent the fire from spreading to other buildings so far and no further evacuations were planned at this stage, Nicoli said.

The Gendarmerie was looking into what caused the fire.

Corneille Nangaa, who leads the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), was referring to a strategic partnership agreement signed in Washington on December 4, under which the United States would obtain greater access to the Democratic Republic of Congo's critical minerals in exchange for investment and security cooperation.

In an interview with Reuters in Goma on Monday, Nangaa said the plan suffered from a lack of transparency and legal shortcomings, citing what he called "the opacity surrounding the negotiations" and "procedural flaws, particularly the violation of the Constitution and the law."

Nangaa's criticism of the deal raises further questions about the feasibility of U.S. investment in war-hit eastern Congo one year after M23 seized Goma, the region's biggest city, as part of a lightning offensive.

Most of eastern Congo’s key minerals, including coltan, lie in areas now held by M23, which has seized major mining zones such as Rubaya in North Kivu.

Mining sites offered to Washington could later become the subject of disputes because they may already have been granted to other partners, Nangaa said.

"The Americans may have signed it, but they should know that they signed it with an illegitimate regime, and a corrupt one at that," he said.

Asked for comment, the Congolese presidency rejected Nangaa's accusations, saying the partnership “fully falls within the constitutional prerogatives” of the elected president and government.

It called concerns over potential disputes with existing contract holders “speculative”, and said any cooperation would respect valid contracts and comply with Congo's mining regulations.

Congo's government has said the partnership will be presented to lawmakers for approval in March. "We have a sound majority in parliament, so we believe that we will get the parliament's approval", Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Economy Daniel Mukoko Samba told Reuters in Davos last week.

In the interview with Reuters, Nangaa said the AFC worked with neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda on security issues but denied receiving support from Kigali.

Rwanda denies backing M23, though a report by a United Nations group of experts in July assessed that it exercised command and control over the rebels.

Last week, Rwanda's ambassador to the United States said in a statement that Kigali engages in "security coordination" with AFC/M23.

The capture of Goma, a city of more than two million people on Congo's border with Rwanda, marked one of the biggest escalations in years of fighting in eastern Congo.

Nangaa told Reuters that security had improved in areas under rebel control since the takeover, adding that schools and hospitals were operating normally and that displaced people had returned home.

The U.N. Human Rights Office says M23, Congolese armed forces and other armed groups have committed serious rights violations , some of which may amount to war crimes. All sides deny wrongdoing.

Nangaa accused Kinshasa of blocking peace efforts, saying ceasefire commitments discussed in talks in Doha, mediated by Qatar with U.S. backing, had not been implemented. The Congolese government rejects those claims, blaming the rebel group for the continued violence.

M23 forces briefly entered the town of Uvira in December saying it sought to stop attacks on civilians, but later withdrew. Nangaa warned that further action could not be ruled out if insecurity continued.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BYNLJ4FIVVMBJKQ7PTAN3OIBHY.jpg?auth=34b3882a35dbf0c5827a7318c75e658a3ba098c655a4c21f2f77a1961ffd5fd0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gunmen kill three policemen in ambush in Nigeria's Katsina state</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/gunmen-kill-three-policemen-ambush-nigerias-katsina-state-2026-01-28/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Three police officers were killed and two others wounded when suspected armed gang members ambushed a routine patrol in northwest Nigeria's Katsina state on Tuesday, the police said on Wednesday.

The incident was part of a surge in attacks , including mass kidnappings by armed gangs operating from forest hideouts who have raided villages, schools and places of worship in the predominantly Muslim northwest.

Tuesday's ambush, the second in a week , highlights the region's persistent insecurity, where gangs known as bandits continue to hit rural communities and security forces despite ongoing military operations.

Katsina police spokesperson Abubakar Sadiq Aliyu said the officers came under heavy fire at about 1144 GMT along the Guga-Bakori road while on patrol. The team "responded bravely,” repelling the assault, but lost three officers in the shootout, Aliyu said in a statement.

Two wounded officers are being treated at a nearby hospital, he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Nigeria of failing to protect Christians. Nigerian authorities say Muslims are targeted as well as Christians and that they are doing their best to stop the violence in difficult circumstances.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nipah virus fears trigger airport checks across Asia after India confirms two cases</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-reports-two-nipah-virus-infections-thai-malaysia-step-up-screening-2026-01-28/</link><description>NEW DELHI/BANGKOK/SINGAPORE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Authorities across Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia have taken urgent steps to stop the highly lethal and epidemic‑prone Nipah virus spreading beyond India, rolling out airport temperature checks and other screening measures.

Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization because of its ability to spark fast‑moving outbreaks, its fatality rate of 40% to 75%, and the fact that there is no approved vaccine or cure.

Two infections were confirmed in India in late December.

The virus, carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can trigger a deadly brain-swelling fever in humans and can also spread directly from person to person through close contact. Several vaccines are in development but remain in testing.

The two people infected in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal in late December were health workers and both are under treatment at a local hospital, a district health officer told Reuters.

Authorities have identified and traced 196 contacts linked to the two cases with none showing symptoms and all testing negative for the virus, the Indian health ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday.

"Speculative and incorrect figures regarding Nipah virus disease cases are being circulated," the statement said. "Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, and field investigations were undertaken ... which ensured timely containment of the cases."

Reports of the infections put authorities on alert in neighbouring Southeast Asian nations as well as Nepal and Hong Kong.

Singapore's Communicable Diseases Agency said on Wednesday that it will set up temperature screening at its airport for flights arriving from areas affected by the infections in India.

The Ministry of Manpower is stepping up surveillance over newly arrived migrant workers from South Asia, and engaging primary care providers to increase vigilance, it said.

"We are also reaching out to our counterparts in South Asia, to better understand the situation. Work is ongoing to establish a global platform for countries to report genome sequencing of detected cases," the agency said in a statement.

A Hong Kong airport authority spokesperson said it was facilitating enhanced health screening measures enforced by the health department at Hong Kong International Airport, including temperature check at gates for passengers arriving from India.

Thailand earlier this week tightened airport screening measures, with neighbouring Malaysia following suit.

Thailand has assigned designated parking bays for aircraft arriving from areas with Nipah infections, its health ministry said, while passengers must complete health declarations before clearing immigration.

Malaysia's health ministry said it was boosting preparedness through health screening at international ports of entry, particularly for arrivals from countries deemed at risk.

"The ministry remains vigilant against the risk of cross-border transmission following sporadic infections in several other countries," it said in a statement on Wednesday.

China's disease control authority said on Tuesday that no Nipah infections had been detected in the country but there were risks of imported cases, state broadcaster CCTV said on Tuesday .

Nepal, which shares a busy border with India, said it was on "high alert" and had tightened screening for travellers. Health ministry officials said border points with India and China had been notified to remain vigilant and check suspected cases.

Nipah was first identified in 1998 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore, although scientists believe it has circulated in flying foxes for millennia and warn that a mutated, highly transmissible strain could emerge from bats.

India regularly reports sporadic infections, particularly in the southern state of Kerala , considered among the world's most at-risk regions for Nipah outbreaks. The virus has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in Kerala since it first appeared there in 2018.

The West Bengal cases are the state's first in nearly two decades, following five fatal infections in 2007, local media reported.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Switzerland to boost defence spending, funded by sales tax hike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/switzerland-boost-defence-spending-funded-by-sales-tax-hike-2026-01-28/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Switzerland plans to inject an additional 31 billion Swiss francs ($40.38 billion) into defence and security spending starting from 2028 and will increase sales tax for a decade to help fund it, the government said on Wednesday.

Citing a deterioration in the geopolitical situation, the governing Federal Council said defence must be strengthened in Switzerland, where spending on the military is not currently scheduled to reach 1% of gross domestic product until 2032.

Under the new plan, sales tax is to be increased by 0.8 percentage points for 10 years starting in 2028, it said.

"The world has become more volatile and insecure, and the international order based on international law is under strain," the government said, noting various European countries have responded by strengthening their defence capabilities.

Swiss officials and lawmakers warn that conflicts including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.S. rivalry with China and tensions in the Middle East pose a risk to the country, through threats such as spying, cyberattacks and even terror attacks.

The government said current financial planning no longer reflected increases in the cost of arms, which have been driven by inflation and greater demand.

The government's plan would need to pass parliament and faces a referendum that could take place next year, it said.

According to the plan, the spending priorities should also encompass investment in IT, cybersecurity and electromagnetic reconnaissance, as well as police and border protection.

In a statement, the Egyptian foreign ministry said four Egyptian crew members were currently on board the Reem alKhaleej vessel at Iran's Bandar Abbas port.

Iran said last month that it had seized a foreign oil tanker carrying 4 million litres of smuggled fuel near the Iranian island of Qeshm in the Gulf. It did not name the vessel or disclose its nationality, but said that 16 foreign crew members had been detained on criminal charges.

Iran, which has some of the world's lowest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and a sharp fall in the value of its national currency, has been seeking to curb widespread fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf states.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Small island states rate China as top development partner as West cuts aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/small-island-states-rate-china-top-development-partner-west-cuts-aid-2026-01-28/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A survey of small island ‌developing nations such as Mauritius and the Maldives showed China rated as the top bilateral development assistance partner amid U.S. aid cuts and Washington's pivot away from climate change, a report by ODI Global found.

Data from an ODI survey to which officials from 29 small island developing states responded found that in the aggregate, governments saw China as the most ‌valued bilateral partner - a view that has geopolitical implications, according to lead author Emily ​Wilkinson.

"These countries are important to different donors for geopolitical reasons," Wilkinson told Reuters.

China's showing among Caribbean countries - where Beijing historically had less involvement than the likes of the United States or the United Kingdom - was surprising, ‍she added.

The survey, conducted between July and November 2025, includes countries spanning from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, including the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Barbados, Cabo Verde, Mauritius and the Maldives.

Nations grouped under the small island developing nations moniker as ⁠defined by the World Bank also include some non-island states such as Belize and Guyana.

While small, some ‍are strategically located for the world's superpowers along key maritime routes.

A breakdown shows a more nuanced picture. The UK topped the ‌list ‌for half of the Caribbean respondents while Australia topped the list in the Pacific. China was number one for the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea island states.

ODI's analysis of finance flows capturing data between 2020 and 2023 shows Beijing provided $6 billion in developmental aid to small island states in the period, outstripping official ⁠development finance from Australia, ⁠at $4.78 billion, the United ​States at $3.17 billion and Japan at $2 billion.

Those figures came before U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office in January 2025, when he largely shuttered USAID - the vehicle for most American aid spending - and has scaled back any funds for climate ‍change.

The survey also found that while donor nations increasingly push innovative financing, such as debt swaps and debt pause clauses when climate disasters strike, there is limited take-up.

"The bigger vulnerability these countries say is the disproportionate impact on the extreme weather events ​have on their economies and the fact that they have, many ‍of them, very limited access to concessional finance," she said, adding the instruments do not get to the root of the problem ​because they don't actually reduce the level of debt.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PLIXCC2MFVOABJRRKV2OPHSUNE.jpg?auth=104db9976a832007a7f79ae43ad09722db166bb73d852964b92099bbe217df97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German police search Deutsche Bank offices in money-laundering probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/business/20260128-german-police-search-deutsche-bank-offices-in-money-laundering-probe</link><description>German prosecutors and police on Wednesday searched Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt and its office in Berlin in an investigation over suspected money laundering offences, officials said.

According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily , the probe is connected to suspected offences in the bank's dealings with companies linked to Russian billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich.

Prosecutors confirmed the raids at the premises of Germany 's biggest bank but did not say who was being targeted.

The Frankfurt prosecutors' office said it was carrying out an "investigation into unknown responsible parties and employees of Deutsche Bank on suspicion of money laundering... and related additional allegations under the Anti-Money Laundering Act".

"In the past, Deutsche Bank maintained business relationships with foreign companies that... are themselves suspected of having been used for the purpose of money laundering," a spokesman for the office said in a statement to AFP.

It said the investigation was being carried out by a specialist economic crime unit along with the federal police.

A spokesman for Deutsche Bank confirmed the searches, and the bank said it was "cooperating fully with prosecutors" but refused to comment further.

News site Der Spiegel said the search in Frankfurt involved around 30 plainclothes investigators.

According to financial sources, the probe relates to alleged offences committed between 2013 and 2018.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Deutsche Bank was being investigated on suspicion of failing to report possible money laundering in a timely manner.

The daily reported that the investigation involves both payments that Deutsche Bank received via a Russian correspondent account and the bank's previous dealings with Abramovich's own companies.

Abramovich has been sanctioned by the EU following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The raids come on the eve of the publication of the bank's results for the fourth quarter of 2025.

Deutsche Bank has faced scrutiny on several occasions in recent years over suspicious transactions.

In 2022, its offices were raided over "suspicious activity reports filed by the bank", again in relation to money laundering.

Media reports at the time said that the investigation centred on a transaction involving Rifaat al-Assad , the uncle of Syria 's then leader Bashar al-Assad .

In 2019, US Congressional committees issued subpoenas for Deutsche Bank's records on US President Donald Trump, including suspicious activity reports.

The bank reportedly lent more than $2 billion to Trump's businesses in the 1990s when other lenders wouldn't, in deals that piqued the interest of regulators .

The Trump family subsequently sued the bank to stop it from complying with the subpeonas.

The Frankfurt-based group also came under scrutiny for its role as a correspondence bank that handled foreign transactions for Danske Bank's Estonian branch, at the centre of a 200-billion-euro ($212-billion) money-laundering affair between 2007 and 2015.

Deutsche Bank subsequently agreed to pay a fine of 13.5 million euros for failing to report suspicious activity quickly enough, after an investigation by Frankfurt prosecutors.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:34:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1eec1a08-fc57-11f0-aacf-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-28T132931Z-1361127052-RC2CAJAD8Q13-RTRMADP-3-DEUTSCHE-BANK-RAIDS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘As in wartime’: Iranian doctors recount deadly crackdown on protesters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-as-in-wartime-iranian-doctors-recount-deadly-crackdown-on-protesters</link><description>One month after Iran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests that has left thousands dead, information and witness accounts are beginning to emerge.

The protests started on December 28 over a rise in the cost of living following a sharp fall in the Iranian rial and rapidly spread nationwide. They were met with a violent response, the full extent of which only began to surface after more than two weeks of an unprecedented nationwide internet blackout.

Several Iranian doctors who have since left the country told FRANCE 24 they were mobilised at the height of the protests, on the evenings of January 8 and January 9.

Their accounts converged, describing scenes of unprecedented chaos that some called "apocalyptic", and injuries resembling those seen in war. Medical facilities were quickly overwhelmed as dozens of wounded patients poured into each department, forcing staff to prioritise treatment according to the severity of injuries, they said.

"Just imagine: It was Thursday evening, there was no internet, communications were cut, and it was extremely difficult to reach doctors and ask them to come urgently to deal with this influx of people shot by bullets," one doctor said.

As the situation worsened, he said there was a wave of solidarity, with private hospitals – usually expensive – opening their doors.

"They were also overwhelmed. They refused no one and treated patients for free. Doctors said they did not want to make money, care had to be accessible to everyone."

Those injured over the two nights came from all age groups. "There was a 70-year-old man shot in the back, but also children and teenagers as young as 14," the doctor said.

Most wounds were concentrated on the head, face, abdomen, lower abdomen and flanks.

From midnight on January 8, the nature of the injuries changed, the doctor said. Live ammunition was now being used. "It was as if [the security forces] had received orders to shoot everyone, as in wartime," he said, adding that he was still operating at 2am.

The following night he was called in again to serve as reinforcement. "On Friday, they called to say a patient had arrived with a live round wound. From that moment on, there were only live rounds."

"The injuries suggested people were trying to flee, that they were hit by shots into the crowd without any specific target, at an angle. These are not the injuries seen in isolated clashes, for example between thieves and the police," he added.

Another doctor, deeply shaken, said he was unable to recover from what he witnessed. “My back is literally bent. I have never seen anything like this in my life,” he said, comparing the scenes to the Holocaust .

Videos authenticated by the France 24 Observers team showed the bodies of patients who died from severe injuries lined up, and in some cases stacked, in hospital corridors, reflecting the high number of fatalities.

According to Amnesty International , which has collected videos, photos and witness accounts, Iranian security forces used a wide array of lethal weapons – assault rifles and automatic or semi-automatic machine guns – firing continuously and indiscriminately into crowds. Evidence collected by the NGO indicated the authorities "committed mass unlawful killings on an unprecedented scale amid the shutdown".

In addition to those who were seriously wounded who flooded into Iranian healthcare centres on those nights, a number of protesters chose to avoid hospitals for fear of being arrested.

Some were treated clandestinely in private homes, "under extremely difficult conditions due to a lack of equipment", while painkillers quickly became unavailable, Iranian health workers told the French daily Libération.

Another witness told FRANCE 24 that an 18-year-old protester shot in the leg was admitted to hospital under a false name. Amid chaos and heightened security, her parents ultimately took her home, where a doctor operated on her.

One of the doctors interviewed by FRANCE 24 said he answered nearly 600 calls in two days, providing remote medical advice without intervening directly.

"It is impossible to know the exact number of deaths," he said. "Many died in the street without reaching hospital. Families took them home to keep them away from the authorities, then buried them secretly, out of sight."

According to a tally published Wednesday by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 6,221 people were killed , including 5,858 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 100 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating. The crackdown has seen more than 42,300 arrests, it added.

The agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran, verifies each death with a network of activists on the ground.

Two senior officials from Iran’s health ministry, quoted by Time magazine , said up to 30,000 people may have been killed in Iranian streets on January 8 and 9 alone.

One doctor said he did not witness direct intervention by security forces during treatment at the public hospital in Tehran where he worked. "But I saw people trying to obtain information about patients operated on during the night."

According to testimonies collected by Le Monde , some doctors deliberately entered false diagnoses – such as "liver surgery" – in medical files to protect patients, while intelligence agents reportedly collected radiology images showing bullet wounds.

In a voice note heard by FRANCE 24, a protester said he feared for his safety after accompanying a severely injured friend to hospital.

"I have never seen anything like this! They brought Dushkas (Soviet-made DShK heavy machine guns) into the street. They fired in continuous bursts, constantly changing ammunition. They spared no one," he said.

"My friend was standing next to me. I suddenly saw him fall. He was shot in the foot," he recounted tearfully. "I used my belt as a tourniquet and said to him, ‘Get up! Stand up!’ But he didn't say anything, he didn't answer me. Then I saw he had been shot again in the chest," he explained.

"We took him to hospital, where they told us it was already over for him and that we should take him away before [the security forces] came to collect his body."

That night haunts him, and he knows he is still not safe.

"The hospital surveillance cameras filmed us," he said, noting that Iranian authorities analyse CCTV footage. "Since then, I shake whenever I step outside. I fear that facial recognition software identified me. I haven't gone home. I'm afraid, and I don’t know what to do."

Security forces were known to target hospitals earlier in the unrest. On January 3, before the peak of the protests, they attacked Khomeini Hospital in Ilam, western Iran, firing teargas inside the building and arresting protesters from their hospital beds, triggering clashes outside.

Many injured protesters are still waiting for care, particularly those shot in the eyes with lead pellets fired from shotguns.

Amnesty International said such weapons were sometimes used at distances of less than two metres with protesters “repeatedly” targeted, particularly in the face.

At Farabi Hospital in Tehran, the capital’s main ophthalmology centre, "We received 55 patients from the provinces – from Qom, Hamedan and Aligoudarz – in recent days,” said hospital director Dr Ghassem Fakhrai in an interview with the official ISNA news agency.

"In the early hours of Friday morning, a large number of patients arrived with eye injuries, some with injuries to both eyes […]. By Saturday, we had treated 700[…]. Including transfers elsewhere, the total is nearly 1,000 patients. They require emergency surgery. This excludes those with just torn eyelids," he said.

"At Kasra Hospital in Karaj, in a single night from Thursday to Friday (January 8-9), around 40 eyes were removed," a first responder told Libération . "Numerous amputations caused by live rounds and crushed bones have also been reported."

Medical workers were also targeted in the crackdown. One doctor told FRANCE 24 that a colleague was killed on his way to the hospital.

Others were reportedly arrested for treating the wounded . Dr Alireza Golchini, a general surgeon at Dehkhoda Hospital in Qazvin in central Iran, was reportedly arrested for providing humanitarian assistance, according to several human rights advocates.

He has now been accused of espionage and faces the death penalty.

"Protocols are prepared, files are complete, and committees are in place to oversee the handover, ensuring a complete transfer of governance in the Gaza Strip across all sectors to the technocratic committee," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told AFP.

The 15-member National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) is a team of Palestinian technocrats created as part of the US-sponsored ceasefire agreement which came into effect on October 10.

It is charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza and will work under the supervision of the "Board of Peace", which US President Donald Trump will chair.

The NCAG, headed by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, is expected to enter the Gaza Strip once the territory's Rafah crossing, on its border with Egypt , reopens.

Hamas spokesman Qassem added that the Rafah crossing "must be opened in both directions, with full freedom of exit and entry to the Gaza Strip, without any Israeli obstacles".

Rafah is Gaza's only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel and is a key entry point for both people and goods.

It has been closed since Israeli forces took control of it in May 2024, except for a limited reopening in early 2025, and other bids to reopen have failed to materialise.

NCAG head Shaath announced last week that Rafah would reopen in both directions the following week.

Qassem told AFP the "independent national committee's announcement of the opening of the Rafah crossing is important".

"What is more important is that we monitor this committee's handling of citizens' departures and entries in full freedom in accordance with the agreement, and not according to Israeli conditions," he added.

Israel has said it would only allow pedestrians to travel through the crossing as part of its "limited reopening" once it had recovered the remains of the last hostage, Ran Gvili.

Israeli forces brought back Gvili's remains on Monday and his funeral was held in the southern town of Meitar on Wednesday.

Qassem said Wednesday that "it is clear that Hamas is committed to the agreement to stop the war on the Gaza Strip", which began after the militant group's deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

"It has carried out everything required of it in the first phase and is ready to enter all tracks of the second phase," he added.

With the technocratic committee's creation and the last hostage held in Gaza returned to Israel, the ceasefire deal's next important milestones will be Hamas's disarmament and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza.

Though Hamas said the return of Gvili's body showed its commitment to the ceasefire deal, it has so far not surrendered its weapons.

The group has repeatedly said disarmament is a red line, but it has also suggested it would be open to handing over its weapons to a Palestinian governing authority.

Neither Israel nor Hamas have committed to a clear date or strategy for withdrawal or disarmament.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:38:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7ab58472-fc5d-11f0-9113-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-28T123002Z-1752778568-RC2AAJALUHY0-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainians face tough weeks as Russia targets power sector during freeze</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainians-face-tough-weeks-russia-targets-power-sector-during-freeze-2026-01-28/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Life will be particularly tough for Ukrainians over the next three weeks due to plunging temperatures and intense Russian attacks on the energy system that have already deprived millions of light and heat, a senior lawmaker said on Wednesday.

Despite progress in peace talks that has led to trilateral negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the United States for the first time, Russia has stepped up bombardments beyond the front line that stretches across eastern and southern Ukraine.

Temperatures of below -20 degrees Celsius (-4°F) are expected in the northern and eastern part of Ukraine next week, according to official forecasts, extremely low for the country.

"The bad news is that there will indeed be frosts, and it will be difficult," Andriy Gerus, the head of the parliament's energy committee, told the national TV channel, Marathon.

"The good news is that we need to hold out for three weeks, and then it will get easier," he added, citing predicted warmer temperatures and increased solar power from longer days.

The last two Russian missile and drone attacks on the capital Kyiv in January left about a million people without electricity and 6,000 apartment buildings without heating. After weeks of repairs, about 700 buildings still lack heat.

That picture is replicated across the country, with northern and eastern Ukraine, home to major cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, regularly targeted, resulting in power restrictions for industry and power cuts for consumers.

Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector have long been key elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.

The head of Ukraine's largest private power producer DTEK told Reuters last week that Ukraine is nearing a "humanitarian catastrophe" due to the damage to its energy systems amidst the freezing temperatures, calling for a ceasefire on attacks on energy assets. Kyiv has targeted Russian oil processing infrastructure to reduce state revenues funding the war.

Ukraine's solar energy association said around 1.5 gigawatts of new solar capacity was commissioned by Ukraine in 2025 and the total installed solar capacity in Ukraine exceeded 8.5 gigawatts, including residential installations.

The volume is higher than the installed capacity of all three Ukrainian-controlled nuclear power plants of 7.7 gigawatts - and helped the country cope during repairs to those plants last summer - but output depends on the weather.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said this month Ukraine's damaged energy system was meeting only 60% of the country's electricity needs this winter, with electricity generation capacity of 11 gigawatts against a need of 18 gigawatts.

Maximum electricity imports from EU countries, combined with power cuts across entire regions, are allowing the system to remain balanced nevertheless.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:33:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K2L3XBF3PZM5XLZMI4K2WF6WVA.jpg?auth=1e9f0fcf49017741f01a6180eb4af3b75a356148ec12100281c02e4d4ae310dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French PMs Philippe and Attal favoured centrist candidates for next presidential election -poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-french-pms-philippe-attal-favoured-centrist-candidates-next-presidential-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Former French Prime Ministers Edouard Philippe and Gabriel Attal are the favoured candidates to lead the centrist challenge in next year's presidential election, said an Elabe/BFM TV poll on Wednesday.

The centrist French political bloc close to President Emmanuel Macron lost its grip in the lower house of parliament after Macron called a snap parliamentary election in 2024, and it has faced unyielding pressure from both the far-right National Rally (RN) and far-left France Unbowed (LFI) parties.

Philippe - Macron's first prime minister - has consistently portrayed himself as a 2027 presidential candidate .

He has also increasingly criticised Macron in recent years, as Macron's attempts to get a budget through parliament has faced consistent challenges from opposition parties.

The Elabe/BFM TV poll added that former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was seen as the favoured candidate from the traditional, conservative right-wing camp for the 2027 election.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:35:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AHFQNP6MCJNRNPECF4MUWEX6UI.jpg?auth=930138880960deabab0a0983df94381b65430cfd8f59f84b07e08c53497d9296&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US tells UN: Gaza demilitarization to include internationally funded buyback program</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-tells-un-gaza-demilitarization-include-internationally-funded-buyback-program-2026-01-28/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The demilitarization of Gaza will include decommissioning weapons through an agreed process "supported by an internationally funded buyback" program, the United States told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday.

Palestinian militant group Hamas retains control of just under half of Gaza following an October ceasefire deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump . The agreement ties further Israeli troop withdrawals to Hamas giving up its weapons.

The United States - along with the 26 countries who have so far joined Trump's so-called Board of Peace and in consultation with the Palestinian National Committee that it oversees - will apply pressure on Hamas to disarm, according to the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz.

"Hamas must not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly or indirectly, in any form, period," he told the 15-member council. "All military terror and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt.

"International, independent monitors will supervise a process of demilitarization of Gaza to include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning and supported by an internationally funded buyback and reintegration program," he added.

Waltz did not elaborate and the U.S. mission to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for more detail on the independent monitoring and proposed buyback program.

Hamas recently agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions and with mediators, sources have said. However, two Hamas officials told Reuters that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday Washington believes disarmament by Hamas militants would come with some sort of amnesty for the Islamist group.

Hamas remains heavily armed, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told the Security Council.

"It still holds thousands of rockets, anti-tank missiles, and tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles. In total, Hamas still holds roughly 60,000 assault rifles," Danon said. "These weapons are used not only against Israel but against Gazans who oppose Hamas rule."

The Security Council in November mandated Trump's Board of Peace through 2027 and solely focused on the Gaza Strip. Russia and China abstained, complaining the U.S.-drafted resolution did not give the United Nations a clear role in Gaza's future.

The resolution described the board as a transitional administration "that will set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza" under Trump's peace plan until the Palestinian Authority has satisfactorily reformed. It also authorized the board to deploy a temporary International Stabilization Force in Gaza.

"We salute and thank our friends who have agreed to contribute to the international stabilization force," Waltz said. The United States has not yet announced which countries have agreed to contribute.

"The ISF will begin to establish control and stability, so that the Israeli Defense Forces can withdraw from Gaza based on standards, milestones and time frames linked to demilitarization," said Waltz.

He added that these would be agreed upon by the Israeli military, the ISF and the guarantors for the ceasefire agreement - the United States, Egypt and Qatar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:39:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2PXLTPH2YZLPDGMS27MGBRNP4E.jpg?auth=7dab38a281158cbd5ab12cf2dd1bc646dc6d60d15bb99afceb68ff894d62ca08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump warns Minneapolis mayor over lack of cooperation with immigration agents</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-warns-minneapolis-mayor-over-lack-cooperation-with-immigration-agents-2026-01-28/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday he was "playing with fire" after the Democratic leader reiterated that his city would not help federal agents enforce immigration law, a day after the president said his administration would "de-escalate a bit" in the city.

Tensions remained high in Minneapolis, where observers and activists say immigration raids appear to have been more targeted and less confrontational over the last 24 hours. The city has been convulsed by unrest after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by federal officers, including Saturday's killing of nurse Alex Pretti.

Trump's administration has signaled it will soften its approach, dispatching border czar Tom Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism.

A senior administration official said Homan's arrival would mark a shift to more traditional targeted operations rather than the broad sweeps Bovino has led in multiple cities. Yet it remained unclear how much would change in a city where federal agents have regularly clashed with protesters.

Observers and activists told Reuters that Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity appeared to slow somewhat on Tuesday before resuming in full on Wednesday. They said there did now appear to be more of an emphasis on targeted exercises.

On Wednesday, ICE agents were seen in several parts of the city rolling up to homes and businesses in caravans of three vehicles with six to eight agents in total, then knocking on doors and looking around, seemingly for a specific person.

If that person was not found, observers said, the agents were seen leaving. In past weeks, agents might have begun randomly stopping people and demanding to see proof of legal status, a practice that has enraged community members and led to heated encounters.

It is difficult to know precisely how many raids are taking place. Authorities do not share that information, and volunteers who track ICE and Border Patrol vehicles say many of their encrypted communication chats have broken into atomized, hyper-local groups, partly to avoid infiltration by federal agents.

"They definitely shift around," said Patty O'Keefe, a community ICE observer in south Minneapolis. "Let up for a few days so people let their guard down, I think."

One observer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe the change in tone from Trump meant there would be a meaningful slowdown in detentions.

"Like everybody out here, though, we can hope that maybe the change of having Homan come in could mean that ICE will shoot and kill less, that they won't attack people like us keeping watch on them," he said.

In one sign that political tensions remain heated, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat and a frequent Trump target, was sprayed with a foul-smelling liquid by a man with a syringe during a Tuesday town hall, where she called for the abolition of ICE.

Omar was unharmed, and Minneapolis police arrested the suspect, Anthony Kazmierczak, 55, for third-degree assault. It was not clear whether Kazmierczak, who was booked into Hennepin County Jail, had an attorney.

Separately, Ecuador's foreign ministry sent a note of protest to the U.S. embassy in Quito after the ministry said an ICE agent tried to enter its Minneapolis consulate on Tuesday.

Under mounting political pressure, Trump had dialed back his attacks on Frey and Governor Tim Walz after speaking with both Democrats in the wake of Pretti's killing, vowing to work with them to lower the temperature.

But on social media on Wednesday, Trump faulted Frey for saying the city would not enforce immigration laws: "Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!"

Trump has threatened to cut off funding for states that include so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, which limit how much cooperation they give federal immigration authorities.

In response, Frey wrote on social media, "The job of our police is to keep people safe, not enforce fed immigration laws."

Pretti, 37, was shot dead during protests near his home on Saturday, and some administration officials immediately accused him of planning to kill law enforcement officers, citing the handgun he was carrying.

But video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot a restrained Pretti in the back.

The killing, coupled with the earlier fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer, has become a major political crisis for Trump. A growing number of Republicans in Congress, who rarely buck Trump, have called for independent investigations into the shooting.

Stephen Miller, the White House adviser widely seen as the architect of Trump's immigration policy, said in a statement reported by CNN that agents "may not have been following" protocol before Pretti was shot. Miller had previously described Pretti as an "assassin" and "terrorist" immediately after the shooting.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:40:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DTBLHQTWSZNTHNII6SD2R5YPW4.jpg?auth=79bdba2327cca2703c042a05e029124203472784dfbdf4c17a275f75f320af4b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio says territorial issue over Donetsk yet to be bridged between Russia, Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rubio-says-territorial-issue-over-donetsk-yet-be-bridged-between-russia-ukraine-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Territorial issues over Donetsk are the remaining item that still require a bridging of views at U.S.-mediated talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday, describing the issue as "a very difficult one."

FBI agents were searching the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in Union City, the agency said in a statement, a facility that state officials opened in 2023.

Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, including winning in Georgia. Trump returned to the White House for a second term last year after winning the 2024 election.

Representatives for Fulton County's election office referred queries to the county's external affairs office, which did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The U.S. Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The Democratic-leaning county is home to Atlanta, Georgia's biggest city, and backed Biden by a wide margin in the 2020 election.

Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn the election result, pressuring the state's top election official to "find" him votes that would allow him to claim victory. Earlier this month he asked a state court for $6.2 million in legal fees he said he spent fighting criminal charges of election interference filed by the county's chief prosecutor, District Attorney Fani Willis.

The prosecution of Trump by Willis for alleged racketeering foundered after revelations that she had a romantic relationship with one of the lawyers she hired, and the case was dismissed last year. The New York Times reported last year that the U.S. Justice Department has issued subpoenas for records related to Willis.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has also sued several states, demanding that they turn over large volumes of voter data. States have challenged the demands as an unconstitutional infringement on their authority to manage elections. A few judges have tossed out the lawsuits, most recently this week in Oregon.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:30:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RL4IF645XNI6VN4DDDZWXMGEFA.jpg?auth=64d39b0c201f633bfa965b9164f971e0dd0046fb45033b2807f4b7f5fda768af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fall of top Chinese general stirs US uncertainty about China's military</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/fall-top-chinese-general-stirs-us-uncertainty-about-chinas-military-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON/BEIJING, Jan 28 (Reuters) - With the downfall of China's top general, the United States has lost an important contact on Beijing's top military body and now faces a People's Liberation Army that increasingly lacks steady, experienced commanders, said former U.S. officials and analysts.

China's defense ministry said on Saturday that Zhang Youxia, second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), is under investigation. It is the latest and highest-profile purge of the country's top military leadership amid Xi's crackdown on corruption in the armed forces.

For Washington, Zhang's surprising demise removes a respected and well-known figure within China's military at a time when successive U.S. administrations have worked to build senior-level contacts to avoid mishaps between the world's two most powerful militaries.

Several former senior U.S. officials told Reuters that Zhang's dismissal came as a shock.

Xi allowed Zhang to communicate with the U.S. during the Biden administration after a 17-month-long period during which China had cut off nearly all military-to-military communications following a visit to Taiwan by then-Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.

Such a senior-level connection - in China's political system, Zhang outranks the defense minister - was seen as an important relationship and a channel that remained viable for further talks.

One of just a few leading officers with combat experience from China's invasion of Vietnam in the late-1970s, Zhang was seen in the U.S. as a competent adviser to Xi, who sits atop the Central Military Commission, now staffed by only one general, a career political commissar Zhang Shengmin.

"Who does Xi Jinping convene in a crisis if there's only one person on his commission?" said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore who engaged with Zhang as a former U.S. defense official.

Thompson said he believed Zhang was the one active-duty PLA officer who could give Xi objective advice about China's military capabilities and shortcomings, as well as the human cost of conflict.

"There's a risk that Xi Jinping is given bad advice by sycophants who tell him what he wants to hear," he said. "That creates a risk of miscalculation."

A senior U.S. administration official said the White House had nothing to share regarding "reports of palace intrigue" in China, adding that the Trump administration is "building a military capable of denying aggression anywhere in the First Island Chain."

The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Washington also did not respond.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held talks multiple times with China's Defense Minister Dong Jun - who does not sit on the CMC - since September, part of U.S. efforts to improve communications with China over its military modernization, nuclear weapons build-up, and more aggressive posture toward U.S. allies and actions in the Indo-Pacific.

But American officials have long prized contact with vice chairs of the CMC over the country's Defense Ministry, which lacks command authority over China's armed forces.

Among senior Chinese generals, Zhang was a known quantity to U.S. officials, having joined a week-long military delegation to the U.S. in May 2012 when he was a lower-level general.

David Stilwell, a former U.S. Air Force General who served as the State Department's top diplomat for East Asia in the first Trump administration, recalls that Zhang was the only Chinese officer who wanted to fly in one of the U.S. military's Osprey aircraft on that trip.

"He is very different from his fellow PLA brothers. He could have fit in very well in the U.S. military," Stilwell said, noting that he was keen to talk to U.S. soldiers and try out U.S. weapons, and struck the Americans as a professional rather than political soldier.

Still, Stilwell said senior-level engagement with CMC generals was typically perfunctory. Without Zhang to advise Xi, his main concern was that the PLA was more likely to believe a self-constructed narrative that they were ready for a "Taiwan adventure."

"I think what you lose with Zhang Youxia gone is a voice of reason," Stilwell said.

U.S. interactions with senior CMC generals have been an infrequent feature of bilateral diplomacy over the past two decades.

Biden administration national security advisor Jake Sullivan was the last known senior U.S. official to meet Zhang when the two held talks in August 2024 in Beijing.

Eric Hundman, a Chinese military expert at Washington-based security consultancy BluePath Labs, said military-to-military exchanges under Xi, even at the CMC level, tended to be scripted.

"The PLA knows its capabilities fairly well and is not interested in moving on Taiwan before they think they're ready. My question mark has always been how much Xi Jinping listens to them on that point," Hundman said.

"To the degree that he's getting worse advice, that would worry me," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:30:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E5SXHVYSAZK5HBSIUT4UETO55Y.jpg?auth=49e9f03fcb0a818bf53e5ac0587f24992b2e6b7290d5ec3e2ac040a00862f117&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In U-turn, France backs move to put Iran's Guards on EU terrorism list</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/u-turn-france-backs-move-put-irans-guards-eu-terrorism-list-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France will now support the inclusion of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the European list of terrorist organisations, a move that Paris has always been hesitant to back for fear that it could cut ties with Iran.

European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were already due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests that has seen thousands killed and thousands more arrested.

But even until earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU's terrorist organisation list following the United States.

"The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain," Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X, adding that France would now back the listing.

The French presidency had earlier announced the decision.

Set up after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.

With France, Italy and Germany now in favour, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday.

While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU's terrorist list, others, led by France have been more cautious.

They have feared that it could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, but also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons.

Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year.

Anti-government protests that swept across Iran since December have triggered the bloodiest crackdown by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, drawing international condemnation.

Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal given the IRGC's role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said was tantamount to terrorist activity.

"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it’s probably a duck and it’s good to call that out," said one senior EU diplomat.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:30:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2JQPB2T3MRKJ5HDX62DU5ME5UQ.jpg?auth=411f96352a3bcc0d77a34294b8d38c343c9139497aedaed9489cf9439cbf4f1b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs push to put Iran's Revolutionary Guards on EU terrorism list</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-france-backs-push-eu-list-iran-revolutionary-guards-terrorist-group</link><description>France is to back a move led by Italy for the European Union to list the Iran 's Revolutionary Guards as a "terrorist organisation", the French presidency said Wednesday, after the force was accused of taking a leading role in a deadly crackdown on protests .

France "supports the inclusion of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the European list of terrorist organisations," the Élysee Palace said.

"The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered," Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot added in a post on X, confirming that France would back the listing.

"The extraordinary courage (the Iranian people) have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain," Barrot said.

France had previously been hesitant to back such a move for fear it could cut all ties with Tehran.

The IRGC is seen as Iran's ideological army with the mandate to ensure the survival of the 1979 Islamic revolution. It is already listed as a terror group by Australia, Canada and the United States but not yet by the EU or UK.

A terrorist group designation by the EU would subject IRGC members to travel bans, asset freezes and "a prohibition on making funds or economic resources available to those listed", according to rules established by the European Council.

Iran's latest protests started on December 28 over a rise in the cost of living and rapidly spread nationwide . They were met with a violent response , the full extent of which only began to surface after more than two weeks of an unprecedented nationwide internet blackout.

According to a tally published Wednesday by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 6,221 people were killed , including 5,858 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 100 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:32:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/767ea0f2-7980-11ef-b008-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24265261045326.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador raids leftist politicians' homes over alleged Venezuela campaign funds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-raids-leftist-politicians-homes-over-alleged-venezuela-campaign-funds-2026-01-28/</link><description>QUITO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ecuador's prosecutor's office raided homes of politicians from former President Rafael Correa's leftist party on Wednesday, investigating alleged illicit money from Venezuela used to finance the 2023 presidential campaign.

The raids targeted presidential candidate Luisa Gonzalez and other members of the Citizens' Revolution party as part of a probe into alleged organized crime and money laundering, the prosecutor's office said.

• Prosecutors allege cash from Venezuela was used to finance the campaign, without providing further details.

• President Daniel Noboa recently said money linked to ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro entered Ecuador through local party campaign financing. The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

• Maduro was captured in Venezuela this month in a U.S. military raid and faces federal drug trafficking charges.

• "Citizens' Revolution and Luisa Gonzalez have not received a single cent from Venezuela, from any cartel, or from anyone," Gonzalez told reporters, calling it political persecution.

• Gonzalez said her party submitted campaign expenses to electoral authorities and accused the prosecutor's office of lacking evidence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:55:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US agents involved in fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis placed on leave</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260128-us-agents-involved-in-fatal-shooting-of-alex-pretti-in-minneapolis-placed-on-leave</link><description>Two immigration agents involved in the fatal shooting of a protester in Minneapolis have been placed on leave, a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said Wednesday, as President Donald Trump battles backlash over the incident.

"The two officers involved are on administrative leave. This is standard protocol," the spokesperson told AFP in a statement.

Intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti was shot multiple times on Saturday after being forced to the ground by camouflaged officers in a scuffle captured on video.

His death, which followed the deadly shooting of another female protester by an immigration officer earlier in January, sparked nationwide and bipartisan outrage.

Trump has called for an "honorable and honest investigation" into Pretti's death and suggested he would "de-escalate a little bit" the administration's immigration crackdown in the city in the northern state of Minnesota.

Stephen Miller – a powerful figure who leads Trump's hardline immigration policy – told AFP Tuesday that the agents may have breached "protocol" before the shooting.

The White House later said Miller was referring to "general guidance" to immigration agents operating in Minnesota, not the specific incident involving Pretti.

Foreign nationals with clean criminal records who arrived before the end of 2025, and who can prove they’ve lived in Spain for at least five months, will soon be eligible for renewable one-year residence permits. People who applied for asylum in the country before December 31 will also be able to apply. Migration Minister Elma Saiz said Tuesday that she expects applications to open April through June.

This extraordinary mass regularisation – the first in Spain in more than 20 years – was born from a citizen-backed proposal signed by some 700,000 people and supported by hundreds of civil society groups, including the Catholic Church .

While most immigrants in Spain have legal status, the country’s booming economy has also drawn hundreds of thousands of largely working-age people from across the world to work in the country’s underground economy. Undocumented migrants work on construction sites, on farms, in shops and restaurants or in people's homes, cooking and cleaning and caring for children.

The bulk of these workers come from the country’s former colonial holdings across Latin America and North Africa such as Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador and nearby Morocco .

And while footage of migrants scrambling over the barbed-wire fences surrounding Spain’s North African exclaves or lurching towards the Canary Islands in flimsy dinghies weigh heavily on the public imagination, the reality is usually less dramatic.

Most undocumented migrants are people who entered Spain legally , going on to overstay their visas and find cash-in-hand work in what has become known as the country’s “black economy”.

The decision sits in stark contrast to a hardening approach to irregular immigration that has flourished across Europe and the US in recent years as the far right gains ground.

Despite declining numbers of irregular arrivals, European Union states in December last year backed harsher migration measures that would allow rejected asylum seekers to be deported to offshore “return hubs” or countries with which they have no connection.

In France, last year’s figures show rising numbers of deportations paired with fewer cases of undocumented migrants being granted legal pathways to work.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has maintained that – far from being a drain on the country’s social services as critics claim – migrants play a crucial role in keeping the country’s welfare state standing. Bringing half a million workers into the formal economy, he argues, will only strengthen the country’s social security system.

Migration Policy Institute Europe deputy director Jasmijn Slootjes said that Spain’s decision was partly in response to fears that the ageing native-born population won’t be capable of sustaining the kind of workforce the country needs to thrive.

“If you look at the demographic decline, the fertility rate in Spain is the lowest in Europe – so it's really, really low,” she said.

“There were a lot of skill shortages, labour shortages, and de facto a lot of irregular migrants are working, although in informal work. And through regularising you can, of course, get more tax payments, and you also get better matching [to] their skills – because people can actually work at their skill level. So it’s a very pragmatic approach.”

She said that the Sanchez government – which announced this decision as part of a deal struck with its erstwhile coalition partners, the leftist PODEMOS party – was championing migration as a fundamental driver of the country’s flourishing economy.

Official data released on Tuesday indicated that 52,500 of the 76,200 people who raised employment numbers in the final quarter of 2025 were born overseas, with that same quarter marking Spain's lowest unemployment rate in 18 years.

“That’s really something that's being mentioned time and again – this link to the economy, maintaining social welfare access and a healthy, competitive country. That is really a core argument in all of this, and the evidence is indeed pointing that way,” Slootjes said.

“I think one quote of [Sanchez's] is very clear in clarifying their approach – he says, ‘Spain needs to choose between being an open and prosperous country, or a closed-off and poor country’,” she said.

Since the last mass regularisation in 2005 – the sixth such amnesty since the fall of the Franco dictatorship – Spain has pursued a less dramatic approach to undocumented migrants, offering them a step-by-step pathway over several years towards gaining a legal right to live, work and eventually become a Spanish citizen.

Despite a turbulent 20 years of boom and bust as Spain weathered the 2008 global financial crisis and then the Covid-19 pandemic, the country has largely avoided the rising anti-immigration sentiment that has pushed far-right parties into prominence – and sometimes power – across Europe and beyond.

That changed in 2018 with the arrival of Vox on the political scene. Born out of a broader backlash to Catalan separatism, the far-right party won the third-most seats in parliament in 2019 on an increasingly anti-immigration platform.

Unsurprisingly, Vox party leader Santiago Abascal was incensed by the announcement.

“The tyrant Sanchez hates the Spanish people. He wants to replace them ,” he posted on social media, adding that Sanchez wants to " accelerate the invasion ”, echoing oft-repeated right-wing narratives.

Abascal instead called for “remigration” – another far-right rallying cry that champions the mass deportation of people born overseas, sometimes including naturalised citizens .

Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the conservative People’s Party – which oversaw several of the amnesties in previous decades – has also criticised the decision, as the party struggles to head off rising support for the anti-immigration Vox.

Slootjes said that while Spain was not immune from the rising tide of nativist sentiment, levels of anti-immigration feeling had not reached the same heights as in other parts of Europe.

“Spain is also witnessing similar trends that we’ve been seeing in other countries in Europe and also across the Atlantic, of course, which is this increasing restrictive narrative around migration and a rise of support for the far right,” she said.

“This is really a moment where Vox is very vocal and really pushing this issue. So for those who are anti-migrant and agree with them, of course this can bolster their support."

Spanish think-tank Funcas in May last year found that local support for immigration was among the highest in Europe , with just 28 percent of respondents favouring restricted immigration in 2024. Those attitudes appeared to endure even as the country reeled from mass unemployment in the wake of the 2008 crash.

"Even during years when unemployment exceeded 25 percent, support for immigration remained largely stable," the report said.

And with more and more countries across Europe facing similar demands for workers, giving those people already practicing their livelihoods without legal protections a pathway out of precarity could well be a way forward, she noted.

“It's food for thought for policymakers across Europe and across the world, especially as this competition for talent and skill shortages, and ageing and demographic decline are plaguing our economies and societies, and it will all ramp up,” she said. “So it's going to be interesting to see how this may become more of a tool in the future, maybe if the tides are shifting and Spain is really testing it out and really creating this evidence to build future policies on how to do it – and how to do it well.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:57:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0610f774-fc66-11f0-a4e9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25295334634240.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian police fire tear gas, protester injured in Lagos floating slum protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-police-fire-tear-gas-protester-injured-lagos-floating-slum-protests-2026-01-28/</link><description>LAGOS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Nigerian police fired tear gas to disperse residents protesting in Lagos on Wednesday over demolition work in one of Africa's largest floating slums that has displaced thousands of people, with one protester reportedly injured.

Lagos state officials, with the help of armed police and excavators, have been demolishing homes in the Makoko slum on the edge of the commercial capital, arguing that residents illegally built their houses - mostly wooden shacks built on stilts above the water - near high-voltage power lines.

On Wednesday, more than 1,000 angry residents and affected families marched to the Lagos State House of Assembly to express their outrage over the demolitions.

The demonstrators refused a police order to disperse and instead demanded to be addressed by the Lagos state governor, whose office is nearby.

Police fired tear gas to disperse the gathering. One person sustained a leg injury and was taken to hospital.

"We were tear-gassed at Alausa. Look at this person, he left his house and now he has become disabled," protester Yawo Gburo said, referring to the injured demonstrator.

Lagos police did not immediately comment.

Makoko, which is home to thousands of mostly poor Nigerians, began life as a fishing village more than 100 years ago. There is no official data on its population, with estimates ranging between 80,000 and 200,000 residents, according to nonprofit groups.

The megacity of Lagos, with an estimated population of more than 20 million, has suffered from a serious shortage of housing, leading to the development of many informal and illegal settlements.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 20:38:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EXQ5CELYPZMVVM7PMXXUMDGOLY.jpg?auth=72d71605256bf511a264b696526644657f23099d41dd259ecc213be709189dda&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Greenland and Denmark start diplomatic talks to ease Trump tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-greenland-denmark-start-diplomatic-talks-ease-trump-tensions-2026-01-28/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Talks between the United States, Greenland and Denmark began on Wednesday, the Danish foreign ministry said, as the three parties seek to resolve a diplomatic crisis over President Donald Trump's threats against the Arctic territory.

The diplomatic talks come after months of tensions between Denmark and the United States, both founding NATO members.

Denmark's foreign ministry said in a written comment to Reuters that senior officials from Denmark, Greenland and the United States had met to "discuss how we can address American concerns about security in the Arctic while respecting the Kingdom's red lines."

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier on Wednesday said that the United States now has in place a process regarding Greenland and that there will be technical level meetings with officials from Greenland and Denmark on the issue.

"Flight NSE 8849, covering the Cucuta-Ocana route, which took off at around 11:42 a.m. and was scheduled to land at around 12:05 p.m., reported its last contact with air traffic control at 11:54 a.m. today," Satena said in a statement.

Newspaper El Tiempo reported that lawmaker Diogenes Quintero and Carlos Salcedo, a candidate to Congress ahead of elections in March, were aboard the aircraft.

Representatives for Quintero said in a statement that they had not had contact with the politician or his assistant, Natalia Acosta Salcedo, since the plane took off.

"We are praying for our friends right now," the statement said.

Colombia's Transportation Minister Mafe Rojas said protocols were put into place aimed at tracking down the plane.

The plane lost contact in a mountainous area planted with coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine, and where illegal armed groups such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) and a dissident faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) operate.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:30:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio details Trump administration's plan to control sale of Venezuelan oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260128-rubio-details-trump-administration-plan-to-control-sale-of-venezuelan-oil</link><description>The Trump administration soon will allow Venezuela to sell oil now subject to US sanctions, with the revenue initially dedicated to basic government services such as policing and health care and subject to Washington's oversight, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday.

The United States will retain control in the short term to ensure the oil revenue is used to stabilize Venezuela , Rubio said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. He noted that the interim leaders of the South American country will submit “a budget” every month of what they need funded.

“The funds from that (oil sales) will be deposited into an account that we will have oversight over,” Rubio said, adding that the US Treasury would control the process. Venezuela, he said, “will spend that money for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.”

Rubio offered new insight into how the US is planning to handle the sale of tens of millions of barrels of oil from Venezuela, which has the largest proven reserves of crude in the world, and oversee where the money flows. After the US raid that captured then-President Nicolas Maduro this month, the US is working to influence the next steps in the South American country through its vast oil resources.

The US will not subsidize oil industry investments in Venezuela, Rubio said, and is only overseeing the sale of sanctioned petroleum as an “interim step.”

“This is simply a way to divide revenue so that there isn’t systemic collapse while we work through this recovery and transition,” Rubio said.

Democrats and some Republicans on the committee pressed Rubio for more details about Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked for assurances from Rubio that the sale of Venezuelan oil will be fair and open, not rigged to benefit oil companies allied with Trump.

“You are taking their oil at gunpoint, you are holding and selling that oil … you’re deciding how and for what purposes that money is going to be used in a country of 30 million people,” Murphy said. “I think a lot of us believe that that is destined for failure.”

Under Maduro, Rubio said Venezuela's oil industry benefited the country's corrupt leaders and countries such as China, which purchased Venezuelan oil at a discount. Now, Venezuela's interim leaders are assisting the US in seizing illegal oil shipments, he said.

The US will give Venezuela's current leaders instructions on how the money can and cannot be spent and conduct audits to ensure it is used as intended, Rubio said. He said Venezuela could use the money to pay for policing or to buy medicine.

The fund was initially set up in Qatar to avoid having the proceeds seized by American creditors and because of other legal complications that stem from the US not considering Maduro’s government legitimate, Rubio said.

Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been set aside and as much as $3 billion more is anticipated, he said.

“It’s an account that belongs to Venezuela, but it has US sanctions as a blocking mechanism,” Rubio said. “We only control the dispersal of the money, we don’t control the actual money.”

Earlier this month, acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez said cash from oil sales would flow into two sovereign wealth funds: one to support crisis-stricken health services and a second to bolster public infrastructure, including the electric grid.

The country’s hospitals are so poorly equipped that patients are asked to provide supplies needed for their care, from syringes to surgical screws. They also must pay for lab and imaging tests at private hospitals.

On Tuesday, during a televised event to announce the revamping of various health care facilities, Rodriguez said her government and the US administration “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication” since Maduro was captured.

Neither Rodriguez nor her government’s press office immediately comment on Rubio’s remarks Wednesday.

At Rodriguez’s request, Venezuelan lawmakers last week began debating an overhaul of the country’s energy law. The proposed changes are meant to create conditions to attract much-needed private foreign investment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:56:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/223dac42-fc90-11f0-9d77-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028576651081.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US handing over seized tanker to Venezuela, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-handing-over-seized-tanker-venezuela-officials-say-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The United States is handing over a tanker to Venezuela that it seized this month, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday, the first known instance in which President Donald Trump's administration has returned such a tanker.

The United States has been carrying out a months-long effort to seize oil tankers linked to Venezuela - carrying out seven apprehensions since late last year.

The officials, who were speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the tanker that is being handed to Venezuelan authorities was the Panama-flagged supertanker M/T Sophia. They did not say why the tanker was returned.

The U.S. Coast Guard, which leads interdiction and seizure operations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Sophia was interdicted on January 7 by the Coast Guard and U.S. military forces. At the time, the administration said the Sophia, which is under sanctions, was a "stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker."

Trump has focused his foreign policy in Latin America on Venezuela, initially aiming to push Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power. After failing to find a diplomatic solution, Trump ordered U.S. forces to fly into the country to grab him and his wife in a daring overnight raid on January 3.

Since then, Trump has said the U.S. plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry in a $100 billion plan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 22:56:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNFG5IQXXRJ2HE2BCXK6NWYA54.jpg?auth=3efbdd55dc7e06047a8e334ee4b3a3f652b32a42fd944d8d360811fe53a78265&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE role at Winter Olympics in Italy to be advisory only, US ambassador says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260128-ice-winter-olympics-italy-advisory-us-ambassador</link><description>A branch of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sent to Italy for the Winter Olympics will not carry out patrols and will have only an "advisory" role, Washington's ambassador to Rome said on Wednesday.

News of its deployment for the February 6-22 Games in Milan-Cortina has sparked anger in Italy, after the agency's involvement in an often brutal crackdown on immigration in the United States.

But US ambassador to Italy Tilman J. Fertitta said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit will be "strictly advisory and intelligence-based, with no patrolling or enforcement involvement".

"At the Olympics, HSI criminal investigators will contribute their expertise by providing intelligence on transnational criminal threats, with a focus on cybercrimes and national security threats.

"All security operations will remain the responsibility of Italian authorities, " he said after meeting Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi.

ICE operations in a number of US cities have triggered large-scale protests, and the recent killings of two demonstrators have caused outrage.

Agents accused of violence there are from a different division than that earmarked for the Olympics.

Fertitta said the HSI focuses on "cross-border criminal activity, ranging from investigating human smuggling, narcotics trafficking, child exploitation, financial crimes, intellectual property right theft, to recovering stolen art and antiquities".

The Italian authorities initially denied speculation that ICE would be present at the Games, then played down their role, suggesting that they would only be helping with security for the US delegation.

US Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected at the opening ceremony at Milan's San Siro stadium on February 6.

Italy's political opposition has asked the government to refuse the deployment, and protests are expected in the coming days in Rome and Milan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 22:57:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ad4268f2-fba3-11f0-8975-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-26T142529Z-798936652-UP1EM1Q0VXAL9-RTRMADP-3-OLYMPICS-2026-PREVIEW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US says Brooklyn man sentenced to 15 years in Iran-backed plot to kill dissident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-says-brooklyn-man-sentenced-15-years-iran-backed-plot-kill-dissident-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A Brooklyn man was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Wednesday for taking part in what prosecutors called a failed Iran-backed murder-for-hire plot against Masih Alinejad , a prominent Iranian dissident living in the U.S., the Justice Department said.

Carlisle Rivera, also known as "Pop," previously pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire and one count of conspiracy to commit stalking before U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman for the Southern District of New York, who imposed Wednesday's sentence, the Justice Department said in a statement.

Alinejad, who fled Iran in 2009, is a longtime critic of Iran's head-covering laws and a journalist. She has promoted videos of women violating those laws to her millions of social media followers. She was living in Brooklyn at the time of the alleged plot on her life.

The case was part of a crackdown by the Justice Department on what it calls transnational repression: the targeting by authoritarian governments of political opponents on foreign soil.

Prosecutors said Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard Corps and its intelligence officials have repeatedly tried to target Alinejad.

Iran has dismissed as baseless allegations that its intelligence officers sought to kidnap or kill her.

Other people have also been convicted in the U.S. and sentenced in relation to the alleged plot.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 23:28:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/A7WECWVOX5ODHMTVFT3EH2BC3Y.jpg?auth=43df1a9f8e337e808e6e8232868f6c5ff7ff3dbb9178c7a1d6984df28b4f2165&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi's party seen gaining lower house majority in election, Nikkei poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichis-party-seen-gaining-lower-house-majority-election-nikkei-poll-2026-01-28/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party is likely to increase seats and gain a majority in the lower house in a general election on February 8, a preliminary survey by the Nikkei newspaper showed on Thursday.

Takaichi called the snap general election to seek a mandate to gear up her expansionary fiscal policy, a move that triggered a spike in bond yields on market concerns Japan may be forced to issue additional debt.

While still early in the race, the LDP is gaining momentum and likely to see its seats exceed the 233 majority of 465 up for grabs in the lower house, up from 198 seats it holds before the election, the Nikkei said.

The LDP currently forms a ruling coalition with the Japan Innovation Party, or Ishin, which together narrowly hold a majority in the powerful lower house. It is a minority in the upper house.

The survey combined the paper's reporting and findings of a poll conducted jointly with the Yomiuri newspaper on January 27-28, the Nikkei said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 23:28:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D7F3RDTWPRPOJOGKHFJFWOTWFU.jpg?auth=8f03e0cd57e0235d448122638e7c8e9d0da567802f6b0cb407ff4ae42926f881&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French lawmakers approve bill to end ‘marital duty’ after consent concerns</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260128-french-lawmakers-bill-end-marital-duty</link><description>French lawmakers on Wednesday unanimously approved a bill seeking to end "marital duty", after criticism from women's rights groups about its use to ignore sexual consent in marriage and marital rape.

The text -- backed by more than 120 MPs in the lower house National Assembly -- clarifies in the civil code that cohabitation does not create any obligation for spouses to have sexual relations.

The cross-party bill will now have to go through the Senate upper chamber.

The French civil code lists four duties attached to marriage -- fidelity, support, assistance and cohabitation -- but it does not mention sexual obligation.

However, older court rulings sometimes interpreted cohabitation as implying a "shared bed", allowing the idea of a "marital duty" to persist in practice.

In 2019, a man obtained a divorce in France on the grounds that his wife had stopped having sex with him.

Last year, Europe's top rights court ruled in favour of his ex-wife, saying a woman who refuses to have sex with her husband should not be considered "at fault" by courts in the event of divorce.

France last year adopted the principle of consent into the definition of the crime of rape, following other European countries like the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 23:30:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/efd20604-f61d-11f0-ba0a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T161325Z-1705529737-RC245JA65JXM-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: Trump weighs Iran strikes to inspire renewed protests, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-weighs-iran-strikes-inspire-renewed-protests-sources-say-2026-01-29/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, multiple sources said, even as Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.

Two U.S. sources familiar with the discussions said Trump wanted to create conditions for "regime change" after a crackdown crushed a nationwide protest movement earlier this month, killing thousands of people .

To do so, he was looking at options to hit commanders and institutions Washington holds responsible for the violence, to give protesters the confidence that they could overrun government and security buildings, they said.

One of the U.S. sources said the options being discussed by Trump's aides also included a much larger strike intended to have lasting impact, possibly against the ballistic missiles that can reach U.S. allies in the Middle East or its nuclear enrichment programmes.

The other U.S. source said Trump has not yet made a final decision on a course of action including whether to take the military path.

The arrival of a U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships in the Middle East this week has expanded Trump's capabilities to potentially take military action, after he repeatedly threatened intervention over Iran's crackdown.

Four Arab officials, three Western diplomats and a senior Western source whose governments were briefed on the discussions said they were concerned that instead of bringing people onto the streets, such strikes could weaken a movement already in shock after the bloodiest repression by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Alex Vatanka, director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute, said that without large-scale military defections Iran's protests remained “heroic but outgunned.”

The sources in this story requested anonymity to talk about sensitive matters. Iran's foreign office, the U.S. Department of Defense and the White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Israeli Prime Minister's office declined to comment.

Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons, warning that any future U.S. attack would be more severe than a June bombing campaign against three nuclear sites. He described the ships in the region as an "armada" sailing to Iran.

A senior Iranian official told Reuters that Iran was "preparing itself for a military confrontation, while at the same time making use of diplomatic channels." However, Washington was not showing openness to diplomacy, the official said.

Iran, which says its nuclear program is civilian, was ready for dialogue "based on mutual respect and interests" but would defend itself "like never before" if pushed, Iran's mission to the United Nations said in a post on X on Wednesday.

Trump has not publicly detailed what he is looking for in any deal. His administration's previous negotiating points have included banning Iran from independently enriching uranium and restrictions on long-range ballistic missiles and on Tehran's network of armed proxies in the Middle East.

A senior Israeli official with direct knowledge of planning between Israel and the United States told Reuters Israel does not believe airstrikes alone can topple the Islamic Republic, if that is Washington's goal.

“If you're going to topple the regime, you have to put boots on the ground,” he said, noting that even if the United States killed Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran would "have a new leader that will replace him."

Only a combination of external pressure and an organised domestic opposition could shift Iran’s political trajectory, the official said.

The Israeli official said Iran’s leadership had been weakened by the unrest but remained firmly in control despite the ongoing deep economic crisis that sparked the protests.

Multiple U.S. intelligence reports reached a similar conclusion, that the conditions that led to the protests were still in place, weakening the government, but without major fractures, two people familiar with the matter said.

The Western source said they believed Trump's goal appeared to be to engineer a change in leadership, rather than "topple the regime," an outcome that would be similar to Venezuela, where U.S. intervention replaced the president without a wholesale change of government.

Khamenei has publicly acknowledged several thousand deaths during the protests. He blamed the unrest on the United States, Israel and what he called “seditionists.”

U.S.-based rights group HRANA has put the unrest-related death toll at 5,937, including 214 security personnel, while official figures put the death toll at 3,117. Reuters has been unable to independently verify the numbers.

At 86, Khamenei has retreated from daily governance, reduced public appearances and is believed to be residing in secure locations after Israeli strikes last year decimated many of Iran’s senior military leaders, regional officials said.

Day-to-day management has shifted to figures aligned with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), including senior adviser Ali Larijani, they said. The powerful Guards dominate Iran's security network and big parts of the economy.

However, Khamenei retains final authority over war, succession and nuclear strategy - meaning political change is very difficult until he exits the scene, they said. Iran's foreign ministry did not respond to questions about Khamenei.

In Washington and Jerusalem, some officials have argued that a transition in Iran could break the nuclear deadlock and eventually open the door to more cooperative ties with the West, two of the Western diplomats said.

But, they cautioned, there is no clear successor to Khamenei. In that vacuum, the Arab officials and diplomats said they believe the IRGC could take over, entrenching hard-line rule, deepening the nuclear standoff and regional tensions.

Any successor seen as emerging under foreign pressure would be rejected and could strengthen, not weaken the IRGC, the official said.

Across the region, from the Gulf to Turkey, officials say they favour containment over collapse - not out of sympathy for Tehran, but out of fear that turmoil inside a nation of 90 million, riven by sectarian and ethnic fault lines, could unleash instability far beyond Iran's borders.

A fractured Iran could spiral into civil war as happened after the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, two of the Western diplomats warned, unleashing an influx of refugees, fueling Islamist militancy and disrupting oil flows through the Strait of Hormuz, a global energy chokepoint.

The gravest risk, analyst Vatanka warned, is fragmentation into “early-stage Syria,” with rival units and provinces fighting for territory and resources.

Gulf states - long‑time U.S. allies and hosts to major American bases- fear they would be the first targets for Iranian retaliation that could include Iranian missiles or drone attacks from the Tehran-aligned Houthis in Yemen.

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt have lobbied Washington against a strike on Iran. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has told Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian that Riyadh will not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran.

“The United States may pull the trigger,” one of the Arab sources said, “but it will not live with the consequences. We will.”

Mohannad Hajj-Ali of the Carnegie Middle East Center said the U.S. deployments suggest planning has shifted from a single strike to something more sustained, driven by a belief in Washington and Jerusalem that Iran could rebuild its missile capabilities and eventually weaponise its enriched uranium.

The most likely outcome is a "grinding erosion - elite defections, economic paralysis, contested succession - that frays the system until it snaps,” analyst Vatanka said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 02:02:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WASHNY53ERPTHDEC2S3V2XHLNA.jpg?auth=a5d588496ea8d938b9a9bdbf0f1c786c0f42fcccfdbc7072e5daac2b32e28e62&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Starmer to meet China's Xi in bid to reset strained ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-starmer-meet-chinas-xi-bid-reset-strained-ties-2026-01-29/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer will meet Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday for talks he hopes will deepen their economic relationship, signalling a breakthrough in ties after years of distrust and acrimony.

On the most important day of his four-day visit to China, Starmer is due to have a 40-minute meeting with Xi at the Great Hall of the People before they have lunch together. Starmer will also hold meetings on Thursday with Premier Li Qiang and China's top legislator, Zhao Leji.

Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, has made improving relations with China one of his priorities in the hope it can yield business opportunities.

The visit to China, the first by a British prime minister since 2018, comes amid tension between Britain and its longstanding close ally the United States over President Donald Trump's recent remarks, including threats to take control of Greenland.

Kerry Brown, professor of Chinese studies at King's College London, said he expected that a number of deals between Britain and China would be announced to show how their relationship has improved.

"This must look like it’s been a success,” he said. “For both sides, they don’t want a meeting which is going to be arguing about things they disagree on."

European and other Western countries have engaged in a flurry of diplomacy with China as they hedge against unpredictability from the United States under Trump.

Starmer's visit immediately follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who signed an economic deal with Beijing to tear down trade barriers, drawing Trump's ire .

Starmer has adopted a new policy of engagement with China after relations deteriorated for years under previous Conservative governments when London restricted some Chinese investment over national security worries and expressed concern over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong.

Speaking to a delegation of business leaders hours after arriving in the country on Wednesday, Starmer said it was time for a “mature” relationship between Britain and the world’s second-biggest economy.

In a sign of how the countries can work together, Downing Street said Starmer and Xi would announce that Britain and China would work together to tackle the gangs involved in trafficking illegal migrants.

The deal will be focused on reducing the use of Chinese-made engines for small boats being used to transport people across Europe to claim asylum.

British and Chinese officials will share intelligence to identify smugglers’ supply routes and work with Chinese manufacturers to prevent legitimate businesses from being exploited by organised crime, Downing Street.

Starmer told reporters on the plane to China that he will “raise the issues that need to be raised” on human rights with Xi when asked if he will bring up the case of Jimmy Lai, the former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen who was convicted in December of national security crimes.

But the presence of more than 50 business leaders accompanying Starmer and his itinerary shows the priority for this trip is economic ties.

"Everything you're doing here, everything I'm doing here is focused on how do we benefit people at home," he told the business leaders on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 02:02:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P7SM7B2H5ZNMTCW457SB47UX6I.jpg?auth=0cf3740a8844f34c14c71d393e60097727748c7a98ccf486e07290c171bfb407&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sustained gunfire, loud blasts heard in Niger's capital</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sustained-gunfire-loud-blasts-heard-nigers-capital-2026-01-29/</link><description>NIAMEY, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Sustained gunfire and loud blasts were heard early on Thursday near Niamey International Airport in Niger, according to a Reuters witness.

The US has held significant sway over Iraqi politics since leading the 2003 invasion that ousted long-time ruler Saddam Hussein.

"We categorically reject the blatant American interference in Iraq's internal affairs," said Maliki, the only former Iraqi prime minister to have served two terms since the invasion.

"We consider it a violation" of Iraq's "democratic system", in place since 2003, he added on X.

In response to Trump's threat, several hundred people protested in the evening near the US embassy in Baghdad, chanting "Yes for Maliki", while some burned a poster bearing the image of Trump and an American flag, an AFP journalist said.

Maliki fell out with Washington during his premiership (2006-2014) over growing ties with Iran and accusations that he pushed a sectarian agenda.

But the 75-year-old shrewd politician has remained a central figure in Iraq's politics and a powerbroker whose approval is considered indispensable to any governing coalition.

On Tuesday, Trump said that Iraq would make a "very bad choice" if Maliki were selected for the top post.

He warned that because of Maliki's "insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq".

Maliki was endorsed as Iraq's next prime minister by the Coordination Framework, an alliance of Shiite groups with varying links to Iran that has emerged in recent years as the main ruling coalition.

Since the invasion, Iraq has long been a proxy battleground between the US and Iran, with successive governments negotiating a delicate balance between the two foes.

But Iraq's new prime minister is set to return to power at a time of seismic changes in the Middle East, as Tehran's regional influence wanes and as Washington threatens possible military intervention in Iran.

In his post on Wednesday, Maliki said the US involvement "infringes upon the Coordination Framework's decision to nominate" its candidate.

He added that, in line with that decision, he "will continue to work until the end, in a way that achieves the higher interests of the Iraqi people".

Several Iraqi political sources told AFP that the coalition is set to meet soon to discuss Trump's ultimatum.

It is "a complicated situation", said a source close to the Framework, adding that there had been internal divisions within the coalition over supporting Maliki, but that a majority vote ultimately settled the issue.

Maliki's backers are now pushing to maintain his candidacy and "not back down", he added.

Trump's statement came days after Secretary of State Marco Rubio voiced similar concerns in a telephone call with outgoing Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani.

Sudani's parliamentary bloc said on Wednesday that choosing a prime minister is an "Iraqi affair", while stressing the need "for positive, balanced relations with friendly and allied countries, especially the United States, based on mutual respect".

The US had also sent a letter to Iraqi politicians saying that Washington views Maliki negatively, political sources told AFP.

Iraq's new premier will be expected to address Washington's longstanding demand that Baghdad disarm Tehran-backed factions, many of which are designated terrorist groups by the United States.

Two US-sanctioned armed groups that are part of the Coordination Framework on Wednesday slammed Trump's meddling in Iraq's affairs.

"We reject all attempts to interfere in our country's internal affairs or influence the peaceful transfer of power, and we refuse any external dictates," said the Asaib Ahl al-Haq faction, while Kataeb Sayyid al-Shuhada also expressed its rejection of Trump's remarks.

Last month, Iraqi officials and diplomats told AFP that Washington demanded that the incoming government exclude Iran-backed armed groups.

Before Trump's call, an Iraqi political source said that the Coordination Framework was set on moving forward with the nomination, believing that Maliki could eventually allay Washington's concerns.

Maliki "thinks differently today", an Iraqi politician told AFP.

After decades of conflicts and chaos, Iraq has recently regained a sense of stability.

But it is struggling with weak economic growth and cannot risk punitive measures by the US, which has already sanctioned several Iraqi entities, accusing them of helping Tehran evade sanctions.

Political scientist Renad Mansour warned that the US might use its leverage over Iraq.

"Sanctions, access to US dollars... and of course, the military threat is there," he said, referring to strikes against pro-Iran groups.

"Iraq is now in a very precarious moment... and there's a lot of concerns over the relatively newfound stability."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 02:03:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8fca78d2-fc75-11f0-891d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/f9998926394aac9470c641bc334f7e41af948d4c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: ICE officers in Minnesota directed not to interact with 'agitators' in new orders</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ice-officers-minnesota-directed-not-interact-with-agitators-new-orders-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - ICE officers in Minnesota were directed on Wednesday to avoid engaging with "agitators" as they carry out President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, according to internal guidance reviewed by Reuters.

The new guidance, offering the most detailed look so far at how operations would change after two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens protesting in Minneapolis, also orders U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers only to target immigrants who have criminal charges or convictions.

That would mark a departure from the broad sweeps that have provoked backlash and legal challenges in Minneapolis and other U.S. cities.

"DO NOT COMMUNICATE OR ENGAGE WITH AGITATORS," said an email disseminated by a top ICE official. "It serves no purpose other than inflaming the situation. No one is going to convince the other. The only communication should be the officers issuing commands."

In response to a request to the White House for comment, an administration official said, "There are ongoing conversations on how to most effectively conduct operations in Minnesota. No guidance should be considered final until it is officially issued."

The operational shift comes after Trump said this week that he aimed to “de-escalate” tension in Minneapolis and St. Paul after federal immigration officers killed two U.S. citizens there this month. In both cases, Trump officials swiftly portrayed the deceased as aggressors, an assertion undercut by video evidence .

Trump tasked border czar Tom Homan to take over operations in Minnesota, in what a senior official told Reuters would be a shift to a more “targeted” approach to enforcement. Border Patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino - who led confrontational sweeps in Los Angeles, Chicago and other cities - was demoted and will soon retire, Reuters reported.

Under the new guidance outlined in the email, ICE officers will receive megaphones so that they can issue commands to the public and "need to verbalize every step of the arrest process."

The guidance does not describe what sort of actions would trigger commands or what officers should do if commands were not followed.

The updated guidance came from Marcos Charles, the top official in ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations division, the email said. It said officers could only target immigration offenders who had a previous criminal history.

"We are moving to targeted enforcement of aliens with a criminal history," it read. "This includes arrests, not just convictions. ALL TARGETS MUST HAVE A CRIMINAL NEXUS."

Under former President Joe Biden, ICE officers were required to focus on serious criminals, but the Trump administration rescinded that policy, allowing officers to arrest non-criminals without restrictions.

ICE officers can run license plate checks for possible targets and should make an arrest if the registered owner of the vehicle is an immigrant with a criminal history, the guidance said.

ICE will run the Minnesota operation with Border Patrol in a support role, it said, a reversal after months of Bovino-led clashes in city streets.

The guidance states that ICE has been getting more cooperation from state and local officials in Minnesota, and that the agency could have more opportunities to pick up immigrants released on parole or probation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 04:18:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RZ3UIPONTJJP7PSQ5WGU2PLJTQ.jpg?auth=861b205979304565a97e5663fb86652b74460767231cb53d5205845533af190c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea industry minister to visit Washington on Thursday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-industry-minister-visit-washington-thursday-2026-01-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 29 (Reuters) - South Korea's Industry Minister Kim Jung-kwan will visit Washington on Thursday to discuss U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of plans to raise tariffs on South Korean goods, the ministry said.

Kim is also scheduled to meet the U.S. Secretaries of Commerce and Energy, according to a ministry press release.

Trump in a social media post on Monday said he would hike tariffs from 15% to 25% because Seoul had not enacted legislation linked to last year's trade deal, prompting alarm in Seoul.

On Tuesday he signaled a softer tone, telling reporters, "we'll work something out with South Korea," without offering details.

Trump's trade negotiator Jamieson Greer said the U.S. lowered tariffs to 15% last year in exchange for South Korea's pledge to invest $350 billion in the U.S. and expand market access, but that Seoul had yet to pass the required bills.

South Korean lawmakers expressed hope the bills would be approved in February, when they are expected to hold a plenary parliamentary session. Officials also stressed they have reached out to the U.S. through multiple channels to prevent further escalation.

Trade Minister Yeo Han-koo is also expected to visit Washington for talks with Greer.

The foreign ministers' retreat of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations aims to set the bloc's agenda for the year under the chairmanship of the Philippines.

Philippine Foreign Minister Ma. Theresa Lazaro told her ASEAN counterparts that the global security environment has become more "challenging" and "more complex and interconnected".

She vowed that Manila would continue to uphold the international rules-based order, and maintain ASEAN's adherence to the principles of restraint, dialogue and international law.

"Across our region, we continue to see tensions at sea, protracted internal conflicts and unresolved border and humanitarian concerns," Lazaro said in her opening remarks.

"Our meeting today allows us to collectively take stock of ASEAN's priorities and exchange views on regional and global developments that directly affect us," she added.

The Philippines recently hosted a dialogue among opponents of Myanmar's ruling junta in a bid to facilitate dialogue and humanitarian aid.

A 2021 coup in Myanmar triggered widespread protests that were brutally suppressed by the junta, unleashing a civil war involving a loose alliance of rebel groups.

Manila is also aiming this year to finish a long-delayed code of conduct for the South China Sea, where tensions have escalated over the past three years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 04:20:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OEUFQO4TERO5RNFQ7H2IQIWEJA.jpg?auth=274df6b1c4bf9d9da2e852dba91f5d0775687cdbfdb5dfe05ffeaae0ed57204d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protesters rally at Texas facility holding Minneapolis child in immigration clampdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260129-protesters-texas-minneapolis-child-immigration</link><description>Texas state police officers on Wednesday used tear gas to disperse a demonstration outside a US immigration detention facility where protesters demanded the release of a 5-year-old Ecuadoran boy among others swept up in the Trump administration's immigration clampdown.

About 100 protesters gathered at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley on Wednesday, carrying signs accusing the federal agents of terrorising communities.

"We want Kristi Noem impeached. We want the US Senate to defund ICE, to not give it any more money. And we need people to pay attention to the midterm elections this year," local elected official Christina Morales told AFP.

Texas state law enforcement responded to the protest in riot gear, deploying tear gas cannisters, including one that landed near two AFP journalists, striking and temporarily incapacitating one of them.

Earlier, Democratic congressmembers Joaquin Castro and Jasmine Crockett conducted an inspection to visit the child, Liam Conejo Ramos, and 1,100 others detained there.

"His dad said that he hasn't been himself, and he's been sleeping a lot because he's been depressed and sad," Castro said in a video message posted to X, in which the congressman insists Ramos and his family were "legally in the United States."

National outcry followed images of the apparently terrified preschooler, dressed in a fluffy blue bunny hat and wearing his school backpack, being held by immigration officers who were seeking to arrest the boy's father in Minneapolis.

The child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias -- both asylum seekers -- were taken from their driveway as they arrived home on January 20, after the child was used as "bait" by officers to draw out those inside his home, according to the superintendent of the boy's school, Zena Stenvik.

A federal judge temporarily blocked their deportation Tuesday.

Castro also demanded the release of everyone else being held at the privately-run facility, saying "there are no criminals in Dilley. Donald Trump said this was about arresting illegal criminal 'aliens' -- that's his language. There isn't a single criminal over there."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 04:20:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fc4f0e8c-fcc5-11f0-a6ce-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028775823569.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan braces for more heavy snowstorms as midwinter election nears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/japan-braces-more-heavy-snowstorms-midwinter-election-nears-2026-01-29/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Northern and western parts of Japan face more heavy snowstorms later this week, the weather agency said on Thursday, as lawmakers campaign in the first winter election in 36 years, with the risk of lower voter turnout due to the freezing weather.

Heavy snowfalls of up to 70 centimetres (27.56 inches) in the Hokuriku region of northwestern Japan and 60 centimetres (23.6 inches) in south-central Kinki, particularly along the Sea of Japan, is forecast through Friday, the Meteorological Agency said.

The agency urged caution due to potential traffic disruptions and the risk of avalanches.

Heavy snowfall last week brought northern Japan’s Hokkaido to a standstill, leaving thousands stranded at its main airport overnight after several dozen flights were grounded.

Japan is set to host the lower house election on February 8, and heavy snowfalls blanketing northern Japan could depress voter turnout and disrupt campaigning, particularly in rural areas, adding another layer of uncertainty to the snap election.

Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party is likely to increase its number of parliamentary seats and gain a majority in the lower house, a preliminary survey by the Nikkei newspaper showed on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:30:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YOMWJADS4JPNHGY3FIBEHA2AVQ.jpg?auth=679a72a5ca7583a8d08690628d8b41574c16ede20c1c9046adc674ae5439f961&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam hails upgrade of diplomatic ties with EU as 'historical milestone'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-hails-upgrade-diplomatic-ties-with-eu-historical-milestone-2026-01-29/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Vietnam and the European Union said on Thursday they elevated diplomatic relations, as both sides seek to expand international partnerships amid global disruptions.

The largely diplomatic move entails no binding commitments but carries political weight at a time when the EU and Vietnam are seeking to deepen international ties as they both face up to higher levies on their exports to the United States.

The upgrade is "a historical milestone underlining the great achievements that the two sides have made," Vietnam's President Luong Cuong said at the start of a meeting in Hanoi with European Council President Antonio Costa.

A free trade agreement between Vietnam and the 27-country EU entered into force in 2020.

Costa, who arrived in Hanoi after the EU struck a major trade deal with India on Tuesday, said the upgraded partnership "highlights the importance we attach to the region and to Vietnam's growing role".

"At a moment when the international rules-based order is under threat from multiple sides, we need to start to stand side by side as reliable and predictable partners," Costa added.

The elevation of ties to Vietnam's highest level, the same as the United States, China and Russia, usually involves more frequent high-level meetings.

It is also expected to generate a stronger partnership, according to a joint statement adopted on Thursday, which says the two sides will explore and deepen cooperation in multiple sectors, including defence, critical minerals, semiconductors, transport and "trusted communications infrastructure", confirming a Reuters report on Wednesday.

Costa acknowledged different views with Vietnam, a long-time Russian partner, over the war in Ukraine and human rights.

But he added that the two countries agree on their support of multilateralism and "the principles of independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 05:30:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DJGCOK5VEZIAZMFHAI4XRER4RM.jpg?auth=7e22d64453d8fd7d5d90c34444019c1b12a37ee955816b08bf9ce5c84d745bb6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China executes 11 criminals linked to Myanmar-based gangs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-executes-11-criminals-linked-myanmar-based-gangs-2026-01-29/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China executed 11 criminals from gangs based in northern Myanmar that included key members of telecom fraud groups, state news agency Xinhua said on Thursday.

The 11 were sentenced to death in September and the executions were carried out by a court in Wenzhou in the eastern province of Zhejiang, Xinhua said without giving more details about the criminals.

In recent years, China has stepped up collaboration with Southeast Asian neighbours Thailand, Myanmar and Cambodia to crack down on rampant "scam centre" operations in the region.

As a result, tens of thousands of criminal suspects have been repatriated, transnational organised crime experts say.

Last year, China's Public Security Ministry said more than 7,600 Chinese nationals suspected of online gambling and telecom fraud were repatriated from Myawaddy, a town on the southeastern Myanmar border with Thailand.

Earlier this month, Cambodia extradited to China tycoon Chen Zhi, who the U.S. says chairs a conglomerate that is a front for a multi-billion-dollar cyber scam network.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 06:08:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China vows to develop space tourism, explore deep space as it races US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/science/china-vows-develop-space-tourism-explore-deep-space-it-races-us-2026-01-29/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's main space contractor vowed to develop space tourism in the next five years, state media reported on Thursday, as Beijing revs up its commercial spaceflight and deep space exploration ambitions amid a technology race with the U.S.

State-owned China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) said it would "achieve the flight operation of suborbital space tourism and gradually develop orbital space tourism," as well as "build a gigawatt-level space digital intelligence infrastructure", state broadcaster CCTV reported.

China and the U.S. are competing as they look to turn space exploration into a commercially viable business similar to civil aviation, as well as becoming the first to exploit the military and strategic advantages of space dominance. CASC has vowed to transform China into a "world-leading space power" by 2045.

Beijing's key bottleneck so far is its failure to complete a reusable rocket test. U.S. rival SpaceX's Falcon 9 reusable rocket has allowed its subsidiary Starlink to achieve a near-monopoly on low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and it is also used for orbital space tourism.

Reusability is crucial to lowering the costs of rocket launches and making it cheaper to send satellites into space. China achieved a record 93 space launches last year, according to official announcements, buoyed by its rapidly maturing commercial spaceflight startups.

However, China has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on LEO satellites as a national security risk and is launching its own satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the next decades.

In late December, Chinese entities submitted filings with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) laying out plans to put about 200,000 satellites in orbit over the next 14 years. Two mega-constellations account for the vast majority, and the move would strategically reserve suborbital slots and frequencies for Beijing.

CASC's plans were announced after China inaugurated its first School of Interstellar Navigation housed in the Chinese Academy of Sciences on Tuesday, aiming to foster the next generation of space talent in frontier fields including interstellar propulsion and deep space navigation.

The new institution signals China's ambitions to strategically transition from near-Earth orbit operations to deep space exploration, and will support China's planned lunar research station and efforts in detecting planets outside our solar system, according to a Xinhua report on the inauguration.

"The next 10 to 20 years will be a window for leapfrog development in China's interstellar navigation field. Original innovation in basic research and technological breakthroughs will reshape the pattern of deep space exploration," Xinhua wrote.

Thursday's CCTV report said CASC would also focus on breakthroughs in key technologies such as small celestial resource exploration and intelligent independent mining and step up monitoring of space debris and the formulation of international space traffic management rules.

China's Chang'e-6 lunar probe was the first spacecraft to bring back samples from the far side of the moon in 2024, and Beijing is actively setting international standards for spaceflight and space infrastructure to establish itself as a dominant space power.

The U.S. faces intense competition this decade from China in its effort to return astronauts to the moon, where no humans have gone since the final U.S. Apollo mission in 1972.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 06:08:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YKWHYCQTD5J5LMBIMMJ7FWVSMQ.jpg?auth=53e3d2ab73cf00dd50635d5ef03c8ae3c5ab5d3dd67b1118aa59f743dc527daf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: New malaria vaccines helped Ghana slash child deaths. Then Trump, others cut aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/new-malaria-vaccines-helped-ghana-slash-child-deaths-then-trump-others-cut-aid-2026-01-29/</link><description>LONDON/ACCRA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - New vaccines are helping Ghana approach a long-sought goal of ending child deaths from malaria, demonstrating the potential of the shots to drive back a disease that kills nearly half a million young children every year in Africa, according to the international vaccine aid group Gavi and the country’s health service.

But aid cutbacks by the Trump administration and other wealthy governments could mean fewer children benefit on the continent where malaria hits hardest, Gavi told Reuters.

Ghana is among the countries that had already made significant progress reducing malaria mortality by scaling up interventions such as the distribution of bed nets treated with insecticides and improving access to both preventive drugs and prompt treatment.

Two new vaccines - one developed by British drugmaker GSK (GSK.L) , the other by Oxford University and the Serum Institute of India - are helping close the remaining gap, said Dr Selorm Kutsoati, who heads Ghana’s immunisation programme.

“For me, the malaria vaccine is a gamechanger,” she told Reuters.

Gavi is currently the only organisation purchasing malaria shots for African nations. It anticipates it will be able to spend just over $800 million on the programme over the next five years - 28% less than the expected need - after falling $2.9 billion short of its overall funding goal for the period, according to internal estimates prepared for its board of directors in December, seen by Reuters.

An additional 19,000 lives could be lost as a result due to lower vaccination rates, the documents say. The estimate, which has not previously been reported, is based on modelling of the vaccines’ impact by researchers at Imperial College London and the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.

“It is the gap between the promise and the need for the vaccine, and the resources we have to provide that,” Scott Gordon, who heads Gavi’s malaria program, told Reuters.

U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy announced in June that Washington would no longer support Gavi , part of sweeping cuts to foreign aid that President Donald Trump says do not align with his “America First” agenda. The United States was previously one of the group’s top donors, contributing some $1.3 billion between 2020 and 2024.

The U.S. "remains committed to working with global partners to combat malaria," a Department of Health and Human Services official told Reuters.

But the Trump administration will not disburse funds to Gavi unless it starts phasing out vaccines containing the mercury-based preservative thimerosal from its portfolio, the official said. Anti-vaccine groups have linked thimerosal to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, despite multiple studies showing no related safety issues .

Gavi confirmed the request and said the group remained in contact with the U.S. government on the subject. Any decision related to its portfolio would be "guided by scientific consensus," it said.

Other donors have also been scaling back support. Britain, Gavi’s biggest donor, has pledged 1.25 billion pounds ($1.72 billion) over the next five years, more than 20% less than for 2020-25.

Britain's international development minister, Jenny Chapman, said the country remains committed to supporting Gavi's work because it saves lives.

A MOTHER DECIDES: ‘I HAVE TO GO FOR THE VACCINE’

Some major global organisations initially doubted the potential of the two vaccines now being rolled out in 24 African countries with help from Gavi.

Based on clinical trials, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimates they reduce malaria cases by over 50% during the first year after three shots are administered, an efficacy rate lower than many commonly used childhood shots. A fourth dose is required before a child turns 2 to maintain protection.

Supporters of the vaccines point to the success in Ghana, saying even a partially effective shot has translated into many lives saved.

“In real-world settings, we're seeing significant impact," Gavi’s Gordon said.

Confirmed deaths among children under the age of 5 have dropped nearly 86% in Ghana, from 245 in 2018, the year before GSK’s vaccine was introduced in select districts, to 35 in 2024, according to government figures. A decade ago, nearly 1,000 children in that age group died each year, Kutsoati said.

Malaria infections have also declined, from roughly 6.7 million in 2018 to 5.3 million in 2024, around a fifth of which were among children under 5, Ghana’s figures show.

The actual numbers are likely to be higher, as many malaria cases do not get diagnosed, and deaths that occur at home often go unreported, said Dorothy Achu, the WHO’s team lead for malaria in Africa. There can also be inconsistent reporting by some health facilities.

But Achu agreed the combination of strategies used in Ghana resulted in a “significant reduction in malaria deaths”, adding the WHO is using the country’s figures to update its estimates.

Esther Kolan, a 31-year-old clothing trader, did not need much persuading to get her 1-year-old son Phenehas Gyngyi Jr. vaccinated last summer at the Mother and Child Hospital in the southern town of Kasoa.

Her brother died of malaria just before his 15th birthday. A daughter was hospitalised twice with the disease before she turned 3.

“I told myself, no matter the condition, I have to go for the vaccine,” Kolan said, adding her family also sleeps under bed nets.

Phenehas has had three doses and has never been hospitalised with malaria.

“This has really helped me a lot,” said Kolan, who plans to get him a booster shot soon. “I was not scared for my child.”

Malaria deaths were already declining in their district when vaccines became available in 2023, according to Stanley Yaidoo, the municipal health services director. But the number of cases still put pressure on hospitals, exhausting staff and taking up beds that could be used to treat other dangerous diseases, he told Reuters.

“The vaccine implementation was the master stroke that we needed to support the already existing interventions,” Yaidoo said.

Some regions managed to eliminate malaria without a vaccine, but countries in sub-Saharan Africa face particular challenges, disease experts say.

Many are among the world’s poorest, with poorly-resourced health systems. The prevailing strain is particularly deadly, and there is growing resistance to preventive and curative drugs. Control efforts have been disrupted by conflicts and natural disasters.

The first countries to use the vaccines - Kenya, Malawi and Ghana - were part of a WHO-led pilot programme that began in 2019 with GSK’s shot. The WHO approved this vaccine for wider use in 2021, but the rollout faced hurdles, including a vast supply shortfall .

Access improved when WHO recommended the Oxford shot in 2023.

In many countries, it is too early to assess the vaccines' impact. But there are anecdotal reports of reductions in cases, hospitalisations and deaths among young children, according to the Gavi documents and interviews with health officials in four countries.

Take-up of the vaccines has varied, the documents show. In the first six months of 2025, coverage rates across 11 countries for three doses ranged from over 70% in Ghana and Burkina Faso, to 45% in Liberia and 35% in conflict-hit South Sudan.

Introducing a new vaccine that requires multiple doses has presented logistical challenges, especially in rural areas where transportation and storage options are limited.

In Ghana, there was also resistance from a number of traditional and religious leaders, and politicians skeptical about the benefits, Yaidoo told Reuters.

But results talk, he said.

“Those who have had the vaccination, they give their testimonies on how their children are protected from severe malaria. So many of them are actually our ambassadors."

Cases of severe malaria among vaccinated children were 58% lower than among unvaccinated children in the year after they received the third dose across the countries that participated in the pilot, a study published in The Lancet medical journal in January found.

Health officials in Kenya and Malawi did not respond to Reuters’ questions about their vaccination programmes.

At least four more countries plan to introduce malaria vaccines before 2028, Gavi said.

Until this year, Gavi could subsidise 85% of the assessed need for shots in areas of medium and high malaria transmission, with governments contributing as little as $0.20 per dose.

It has now reduced its spending cap to 70% for areas that will be ordering shots for the first time, the documents show. It will also be asking all but the poorest governments to increase their contributions, which vary depending on the strength of their economies.

Details of how these changes will affect individual countries are being worked out, Gavi said.

Price cuts for the vaccines could help mitigate the aid cuts. GSK and its partner, India’s Bharat Biotech, said in June they would reduce the price of their shot to under $5 a dose by 2028, roughly half what it costs now. In November, Gavi and the U.N. children's agency announced a deal to pay 25% less for Serum’s vaccine, currently priced at around $4 per dose, within roughly a year.

GSK said the real-world data was encouraging, and it was working with Gavi on how to make the roll-out as effective as possible. It did not elaborate. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment.

At least three countries - Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast and Togo - have committed to covering some malaria vaccine needs themselves, Gordon said.

But Tanzania is struggling to plug funding gaps and will have to delay the start of its vaccination campaign, said Dr Samwel Lazaro, acting head of its malaria programme.

“Currently, the government is focused on ensuring the implementation of the most essential and life-saving services, such as the use of medicated bed nets,” Lazaro said.

Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam have also tightened screening at airports.

The Nipah virus can cause fever and brain inflammation and has a high mortality rate. There is also no vaccine. But transmission from person to person is not easy and typically requires prolonged contact with an infected individual.

"It has become imperative to strengthen preventative and surveillance measures at Pakistan's borders," the Border Health Services department said in a statement.

"All travelers shall undergo thermal screening and clinical assessment at the Point of Entry," which includes seaports, land borders and airports, the department added.

The agency said travellers would need to provide transit history for the preceding 21-day period to check whether they had been through "Nipah-affected or high-risk regions".

There are no direct flights between Pakistan and India and travel between the two countries is extremely limited, particularly since their worst fighting in decades in May last year.

In Hanoi, the Vietnamese capital's health department on Wednesday also ordered the screening of incoming passengers at Noi Bai airport, particularly those arriving from India and the eastern state of West Bengal, where the two health workers were confirmed to have the virus in late December.

Passengers will be checked with body temperature scanners to detect suspected cases. "This allows for timely isolation, epidemiological investigation," the department said in a statement.

That follows measures by authorities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest city, who said they had tightened health controls at international border crossings.

India's health ministry said this week that authorities have identified and traced 196 contacts linked to the two cases with none showing symptoms and all testing negative for the virus.

Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40% to 75%, depending on the local healthcare system's capacity for detection and management, according to the World Health Organization.

The virus was first identified just over 25 years ago during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore, although scientists believe it has circulated in flying foxes, or fruit bats, for thousands of years.

The WHO classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen. India regularly reports sporadic infections, particularly in the southern state of Kerala , regarded as one of the world's highest-risk regions for Nipah.

As of December 2025, there have been 750 confirmed Nipah infections globally, with 415 deaths, according to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, which is funding a vaccine trial to help stop Nipah.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 07:15:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU's Kallas: We expect to list Iran's revolutionary guards as a terrorist organization</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eus-kallas-we-expect-list-irans-revolutionary-guards-terrorist-organization-2026-01-29/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The European Union will most likely include Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on its list of terrorist organisations, the bloc's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said on Friday ahead of a foreign affairs ministers council.

News that "Le Constellation" bar, in the town of Crans-Montana in Canton Valais, had gone six years without a safety check quickly prompted officials to ban some practices, including the use of sparkling candles blamed for the tragedy.

The stain on Switzerland's otherwise exemplary safety record was quickly felt as local hoteliers reported cancelled bookings in a canton where the cost of real estate in resorts such as nearby Verbier can fetch prices on a par with Hong Kong.

"There were cancellations, there were reservation postponements to later dates in hotels," said Bruno Huggler, director of the Crans-Montana tourism office, after the blaze that killed mostly teenagers and injured more than 100 people.

Le Constellation owners Jacques Moretti and his wife are under investigation for negligent homicide and other crimes.

The disaster has ignited a fractious political debate over safety, including calls for harmonised national standards in a country that prizes local autonomy.

It has also sparked alarm in Verbier's hospitality sector.

"We realize this could very well happen right here," said Lionel Dubois, head of Verbier's Association of Hoteliers, Cafe Owners and Restaurateurs. "That, I think, is a bit frightening."

Tourism in Switzerland was worth about $22.17 billion, or 3% of national output in 2021, official data showed.

While bookings at Crans-Montana's roughly 1,300 hotel rooms have suffered, the overall picture is stable, as chalet and apartment rentals cover most stays, tourism boss Huggler said.

Young people have been shaken, though, and while some restaurants are returning to life, bars remain quieter, said Cedric Berger, head of the Association of Apartment and Chalet Owners of the Crans-Montana Upper Plateau.

Some local accommodation providers have seen cancellations in short-term vacation rentals.

"January is a month to forget, a lost month for everyone," said Berger.

Survivors of the fire, which also killed French and Italian citizens, are still hospitalised around Europe.

Crans-Montana apartment owners from Italy and France are angry, said Berger, who is also a lawyer.

"People go to Valais not because it's the 'best party', but because it's Switzerland, and you think it's safe. If that quality disappears, then Switzerland's 'fortress' is a bit shaken," he added.

Anxiety about the fallout is palpable in Verbier, where Reuters contacted 37 hospitality venues.

Most declined to speak or did not reply, though the 12 who did said checks were conducted properly. But all agreed that rules must be reinforced to guarantee regular inspections, limit numbers at venues and provide fire-safety training to staff.

In four of Switzerland's 26 cantons, including Valais, building insurance is not mandatory - potentially increasing risks for owners hit by fire, as well as weakening controls.

The Swiss Insurance Association said over 90% of buildings in Switzerland are insured according to market estimates, adding it does not keep precise figures on how many are not. Reuters could not establish if Le Constellation had building insurance.

The fire delivered the biggest hit to Switzerland's reputation since the 2023 collapse of Credit Suisse bank, said Alexandre Edelmann, head of Presence Switzerland, the foreign ministry unit that promotes the country's image abroad.

As media reports about Switzerland jumped to 25 times more than average in early January, a crisis room was established to support people abroad following the fire, said Edelmann.

Lawmaker Jacqueline de Quattro, head of the lower house of parliament security committee, said the fire had exposed potential shortcomings in Switzerland's federal system, which allows cantons to set their own rules.

"We believed we had strict rules and that Switzerland was well‑prepared," said de Quattro. "But then we were brutally confronted with reality."

Proposing a national review to harmonise standards backed by an events industry group, she voiced concerns over event professionals' reports of sloppy work stemming from inadequate training, cost pressures and irregular inspections.

But the head of Verbier's Val de Bagnes municipality, Fabien Sauthier, said inspections need resources and that, while regular checks occur, it was tough to inspect some 400 public buildings annually with just four full-time safety officials.

And any push towards greater federal oversight could face resistance.

"I'm a Swiss person, so I think the canton should decide what it wants to do," said Willy Schranz, head of the municipal council in Adelboden in Canton Bern. "If you take responsibility, then it's a very good system."

China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their future.

Taiwan routinely holds drills ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which begins next month, though these are the first to take place in front of the media since China held its latest round of war games around the island in late December.

Any invasion of Taiwan by China would be very difficult given that the People's Liberation Army would have to first cross the Taiwan Strait and then attack the limited number of beaches on the island that would be suitable for landing their forces.

The drill, on a beach that forms part of the Zuoying naval base in the southern city of Kaohsiung, imagined a scenario where Taiwan first detected an unknown boat loitering off the coast - and then sends drones to investigate.

Taiwanese attack drones and fast, missile-armed patrol boats are then pressed into action. Snipers help pick off enemy forces and Taiwan-made anti-ship Hsiung Feng missiles take aim from concealed mobile launchers on the beach.

A Marine Corps officer, speaking while fully masked and not providing his name for security reasons, told reporters the near-shore exercise with coordinated strike missions was able to build a "kill chain and effectively execute joint interceptions."

"This demonstrated the Navy's multi-layered, multi-wave defensive combat effectiveness, as well as the Marine Corps' combat power and resilience in rapidly taking control from both the sea and the land," he added.

President Lai Ching-te's administration, as part of a defence-modernisation programme, has pushed for more combat-realistic training that relies less on set-piece performances and more on simulating actual combat.

Earlier this week, the military showed how its U.S.-made HIMARS - High Mobility Artillery Rocket System - would be used to hit the Penghu islands in the Taiwan Strait should Chinese forces seize them first and use them as a base to launch strikes on Taiwan proper.

The Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab HIMARS, one of Taiwan's newest and most precise strike weapons, has been used extensively by Ukraine against Russian forces.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 07:15:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7CYZ2N2WDBNULBEYGGOL3ZHRRA.jpg?auth=d62d508caff2912d07da53fcef4445908d5428a401e4ca1ef55a0e5252fba867&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel parliament gives initial approval for 2026 budget, averting snap election for now</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-parliament-gives-initial-approval-2026-budget-averting-snap-election-now-2026-01-29/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Israel's parliament gave initial approval to the 2026 state budget draft on Thursday, handing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a temporary political reprieve by averting the immediate prospect of an early election.

Lawmakers voted 62-55 in favor of the spending plan, which totals 662 billion shekels ($214.43 billion), excluding debt servicing, and sets a budget deficit ceiling of 3.9% of gross domestic product this year.

The budget, as well as an accompanying economic plan, still faces a difficult path to final approval amid deepening polarisation within Netanyahu's governing coalition. Under Israeli law, the budget must be passed by the end of March or parliament would automatically dissolve, triggering a snap election.

Tensions inside the coalition have simmered for more than two years, fuelled by disagreements over the war in Gaza, the ceasefire reached in October that halted the fighting, and demands by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties for legislation exempting religious seminary students from mandatory military service.

Some ultra-Orthodox lawmakers did not vote in favour of the budget since a military conscription bill has not yet been approved.

Netanyahu's other right-wing coalition partners - as well as opposition parties - argue that ultra-Orthodox men must share the burden of military service, particularly after two years of fighting in Gaza and Lebanon in which nearly 1,000 Israeli soldiers were killed.

"We made some really good progress on tariffs for whisky, on visa-free travel to China, and on information exchange co-operation on irregular migration," Starmer told reporters in Beijing after an 80-minute summit with the Chinese leader.

The pair discussed how much whisky tariffs would be reduced and over what timeframe, as well as discussing information on the small boats used in irregular migration into Britain as part of a greater strategic focus on security and defence.

Starmer also said the move to lower whisky tariffs was an example of how he wanted "a much wider opening" for British businesses in China, part of the aim of his trip as he seeks to inject growth into the UK's sluggish economy.

Asked whether the pair had discussed Jimmy Lai, the former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen who was convicted in December of national security crimes, Starmer said they had held a "respectful" discussion about that.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:02:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RN3WC6XR5RPA5HTNK7AWVYB6TA.jpg?auth=288aabc2a6cb2134ec26effe0b9e7994cc15150f161196b87be57df1e820db9c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China sees most high temperature days on record in 2025</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/china-sees-most-high-temperature-days-record-2025-2026-01-29/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China's national average annual temperature hit a record for a second year at 10.9 degrees Celsius (51.6 degrees Fahrenheit), with the most high-temperature days ever recorded, the country's Meteorological Administration said on Thursday.

The announcement was made at a press conference where the administration released its 2025 climate bulletin.

Last year was among the planet's three warmest on record, the World Meteorological Organisation said in January.

China's average annual temperature has risen over recent decades, and 2025 was the warmest year since nationwide records began in 1961, the administration said. Heavy rainfall and extreme heat have become more intense, increasing risks such as flooding and natural disasters.

The country's 2025 temperature of 10.9 C tied with 2024 for the highest on record, the administration said. China describes high-temperature days as days at or above 35 C.

From late June to early September there were sustained high temperatures across central and eastern China and average precipitation was 4.5% higher than normal, it said.

The amount and duration of rain were also the highest on record in northern China, while the autumn rains in western China were the heaviest on record, the administration said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:02:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N6V2H2DH3RL47JITTIZSLBZ3IY.jpg?auth=0a74fc1dec4728624c626810ae29127bdb2bb8b2459412568fd8f436f5886e29&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gunfire and explosions heard near airport in Niger’s capital, residents say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260129-gunfire-explosions-heard-near-airport-niger-capital-residents-say</link><description>A burst of heavy gunfire and explosions erupted early Thursday near the international airport in Niger 's capital Niamey before halting within hours, residents told AFP.

Videos filmed by residents of the area showed streaks of light in the sky with the sound of loud explosions, while other images showed flames several metres high and charred cars.

The capital's Diori Hamani International Airport houses an air force base and is located about 10 kilometres from the presidential palace.

Niger, a country hit regularly by jihadist attacks, has been led for more than two years by Abdourahamane Tiani , the head of a junta that overthrew the country's elected civilian president in 2023.

The shooting began shortly after midnight, according to residents of a neighbourhood near the airport.

Calm returned two hours later, they said.

It was not immediately clear what had caused the gunfire and whether there were any casualties.

The sound of sirens from fire trucks heading towards the airport could also be heard in the early hours of the morning, according to local residents.

An online activist who supports the military rule , Ibrahim Bana, posted a video on Facebook in which he called on people to turn out on the streets of the capital to "defend the country".

The country's largest international airport is also the headquarters of a joint force created by Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali to combat jihadist groups waging deadly violence in the region.

Since taking over the country, Niger's military leadership has forced out French and US forces who had been helping to combat the jihadists.

Niger and its neighbours, also led by military juntas, have teamed up to create their own confederation, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), and have announced the creation of a 5,000-strong force for joint military operations.

According to ACLED, an NGO that tracks conflict casualties globally, jihadist violence killed nearly 2,000 people in 2025 in Niger.

A huge uranium shipment with an unknown buyer, that left the country's north in late November, has also been stuck at the airport for weeks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:03:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9f5ae042-fcc6-11f0-b793-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92V93WP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike kills three in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-drone-strike-kills-three-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-region-governor-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A Russian drone strike killed three people and wounded three more overnight in Ukraine's southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, the regional governor and emergency services said on Thursday.

Two women aged 26 and 50 and a 62-year-old man were killed in the attack, Ukraine's emergency services said, adding that one private building had been destroyed and several others damaged.

Emergency services posted photos on the Telegram messaging app of firefighters battling a raging fire and a flattened building.

Overall, in the past 24 hours Russia has launched 841 strikes at 34 settlements in the region, Governor Ivan Fedorov said.

Russian forces occupy large swathes of territory in Zaporizhzhia and have been making recent gains there. It is one of four Ukrainian regions that Russia claims to have annexed since it launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 105 drones overnight, of which 84 were downed.

Ukraine and Russia met for U.S.-brokered peace talks in Abu Dhabi last week, with further meetings expected on Sunday, but Russia has continued to pound Ukrainian cities and both countries have hit each other's energy infrastructure .

Moscow's drones also struck again the southern port city of Odesa, causing a large fire at an industrial facility, Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram.

Kiper said that warehouses, production buildings and trucks were damaged in the attack, adding that no one was hurt.

The city of Odesa and surrounding region have been a repeated target of Moscow's attacks in recent months as it steps up pressure on Ukraine's maritime export arteries in retaliation for Kyiv's strikes on unregulated oil tankers sailing to Russia.

The death toll of an overnight attack on Tuesday on Odesa rose to four, Kiper said, after an elderly man died in a hospital from his injuries.

Russian officials made no comments on the attacks. Both Moscow and Kyiv deny they are targeting civilians in the nearly four-year war.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 08:55:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PO72BNIDJNJLFC4CD3KQ2FXB4E.jpg?auth=d6395eaa70c8bcc8a320d5e1834bd89b03ba9fe5aaade739f817abfc055226ea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz calls for stronger NATO within Europe, but wants to maintain US ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germanys-merz-calls-stronger-nato-within-europe-wants-maintain-us-ties-2026-01-29/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday called for a stronger NATO within Europe but said that it should also always extend the hand of cooperation to the United States.

Kallas said that despite US-led talks to end the war in Abu Dhabi Russia was "bombing Ukrainians, trying to bomb and freeze them to surrender".

"It's a very hard winter and Ukrainians are really suffering. There is a humanitarian catastrophe coming there," she said at the start of an EU meeting in Brussels.

Estonian ​Foreign Minister Magnus ⁠Tsahkna said on Thursday he wanted ​to ‍blacklist all Russians who ​have fought in ​Ukraine and prevent them from entering the Schengen area.

"You can imagine these ‍hundreds of ​thousands of ex-combatants and criminals, coming here ‌and what they're ‍going to do," he told reporters. "They're going to do many bad ‍things."

Russia's oil giant Lukoil, sanctioned by Washington over the Ukraine war, said on Thursday that it will sell its foreign assets to the US investment firm The Carlyle Group.

Lukoil "informs that it signed an agreement with US investment company Carlyle on the sale of LUKOIL International GmbH ", Russia's second-biggest oil producer said, adding that the deal excluded assets in Kazakhstan.

The number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could be 2 million by spring, with Russia sustaining the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II, a report warned Tuesday.

The report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

As the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes damaged an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and in the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.

Russian drone strikes killed three people and wounded another person overnight in southern Ukraine, the region's governor said early on Thursday.

"Unfortunately, two women and a man were killed, and another man was wounded," said Zaporizhzhia Governor Ivan Fedorov.

He added in a post to Telegram that the strikes had destroyed houses and caused fires.

EU top diplomat Kaja Kallas warned Thursday that Ukraine was facing a "humanitarian catastrophe" as Russian strikes cut power in frigid winter conditions.

Kallas said that despite US-led talks to end the war in Abu Dhabi Russia was "bombing Ukrainians, trying to bomb and freeze them to surrender".

"It's a very hard winter and Ukrainians are really suffering. There is a humanitarian catastrophe coming there," she said at the start of an EU meeting in Brussels.

Estonian ​Foreign Minister Magnus ⁠Tsahkna said on Thursday he wanted ​to ‍blacklist all Russians who ​have fought in ​Ukraine and prevent them from entering the Schengen area.

"You can imagine these ‍hundreds of ​thousands of ex-combatants and criminals, coming here ‌and what they're ‍going to do," he told reporters. "They're going to do many bad ‍things."

Russia's oil giant Lukoil, sanctioned by Washington over the Ukraine war, said on Thursday that it will sell its foreign assets to the US investment firm The Carlyle Group.

Lukoil "informs that it signed an agreement with US investment company Carlyle on the sale of LUKOIL International GmbH ", Russia's second-biggest oil producer said, adding that the deal excluded assets in Kazakhstan.

Christina Harward, Russia Deputy Team Lead at the Institute for the Study of War, says that the 'Russian advances are coming at a literal foot-pace' and 'this is not the picture that the Russians are trying to paint', adding that Russian casualties are astronomical.

﻿ She explains that Russians are trying to diplomatically strongarm Ukraine and the West into giving up this territory, because they 'know the fight is going to be long'.

The number of soldiers killed, injured or missing on both sides of Russia's war on Ukraine could be 2 million by spring, with Russia sustaining the largest number of troop deaths for any major power in any conflict since World War II, a report warned Tuesday.

The report from the Center for Strategic and International Studies came less than a month before the fourth anniversary of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24.

As the war grinds through another bitterly cold winter, Russian strikes damaged an apartment block Wednesday on the outskirts of Kyiv, killing two people. Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and in the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.

For the Inuit people, who have lived here for centuries, no one owns the Arctic land.

The concept that ownership is shared collectively is central to the Inuit identity , they say. It has survived 300 years of colonisation and is written into law: People can own houses, but not the land beneath them.

"We can't even buy our own land ourselves, but Trump wants to buy it - that's so strange to us," said Kaaleeraq Ringsted, 74, in Kapisillit, a tiny settlement of wooden houses clinging to the shore of a fjord east of the capital, Nuuk.

“Since childhood, I have been used to the idea that you can only rent land. We have always been used to the idea that we collectively own our land.”

'A FREE LIFE IN NATURE'

Ringsted, a former fisherman and hunter who was born in Kapisillit, was speaking at the small church that sits on a cliff above the village, reachable only via a steep wooden staircase, where he is now the village catechist.

It is deep winter, and the sun rarely climbs above the surrounding mountains.

The settlement scattered below also boasts a school, a grocery store and a service house where residents can shower and wash clothes. A small emergency room holds basic medical supplies. A job posting for a clinic employee hung on the door.

It is a place of raw beauty and hard logistics. The small pier is the lifeline, where the weekly boat brings supplies from Nuuk and from which fishermen and hunters set out for seal, halibut, cod and reindeer.

"We’ve always had a free life here in nature," said Heidi Lennert Nolso, the village leader. "We can sail and go anywhere without restrictions."

Greenland and its people were thrust into the global spotlight last year when Trump revived his demand that the U.S. take control of the island for national security and to access its abundant mineral resources .

Trump has since backed away from threats the U.S. could take the island by force and said he had secured total and permanent U.S. access to Greenland in a deal with NATO, but much of the detail remains unclear.

Locals in the village said they followed the headlines, but it was not something they spoke a lot about.

“People here are interested in the day that is coming. Is there food in the fridge? Fine, then I can sleep a little longer. If there is no food, then I will go out and catch fish or go out and shoot a reindeer,” said Vanilla Mathiassen, a Danish teacher in Kapisillit who has worked in towns and villages across Greenland for 13 years.

Ulrik Blidorf, a lawyer in Nuuk and owner of the firm Inuit Law, said Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory, did not have private freehold ownership of land.

“In Greenland, you can’t own the land,” Blidorf said. “It’s been like that ever since our ancestors came here. Today you get a right to use the area where you have your house.”

Nearly 90% of Greenland's 57,000 population are indigenous Inuit, who have inhabited the island continuously for around 1,000 years.

Rakel Kristiansen, from a family of shamanic practitioners, said Inuit people saw themselves as temporary guardians of the land.

"In our understanding, owning land is the wrong question,” she said. “The question should be who is responsible for the land. The land existed before us, and it will exist after us.”

CLINGING ON TO SURVIVAL

Back in Kapisillit, a cold wind sweeps down from the Greenland ice sheet. Two sea eagles circle above the fjord and seagulls cluster around fishing boats.

Here, the focus is on survival.

But there are fewer hunters and fishermen now, as the pull of education, jobs and services has drawn people away from the settlement in recent decades.

At the school, William, 8, Malerak, 7, and Viola, 7, are the only remaining students, studying beneath a map of Greenland printed in 1954. During recess, they go sledding. All three are moving away soon, and the school may close.

New holiday homes, some with outdoor hot tubs, have been built along the bay for wealthy Nuuk residents. They stand empty and shuttered in winter.

From a nearby cliff, an iceberg-filled fjord is visible. The scenery could draw tourism, but the village lacks even basic infrastructure.

“There's a risk the settlement could die," village leader Nolso said. "People are getting old.”

Kapisillit once had nearly 500 residents at its peak, said Kristiane Josefsen, a lifelong resident. Today it has 37. Josefsen, born in 1959, works with sealskin — washing, processing and scraping it to sell in Nuuk for national costumes.

"Scraping sealskins is very hard on the body," she said.

But though she plans to retire this year, she does not intend to leave.

"I’m staying here. I belong here," she said. "This is my land. Greenland is my land.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:44:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UHN5MS4LWRNHVMET5GFCC47H74.jpg?auth=468fd4652c77e8d84c2f78ce7b08a79a9c3d74e01a27a8eff02395128093789f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's foreign minister to visit Turkey for talks on tensions with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-foreign-minister-visit-turkey-talks-tensions-with-us-2026-01-29/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi will visit Turkey on Friday for talks with his counterpart Hakan Fidan on the recent developments in Iran and tensions with the United States, a Turkish Foreign Ministry source said on Thursday.

U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons or the next U.S. attack would be far worse. Trump has sent an " armada " to the Middle East and warned Tehran against killing anti-government protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

Tehran, which brutally cracked down on large protests this month and killed or arrested thousands, responded with a threat to strike back against the United States, Israel and those who support them.

Iranian officials blame the unrest, the biggest since the 1979 revolution, on Iran's foes, Israel and the United States.

Turkey, a NATO member that shares a border with Iran, has said it opposes any foreign intervention on its neighbour and urged Washington to resolve its issues with Iran "one by one".

It has reached out to both sides, warning that destabilisation in Iran would exceed the region's capacity to manage at this time.

The source said Fidan would tell Araqchi that Turkey closely followed developments in Iran, and that Iran's security, peace, and stability were of "great importance" for Ankara.

Fidan will also repeat Turkey's opposition to any military attack on Iran and warn that such a move will "create risks on a global scale", the source said, adding that he would offer Turkey's support in helping resolve tensions with Washington.

Fidan will "note that Turkey supports finding a solution on Iran's nuclear programme as soon as possible, and that it stands ready to help on this issue if it is needed," the source said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:46:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SXPZDAJ2ANNUTKIWK5IC55EBGI.jpg?auth=d070a3361857cac5524ecbeede473ded9b0b6e9e4994b5555785ffc47f412422&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Senate approves draft bill to simplify return of colonial-era artefacts</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260129-french-lawmakers-approve-framework-law-facilitate-return-colonial-artefact</link><description>French senators adopted a bill on Wednesday to simplify the return of artworks looted during the colonial era to their countries of origin.

The draft legislation was unanimously approved by the upper house and will next be sent to the National Assembly lower house before it can become law.

France still has in its possession tens of thousands of artworks and other prized artefacts that it looted from its colonial empire.

President Emmanuel Macron has gone further than his predecessors in admitting past French abuses in Africa.

Speaking on a visit to the Burkina Faso capital Ouagadougou shortly after taking office in 2017, Macron vowed that France would never again interfere in its former colonies and promised to facilitate the return of African cultural heritage within five years.

Former colonial powers in Europe have slowly been moving to send back some artworks obtained during their imperial conquests, but France is hindered by its current legislation.

The return of every item in the national collection must be voted on individually.

Designed to streamline the process, the bill under consideration specifically targets property acquired between 1815 and 1972.

"The idea is not to empty French museums , but to achieve authenticity in France's response, without denial or repentance, but in recognition of our history," said centrist Senator Catherine Morin-Desailly.

In 2025, France's parliament approved the return to Ivory Coast of a " talking drum " that colonial troops took from the Ebrie tribe in 1916.

France has been flooded with restitution demands, including from Algeria , Mali and Benin .

The restitution of looted artworks to Africa is one of the highlights of the "new relationship" Macron wanted to establish with the continent.

In 2023, France adopted two so-called framework laws to return objects in two categories: one for goods looted from Jewish families during World War II , and another for the repatriation of human remains from public collections.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:47:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5245f3c8-3650-11ec-a1ef-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/benin-art.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer seeks fresh start with China as Trump shakes up global relations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260129-uk-starmer-seeks-fresh-start-china-trump-shakes-up-global-relations</link><description>British ⁠Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday that he wanted to build a "sophisticated relationship" with Beijing to boost the UK economy, signalling a reset after years of strained ties.

On the key day of his four-day visit to China , the first by a British prime minister in eight years, Starmer held an 80-minute summit with Xi at the ​Great Hall of the People before they lunched together. Starmer said the pair chatted about football and Shakespeare, as well as business matters.

The British leader will also ‍meet Premier Li Qiang. Starmer, whose centre-left Labour Party government has struggled to deliver the growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world's second-largest economy a priority, despite lingering misgivings about espionage and human rights .

"China is a vital player on ​the global stage, and it's vital that we build a more sophisticated relationship where we can identify opportunities to collaborate, but of course, ​also allow a meaningful dialogue on areas where we disagree," Starmer told

Xi said ties with Britain had gone through "twists and turns" that did not serve the interests of either country and that China was ready to develop a long-term partnership.

"We can deliver a result that can withstand the test of history," the Chinese leader told Starmer, flanked by his top ministers.

Starmer is the latest Western leader to engage in a flurry of diplomacy with China, as nations hedge against unpredictability from the United States under President Donald Trump.

Trump's on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges to grab control of Greenland , an autonomous territory of Denmark , have rankled long-standing allies like Britain.

Starmer's visit immediately follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who signed an economic deal with Beijing to tear down trade barriers, ‍drawing Trump's ire.

The British leader told reporters he had made progress in discussions with China's leader to reduce tariffs on whisky, while Xi also said China would consider waiving visas for British nationals.

The "relationship is in a good place, a strong place", said ​Starmer, who is being accompanied by more than 50 business leaders on the trip.

Asked by a reporter if Xi was someone he could do business with, Starmer replied "yes".

Starmer has adopted a new policy of engagement with China after ties deteriorated for years under previous Conservative governments, when London curbed some Chinese investment over national ‌security worries and expressed concern over a crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong.

"I made the promise 18 months ago, when we were elected into government, that I would make Britain face outwards again," Starmer told Xi. "Because, as we all know, events abroad affect everything that happens back in ‍our home countries, to prices on the supermarket shelves to how secure we feel."

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of Britain’s opposition Conservative Party, said on Wednesday she would not have gone to China because of the security risks the country poses. British security services have said China routinely spies on the government. China has denied the claims.

In a sign of how the countries can work together, Starmer also announced that Britain and China would jointly tackle gangs involved in trafficking illegal migrants.

The deal focuses on reducing the use of Chinese-made engines for small boats that transport people across Europe to claim asylum .

British and Chinese officials will share intelligence to identify smugglers’ supply routes and work with Chinese manufacturers to prevent legitimate businesses from being exploited by organised crime , Downing Street said.

Starmer told reporters he also had a "respectful ‍discussion" with Xi about the case of Jimmy Lai , the former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen who was convicted in December of national security crimes.

After arriving in the Chinese capital late Wednesday, Starmer dined at a ‌restaurant known for its mushroom-laden dishes ​that also hosted former US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen during her 2023 visit.

He practiced pronouncing the Chinese word for thank you – "xie xie" – with restaurant staff as he posed for photographs, a video posted on Weibo showed.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 09:47:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/245e23be-fce8-11f0-bc97-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029280407456.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says it is still waiting for U.S. response to Putin's nuclear treaty offer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-it-is-still-waiting-us-response-putins-nuclear-treaty-offer-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Russia is still waiting for the United States to respond to President Vladimir Putin's proposal to informally extend for a year the provisions of the last remaining nuclear arms pact between the two countries, the Kremlin said on Thursday.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the expiry of the New START treaty on February 5 could lead to a serious gap in the legal framework regulating nuclear arms.

New START, which was signed by presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, sets limits on the strategic weapons that each side would use to target the other's critical political and military centres in the event of a nuclear war.

European nations are hiking defence spending in response to pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and following Russia's invasion of Ukraine .

Norway will acquire 16 launch systems and an undisclosed number of rockets for a total cost of 19 billion Norwegian crowns ($2.0 billion), the defence ministry said in a statement.

Hanwha Aerospace's Chunmoo artillery system competed for the Norwegian army contract with U.S. defence giant Lockheed Martin's (LMT.N) , opens new tab HIMARS.

"Hanwha will deliver launch units and training materials in 2028 and 2029, and missiles in 2030 and 2031," Norway's Defence Minister Tore Sandvik said in the statement.

Norway, which shares a border with Russia in the Arctic, says the war in Ukraine has shown that long-range artillery is essential on the modern battlefield.

The South Korean system met all requirements set by Norway for the ground-based artillery, including the ability to fire at a range of up to 500 km (310 miles), and had the quickest delivery time, officials have said.

Hanwha Aerospace last year signed an agreement with Polish defence company WB Electronics to form a joint venture producing missiles in Poland, including for the Chunmoo rocket artillery, ensuring manufacturing on European soil.

Some members of Norway's parliament had said the Nordic country should help to develop a European missile alternative, but the government dismissed this as too time-consuming and costly.

British citizens will be allowed to visit China without a visa if they are travelling for under 30 days, Starmer said following his talks with President Xi Jinping, in what he cast as a win for business.

Companies had been "crying out for ways to grow their footprints in China", a statement from Starmer said, adding that visa-free travel would help facilitate expansion in that market, boosting jobs at home.

Injecting growth into Britain's relatively sluggish economy is one of the main aims of his four-day trip.

As part of what Britain called a "new partnership", the two countries also agreed to conduct a feasibility study which could pave the way towards a bilateral services agreement, which would further help British firms doing business in China.

Britain's economy is underpinned by its huge services sector and the partnership will aim to grow links in the healthcare, financial and professional services, legal services, education and skills sectors, the statement said.

Britain exports 13 billion pounds worth of services to China annually, it added, and demand from China is growing.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 11:31:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DN3S3SQGUBN7FMX5P7JFFGT3HE.jpg?auth=a94bbf5fa466e4d37b3458b5fbb32cc162cb9ba63b873ac6ea132478b360f6e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia and Ukraine carry out new exchange of war dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-ukraine-carry-out-new-exchange-war-dead-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW/KYIV, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine said on Thursday that they had carried out the latest exchange of their war dead, a regular practice designed to allow relatives of those killed on the battlefield to bury their loved ones.

Following weeks of daily clashes between protesters and immigration agents, spiked by the fatal shooting of two U.S. citizens during such confrontations, senior Trump administration officials seemed to be recalibrating their approach.

A newly issued internal memo from a high-ranking Immigration and Customs Enforcement official directs federal officers to refrain from any unnecessary communication and engagement with "agitators" so as to avoid "inflaming the situation."

The directive, reviewed by Reuters late on Wednesday, also orders ICE officers to only target immigrants who have records of criminal charges or convictions, a departure from earlier tactics that included randomly stopping people on the street to demand documented proof of legal U.S. residence or citizenship.

The substance of the memo seemed at odds with tough talk coming from Trump and some of his senior officials on Wednesday.

A day after sounding a conciliatory tone in his public remarks, the Republican president took to his Truth Social platform on Wednesday to warn that Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat, was "playing with fire" by continuing to insist that city authorities would play no role in enforcing federal immigration laws.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents had arrested 16 people on Wednesday in Minnesota for allegedly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal law enforcement.

"Nothing will stop us from continuing to make arrests and enforce the law," Bondi wrote.

A federal judge in Minneapolis said on Wednesday that ICE was flouting the law by ignoring dozens of federal court orders during this month's surge.

While canceling a contempt-of-court hearing for acting ICE chief Todd Lyons - after the agency belatedly complied with an order to release a wrongly detained Ecuadorean man - U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz cited at least 96 federal court orders he said ICE has violated in 74 cases.

"This list should give pause to anyone - no matter his or her political beliefs - who cares about the rule of law," Schiltz wrote in his ruling. "ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2025 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence."

It was not made clear what Homan planned to discuss at his press conference, two days after he held his first meetings with Frey and Minnesota's Democratic governor, Tim Walz, who have denounced the ICE operation as "reckless" and demanded it be ended altogether.

The guidance contained in the internal ICE memo seemed to reflect a change playing out on the streets of Minneapolis.

Observers and activists closely tracking ICE actions told Reuters that immigration raids had slackened somewhat on Tuesday before ramping up again on Wednesday, though in a more narrowly tailored manner.

Trump himself said on Tuesday he was looking to "de-escalate a little bit," and dispatched Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism and legal challenges.

Minnesota's Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul have been in a state of upheaval since Trump ordered some 3,000 heavily armed ICE and Border Patrol agents to the area weeks ago to conduct a deportation drive dubbed Operation Metro Surge.

Tensions escalated after Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot dead behind the wheel of her car by an ICE agent on January 7, sparking demonstrations in the Twin Cities and in communities large and small across the country.

But public outrage deepened after Saturday's fatal shooting of an intensive care nurse, Alex Pretti, also 37, during another encounter between immigration agents and activists who confronted them to record and protest ICE activity.

In both cases, Trump administration officials immediately defended the federal agents involved in the shootings, denouncing both Good and Pretti as "domestic terrorists" who they said were threatening to harm law enforcement.

Multiple video recordings of the two incidents that have since gone viral on the internet plainly contradict the notion that either Good or Pretti posed a danger to immigration officers or others.

While some administration officials immediately accused Pretti of planning to "massacre" officers, citing the handgun he was carrying, video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot Pretti in the back while he was being restrained.

"We continue to call on all parties to exercise restraint and to renounce any use of force to resolve issues. Clearly, the potential for negotiations is far from exhausted... We must focus primarily on negotiating mechanisms," Peskov told reporters.

"Any forceful actions can only create chaos in the region and lead to very dangerous consequences in terms of destabilising the security system throughout the region."

The suspects were detained following a joint investigation by Istanbul prosecutors, the anti-terrorism police and Turkey's intelligence agency, according to TRT.

They are accused of gathering information on military bases and other sensitive locations in Turkey and abroad, allegedly in coordination with members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' intelligence arm, according to the report.

TRT said the six are further suspected of conducting reconnaissance around the NATO-run Incirlik air base in the southeastern Turkish province of Adana, taking part in shipment of drones through Turkey for use in third countries, and sharing information with Iranian intelligence.

Iran was hit in the past month by the most widespread unrest since its 1979 Islamic Revolution. It is also under U.S. pressure to negotiate a deal to curb its nuclear programme or face, in President Donald Trump's words, a "far worse" attack than a U.S. strike on its nuclear facilities last June.

Trump has sent what he has described as an " armada " to the Middle East to warn Tehran against killing anti-government protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

The report by World Weather Attribution showed that the intensity of such extreme rainfall events has increased by 40% since preindustrial times - a clear sign that warmer ocean temperatures linked to greenhouse gas emissions are partly to blame - and that current La Niña conditions had worsened things.

Severe flooding since December has wrought havoc across Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Eswatini, "with some areas receiving over a year’s rain in just days," the study said. Burst rivers forced the closure of South Africa's Kruger park , and will cost millions of dollars to repair.

"Data confirms a clear move toward more violent downpours," WWA said. "This effect was compounded by the current La Niña, which naturally brings wetter conditions to this part of the world, but is now operating within a ... more moisture-rich atmosphere."

La Niña involves the temporary cooling of temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. The World Meteorological Organization has predicted a weak La Niña in this cycle, but warned that warmer-than-normal sea temperatures linked to climate change are increasing the chance of floods and droughts.

"Human-caused climate change is supercharging rainfall events like this with devastating impacts for those in its path," Izidine Pinto, co-author and senior climate researcher at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute said.

"Our analysis clearly shows that our continued burning of fossil fuels is increasing the intensity of extreme rainfall, turning (it) ... into something much more severe."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 11:34:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XRVBM7AJZZLSLDTOLGK2CIKMIE.jpg?auth=f0f69f350d8c86333642497ef8dbdb23245fdd397b115ab46aea652bd9d24bc6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran's army chief vows 'crushing response' as US tensions simmer</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260129-live-iran-army-chief-vows-crushing-response-us-tensions-simmer</link><description>Iran's army chief on Thursday vowed a "crushing response" to any attack, state television reported, after the United States moved a strike force into regional waters.

TotalEnergies chief executive Patrick Pouyanne announced the restart of the Mozambique LNG project at a ceremony attended by President Daniel Chapo .

"I am delighted to announce the full restart of the Mozambique LNG project ... The force majeure is over," Pouyanne told the event.

The $20 billion project in the northern Cabo Delgado province on the border with Tanzania was suspended following a bloody jihadist attack in 2021 that killed an estimated 800 people.

TotalEnergies had already lifted in October the force majeure it declared after the attack , and has sought compensation of $4.5 billion in cost overruns linked to the delay from the Mozambique government.

Chapo's office said in a statement the restart of the project "presents a significant milestone for the national economy and reaffirms the confidence of international partners in Mozambique's energy, institutional and human potential".

Reportedly the largest private investment in Africa's energy infrastructure, the project is expected to generate thousands of jobs and help make the country one of the world's biggest LNG exporters.

But environmental groups have called it a " climate bomb" that would bring little benefit to Mozambicans, more than 80 percent of whom lived below the poverty line of three dollars per day in 2022, according to the World Bank .

While northern Mozambique has not experienced an attack on the scale of the one in 2021, there are regular attacks on civilians and troops blamed on jihadist insurgents.

The insurgency in northern Mozambique has left more than 6,200 people dead since 2017, according to the NGO Acled, which collects data on conflict zones.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 11:35:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/39587782-09f7-11ef-a7d8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000_34QQ84L.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli fire kills two in Gaza as truce deal moves to next phase</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-fire-kills-two-gaza-truce-deal-moves-next-phase-2026-01-29/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Israeli fire killed at least two Palestinians in Gaza on Thursday, health officials said, in the latest violence rattling a fragile ceasefire as Hamas and Israel looked to implement the second phase of the U.S.-brokered Gaza peace plan.

Medics said two men were killed by Israeli forces in eastern Khan Younis, in an area adjacent to where the army operates. The Israeli military told Reuters it wasn't aware of any casualties as a result of Israeli fire on Thursday.

The Gaza health ministry said Israeli airstrikes, tank shelling and gunfire have killed at least 490 people since the truce took effect in October after two years of war that widely demolished the Palestinian enclave.

Israel said four soldiers have been killed by Palestinian militants in the small coastal territory over the same period.

The two sides have traded blame over the truce violations.

By advancing to phase two, the U.S. and mediator partners Egypt and Qatar must confront the more contentious issue of Hamas disarmament, which the group has long rejected.

Laura Fernandez, 39, a political scientist and former presidential chief of staff, holds a commanding lead, signaling voter appetite in the Central American country to extend the right’s mandate.

The election underscores the growing appeal in Latin America of strongmen leaders like El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele who champion their tough security policies at the expense of shrinking civil liberties.

Fernandez campaigned on a vow to continue the policies of Costa Rica's current president and her mentor, Rodrigo Chaves, a brash former World Bank economist who is facing a number of corruption investigations while remaining deeply popular.

“Rodrigo Chaves’ project is not a four-year event, it’s a one-way street,” Fernandez said in a campaign video.

The election is seen by many as a referendum on Chaves' leadership and his tough-on-crime policies.

Fernandez has asked voters to hand her 40 seats in the 57-seat legislative assembly, a supermajority that would allow her to reform the judiciary and constitution, including allowing consecutive or indefinite reelection. Currently, the term is set at four years but cannot be served consecutively.

She has also pledged to enact stricter criminal sentences, reform state pensions and fight crime.

Latest polls show Fernandez at or around 40%, the amount needed to avoid a runoff vote in April, while her closest contenders in the 20-person race are polling in the single digits.

If Fernandez fails to garner enough support to win the election outright, those seen as most likely to make it to a second round against Fernandez include Alvaro Ramos, an economist from the mainstream National Liberation Party and Claudia Dobles, an architect and former first lady who returned to revive the fledgling Citizen Action Party after working as a researcher at MIT.

Most of the 19 opposition candidates have warned against the risk of an emerging authoritarian model led by Chaves, but have failed to form a united front against Fernandez.

A major tourist destination, Costa Rica has long been lauded as a peaceful oasis in a region plagued by civil wars, gang violence and drug trafficking.

But the country of about 5.2 million has seen record levels of murders in recent years as it becomes a growing hotspot for global cocaine trafficking according to the U.S. government.

In late January, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned a Costa Rican drug network and said the country "has become an increasingly significant waypoint for criminal organizations trafficking cocaine to the United States."

The statement underscored a major transformation for a country that has no military and attracts over 2 million tourists a year.

"The speed with which drug traffickers have infiltrated the country and captured some of the country's institutions hasn't been seen before," said Maria Fernanda Bozmoski, the director for Central America at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based international affairs think tank.

While rising violence and murders have led to an anti-incumbent shift in recent elections in Chile, Honduras and Ecuador, Bozmoski said that Chaves has remained largely immune to that sentiment.

Ronald Rodriguez, a 61-year-old retiree from the canton of San Carlos in northern Costa Rica, said Chaves’ movement needs more time and power for its policies to make an impact.

"The problem isn't Chaves, it's all of those who came before him and let things get worse," Rodriguez said. "Things are worse than ever and that's why we need the things Chaves is promising, changing the judiciary and building that Bukele jail fast."

El Salvador’s Bukele recently visited Costa Rica to inaugurate a maximum-security prison modeled after El Salvador's 40,000-inmate Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT) and Fernandez has vowed to see it through.

Ronald Alfaro, a researcher at Costa Rica's Center for Investigations and Political Studies (CIEP), said Chaves' popularity stems from his anti-status quo reputation.

"His support, like other similar political figures, is more based on his persona and what he represents," Alfaro said. "That's why the government's slogan is, if you want change, vote for continuity."

Despite the incumbent party's lead, a January poll from CIEP shows nearly a third of voters remain undecided while 79% of respondents said they were a little enthusiastic or not enthusiastic at all about the election.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 12:59:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QBIMDONCWVL5FPNCYORQ6TKXRA.jpg?auth=e7289fa10ca2cbf64f648ff2602da6b63db42066bf538929b475c19e2a003cd2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Temperatures as low as minus 30C in Ukraine next week may damage crops</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/temperatures-low-minus-30c-ukraine-next-week-may-damage-crops-2026-01-29/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Extremely low temperatures down to minus 30 degrees Celsius (minus 22 degrees Fahrenheit) will hit Ukraine at the beginning of next week, which is very dangerous for winter crops, agricultural analysts and the national emergency service said on Thursday.

A sharp drop in temperature will begin on February 1 and will affect all regions except southern Ukraine and the frosts will begin to ease slightly only on February 4, the service said on the Telegram messenger.

"We consider the current cold spell to be extremely dangerous for winter crops across a significant part of Ukraine," analyst Barva Invest said on Telegram.

Ukraine is a producer of winter wheat, which accounts for about 95% of the total Ukrainian wheat harvest. Winter wheat, which has a higher yield than spring wheat, is sown in autumn and harvested in the summer of the following year.

Barva Invest noted that a combination of severe frosts and insufficient snow cover could affect crops in central, north-eastern and eastern Ukraine.

Frosts will be less severe in southern Ukraine, but there is no snow cover there to protect the crops.

Temperatures dropped to minus 20 C in Ukraine in early January, only easing to above-zero temperatures this week.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 12:59:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VZQQYHTF5VNJXMVYWQ3WSEGRGI.jpg?auth=d34a648b1a5951766a59aaf10084f7d3710643b7d447f1d72d4ae992c489887f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chechen leader Kadyrov says Russia should fight war in Ukraine to the end</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/chechen-leader-kadyrov-says-russia-should-fight-ukraine-war-end-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The leader of Russia's Chechnya region, Ramzan Kadyrov, said on Thursday that he was opposed to talks on ending the war in Ukraine and that Moscow should fight on.

Kadyrov, who calls himself Putin's "foot soldier" is a prominent war hawk. His comment reflects a current of opinion among hardliners that Russia is winning the four-year-old war and should keep going, even as U.S. President Donald Trump steps up diplomatic efforts to end it.

However, the decision on whether and when to stop lies firmly with Putin.

Conflicts in the Middle East and a protracted Russia-Ukraine war have led to a surge in demand for arms, driving sales for defense contractors like Lockheed.

Geopolitical tensions have also been further heightened by the capture of the Venezuelan president , opens new tab by U.S. forces.

Lockheed's F-35 and F-22 fighter jets, RQ-170 stealth drones and Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopters were used in the operation, CEO Jim Taiclet said in the release.

Earlier this month, Lockheed clinched a seven-year agreement with the Department of War to boost production of Patriot PAC-3 missile interceptors to 2,000 units annually, up from 600.

Separately, Lockheed also said on Thursday that it had reached a deal with the DoW to more than quadruple production of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile interceptors to 400 per year, up from 96 previously.

During the fourth quarter, the company's missiles business, maker of the Patriot system, posted the fastest sales growth, up 17.8% from a year ago.

Quarterly sales for its aeronautics segment, which is the leading segment by revenue and makes the F-35 jets, rose 6.4%.

In January, Lockheed said it delivered a record 191 F-35 fighter jets in 2025, up from 110 jets in 2024.

The F-35 is the Pentagon's largest acquisition program, with lifetime costs estimated at more than $2 trillion for purchasing, operating and maintaining the aircraft.

Peers RTX (RTX.N) , opens new tab and Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) , opens new tab have reaffirmed their commitment to dividends, although Northrop said it would pause buybacks beyond January.

In 2025, Lockheed paid $3.13 billion in dividends, a rise from $3.06 billion the previous year.

Lockheed forecast 2026 revenue of $77.5 billion to $80 billion, above analysts' estimates of $77.83 billion, according to LSEG-compiled data.

It expects profit per share between $29.35 and $30.25, versus expectations of $29.28.

Myanmar's long‑running conflict remains one of ASEAN's most difficult and divisive issues. It recently completed elections , which are expected to hand a landslide victory to a military-backed party, but ASEAN as a bloc has not endorsed the vote.

While Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Theresa Lazaro noted that some member states view the elections as "something positive," she emphasised this was not an expression of support, merely an acknowledgement that some governments see opportunities emerging.

ASEAN has barred Myanmar's military rulers since 2022 and did not as a bloc endorse the election, which the opposition did not participate in.

Lazaro stressed that ASEAN’s engagement with Myanmar continues to be anchored in the 2021 five-point peace plan agreed with the junta leader after a coup.

Negotiations on an ASEAN‑China Code of Conduct in the South China Sea have dragged on for over two decades, but the Philippines, as 2026 chair, is pushing to inject momentum.

China's extensive maritime claims overlap with the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam, making a functional code essential to preventing escalation and managing incidents at sea.

Lazaro said ASEAN ministers "welcome the positive momentum" in negotiations and that the Philippines will endeavour to speed them up and conclude the code this year.

She emphasised the code must be based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and must be legally binding to effectively address disputes.

The long-running border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia remains a sensitive issue for ASEAN.

The previous chair of ASEAN, Malaysia, oversaw several rounds of ceasefire negotiations after renewed fighting along the border last year, when clashes, airstrikes and landmine blasts caused scores of casualties and mass displacement.

Lazaro said the current ceasefire is fragile but holding, and ASEAN is relieved that skirmishes have not escalated.

As chair, the Philippines will serve as coordinator for the ASEAN Observer Team, tasked with monitoring the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 13:00:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FSSIK23YQJNJ7IR6YMISES4ONU.jpg?auth=4f91438c768ade873014dfabc9894ca4811a929379d104e59dcb6bc9a67dd5f1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK immigration officers in court charged with stealing cash from 'small boat' migrants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-immigration-officers-court-charged-with-stealing-cash-small-boat-migrants-2026-01-29/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Five British immigration officers appeared in court on Thursday charged with misconduct in public office and conspiracy to steal from migrants who had arrived in Britain on small boats.

John Bernthal, 53, Ben Edwardes, 45, Lee-Ann Evanson, 42, Besmir Matera, 36, and Jack Mitchell, 33, are charged with stealing from migrants between August 2021 and November 2022.

All five are also charged with one count of misconduct in public office and one count of money laundering.

They sat in the dock at London's Westminster Magistrates' Court as prosecutor Rosalind Earis said the five worked on Britain's south coast "dealing with recent arrivals on small boats across the Channel".

The crossings of small boats carrying migrants from France, the most visible sign of arrivals, have become a focal point for British voters and has helped propel Nigel Farage's anti-immigration Reform UK party into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Earis told the court that "many of these people arrive with relatively large sums of money in cash on their person". When the defendants discovered this "they worked together to take that money for themselves and share it", Earis added.

Matera is also charged with entering or remaining in Britain by deception and possession of three identity documents – a British passport and a full and provisional driving licences – in a false name.

Earis said Matera applied for asylum in 2003, claiming he was from Kosovo and had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry. But, Earis said, Matera was from Albania and arrived in Britain on a school trip.

A sixth defendant, 43-year-old David Grundy, is only charged with one count of money laundering.

All six defendants were granted bail ahead of their next hearing at Southwark Crown Court in February. None were asked to enter pleas.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 13:00:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The top candidates in Costa Rica's presidential election: a tough-on-crime front runner and splintered opposition</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/top-candidates-costa-ricas-presidential-election-tough-on-crime-front-runner-2026-01-29/</link><description>SAN JOSE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - A total of 20 candidates are in the running to be Costa Rica's next president, but one right-wing populist candidate has taken a commanding lead in the polls. Laura Fernandez of the ruling Sovereign People's Party is hoping to win at least 40% of the vote to avoid an April runoff.

LAURA FERNANDEZ, 39, Sovereign People's Party (PPSO)

A protégé of the current president, Fernandez has vowed to champion tough policies to combat a surge in crime fueled by drug trafficking in the country. She has also called for changes to state pensions and reforming the judiciary and the constitution.

She has steadily risen in the polls and most show her with over 40% support, the threshold required to avoid a runoff.

A political scientist, Fernandez led the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Policy from 2022 to 2025 and briefly served as the president's chief of staff.

ALVARO RAMOS, 42, National Liberation Party (PLN)

Despite polling below 10%, economist Alvaro Ramos is viewed as one of the candidates who are most likely to reach a runoff.

He briefly oversaw the country's extensive network of public health clinics in 2022, but was dismissed from the job due to a feud with the president over salaries.

Ramos has promised to crack down on crime. But his political party, one of Costa Rica's most established, has struggled to regain its footing in recent elections.

CLAUDIA DOBLES, 45, Citizen Action Party (PAC)

Claudia Dobles, an architect and former researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is the wife of former President Carlos Alvarado, who served from 2018 to 2022.

She oversaw urban planning and decarbonization projects during her husband's administration, but her party suffered one of its worst electoral defeats following his presidency and was nearly wiped from the political scene.

ARIEL ROBLES, 34, Broad Front (FA)

A teacher and legislator from the left-wing Broad Front party, Ariel Robles is polling at just 4%, though his party is registering high levels of support in legislative races. Still, his party has mounted the strongest opposition against the ruling party in Congress and is trying to attract the youth vote, which is the largest portion of undecided voters.

JOSE MIGUEL AGUILAR, 47, Avanza

Despite polling at just about 3%, Aguilar has garnered widespread media attention for his marriage to a cousin of El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.

Aguilar has sharply criticized Costa Rica's president in televised debates, a notable development given the president's ideological alignment with Bukele, a hard-liner.

The other 15 candidates span the political spectrum and are polling below the margin of error. Most have joined the other opposition candidates in warning against the risk of an emerging authoritarian model championed by the election's frontrunner.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 13:01:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ALUOCBJA5VJLBEHGDM66OLXARQ.jpg?auth=99ac7866b822967137da114e0a63aa214b021967293554dd51e42a3339466988&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK and 23 other OSCE members launch probe into Georgia rights concerns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-23-other-osce-members-launch-probe-into-georgia-rights-concerns-2026-01-29/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 29 - Britain, Canada, Germany and 21 other OSCE members on Thursday said they would launch an expert mission to examine the deteriorating human rights situation in Georgia.

“However, our concerns about the Georgian authorities’ implementation of shared human‑dimension commitments and international human rights obligations have only increased,” the statement, published on the British government's website, said.

The state Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, said professional lapses by staff had contributed to a mass outbreak of a viral infection that led to 46 people being hospitalised. At least three people died as a result of the illness and six other deaths were under investigation.

The care home is just outside the city of Novokuznetsk, where the deaths of nine newborn babies in the space of nine days shortly after the New Year sparked outrage across Russia and spurred a criminal investigation into negligence.

In the latest case, the Investigative Committee said staff were being questioned, medical records had been seized and forensic tests were under way to determine the cause of the infection's spread.

The investigation is into "sanitary violations resulting in the deaths of patients".

The regional health ministry said earlier this month it had detected 46 cases of influenza type A among a sample of 128 residents of the care home, while two more people tested positive for pneumonia.

Those who died included a 21-year-old woman with cerebral palsy and a 19-year-old man, according to regional authorities.

Ilya Seredyuk, governor of the Kuzbass region of Siberia, called the news was devastating, and said a commission formed by the regional government had been working on site since January 24.

"Materials requiring review have been sent to law enforcement agencies," he said.

Kuzbass is a heavily industrial region of about 2.6 million people that accounts for much of Russia's coal production.

Average life expectancy there in 2023 was about 70.2 years, well below the national average of 73.1 and compared with an average of 81.5 in the European Union.

Official data released this month shows deaths from respiratory diseases among working-age people in Kuzbass rose between 2022 and 2024, while overall mortality rates were higher and fertility rates lower than federal averages.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 14:03:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark's King Frederik to visit Greenland in February</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmarks-king-frederik-visit-greenland-february-2026-01-29/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Denmark's King Frederik will travel to Greenland during the week starting February 16, he told journalists on Thursday.

Truckers in Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia began protests on Monday against the EU's new stricter implementation of its entry-exit system under which they face detention and deportation for exceeding Schengen visit limits.

The same day, EU spokesperson Markus Lamert said the bloc was working on a new visa strategy for highly mobile professions like truck drivers, athletes or artists, but the drivers have kept up the pressure.

At the Batrovci border crossing between Serbia and Croatia, an EU-member state, a mile-long column of trucks blocked the approach to the cargo terminal.

"I would personally like this to be over tomorrow..., but we will see what the European Commission will ... bring to us as a solution," said Dusan Andjelic, of the MS Transporter trucking company.

Blockades halted freight along the key corridor linking the EU to Turkey and the Middle East.

Serbia's Chamber of Commerce head Marko Cadez said 93% of exports from the four countries were blocked, causing daily damage of about 92 million euros ($109.95 million).

EU-based firms operating in or exporting to the region are also affected.

"For every company ... it is about 10,000 to 50,000 euros per day in penalties ... as they are not servicing customers," Cadez told Reuters in Belgrade.

In a letter sent on Wednesday to EU enlargement chief Marta Kos, Montenegro's President Jakov Milatovic urged consideration of Montenegrin transporters' daily needs.

On Thursday, Montenegrin truckers lifted a blockade of the Adriatic port of Bar that had stoked fear of fuel shortages .

Cadez said Serbia was seeking a meeting with the European Commission to discuss solutions like special visas or permits.

Chief Michael Petawabano, the leader of the Cree community, said in a Facebook post that all community buildings, schools and offices were closed and that police were conducting an active investigation.

"We ask all community members to remain calm, stay indoors, and cooperate fully with police as they conduct their investigation. We will provide updates as more information becomes available," he said.

A spokesperson for Quebec's provincial police force said that two men in their 30s were found dead on Wednesday night and that the incident appeared to be related to organized crime and drugs.

Mass violence and shootings are rare in Canada, which has stricter gun laws than the neighboring U.S.

Levels of violence in Canada's remote and marginalized First Nations, where living conditions are often poor, are higher than in the rest of the country.

A January 18 high-speed rail crash in southern Spain killed 45 people while a derailment two days later in Catalonia killed a train driver, sparking political and public scrutiny of rail safety, maintenance and infrastructure spending.

Oscar Puente, who was heckled by opposition lawmakers shouting "resign" when he walked up to the podium, said maintenance spending per kilometre had risen 66% since 2017 and was now at or above the European average.

France invests slightly more while Italy spends less, he said.

European Commission data and industry experts have questioned whether maintenance investment has kept pace with Spain's expanding rail network and rising passenger numbers, a view Puente rejected.

According to him, Spain had invested about 30 billion euros ($36 billion) less in rail infrastructure between 2010 and 2018 than it would have if pre-financial crisis spending levels had been maintained.

The conservative People's Party held power from 2011 to 2018, implementing across-the-board spending cuts amid the EU's push for austerity while Spain faced a severe public debt crisis following a housing bubble bust.

Total annual rail investment has jumped to around 5 billion euros ($6 billion) in 2025 from roughly 1.7 billion euros in 2017, said Puente, of the ruling Socialist Party.

Afghanistan's humanitarian situation is deteriorating sharply, with millions pushed into hunger by the loss of remittances, limited job opportunities and a sharp reduction in international assistance.

The two-year programme, backed by the United Nations and Asian Development Bank, will support more than 151,000 families, including Afghan returnees from Iran and Pakistan as well as people affected by recent earthquakes and floods.

The director of the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization, Qu Dongyu, said the project would address immediate food security needs but also aim to close Afghanistan's food production gap and create space for private sector recovery.

The FAO warned in a report that 17.4 million people are projected to face acute food insecurity in 2026, with 4.7 million affected by acute malnutrition.

More than 2.5 million Afghans have been expelled from Iran and Pakistan over the past year, according to the World Food Programme, swelling Afghanistan’s population by roughly a tenth and cutting off remittance income for many families.

Aid agencies say winter conditions, scarce jobs and funding shortfalls have further strained households, with the WFP warning that last year marked the biggest surge in malnutrition ever recorded in Afghanistan and that conditions are likely to worsen in 2026.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:06:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ETDF462DPBMBJNS6IX4QGDSYZM.jpg?auth=d128e61f47df173b45b8a5802aa3e88427e3317702d3d7fabcb1e7c43f46f8e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors widen fatal fire probe to local authorities, documents show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swiss-prosecutors-widen-fatal-fire-probe-local-authorities-documents-show-2026-01-29/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Swiss prosecutors have summoned a current and a former local official for questioning next month in a probe into a New Year bar fire that killed 40 people, and say the town's leaders could be liable for safety failures, documents showed on Thursday.

Prosecutors' inquiries initially focused on the French owners of "Le Constellation" bar, who are under investigation for crimes including suspected negligent homicide.

Most of those killed in the blaze in the Alpine resort of Crans-Montana were teenagers and some of the 116 people injured are still in hospital with severe burns.

Lawyers for the victims have sought an expansion of the probe to include local officials. Crans-Montana's mayor said the municipality had missed multiple annual safety checks.

Officials for the municipality did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It previously expressed regret over the tragedy and dropped its request to be a plaintiff in the case. That would have given the municipality the same status as the victims, access to case documents and, in theory, could have made it entitled to compensation.

The prosecutor's office for Valais declined comment.

The fire was one of the worst disasters in modern Swiss history and has tested relations with neighbouring Italy, which lost six of its nationals in the blaze. The tragedy has also sent chills through the lucrative tourism sector.

In their documents, prosecutors described the two new individuals called for hearings next month as "defendants" in the case, documents showed, and said past and present officials could be responsible for safety failings.

The head of security for Crans-Montana has been called for a hearing on February 6. The defendant's lawyer Nicolas Rivard said his client would reserve statements for prosecutors.

Prosecutors also called a former head of fire safety for the municipality on February 9, another document showed. Reuters could not immediately establish when the individual left the municipality or why.

"(They) will be present on the ninth in the state prosecutor's office," the individual's lawyer David Aioutz said.

Separately, Valais prosecutors sent a document on January 27 that formally rejected the town's request to be a plaintiff.

"There are...reasons to believe that the municipality failed in its duty to enforce the various regulations it was responsible for, intended to safeguard the lives and physical integrity of the bar's customers," it said.

"Failings could be attributable both to staff members and to members of the town council, past and present," it said.

Further hearings are also planned next month with bar owners Jacques and Jessica Moretti, who are not in custody . The couple has expressed grief over the tragedy and vowed to cooperate.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:07:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XLJ2GBF2JBIKPB4GLGL237WAKA.jpg?auth=f108747aa3467c796ac955038bbbd6f824ff4b74a561bd270bfba2e7c2bc88e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Russia has invited Ukraine's Zelenskiy to come to Moscow for peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-russia-has-invited-ukraines-zelenskiy-come-moscow-peace-talks-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that Russia had reiterated its invitation for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to come to Moscow for peace talks, as U.S.-led efforts to reach a deal to end the nearly four-year war in Ukraine intensify.

The Kremlin made its statement as the two countries carried out their latest exchange of war dead, and hours after it declined to comment on rumours that Moscow and Kyiv have agreed to stop striking each other's energy infrastructure.

Washington-mediated peace talks in Abu Dhabi last weekend have injected some new momentum into efforts to clinch a peace deal, but profound differences persist between the Russian and Ukrainian negotiating stances. Fierce fighting is still raging, while Kyiv battles debilitating power outages caused by recent missile strikes.

An unnamed U.S. official told Axios on Saturday that Zelenskiy and Russian President Vladimir Putin were "very close" to setting up a meeting after the U.S.-mediated talks.

A new round of Abu Dhabi talks between Russian and Ukrainian negotiating delegations is scheduled for Sunday, and U.S. President Donald Trump - who is pushing for a deal to end Europe's biggest conflict since World War Two - said on Tuesday that "very good things" were happening in the process.

Major disagreements remain though, including over who gets what territory in any deal, the potential presence of international peacekeepers or monitors in post-war Ukraine, and the fate of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, cited by the Interfax news agency, said on Thursday that Moscow had not yet received a response to its invitation for Zelenskiy to come to Moscow.

Zelenskiy rejected a similar invitation last year, saying he could not to go to the capital of a nation that was firing missiles at his country every day. He suggested at the time that Putin come to Kyiv instead.

Any meeting between Putin and Zelenskiy would need to be well prepared and results-oriented, Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said on Wednesday. He said Zelenskiy's safety would be guaranteed if he came to Moscow.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday described the two sides' disagreement over who gets what territory as the one central issue which was "very difficult" to resolve.

Russia wants Ukrainian forces to withdraw from the roughly 20% of Donetsk region which the Russian army does not control.

Kyiv has said it does not want to gift Moscow territory which Russia has not won on the battlefield and which could serve as a platform in future for Russian forces to push deeper into Ukraine.

Ushakov, the Kremlin aide, said on Thursday he didn't regard the land issue as the only key one left on the table.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov cast doubt on the viability of any security guarantees that Washington might be able to provide Ukraine as part of a deal, saying he doubted they could usher in an enduring peace if they were designed to keep Ukraine's current political leadership in power.

Meanwhile, Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya in southern Russia, called for more war rather than peace in comments that reflect a belief among hardliners that Moscow is winning on the battlefield.

"I believe the war must be taken to its conclusion," Kadyrov told reporters at the Kremlin.

Modest protests that began last month in Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic hardship unleashed long-suppressed wider grievances and swiftly escalated into the gravest existential threat to Iran's Shi'ite theocracy in nearly five decades, with protesters commonly calling for ruling clerics to step down.

Authorities cut internet access and stifled the unrest with overwhelming force that killed thousands, according to rights groups. Tehran blames "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the United States for the violence.

Within days, plainclothes security forces launched a campaign of widespread arrests accompanied by an intensified street presence based around checkpoints, according to five activists who spoke on condition of anonymity from inside Iran.

They said detainees had been placed in secret lockups.

"They are arresting everyone," one of the activists said. "No one knows where they are being taken or where they are being held. With these arrests and threats, they are trying to inject fear into society."

Similar accounts were given to Reuters by lawyers, medics, witnesses and two Iranian officials speaking on condition of anonymity to avoid retribution by security services.

They said the roundups appeared aimed at preventing any serious revival of protests by spreading fear just as the clerical establishment faces rising external pressure.

Uncertainty over the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic has lingered since U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that an "armada" was heading toward the country but that he hoped he would not have to use it.

On Wednesday, however, he doubled down on his threats by demanding Iran negotiate curbs on its nuclear programme, warning that any future U.S. attack would be "far worse" than one day of airstrikes last June on three nuclear sites.

Multiple Western and Middle Eastern sources told Reuters this week that Trump is weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces and leaders to inspire protesters, although Israeli and Arab officials said air power alone would not topple the clerical rulers.

One of the activists said security forces were detaining not only people accused of involvement in the latest unrest but also those arrested during protests in previous years, "even if they had not participated this time, plus members of their families".

The latest death toll compiled by the U.S.-based HRANA rights group stands at 6,373 - 5,993 protesters, 214 security personnel, 113 under-18s and 53 bystanders. Arrests stand at 42,486, according to HRANA.

Judiciary officials have warned that “those committing sabotage, burning public property and involved in armed clashes with security forces” could face death sentences.

Two Iranian officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed to Reuters that thousands of arrests had been carried out in the past few days.

They said many detainees were being held in unofficial detention sites, "including warehouses and other improvised locations", and the judiciary was acting quickly to process cases.

Iranian authorities declined to comment publicly on the number of arrests, or say where the unrest-related detainees were held. Authorities said on January 21 that 3,117 were killed in the unrest, including 2,427 civilians and security personnel.

Amnesty International reported on January 23 that "sweeping arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, bans on gatherings and attacks to silence families of victims mark the suffocating militarisation imposed in Iran by the Islamic Republic’s authorities in the aftermath of protest massacres".

Arrests are continuing across the sprawling country, from small towns to the capital, witnesses and activists said.

"They arrested my brother and my cousin a few days ago,” said a resident of northwestern Iran who asked not to be named.

"They stormed our home in plainclothes, searched the entire house, and took all the laptops and mobile phones. They warned us that if we make this public, they will arrest all of us."

More than 60% of Iran's 92 million people are under the age of 30. Although the latest protests were snuffed out by the security forces, clerical rulers will eventually risk more demonstrations if the heavy repression persists, according to rights activists.

Three Iranian lawyers told Reuters that dozens of families had approached them in recent days seeking help for relatives who had been detained.

"Many families are coming to us asking for legal assistance for their detained children,” one lawyer said. "Some of those arrested are under 18 - boys and girls."

Human rights groups have long said Iranian security organs use informal detention sites during periods of serious unrest, holding detainees without access to lawyers or family members for extended periods.

Five doctors told Reuters that protesters wounded during protests had been removed from hospitals by security forces and dozens of doctors had been summoned by authorities or warned against helping injured demonstrators.

Prison authorities denied holding wounded protesters.

"They have arrested many doctors and nurses who helped wounded protesters...They are arresting everyone," said one of the doctors.

Families of five detainees told Reuters the lack of information about their whereabouts itself had become a form of punishment.

"We don’t know where they are, whether they are still alive, or when we’ll see them,” said an Iranian man whose daughter was arrested.

"They took my child as if they were arresting a terrorist. My child protested because all young people (just) want to have a better life. My child is a young person who only took part in protests."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 15:07:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KF4KTQHCGRKELF4N5X635Q6GII.jpg?auth=e05cfdf6de4c77800a4ad9abb8351b0b963ae93c04779475a6406d1e22102894&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany aims to confiscate property seized in Lebanon ex-central bank chief probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/germany-aims-confiscate-property-seized-lebanon-ex-central-bank-chief-probe-2026-01-29/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 29 (Reuters) - German prosecutors have applied to a court to confiscate some 35 million euros ($42 million) worth of property they had seized in a money laundering investigation into the former governor of Lebanon's central bank and other defendants.

Several European countries including France, Germany and Luxembourg have been investigating whether tens of millions of dollars of the funds allegedly embezzled from the central bank were laundered in Europe.

The investigation is linked to Forry Associates, a company controlled by the brother of former Lebanese central banker Riad Salameh. The brothers - who deny any wrongdoing - were accused of using Forry to divert $330 million in public funds through commissions.

"My lawyer will challenge the case and will prove that these investments are of my own funds," Salameh told Reuters when asked to comment.

The case is separate from an indictmen t in Lebanon of Salameh, who headed the Lebanese Central Bank for three decades, and two lawyers on charges including embezzlement of public funds, forgery and illicit enrichment.

The banker was detained for some 13 months over alleged financial crimes committed during his tenure and released after paying $14 million record bail. He remains in Lebanon, is subject to a travel ban and has denied any wrongdoing.

As part of an extensive money laundering investigation against the ex-governor and four other defendants which started in mid-2021, the properties in Munich and Hamburg and shares in a real estate company in Duesseldorf have been seized, the Munich prosecutors said in a statement.

They added that the total value was about 35 million euros.

"In January 2026, the Munich prosecutor's office applied to the Munich regional court for the confiscation of the seized real estate and company shares," said the prosecutors.

The prosecutors' office could not say what would happen to the assets if the court granted the confiscation.

The Munich prosecutor's office said in February 2024 it had seized three commercial properties in Munich and Hamburg with a total value of about 28 million euros, and shares worth about seven million euros in a Duesseldorf-based property company, as part of the case.

Lebanese authorities have said they want to reclaim the confiscated assets to help recapitalize state coffers drained in the lead-up to the country’s 2019 financial collapse.

The preliminary investigation has been provisionally suspended due to the unknown whereabouts of the suspects, said the prosecutors in their statement, adding there was a presumption of innocence until any decision was made.

"President Trump and I, along with others in the administration, have recognised that certain improvements could and should be made. That's exactly what I'm doing here," he told reporters after the deaths in the northern city of Minneapolis.

Homan was speaking for the first time since the president sent him to Minneapolis to calm furious protests over the killing by federal agents of 37-year-old nurse Alex Pretti.

The border czar said federal agents were trying to act professionally but added: "If they don't, they'll be dealt with like any other federal agency. We have standards of conduct."

Pretti, an intensive care unit nurse, was shot multiple times on Saturday after being forced to the ground by camouflaged officers in a scuffle captured on video. His death came just weeks after federal agents shot dead fellow Minneapolis resident Renée Good.

"We're going to make sure we do targeted enforcement operations and I'll say it again: we are not surrendering our mission at all. We're just doing it smarter," Homan told the news conference.

"President Trump wants this fixed. And I'm going to fix it – with your help," he added.

Homan said immigration enforcement would reduce the number of officers in Minnesota but suggested this would happen only after "cooperation" from state officials.

But the clatter of single and double-deck trams along this century-and-a-half-old line – a source of civic pride and transport alike for tens of thousands of daily commuters in Egypt's second city – is soon to be stopped.

Next week, authorities are starting a sweeping renovation aimed at replacing the nearly 14-kilometer (9-mile) line's worn but beloved trams with a digitally controlled light rail system, one of the latest projects in a broader push to revamp Egypt’s road and rail networks under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

The National Authority for Tunnels says the renovations should roughly double current speed, cutting end-to-end travel time along a similar route by over half an hour, and boost passenger capacity.

While some commuters welcome the renovation plan, others worry that construction could ensnarl narrow streets, that ticket prices could jump, or that works, planned over two years, might have to be extended.

Some are mourning the loss of one of the Mediterranean city's most treasured features.

"It's not just a means of transport," said Fatma Hussein, 63, a retired agricultural engineer who has ridden the tram since her school days. "It's our memories ... our history. You can develop it, but why stop it? Why deprive employees, students and the people who use it all the time?"

Launched in the 1860s, the Raml line is a rare holdout of double-decker trams. Wide carriage windows frame Alexandria’s tree-lined streets, dilapidated apartment blocks and historic villas.

With standard tickets costing just five Egyptian pounds (about $0.10), it also remains an affordable option for workers, students and pensioners amid rising living costs.

Alexandrian novelist Alaa Khaled, who grew up near the tramline, recalls how he used to make rides into a game with his father, climbing between the tram's floors to see the city from different angles.

"Even now, I still take the whole journey and gaze at the villas and trees as a window onto the history of the city, or just sit down and read," he said.

Architect and urban mobility specialist Yasmin Kandil said she worried that the light rail project, which includes elevating parts of the line to bypass intersections, will prioritise vehicles and speed while distorting the city's aesthetics.

Residents' concerns have been fuelled by the recent suspension of the local Abu Qir rail line for conversion into a metro line, which commuters say worsened congestion and left travellers scrambling for alternatives.

Authorities say they will deploy replacement buses during the construction of the light rail to limit disruption. The National Authority for Tunnels, which manages the tram and its renovation, did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The European Investment Bank is providing 138 million euros ($165 million) for the project and lists the total cost at about 592 million euros ($708 million). France’s development agency is also providing financing.

Alexandria has another tram line, the City Line, which has newer trams and has yet to be slated for renovations.

But the loss of the Raml line will be "painful", said 52-year-old tram driver Mahmoud Ramadan, who has worked on the tram network since 1997 and said he met his wife on the job.

"Not everyone will understand," he said. "It's your home and your life for 30 years.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:03:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PJGZF4XODNOI3NWN3EGGA5HSX4.jpg?auth=60ca5cdc8eeca1a99c8cdba2b2fa83aeca0dc9c896f08694b9eaf1331124bdba&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hegseth expected to skip NATO ministers' meeting next month, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hegseth-expected-skip-nato-ministers-meeting-next-month-sources-say-2026-01-29/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is not expected to attend a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels next month, a U.S. official and a NATO diplomat told Reuters on Thursday.

Here are five reasons why:

Since becoming Japan's first female prime minister in October, Takaichi has won strong approval ratings. Despite a slip ahead of the election, several polls still put her support rate above 60%.

Backing for her ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), however, trails far behind at about 35%, fuelling doubts whether Takaichi's personal appeal will translate into votes for LDP candidates contesting the 465 seats at stake.

Polling shows Takaichi's strongest backing comes from younger voters rather than the older generations that have long formed the LDP’s electoral backbone. Recent surveys put her approval rating among voters under 30 more than 20 points higher than among those in their 70s.

But younger Japanese tend to vote far less than their older peers. For example, in the October 2024 lower house election in Tokyo, the capital, just 36% of those aged 21 to 24 voted, versus 71% of those aged 70 to 74.

For the first time in 26 years, the LDP is fighting a national election without former coalition partner Komeito, a party linked to the lay Buddhist Soka Gakkai movement, which says it has at least 8 million members in Japan.

Komeito's vote mobilisation has delivered dozens of seats to the LDP in past elections, particularly in urban areas. This time, it has joined the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan in a centrist bloc, potentially redirecting millions of votes away from the LDP.

The slate of as many as 190 candidates fielded by the far-right Sanseito party is the third largest in the fray, as the party looks to add to the two seats it has now.

Sanseito has targeted conservative LDP voters with pledges to toughen immigration and tackle rising prices. Its push follows a breakout performance in July's upper house election when it bled support from the LDP to win 14 seats.

Takaichi's mid-winter scheduling of the election breaks with a convention of polls held in milder months, particularly in autumn.

This is only the third February lower house election in the post-war era and the first since 1990. Heavy snowfall blanketing northern Japan could depress turnout and disrupt campaigning, particularly in rural areas, adding uncertainty in an already volatile race.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:10:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UE2BV23R3BIMVDUKQAMBHO2CD4.jpg?auth=915b24fcfbc402f2defc894a7a879f6f5fe339a16414ea04a7370f0e40cc0ab5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India should consider age-based curbs on social media, adviser says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-should-consider-age-based-limits-social-media-access-economic-adviser-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Jan 29 (Reuters) - India's chief economic adviser proposed age-based limits on access to social media platforms he said were "predatory" in their approach to keeping users online, signalling a potential blow to Meta and YouTube in their largest user market.

Such a shift would pull India in line with a growing global trend , after Australia became the first nation last year to ban social media for children younger than 16.

On Monday, France's National Assembly backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media and Britain, Denmark and Greece are studying the issue.

The adviser, V. Anantha Nageswaran, recommended in India's annual economic survey that families promote screen-time limits, device-free hours and shared offline activities.

"Policies on age-based access limits may be considered, as younger users are more vulnerable to compulsive use and harmful content," he wrote in the survey, which was published on Thursday.

"Platforms should be made responsible for enforcing age verification and age-appropriate defaults."

The recommendations are not binding, but are reflected in policy discussions in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Past recommendations have prompted tax reforms, easing rules on Chinese investment and stronger digital infrastructure.

India, the world's No. 2 smartphone market with 750 million devices and a billion internet users, is a key growth market for social media apps, and does not set a minimum age for access.

Research firm DataReportal says YouTube has 500 million users in India, Facebook 403 million, while Instagram has 481 million.

Facebook operator Meta (META.O) , opens new tab , YouTube-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab and X did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Meta has previously said it backs laws for parental oversight while adding: "Governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites."

New Delhi has repeatedly clashed with social media companies like Meta and X over the years over content moderation, local data storage, user safety and not complying with content takedown orders promptly.

In a press briefing, Nageswaran on Thursday called the platforms "predatory" in their approach to maximise user engagement and time spent by users, adding that "such algorithms are particularly targeted at youngsters between the ages of 15 and 24."

Cheap telecom data plans have boosted use of social media apps in recent years, with 75% of young smartphone users on the apps, the survey report said.

"Digital addiction negatively affects academic performance and workplace productivity due to distractions, 'sleep debt', and reduced focus," Nageswaran added.

The recommendation follows growing efforts among Indian states to rein in screen time for young people.

The coastal state of Goa and the southern state of Andhra Pradesh have said they are studying Australia's regulatory framework, with an eye to similar bans for children.

"Trust in social media is breaking down," Nara Lokesh, the infotech minister in Andhra Pradesh, wrote on X on Thursday, saying the state would study legal frameworks for age-appropriate access.

"Children are slipping into relentless usage, affecting their attention spans and education."

Nageswaran said "we are very happy" the two states are considering restrictions for children.

Some activists and tech experts have called for measures to help children and parents develop healthy and safe social media usage, saying that age-based curbs do not work as children can bypass them with fake identification documents.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:10:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TOGRB4KN35IR5FBTH3H6XN32B4.jpg?auth=9287b2d7d311bb673b553568c4c7aa54011dc67828590c2c45f89e3ec0091cb6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia is ready to evacuate its staff from Iran's Bushehr nuclear plant if necessary, TASS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-is-ready-evacuate-its-staff-irans-bushehr-nuclear-plant-if-necessary-tass-2026-01-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Russia is ready to evacuate its staff from Iran's Bushehr nuclear power plant if necessary, Alexei Likhachev, the head of Russia's state nuclear corporation, was cited as saying on Thursday by the state news agency TASS.

President Vladimir Putin said last year that hundreds of Russians were working at the facility, Iran's only operating nuclear power plant, which Moscow built for Iran.

More nuclear facilities are currently being built at the Bushehr site by Russia.

A U.S. strike on Iran's nuclear facilities in June last year did not target Bushehr. Likhachev warned at the time that an attack on the site could trigger a catastrophe comparable to the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

On Wednesday U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran to come to the table and make a deal renouncing nuclear weapons, or the next U.S. attack would be far worse.

Likhachev was quoted as saying: "We sincerely hope that the parties to the conflict will uphold their commitments regarding the inviolability of this territory (Bushehr).

"But, as they say, we are keeping our finger on the pulse and, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence, we will be ready to carry out evacuation measures if necessary."

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons, and Russia says it supports Tehran's right to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 16:11:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B3X5K3CYBFPG7FRK3B6BI7X4IQ.jpg?auth=d701f6a3aa341163cd2264b3de8fe952eb2986b6515a87e05a9e1dd82c99c75b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hegseth expected to skip NATO ministers' meeting next month, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hegseth-expected-skip-nato-ministers-meeting-next-month-sources-say-2026-01-29/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is not expected to attend a meeting of NATO defence ministers in Brussels next month, a U.S. official and a NATO diplomat told Reuters on Thursday.

Its second moon claim was featured in a post that garnered more than 16,000 reactions. The claim was also widely circulated on X , with some posts garnering more than 3 million views.

To illustrate this claim, the posts feature an image generated by artificial intelligence showing the Earth with two moons of roughly the same size, suggesting the existence of a new heavenly body similar to the Moon currently in orbit around our planet.

The confusion seems to hail from the discovery made last July by researchers at the Complutense University in Madrid of a small asteroid baptised "2025 PN7". This asteroid was first spotted through the Pan-STARRS1 telescope at the Observatory in Haleakala, Hawaii. While it has an Earth-like orbit, that does not make it a “temporary second moon”.

Our team spoke to Éric Lagadec, an astrophysicist at the Côte d’Azur Observatory:

"'2025 PN7' isn’t a new moon. A moon orbits around a planet that it is linked to by gravity, like our moon that orbits Earth. This asteroid, however, is not orbiting our planet. It is what is called a "quasi-moon" or a "quasi-satellite": it orbits the sun, but its trajectory follows Earth’s trajectory, which gives the impression that it is following it."

According to NASA , "moons orbit planets and dwarf planets. They also orbit asteroids". 2025 PN7, on the other hand, doesn’t orbit the Earth; it orbits the sun (see the image below or check out NASA’s Small-Body Database Lookup (SBDB) , which has information about so-called small bodies within our solar system).

The asteroid, which has a diameter of around 19 metres, isn’t gravitationally linked to the Earth – unlike the moon. It doesn’t have any impact on our planet – for example, it has no bearing on the tides, unlike our moon. It also isn’t visible to the naked eye from Earth.

Lagadec says that the confusion stems largely from images shared by some social media users, which depict the asteroid as a similar size to our moon. In reality, our moon has a diameter of around 3,400 kilometres, while 2025 PN7’s diameter is only 19 metres .

"This type of image can feed into conspiracy theories about the moon,” Lagadec said.

"Repression cannot go unanswered," foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X. "Any regime that kills thousands of its own people is working toward its own demise."

"This will put them on the same footing with al-Qaeda, Hamas, Daesh," Kallas said earlier, using an Arabic acronym for the Islamic State (IS) group. "If you act as a terrorist, you should also be treated as a terrorist."

The 27-nation bloc on Thursday also sanctioned 15 Iranian officials, including top commanders of the Revolutionary Guards, over the violent crackdown on protesters that has left thousands dead .

Iran had no immediate comment, but it has criticised Europe in recent days as it considered the move. Other countries, including the US and Canada, have designated the Guard as a terrorist organisation.

The latest EU measures, while largely symbolic, add to international pressures on the Islamic Republic, which faces a threat of military action from US President Donald Trump in response to the killing of peaceful demonstrators and over possible mass executions.

The American military has moved the USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers into the Mideast. It remains unclear whether Trump will decide to use force.

Sansal, who was pardoned by Algeria's president last November after spending a year in jail, joins the 40 lifelong members of the Académie, traditionally known as the " immortels " (immortals).

The writer was a late contender for the seat left vacant by the late lawyer and writer Jean-Denis Bredin, after no candidate won a majority in an earlier vote in December.

Other candidates included Belgian poet Philippe Leuckx.

Known as the guardian of the French language , the Académie is tasked with maintaining the language's purity and publishes an official dictionary.

In early December, the Académie honoured Sansal at a ceremony where he received the international literary award the Cino del Duca World Prize for his work.

In 2015, he won the Académie's Grand Prix du Roman for his book "2084: The End of the World", a dystopian novel inspired by George Orwell's "1984" and set in an Islamist totalitarian world in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust.

Sansal's novels warning of the risks of creeping authoritarianism but also Islamisation have made him a favourite on the right in France but deeply unpopular with the authorities in his country of birth.

Algeria handed Sansal a five-year jail term in March on charges of undermining its territorial integrity after arresting him in November last year on arrival from France.

His detention was seen by supporters as a consequence of a political row between Algeria and France over sovereignty of the territory of the Western Sahara , where Paris backs the claim of Algiers' north African rival Morocco .

Weeks before his arrest, Sansal told a far-right French media outlet that France had unjustly transferred Moroccan territory to Algeria during the 1830-1962 colonial period.

Even after Sansal's release, prominent French sports journalist Christophe Gleizes remains in an Algerian prison, sentenced to seven years for "glorifying terrorism" for having sought to interview an outlawed group.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 17:07:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4e96d35a-fd2a-11f0-a1bb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-943E4RE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Merz says Germany exploring shared nuclear umbrella with European allies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/merz-says-germany-exploring-shared-nuclear-umbrella-with-european-allies-2026-01-29/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 29 (Reuters) - European nations are starting to discuss ideas around a shared nuclear umbrella to complement existing security arrangements with the U.S., German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said, amid growing talk in Germany of developing its own nuclear defences.

Merz, speaking at a time of increased transatlantic tensions as U.S. President Donald Trump upends traditional alliances, said the talks were only at an initial stage and no decision was imminent.

"We know that we have to reach a number of strategic and military policy decisions, but at the moment, the time is not ripe," he told reporters on Thursday.

Germany is currently banned from developing a nuclear weapon of its own under the so-called Four Plus Two agreement that opened the way for the country's reunification in 1990 as well as under a landmark nuclear non-proliferation treaty that Germany signed in 1969.

Merz said Germany's treaty obligations did not prevent it from discussing joint solutions with partners, including Britain and France, the only European powers which have a nuclear arsenal.

"These talks are taking place. They are also not in conflict with nuclear-sharing with the United States of America," he said.

European nations have long relied heavily on the United States, including its large nuclear arsenal, for their defence but have been increasing military spending, partly in response to sharp criticism from the Trump administration.

Trump has rattled Washington's European allies with his talk of acquiring Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally, and his threat, later rescinded, to impose tariffs on countries that stood in his way.

He has also suggested in the past that the U.S. would not help protect countries that failed to spend enough on their own defence.

Merz's comments were echoed by the head of the parliamentary defence committee, Thomas Roewekamp, who said Germany had the technical capacity which could be used in developing a European nuclear weapon.

"We do not have missiles or warheads, but we do have a significant technological advantage that we could contribute to a joint European initiative," Roewekamp, from Merz's centre-right Christian Democratic Union party, told Germany's Welt TV.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:03:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UV2Z3CG7CJOLXMMJELNHY4OVO4.jpg?auth=69a6ec5a33dfb297ab4168362665dd84d6bf1ff462225c7a2a6ffa98ceca136a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says U.S. to open Venezuela airspace after talk with acting president</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-says-us-open-venezuela-airspace-after-talk-with-acting-president-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he planned on opening up Venezuela's air space after a discussion on Thursday with the country's acting president Delcy Rodríguez.

Ai, speaking to Reuters in London, said he has previously argued that Western leaders visiting China should openly denounce the country's human rights abuses before striking business deals with the world's second-largest economy.

"But today I changed my mind, completely," Ai said. "The West (is) not even (in a) position to accuse China. (They must) just check on their record (of) what they did on international human rights, (their) freedom of speech record."

Ai's remarks come as Keir Starmer makes a four-day visit to China , the first by a UK leader in eight years, aimed at improving relations despite concerns over espionage and human rights.

Ai, in London hosting events for his new book "Censorship", said Western leaders raising issues such as human rights, free speech and censorship would be seen as deeply hypocritical and would "make people laugh".

He pointed to how the West handled the case of Julian Assange, who returned to Australia in June 2024 after a plea deal ended his imprisonment and a 14-year legal battle over the release of classified U.S. military files.

As he arrived in Beijing on Wednesday, Starmer said he would "raise the issues that need to be raised" on human rights with China's president, Xi Jinping, including the case of Jimmy Lai, a former Hong Kong media tycoon and British citizen convicted in December of national security crimes.

Ai said he has also faced censorship in the West, including a London gallery's decision to postpone one of his exhibitions in 2023 over a social media post about the war in Gaza.

"I think they (Western leaders) are shy even to talk about those things (human rights)," Ai said.

Nevertheless, Ai said that, based on business interests, Starmer's decision to visit to China was "rational and practical". He called it a "very good move" that would benefit Britain and be well received in China.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:03:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YJ7QQZ7CCZOATPGK6D3PRRCEJU.jpg?auth=38fbd0011c46ef438674f6f3726e582a808bf56204861342551c2dfd85fff728&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico's Sheinbaum, Trump talk trade as USMCA review approaches</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/mexicos-sheinbaum-says-she-had-productive-call-with-trump-trade-2026-01-29/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke on Thursday about trade and security, as both governments geared up for high-stakes negotiations later this year about their trilateral trade deal with Canada.

Both leaders said the call was productive.

The call follows a Wednesday meeting in Washington between Sheinbaum's economy chief and the U.S. trade representative, who agreed to begin formal discussions on possible reforms to the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

"There is nothing concrete, but it is coming along very well," Sheinbaum said about the trade deal in her morning press conference. She noted progress on the Trump administration's demand that Mexico address what Washington calls "non-tariff barriers" to trade.

Trump, in a Truth Social post, praised Sheinbaum as Mexico's "wonderful and highly intelligent leader." He said the conversation went well.

Under the trilateral trade deal, which was negotiated during Trump's first term, the U.S., Mexico and Canada must launch a joint review of the trade pact by July 1, its sixth anniversary, to confirm their intention to renew it for 16 years or make modifications.

The USMCA deal replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020 and is a backbone of Mexico's economy. It has shielded Mexico from the bulk of Trump's tariffs, as goods that comply with its rules of origin can enter the U.S. duty-free.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, however, has said the deal has "shortcomings," and is not equipped to deal with surges of exports and investment from non-market economies such as China into the region. Trump this month said the USMCA was "irrelevant" for the U.S. despite a highly integrated North American economy.

While the presidents did not go into detail about what they discussed regarding security, Sheinbaum said both agreed things are going "very well."

Washington's desires for a more active role combating drug cartels in Mexican territory - resisted by Sheinbaum who cites Mexico's opposition to foreign interference in law enforcement - have at times been a sticking point in trade talks.

The FBI's reported involvement in arresting Canadian former snowboarder Ryan Wedding on drug charges in Mexico last week has further heightened tension between the U.S. and Mexico on the issue of security.

Two topics - Cuba and critical minerals - were not brought up on the call, said Sheinbaum. She stressed, however, that the two governments are discussing the issues.

Mexico's oil shipments to Cuba have come under scrutiny in Washington after Trump vowed to stop the flow of oil and money to Cuba from Venezuela, until recently Cuba's other main supplier of crude oil.

Sheinbaum this week appeared to acknowledge that Mexico had halted a planned shipment to Cuba, but said decisions about shipments are a sovereign matter and that Mexico would continue to provide humanitarian aid to Cuba in the form of oil.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:03:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FMU6RP6U4JJYRD2W4TQWHZWATU.jpg?auth=54176e7ac35178a7d57f9cb0829dea90cc6f9224376691411ec9f1595136b205&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's NSA pick endorses post-9/11 surveillance powers, stays vague on warrants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-nsa-pick-endorses-post-911-surveillance-powers-stays-vague-warrants-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Army Lieutenant General Joshua Rudd, President Donald Trump 's pick to head the National Security Agency, said on Thursday he is in favor of keeping broad foreign surveillance powers introduced following the September 11, 2001, attacks.

But when it came to whether he would seek a warrant before turning those powers against Americans, Rudd had less to say at his confirmation hearing before a U.S. Senate committee.

Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows the NSA to surveil foreigners abroad using data drawn from U.S. digital infrastructure.

The provision for years has caused anxieties over domestic surveillance because it can allow the NSA's law enforcement counterparts to mine the massive data trove without a warrant. A 2024 proposal to require them to get a judicial sign-off before searching the data failed in the House of Representatives by a single vote.

With the power up for congressional renewal in April, the contours of Section 702's powers are again being put up for debate.

Rudd endorsed Section 702 - enacted as part of changes in U.S. intelligence policies following the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on the United States - during testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee.

"It's indispensable," Rudd told lawmakers. "It's critical to mission outcomes."

Asked by Democratic Senator Ron Wyden whether he would insist on a judicial warrant before targeting people in the United States for surveillance, Rudd said that "if confirmed, I will absolutely commit to executing the foreign intelligence mission of the NSA in accordance with the authorities that it has been given and in accordance with all applicable laws."

Wyden expressed dissatisfaction, telling Rudd, "That is about as vague as anything I've heard on the subject."

When Republican Senator John Cornyn returned to the matter of seeking warrants at the end of the hearing, Rudd stuck to his noncommittal tone.

"That's certainly something I'd like to take a deeper look at," Rudd said.

Rudd, nominated by Trump last month, currently serves as the No. 2 at the U.S. military's Indo-Pacific Command, which is responsible for U.S. forces in the greater Pacific region. The NSA is an agency within the Defense Department tasked with monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for global intelligence and counterintelligence purposes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:04:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DIM6L3CYG5MTJKSCDDML4I6AJM.jpg?auth=9ad75421842b384e9f46bfda9b43d29de7a0d0fa21cd010906918c22567870c1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>American Airlines plans to resume US flights to Venezuela pending government approval</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/american-airlines-plans-resume-us-flights-venezuela-pending-government-approval-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - American Airlines said Thursday the U.S. carrier plans to resume daily service to Venezuela pending government approval and subject to security assessments just weeks after the U.S. military seized the country's leader.

Although Guterres did not reference any particular country, his remarks come a week after U.S. President Donald Trump launched his Board of Peace. This was initially designed to cement Gaza's rocky ceasefire, but Trump foresees it taking a wider role, an approach that worries some global powers.

"Global problems will not be solved by one power calling the shots. Nor will they be solved by two powers carving the world into rival spheres of influence," Guterres told a press conference to mark the start of his 10th and final year in office.

Trump, who began his second term a year ago, is resuscitating what much of the international community had long spurned as an outdated worldview – spheres of influence carved out by the big powers. He has vowed to restore U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Guterres’ second five-year term has been marked by Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine , the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the conflict in Sudan, the war between Israel and Palestinian militants Hamas in the Gaza Strip, a rapid end to Syria's civil war and the U.S. capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro.

"International law is trampled. Cooperation is eroding. And multilateral institutions are under assault on many fronts," said Guterres. "Impunity is driving today’s conflicts – fueling escalation, widening mistrust, and kicking the doors open for powerful spoilers to enter from every direction."

Guterres spoke to reporters amid a cash crisis as the world body's largest contributor - the United States - has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies and refused to make mandatory payments to the U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets. He launched a reform task force in March, known as UN80, which seeks to cut costs and improve efficiency.

Trump has described the U.N. as having "great potential" but said it is not fulfilling that, slamming it for failing to support American-led peace efforts.

"Despite all the hurdles, the United Nations is acting to give life to our shared values," Guterres said. "And we won’t give up. We are pushing for peace – just and sustainable peace rooted in international law. Peace that addresses root causes. Peace that endures beyond the signing of an agreement."

Guterres also had a warning for the world on technology. He has made pushing for a governance framework for artificial intelligence a priority.

"We are witnessing perhaps the greatest transfer of power of our times – not from governments to people, but from governments to private technology companies," he said. "When technologies that shape behavior, elections, markets, and even conflicts operate without guardrails, the reaction is not innovation, it is instability."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:04:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SXN7YX5CRFPVBFCW3MJOS4YYGI.jpg?auth=d6b651bbb7e08fadf6d18efb5a3beb717345f0717d9c65db4bb30679be3dac14&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil police arrest suspect with ties to Islamic State, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-police-arrest-suspect-with-ties-islamic-state-source-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Brazil's federal police arrested on Thursday a suspect with ties to Islamic State accused of preparing a suicide attack, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The company was still scrambling Thursday to explain the deal for a tool to identify and track foreigners on US soil, which it says was signed by an arm's-length subsidiary set up to bid on classified US government work, with limited oversight from HQ in France.

Nevertheless, "according to the information made known to the group, that contract awarded in December 2025 is not currently being fulfilled", Capgemini told AFP by email.

An internal message sent to Capgemini staff Wednesday and seen by AFP said that the contract was "subject to legal challenge" without providing details, adding that the US arm had "launched a process of examining the contents of this contract".

The killings of two people – Renée Good and Alex Pretti – by ICE and border patrol (CBP) agents in Minneapolis have made world headlines in recent weeks, provoking widespread condemnation of the American agency.

Capgemini, which operates in around 50 countries worldwide and belongs to the CAC40 group of France's largest listed companies, has called an extraordinary board meeting for this weekend after being the subject of pointed questions in parliament and calls for transparency from the government.

"I've been at Capgemini for 32 years and I've never seen a crisis situation like this one," CFDT union delegate Frédéric Boloré told AFP. "It's a huge shock for employees."

Shares in the group fell 2.8 percent to €127.85 ($152.70), by close of trading in Paris Thursday, and are 10 percent lower than at the start of the year.

Campaign group Multinationals Observatory last week revealed the ICE contract, with further details reported by broadcaster France 2.

Chief executive Aiman Ezzat wrote on LinkedIn Sunday that bosses "were recently made aware, through public sources" of the contract with Capgemini Government Solutions (CGS), the US subsidiary.

At CGS, "decision making is separate, networks are firewalled, and the Capgemini group cannot access any classified information (or) classified contracts", Ezzat added.

Public US government documents show that the ICE-CGS contract signed on December 18 is worth $4.8 million.

"I think the least we can expect of a French company... is to be transparent about the contracts it has with ICE, but perhaps also to call them into question," Economy Minister Roland Lescure told journalists in Paris Thursday.

Ezzat acknowledged in his LinkedIn message that "the nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm".

But CGT union representative Benjamin Girard said the ICE contract's existence was not a "revelation" to him.

"Capgemini works with government organisations playing a part in migration policies that are currently quite authoritarian," he said.

In a letter to CEO Ezzat, CGT representatives said that the ICE deal was "not only contrary to Capgemini's stated values, but makes our company an active accomplice in serious human rights violations".

France 2 has reported that the company has other contracts in the US tied to surveillance of sites used for detention and transport of arrested foreigners.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 18:06:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/580b98f6-fd36-11f0-82b8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/4f16a6f226e456bb1456e67f32b988d53cdce7bc.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief 'deeply concerned' by escalation of violence in South Sudan, spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/un-chief-deeply-concerned-by-escalation-violence-south-sudan-spokesperson-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>Jan 29 (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres is "deeply concerned" by continued escalation of violence in South Sudan, a spokesperson said on Thursday, while reiterating the world body chief's call to protect civilians.

The use of drones by the fighters from Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) in recent attacks has marked a significant escalation in the violence in the region, military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Sani Uba said.

The militants struck the Sabon Gari base before dawn, storming the perimeter and briefly breaching part of the facility, Uba said.

While they were fighting, their drone bombardment destroyed several military vehicles, including an excavator and a low-bed trailer, he added.

The army regained control after reinforcements arrived, repelled the attack and were pursuing the militants, Uba said.

Some soldiers and Civilian Joint Task Force members "paid the supreme price," he said, without giving details on the numbers.

Two security sources told Reuters at least nine soldiers and two task force members were killed, with around 16 others wounded.

Nigeria's military has pushed deeper into insurgent strongholds in the northeast this year as part of a renewed offensive against militant groups.

But despite repeated operations, Boko Haram and its splinter faction ISWAP continue to mount large-scale attacks, exploiting difficult terrain, porous borders and a weak state presence across parts of the arid northeast.

Borno, where Boko Haram and ISWAP fighters have intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:11:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S. sends additional warship to Middle East amid Iran tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-sends-additional-warship-middle-east-amid-iran-tensions-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy has sent an additional warship to the Middle East, a U.S. official told Reuters on Thursday, amid a large military buildup in the region and soaring tensions.

Plainclothes Iranian security forces have rounded up thousands of people in a campaign of mass arrests and intimidation to deter further protests after crushing the bloodiest unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, sources told Reuters .

Modest protests that began last month in Tehran's Grand Bazaar over economic hardship unleashed long-suppressed wider grievances and swiftly escalated into the gravest existential threat to Iran's Shi'ite theocracy in nearly five decades, with protesters commonly calling for ruling clerics to step down.

Authorities cut internet access and stifled the unrest with overwhelming force that killed thousands, according to rights groups. Tehran blames "armed terrorists" linked to Israel and the United States for the violence.

The latest death toll compiled by the U.S.-based HRANA rights group stands at 6,373. Arrests stand at 42,486, according to HRANA.

The IOC told Reuters in a statement, which was supported by the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations and the Winter Olympic Federations, about its concerns for the situation facing Iranian athletes.

"At this moment in time, we are particularly concerned about the situation of Iranian athletes impacted by the events unfolding in their country - as we are with all athletes who face conflict and tragedies elsewhere in the world," the IOC said.

"Unfortunately, these situations are more regularly brought to our attention due to the increasingly divided world in which we live.

"We have to be realistic about the IOC's ability to directly influence global and national affairs. At the same time, we will continue to work with our Olympic stakeholders to help where we can, often through quiet sport diplomacy."

Iran International, a Persian-language satellite television channel and multilingual digital news operation based in London, reported last week that a 19-year-old wrestler, Shahab Fallahpour, was killed by security forces during demonstrations in the southwestern city of Andimeshk.

United World Wrestling said it had also been alerted to concerns over the safety of several Iranian wrestlers.

"United World Wrestling has received multiple communications regarding the situation of four Iranian wrestlers...," the international governing body for the sport said.

"As a sporting organisation, UWW is not in a position to directly influence global or national affairs.

"However, we are particularly concerned about the situation of Iranian athletes impacted by the events unfolding in their country, as we are with all athletes worldwide who are affected by conflict and tragedy.

"UWW is seeking further reliable information and reiterates its commitment to the protection of athletes and respect for fundamental sporting values."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:51:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MPZB5T25UZLJTMVY75KFLP5ABI.jpg?auth=6f5e780d35f4b5914acb97ca619717d96504be2c5f0878657cb2c6d79cc7e80c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hegseth tells Trump Pentagon is prepared on Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/hegseth-tells-trump-pentagon-is-prepared-iran-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Thursday the U.S. military will be prepared to carry out whatever President Donald Trump decides on Iran to ensure Tehran does not pursue nuclear weapons capability.

With a large U.S. military force gathered in the region, Hegseth was asked by Trump at a cabinet meeting to comment on the situation.

"They should not pursue nuclear capabilities. We will be prepared to deliver whatever this president expects of the War Department," Hegseth said, referring to the Trump administration's unofficial renaming of the Defense Department.

U.S. officials say Trump is reviewing his options but has not decided whether to strike Iran.

U.S.-Iranian tensions soared following a bloody crackdown on protests across Iran by its clerical authorities in recent weeks.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations over economic privations and political repression have since abated.

He has said the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear program after the June airstrikes by Israeli and U.S. forces on key nuclear installations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:54:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HFXVBXSLDZPPPIJN4A2PUVJRAQ.jpg?auth=1a0df4661c7a5227cefa67bc937f8534715bba0116da453e8a658ad3a5917e73&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Warships and fighter jets: What is the 'massive' US armada on its way to Iran?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260129-warships-fighter-jets-what-is-massive-us-armada-on-way-to-iran</link><description>US President Trump Donald Trump amped up the pressure on Iran on Wednesday, posting on the Truth Social platform that “ A massive Armada is heading to Iran .”

The deployment comes a month after a sharp rise in the cost of living and the plummeting rial currency prompted protests that swiftly evolved into a crisis of legitimacy for the country's clerical leadership.

The US strike group is "currently deployed to the Middle East to promote regional security and stability", US Central Command said in a post on X . The strike group was in the Indian Ocean , Central Command said, and not in the Arabian Sea that borders Iran.

Iran's army chief Amir Hatami on Thursday responded by vowing a "crushing response" to any US attack. "In accordance with the threats we are facing, maintaining and enhancing strategic advantages for rapid combat and a crushing response to any invasion ... is always on the army's agenda," Iran's Tasnim news quoted him as saying.

According to Trump’s social media post, the US fleet is "ready, willing, and able to rapidly fulfil its mission, with speed and violence, if necessary".

The armada is headed by the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier – one of 10 nuclear-powered US aircraft carriers, known as the Nimitz class, the largest category of warships in the world, according to the US Navy.

The massive vessels are 333 metres long and can hold more than 65 aircraft and multiple missile mounts. Each of the 10 existing Nimitz-class vessels costs $4.5 billion and the Abraham Lincoln can support a crew of up to 5,680 people .

Despite their huge size, these juggernauts are designed for exceptional speed over extended periods. They can travel at more than 30 knots, or 56km/h (35mph), a speed at which it can still manoeuvre quickly to evade attacks.

The carriers can also host squadrons of stealth aircraft, including Lockheed Martin’s F-35 Lightning II fighter jets and Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jets, according to AP . Hundreds of missiles of different varieties may also be aboard, including Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, as well as the NATO Sea Sparrow , an anti-missile and aircraft weapon system.

Analysts following flight-tracking data have noticed that dozens of US military cargo planes are also heading to the region.

The deployment is similar to that seen last year, AP reported , when US air defence hardware was moved to the region in case of Iranian retaliation for the US bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites during the Iran-Israel war in June.

At least three destroyers are accompanying the USS Abraham Lincoln: the USS Frank E. Petersen Jr., known for its missile-launch systems; the USS Spruance, with advanced radar and sensor capabilities; and the USS Michael Murphy, a more recent version of the Spruance.

The Abraham Lincoln might also be carrying additional equipment, like the AN/SLQ-25A Nixie decoy system, which uses sound to prevent underwater torpedoes from tracking a ship.

The mobilisation suggests that Trump’s repeated threats to strike Iran may crystalise.

Tehran is responding with its own threats. Its mission to the United Nations hit back in a post on X , saying first that the country "stands ready for dialogue based on mutual respect and interests" before adding: "BUT IF PUSHED, IT WILL DEFEND ITSELF AND RESPOND LIKE NEVER BEFORE!"

The Iranian regime has blamed the widespread public unrest and demonstrations – seen as the biggest threat to the regime since the 1979 revolution – on Israel and the United States. “We find the US President guilty due to the casualties, damages and slander he inflicted upon the Iranian nation,” Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei wrote on X .

The US president has continued to ramp up the pressure in recent weeks and has repeatedly advocated for new leadership and an end to Khamenei’s 37-year reign. But the primary reason for US military intervention would likely be to curb Iran’s nuclear programme.

What the White House is asking of Tehran has often vacillated , with Trump's threats at one point being tied to demands not to hang protesters before shifting to its nuclear programme .

Trump has criticised the regime’s crackdown on its people, calling on them to keep protesting while asserting in mid-January that, " h elp is on its way ".

Trump on Thursday warned that " time is running out " and demanded that Iran "negotiate a fair and equitable deal – NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS" in a post on Truth Social.

A source told Reuters on Thursday that any US strikes might target the ballistic missiles that can reach US allies in the Middle East as well as Iran's nuclear enrichment programmes.

Concern over a possible military confrontation is spreading globally, with the Kremlin saying any ​use of force against Tehran could create " chaos " in the region and urging talks while Turkey has offered to mediate .

Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem said Monday that any attack on its ally Iran would be considered an attack on the militant group , and warned that a conflict " will ignite the region ".

EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said Thursday that the already volatile Middle East "does not need a new war".

The sharpening rhetoric between Washington and Tehran comes at a volatile moment in the region, and Iranians find themselves caught in the crossfire.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency places the number of deaths in the Iranian protests at more than 6,000 people, including 5,925 protesters, since December, adding that it is investigating another 17,000 reported deaths. Another group – Norway-based Iran Human Rights – has warned that the final toll could exceed 25,000 .

Repeated internet shutdowns and communications blockades have prevented the collection of exact figures, and Iranian state-run media remains one of the main sources of news coming out of the country.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 19:56:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/76303c76-fd20-11f0-8b6b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029228722760.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Burkina Faso military government dissolves political parties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/burkina-faso-military-government-dissolves-political-parties-2026-01-29/</link><description>DAKAR, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Burkina Faso's military-led government has dissolved all political parties and scrapped the legal framework governing their operations, according to a decree approved by the West African nation's council of ministers on Thursday.

The decision by the military rulers who seized power in September 2022 is the latest move to tighten control following the suspension of political activities after the coup.

Burkina Faso's Interior Minister Emile Zerbo said the decision was part of a broader effort to "rebuild the state" after what he said was widespread abuses and dysfunction in the country's multiparty system.

He said a government review found that the multiplication of political parties had fuelled divisions and weakened social cohesion.

Before the coup, the country had over 100 registered political parties, with 15 represented in parliament after the 2020 general election.

The decree disbands all political parties and political formations. A law repealing the statutes and regulating party financing, and the status of the opposition leader, will be sent to the current transitional council, according to minutes of the cabinet meeting.

All the assets of the dissolved parties will be transferred to the state.

The Sahel nation, like neighbours Mali and Niger, has been struggling to contain Islamist insurgencies linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State that have killed thousands and displaced millions over the past decade.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 20:32:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E3ZX4XZZY5KGTHIVTNVGOCNL4Q.jpg?auth=3df07cfaa935aa1829ff3abf7d0dd3b8709b6e949235dae12fd6823e3389c086&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney says he expects US administration to respect Canadian sovereignty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/carney-says-he-expects-us-administration-respect-canadian-sovereignty-2026-01-29/</link><description>OTTAWA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, asked about reports that U.S. officials had met separatists seeking independence for the province of Alberta, on Thursday said he expected the U.S. administration to respect Canadian sovereignty.

The Financial Times said State Department officials had held three meetings with the Alberta Prosperity Project, a group that is pushing for a referendum on whether the energy-producing Western province should break away from Canada.

"We expect the U.S. administration to respect Canadian sovereignty. I'm always clear in my conversations with President Trump to that effect," Carney told a press conference.

Trump, he added, had never raised the question of Alberta separatism with him.

The APP, which says Ottawa's policies are stifling the province, wants another meeting next month with State and Treasury officials to ask for a $500 billion credit facility, the Financial Times reported.

Alberta premier Danielle Smith said she wanted to stay part of Canada but noted that polls show 30% of the population was fed up with what it saw as Ottawa's excessive interference.

Alberta is landlocked and Smith is pressing for another oil pipeline to the Pacific Coast. That would have to cross the neighboring province of British Columbia, whose premier David Eby has ruled out the idea.

Eby, whose relations with Smith are usually chilly, told reporters earlier that "to go to a foreign country and to ask for assistance in breaking up Canada ... is treason".

Last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told a radio station: "I think we should let them come down into the U.S."

Asked about a possible Alberta referendum, he replied: "People want sovereignty. They want what the U.S. has got."

Carney and Trump have repeatedly traded barbs in recent weeks. Carney, who calls the U.S. president a skilled negotiator, suggests some of Trump's recent comments could be tied to a review of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact that is due to start later this year.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 20:33:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7YG77G7ZRFNK7AQIECMOTAVKOQ.jpg?auth=a18701c376bb3377585c2661d81767b068771cef8e3d59c55cc3369bd2b2e65f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy expects implementation of agreement not to fire on Kyiv</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-expects-implementation-agreement-not-fire-kyiv-2026-01-29/</link><description>Jan 29 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday he expected the implementation of an agreement by Russia not to fire on Kyiv and other cities for a week because of winter weather, as announced by U.S. President Donald Trump.

Zelenskiy said the days to come would show whether Moscow would abide by such an agreement.

"Our teams discussed this in the United Arab Emirates. We expect the agreements to be implemented," Zelenskiy wrote in English on the X social media platform. "De-escalation steps contribute to real progress toward ending the war."

Speaking immediately afterwards in his nightly video address, Zelenskiy expressed his thanks to Washington for the initiative, which he described as halting Russian strikes on energy targets.

"Thanks to the American side for their efforts in ensuring a stop to strikes on energy (targets) at this time and let's hope that America succeeds in ensuring this," he said.

"We shall see what the real situation is with our energy facilities and cities in the days and nights to come."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 20:33:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GQMVCVEBWBJJFOK3I5BQYA4TDY.jpg?auth=ca880cc98de003cd2d075aa4259df95fd7c243c7d1f254c2c5d7bb6123b2bea7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain mourns victims as families push for train crash truth</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-mourns-victims-families-push-train-crash-truth-2026-01-29/</link><description>HUELVA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Some relatives of the 45 people killed in Spain's rail disaster vowed on Thursday to find out why the two high-speed trains collided , making their promise before survivors still wearing bandages and slings at a funeral mass.

"Only the truth will help us heal this wound. We will know the truth, we will fight so that there will never be another train," Liliana Saenz, who lost her mother, said at the service in the southern city of Huelva. King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia attended.

Spain is trying to come to terms with the January 18 disaster near the village of Adamuz in southern Spain that caused one of the highest death tolls from a train crash in European history.

The government has been scrutinized over whether it has sufficiently invested in maintenance of Spain's vaunted railway system since the crash and other incidents that same week, including the death of a train driver in Catalonia.

A fracture in the rail appeared to have occurred before one of the trains headed for Madrid from Malaga derailed and was hit by a second, Huelva-bound train coming in the opposite direction 20 seconds later, authorities said. Puente said the gap could have been as short as nine seconds.

Trump launched his Board of Peace last week, initially designed to cement Gaza's rocky ceasefire, but which he foresees playing a wider role that concerns other global powers.

He has invited dozens of other world leaders to join, and while Middle East powers including Turkey, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, as well as major emerging nations such as Indonesia, have joined the board, global powers and traditional Western U.S. allies have been more cautious.

Luxon said in an email statement that the decision had been made not to join the Board of Peace in “its current form.”

New Zealand’s Foreign Minister Winston Peters added in a post on X that a number of states, particularly from the region, have stepped up to contribute to the Board’s role on Gaza, and “New Zealand would not add significant further value to that.”

Peters post added that as a “a leading founder and longstanding supporter” of the United Nations, it is important that the Board’s work is complementary to and consistent with the UN Charter.

“It is a new body, and we need clarity on this, and on other questions relating to its scope, now and in the future,” Peters said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 21:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/77P33MMOLRNXLHAEV7CRJLKE7A.jpg?auth=cb43aeabef489eefbffe10e4c506fd345ceb05ff8082bb2aadae5413b5802c9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gang-wracked Haiti capital 'systematically' terrorised by sexual violence, MSF warns</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260129-gang-wracked-haiti-capital-systematically-terrorised-by-sexual-violence-msf-warns</link><description>Sexual and gender-based violence has surged in Haiti in recent years, with women and girls targeted by increasingly brutal practices, medical charity Doctors Without Borders warned Thursday.

Haiti is the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, with swathes of the country under the control of rival armed gangs who carry out murders, rapes and kidnappings.

"Sexual and gender-based violence has surged in Haiti's capital since 2021, and is being used systematically to terrorise the population," Doctors Without Borders, which goes by its French initials MSF, warned as it published a fresh report based on 10 years of data and testimonies from its clinic in Port-au-Prince.

MSF said its Pran Men'm clinic had "borne witness to the impact of Haiti's descent into violence and of its hollowed-out health, security, and judicial mechanisms on the bodies of women and girls".

The clinic had over the past decade treated nearly 17,000 survivors of sexual violence – 98 percent of whom were women and girls – including 2,300 in just the first nine months of 2025.

Nearly one-fifth of the survivors treated at the clinic had suffered multiple instances of sexual violence.

"The number of survivors of sexual and gender-based violence who receive care at the clinic has almost tripled from an average of 95 admissions per month in 2021 to more than 250 in 2025," MSF head of mission in Haiti Diana Manilla Arroyo pointed out in a statement.

MSF highlighted a "shocking increase in the brutality of the violence" it was seeing.

Fifty-seven percent of survivors who have received care at Pran Men'm since 2022 reported being assaulted by members of armed groups, and often by multiple perpetrators, it said.

MSF said that over 100 patients reported being assaulted by 10 or more perpetrators at a time.

"They beat me and broke my teeth," one 53-year-old survivor was quoted as saying in the report.

"Three young men who could have been my children ... After raping me, they raped my daughter ... and beat my husband."

The report warned of persistent shortcomings in survivors' access to services amid lacking funding for protection services.

Other barriers, including financial difficulties and insecurity, also prevent survivors from swiftly accessing care, it said.

This can have dire medical consequences, it warned, pointing out that only a third of survivors treated at its clinic since 2022 arrived there within three days of their assault, beyond which time it is no longer possible to prevent HIV transmission.

MSF called for more funding and for the "unequivocal recognition of the widespread nature of sexual violence and its deliberate use by armed groups as a tool to control and subjugate women and girls".</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 21:28:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c5092e56-fd53-11f0-8dc5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Haiti-6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tokyo hopes voters will hand PM Takaichi new clout to counter China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tokyo-hopes-voters-will-hand-pm-takaichi-new-clout-counter-china-2026-01-29/</link><description>TOKYO/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - China may rethink its escalating pressure campaign on Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi if she delivers a resounding victory in a February 8 snap election, say current and former Japanese officials and political analysts.

Weeks after taking office last year, Takaichi touched off the biggest diplomatic dispute with Beijing in over a decade, by publicly outlining how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan, the self-ruled island claimed by China.

Beijing demanded she retract the remarks, which she has not done, and then rolled out a series of retaliatory measures that are starting to weigh on the world’s fourth largest economy.

"China's initial thinking was probably to try to bring down the Takaichi government," said Kazuhisa Shimada, a former vice minister of defence.

"This election is extremely important... a weak government simply won't be taken seriously."

Japan's first female leader hopes to capitalise on her high personal approval ratings, hardly dented by the China row, to bolster her coalition's razor-thin majority in parliament.

A poll showed on Thursday that she may be on course to do just that , though analysts have described the ballot as Japan's most unpredictable in years.

A big win will help send a message to Beijing that its attacks have not damaged her domestically, a senior Japanese government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is a sensitive one.

China's economic curbs on one of its top trading partners could also backfire, while attempts to cast Takaichi as a dangerous ideologue reviving Japan's militaristic past is failing to gain traction internationally, the official added.

Those factors should eventually force China to re-engage with Japan, he said.

So far, however, Beijing has showed no signs of backing down.

China's foreign ministry declined to answer specific questions for this report.

It referred to remarks by spokesperson Guo Jiakun at a January 27 press conference that Takaichi had "severely threatened" the "political foundation of China-Japan relations".

A Chinese official, speaking on condition of anonymity, acknowledged that the election may bring Takaichi short‑term political gain but warned that Japanese people would ultimately see the diplomatic and economic price for crossing China.

Takaichi, who has said she will resign if her coalition loses its majority, did not respond to a request for comment sent to her office.

While domestic cost-of-living issues have dominated the campaign, tensions with China loom large, threatening Japan's weak economic growth and spurring the government to step up efforts to boost security.

Unveiling the election decision on January 19, Takaichi called out Chinese military exercises around Taiwan and "economic coercion".

China's retaliation for her earlier remarks on Taiwan have included a state-directed boycott on travel to Japan that almost halved the number of Chinese visitors in December.

Beijing is also weighing curbs on exports of rare earths and critical minerals, Chinese state media said. Analysts at Daiwa Institute of Research say such a ban could shave up to 3% from Japan's GDP, or about $117 billion, and cost 2 million jobs.

More than two-thirds of Japanese firms expect frayed ties with China to affect the economy, a Reuters survey showed this month, with an Asahi newspaper survey showing 60% of voters were concerned about the economic impact, up from 53% in December.

Economic anxiety may have factored into Takaichi's decision to call the election now, said Paul Midford, professor of international studies at Meiji Gakuin University in Yokohama. The next lower house vote did not have to be held until late 2028.

Takaichi's decision to try and solidify power may also be influenced by memories of her mentor, former premier Shinzo Abe, who returned to power in 2012 during an earlier period of high tension with China, said Shimada, the former vice minister.

"Abe kept winning elections and built an extremely solid political base," he said. "Once that happened, China had no choice but to deal with the Abe government."

Abe oversaw a convincing upper house election win in 2013 and met Chinese President Xi Jinping in late 2014, just before his ruling coalition delivered another large majority in a lower house vote.

A key metric of Takaichi's success will be whether her party can deliver a majority on its own, said Jeremy Chan, a senior analyst for Northeast Asia with political risk consultancy Eurasia Group.

That would require 35 seats in addition to the 198 it now controls in the 465-seat lower house.

"If she is able to do this, it would signal to Beijing that she will likely remain as prime minister for a few years and China’s pressure campaign against her has backfired," said Chan, a former U.S. diplomat in both China and Japan.

"Conversely, Beijing would likely increase its coercion against Japan if Takaichi wins only a small victory."</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:28:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KL6MEU7SJJKHBN334K6REMUEDA.jpg?auth=3ee427db8067ca12775466714534d2aaa8d6b57455ac585bc29d78425f05b68c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ex-Google engineer convicted of stealing AI secrets for Chinese companies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ex-google-engineer-convicted-stealing-ai-secrets-chinese-companies-2026-01-29/</link><description>WILMINGTON, Delaware, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Former Google (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab software engineer Linwei Ding was convicted by a federal jury in San Francisco on Thursday of stealing AI trade secrets from the U.S. tech giant to benefit two Chinese companies he was secretly working for, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Thursday.

Ding, a 38-year-old Chinese national, was found guilty after an 11-day trial of seven counts of economic espionage and seven counts of theft of trade secrets for stealing thousands of pages of confidential information.

Each economic espionage charge carries a maximum 15-year prison term and $5 million fine, while each trade secrets charge carries a maximum 10-year term and $250,000 fine.

Ding is scheduled to appear at a status conference on February 3, according to the DOJ.

An attorney for Ding, also known as Leon Ding, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ding was originally indicted in March 2024 on four counts of theft of trade secrets. A superseding indictment in February expanded the charges.

Ding's case was coordinated through an interagency Disruptive Technology Strike Force, , opens new tab created in 2023 by the Biden administration.

Prosecutors said Ding stole information about the hardware infrastructure and software platform that lets Google's supercomputing data centers train large AI models.

Some of the allegedly stolen chip blueprints were meant to give Google, owned by Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab , an edge over cloud computing rivals Amazon.com (AMZN.O) , opens new tab and Microsoft (MSFT.O) , opens new tab , which design their own, and reduce Google's reliance on chips from Nvidia (NVDA.O) , opens new tab .

Prosecutors said Ding joined Google in May 2019 and began his thefts three years later, when he was being courted to join an early-stage Chinese technology company.

Google was not charged and has said it cooperated with law enforcement. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:31:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ROTTQRFTJRIL5JCTZZ6CWFH2YU.jpg?auth=5d5756c787f7add2e86a86578d4a10ed5778ecd38c929eb91546f9093b22291f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim announces major construction projects as party congress nears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-announces-major-construction-projects-party-congress-nears-2026-01-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 30 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un set a goal to carry out large-scale construction projects this year, including industrial factories in 20 regions simultaneously, state media KCNA said, as the country gears up for a key party congress.

North Korea is preparing to hold the Ninth Party Congress of the ruling Workers' Party, to convene soon to set major policy goals.

"We are now standing on the starting line of our gigantic struggle for another year, aimed at transforming the regions," Kim said in a speech on Thursday, KCNA said on Friday.

The attack happened overnight in Sabon Gari in remote Borno state, which has been the epicentre of an Islamist insurgency by Boko Haram and its Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) offshoot rival since 2009.

More than 40,000 people have been killed and nearly two million others forced to flee their homes.

"The death toll runs into dozens," said Ibrahim Liman, a member of the Civilian Joint Task Force militia that helps the Nigerian military against the militants.

"More bodies are still at the base while many soldiers are missing," he added.

Liman said 20 bodies, including those of five soldiers and 15 construction workers, and local hunters were taken to the general hospital in the nearby town of Biu.

Bukar Yamta Ali, secretary of a local hunters' group in Yamarkumi, near Biu, and two nurses at Biu hospital confirmed they had recovered bodies and wounded from Sabon Gari.

The victims were working on a road bridge that was destroyed last year in another jihadist attack, and were returning to their base when they were attacked.

Military and militia sources said on Tuesday that at least nine Nigerian soldiers were killed in an ISWAP ambush near Damasak near the border with Niger last week.

ISWAP emerged from a split with Boko Haram in 2016 and primarily targets Nigerian security forces, although civilians in the region have been caught up in the violence.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 22:59:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8c3e567c-e314-11f0-b89a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-26T163203Z-839028605-RC2BOIAF5Q1O-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-NIGERIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to impose tariffs on goods from nations giving oil to Cuba, White House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-impose-tariffs-goods-nations-nations-giving-oil-cuba-white-house-says-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and establishing a process to impose tariffs on goods from countries that sell or otherwise provide oil to Cuba, the White House said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 23:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L7EN23JCJFLAJFNMBX2CSRS6JU.jpg?auth=bf322c6dc44e2712e319225223268a9f40668035829eb51570e20021a5d0323d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democrats ask top US spy to explain presence at FBI raid on election facility</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/democrats-ask-top-us-spy-explain-presence-fbi-raid-election-facility-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Top Democrats on the Senate and House intelligence committees called on Thursday on Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard to brief their panels on why she was present for an FBI raid on an election facility in Georgia.

Senator Mark Warner and Representative Jim Himes told Gabbard in a letter that they were deeply concerned that she was at the scene of Wednesday's FBI operation, saying that the U.S. intelligence community "should be focused on foreign threats."

"When those authorities are turned inwards, the results can be devastating" for privacy and civil liberties, the pair wrote to the top U.S. spy.

Gabbard's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

It is highly unusual for America’s top intelligence official to be included in a domestic law enforcement operation, given that the remit of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) is overseas spying and protecting the national security interests of the U.S.

Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii, was at the scene when the FBI raided the election office in Fulton County, Georgia in pursuit evidence to back up Republican President Donald Trump's false claims that widespread fraud lost him the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden.

The FBI said in a brief statement that its agents executed a warrant at the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in Union City, a large, warehouse-like facility opened in 2023, calling it a "court-authorized law enforcement activity."

The warrant "sought a number of records related to 2020 elections," the Fulton County government said in a brief statement about the raid, the latest in a string of actions by Trump's administration to use the Justice Department against his perceived enemies or to intervene in cases where he believes he was treated unfairly.

Warner and Himes told Gabbard that any federal efforts to combat "foreign election threats" required that the public and the congressional intelligence committees be informed.

Gabbard, they noted, has questioned a 2017 intelligence community assessment that Russia tried to influence the 2016 presidential vote in Trump's favor, a finding upheld by a bipartisan Senate intelligence committee report and Special Counsel Robert Mueller.

Gabbard, they said, also has dismantled an intelligence unit created by Congress to expose malign foreign influence operations.

"Your recent actions raise foundational questions about the current mission of your office, and it is critical that you brief the committees immediately as part of your obligation to keep Congress fully and currently informed," the pair wrote.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 23:32:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNWBM3E4ZJN2RGN5LHJJVZ2GEA.jpg?auth=46469b9fade99b0afbdaaa2bcf109f96a98cc104e1585deb71be50414b5ac51a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sweeping oil reform in Venezuela approved, operators expected to gain autonomy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sweeping-oil-reform-venezuela-approved-operators-expected-gain-autonomy-2026-01-29/</link><description>Jan 29 (Reuters) - Lawmakers approved in a final vote on Thursday a sweeping reform of Venezuela's main oil law after sweetening a proposal by interim President Delcy Rodriguez to lower taxes, expand the oil ministry's decision power, grant autonomy for private producers and make possible asset transfers and outsourcings.

The changes are expected to encourage increases in oil and gas production and foreign investment following a $100 billion reconstruction plan for the industry proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump this month after the U.S. military captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The fast-tracked reform to the backbone of the country's oil industry follows 20 years of strict nationalization and expropriation of assets previously owned by foreign companies including U.S. oil majors Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) , opens new tab and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) , opens new tab , which have not been fully compensated after years of arbitrations and lawsuits.

"We have achieved the unanimous approval of a hydrocarbons law reform that will make hiring domestic and foreign companies to extract resources from the world's largest oil reserve more competitive," said National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez.

As promised by U.S. officials, Trump's administration eased sanctions on the Venezuelan energy industry related to its oil exports through a general license shortly after the reform approval.

The proposal was submitted, discussed and approved in less than two weeks. Trump said he would control Venezuela's oil revenue indefinitely following a flagship $2 billion supply deal between Caracas and Washington.

Many potential oil investors viewed the reform as "good enough" to encourage initial investment to recover the OPEC country's depleted industry, while former Venezuelan officials have called it unconstitutional.

The new law will allow private producers to operate projects under new oil contracts or in joint ventures, even if they are the minority stakeholders. They are gaining long-sought autonomy to commercialize output and cash proceeds out of state company PDVSA's control.

The reform also formalizes an oil production sharing model first introduced by Maduro and negotiated with little-known energy firms in recent years. Politicians and experts have warned about the secrecy of those deals and the potential for corruption due to loose regulation.

Changes to the text added in recent days prepared the ground for reducing the income tax for energy projects and removed a series of extra taxes. But a new 'hydrocarbon tax' yet to be regulated in separate legislation was introduced, casting doubts about Caracas' intention of really lowering the government's take, among the highest in Latin America.

Proposals made at the last minute by opposition lawmakers to grant transparency, limit the ministry's powers and maintain the National Assembly approval power for oil contracts were rejected.

The legislature's energy committee received some 120 proposals to modify the law, said lawmaker Orlando Camacho, who is allied with the government.

Washington did not recognize the legitimacy of the election of Venezuela's National Assembly. The U.S. also rejected other voting processes in the country that had little participation and a lack of international observation.

The possibility of transferring oil assets currently owned and operated by state oil firm PDVSA, and to outsource the operation of oilfields under the new contract model was added recently to the reform.

Those production-sharing contracts are expected to be signed as the government makes an evaluation over the next six months of dozens of PDVSA-controlled oil and gas joint ventures, the model that has dominated the industry since the previous hydrocarbons law was approved in 2001.

The National Assembly lost its previous approval authority over contracts, with the oil ministry - currently also controlled by Rodriguez - taking over almost all power to sign contracts and greenlight any term changes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jan 2026 23:52:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UQ3HLJSLYNJ53O2VAQ6OPFC6SQ.jpg?auth=fc07759e4b18ff121d16856ea1305ca50169d046ef166901e28f3645864b86f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump warns UK about business with China after Starmer-Xi talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-says-very-dangerous-uk-get-into-business-with-china-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON/BEIJING, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has warned the United Kingdom against getting into business with China after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Chinese leader Xi Jinping hailed a reset in relations.

With Western leaders reeling from the unpredictability of Trump, Starmer became the latest to head to China, where he called for a "more sophisticated relationship" with improved market access, lower tariffs and investment deals in three-hours of talks with Xi on Thursday.

During the premiere of the "Melania" film at the Kennedy Center, Trump was asked about the UK pledging greater business cooperation with China, and he told reporters: "Well, it's very dangerous for them to do that, and it's even more dangerous I think for Canada to get into business with China."

Starmer, whose centre-left Labour government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised, has made improving relations with the world's second-largest economy a priority.

His visit comes amid Trump's on-off threats of trade tariffs and pledges to grab control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which have rattled long-standing U.S. allies, such as Britain.

Starmer told reporters on the plane on the way to China that Britain could continue to strengthen economic ties with China - without angering Trump - because of his country's long history of working closely with the United States.

"The relationship we have with the U.S. is one of the closest relationships we hold, on defence, security, intelligence and also on trade and lots of areas," he said.

Starmer said Britain would not have to choose between closer ties with the United States or China, highlighting Trump’s visit to Britain in September where they announced 150 billion pound of U.S investment into Britain.

Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on Canada if it goes through with economic deals struck with China on a recent visit by its leader Mark Carney.

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is expected to travel to China soon and Trump himself has said he will visit in April.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 02:03:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YS7EHJSXTFN55FOKICREDVMWHE.jpg?auth=7d6179635ffbcbe16957f926854f1bdd5f28050b37835e21f40468d2507f847c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US missions to review aid programs for compliance with new rules on abortion, diversity and gender</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-missions-review-aid-programs-compliance-with-new-rules-abortion-diversity-2026-01-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - The State Department has ordered U.S. missions worldwide to review all aid programs to ensure they meet stringent new rules that prohibit funding of groups working on family planning, diversity or what the Trump administration calls “gender ideology,” according to a cable seen by Reuters.

The Trump administration last week announced the expansion of the so-called Mexico City Policy, which opponents call the "global gag rule" because they say it silences abortion rights advocates.

The policy, previously focused on abortion, now also bars funding of groups that work on diversity, equity and inclusion; gender identity and transgender rights. It expands the amount of foreign aid affected to about $30 billion and targets more groups to include U.S.-based organizations.

The move has outraged aid groups that see it as another blow to the struggling sector and a move that effectively silences civil society in developing countries.

Department bureaus and posts should begin assessing the aid projects they oversee and consider identifying a focal point or forming a “tiger team” to work on the new rules, the cable, dated Wednesday, said.

The new rules, which go into effect on February 26, will be included in any new grants or cooperative agreements and added to existing projects when new funding is awarded, the cable said.

Officials expect some organizations will not comply with the policy and opt out of receiving U.S. funding, according to the cable, which included an internal email address to receive information on those organizations declining to comply.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio will issue limited waivers to ensure implementation of the new rules does not "unduly disrupt ongoing lifesaving programming, disaster response, and other critical priorities," the cable said.

The State Department did not respond to a request for comment.

President Donald Trump eradicated the federal government’s main foreign aid agency USAID after returning to office last year, throwing the global aid sector into chaos. The administration has also aggressively closed programs relating to diversity initiatives and acceptance of transgender people.

Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City Policy has been rescinded by each Democratic president since and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. Trump restored it a year ago before the expansion was announced by Vice President JD Vance at the March For Life anti-abortion rally in Washington on Friday.

Under the new rules, foreign NGOs are prohibited from using funding from non-U.S. donors as well as U.S. aid for the banned purposes. The restriction previously applied only to U.S. funds.

These are to “provide or promote abortion as a method of family planning; Promote gender ideology; Promote discriminatory equity ideology; or Engage in unlawful diversity, equity, and inclusion-related discrimination,” or provide financial support to other groups engaged in these activities, according to the cable.

U.S.-based NGOs were only restricted from using U.S. assistance for those purposes, it said.

International Crisis Group's Cristal Downing said the policy already required large amounts of paperwork from organizations, including those in conflict zones, and had been damaging to civil society, for instance negatively affecting groups working on women's rights.

"This is an attempt at global social engineering, part of a slash and burn strategy targeting gender equality programming that started with last year’s aid cuts. It will affect access to safe spaces for survivors of gender-based violence, efforts to increase women’s representation in peacebuilding initiatives, and a host of other work," said Downing, project director for gender and conflict at the think tank.

Talking points in the cable instructed U.S. diplomats to say the move was part of Trump’s foreign aid overhaul aimed at focusing "resources on programs that are designed to effectively and efficiently save lives, support allies, and create commercial opportunities that benefit the American economy.”

“Programs predicated upon advancing divisive social causes, globalism, and other radical ideologies have no place in our new foreign assistance architecture,” the talking points said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 02:03:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RC4OPHQZEZLVFPXYDFKRAVZPGY.jpg?auth=af1e54078b887343895541d0b7b5c08aa75a546e09852fbd55dfa5f792685ac7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he is planning to talk to Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-he-is-planning-talk-iran-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was planning to talk to Iran amid rising tensions.

Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, has made the indigenous submarine programme a key part of an ambitious project to modernise its armed forces as Beijing stages almost daily military exercises to assert its sovereignty claims.

The submarine programme has drawn on expertise and technology from several countries , including the United States and Britain, a breakthrough for diplomatically isolated Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's territorial claims.

Taiwan's CSBC Corp (2208.TW) , opens new tab , which is leading construction of what is eventually planned to be eight submarines, said in a statement late on Thursday that the first ship, named the Narwhal, had completed its first underwater test at sea.

It said the submarine had carried out a "shallow-water submerged navigation test".

"Submarines are a key strategic capability with deterrent power," it said, after the test off the southern Taiwanese port of Kaohsiung.

The Narwhal had been due to be delivered to the navy in 2024, joining two existing submarines purchased from the Netherlands in the 1980s, but the programme has been hit with delays.

"Due to constraints in the international environment and pressure from the Chinese communists, Taiwan's indigenous submarine programme has faced various difficulties and challenges from the beginning to the present," CSBC said.

Taiwan has said it hopes to deploy at least two such domestically developed submarines by 2027, and possibly equip later models with missiles.

The first submarine, with a price tag of T$49.36 billion ($1.58 billion), will use a combat system by Lockheed Martin Corp (LMT.N) , opens new tab and carry U.S.-made Mark 48 heavyweight torpedoes.

Taiwan's armed forces are dwarfed by those of China, which has three operational aircraft carriers and ballistic missile submarines and is developing stealth fighter jets.

Taiwan is modernising its military to be able to fight "asymmetric warfare," using mobile and agile systems like submarines, drones and truck-mounted missiles to fend off its much larger adversary China.

Taiwan President Lai Ching-te announced in November 2025 that his government would spend an additional $40 billion on defence.

Lawmakers in the country's National Assembly approved the overhaul of the energy industry law earlier in the day, less than a month after the brazen seizure of then-President Nicolás Maduro in a US military attack in Venezuela’s capital.

As the bill was being passed, the US Treasury Department officially began to ease sanctions on Venezuelan oil that once crippled the industry, and expanded the ability of US energy companies to operate in the South American nation, the first step in plans outlined by Secretary of State Marco Rubio the day before.

The license authorisation by the Treasury Department strictly prohibits entities from China, Russia, Iran, North Korea or Cuba from the transactions.

The moves by both governments on Thursday are paving the way for yet another radical geopolitical and economic shift in Venezuela.

“We’re talking about the future. We are talking about the country that we are going to give to our children," Rodríguez said.

Rodríguez proposed the changes in the days after US President Donald Trump said his administration would take control of Venezuela’s oil exports and revitalize the ailing industry by luring foreign investment.

The legislation promises to give private companies control over the production and sale of oil and allow for independent arbitration of disputes.

Rodríguez’s government expects the changes to serve as assurances for major US oil companies that have so far hesitated about returning to the volatile country. Some of those companies lost investments when the ruling party enacted the existing law two decades ago to favor Venezuela’s state-run oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela SA, or PDVSA.

The revised law would modify extraction taxes, setting a royalty cap rate of 30% and allowing the executive branch to set percentages for every project based on capital investment needs, competitiveness and other factors.

It also removes the mandate for disputes to be settled only in Venezuelan courts, which are controlled by the ruling party. Foreign investors have long viewed the involvement of independent courts as crucial to guard against future expropriation.

Ruling-party lawmaker Orlando Camacho, head of the assembly’s oil committee, said the reform “will change the country’s economy.”

Meanwhile, opposition lawmaker Antonio Ecarri urged the assembly to add transparency and accountability provisions to the law, including the creation of a website to make funding and other information public. He noted that the current lack of oversight has led to systemic corruption and argued that these provisions can also be considered judicial guarantees.

Those guarantees are among the key changes foreign investors are looking for as they weigh entering the Venezuelan market.

“Let the light shine on in the oil industry,” Ecarri said.

Oil workers dressed in red jumpsuits and hard hats celebrated the bill’s approval, waving a Venezuelan flag inside the legislative palace and then joining lawmakers in a demonstration with ruling-party supporters.

The law was last altered two decades ago as Maduro ’s mentor and predecessor, the late Hugo Chávez, made heavy state control over the oil industry a pillar of his socialist-inspired revolution.

In the early years of his tenure, a massive windfall in petrodollars thanks to record-high global oil prices turned PDVSA into the main source of government revenue and the backbone of Venezuela’s economy.

Chávez’s 2006 changes to the hydrocarbons law required PDVSA to be the principal stakeholder in all major oil projects.

In tearing up the contracts that foreign companies signed in the 1990s, Chávez nationalised huge assets belonging to American and other Western firms that refused to comply, including ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. They are still waiting to receive billions of dollars in arbitration awards.

From those heady days of lavish state spending, PDVSA’s fortunes turned — along with the country’s — as oil prices dropped and government mismanagement eroded profits and hurt production, first under Chávez, then Maduro.

The nation home to the world’s biggest proven crude reserves underwent a dire economic crisis that drove over 7 million Venezuelans to flee since 2014. Sanctions imposed by successive US administrations further crippled the oil industry.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 02:04:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cbf675f0-fcb0-11f0-8f58-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/0668e29028bba83f0f024438bdae56f29fe5d082.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's reformist Natthaphong is frontrunner ahead of February vote, polls show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-reformist-natthaphong-is-frontrunner-ahead-february-vote-polls-show-2026-01-30/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Thailand's progressive People's Party leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut continued to lead opinion polls on Friday, highlighting the stiff challenge facing Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul 's bid to stay in power ahead of elections on February 8 .

February's vote has settled into a three-way race between Anutin's conservative Bhumjaithai Party, the former ruling Pheu Thai Party and the reformist People's Party.

A poll by Suan Dusit University published on Friday said Natthaphong was backed by 35.1% of respondents, with Anutin coming in third with 16.1%, behind Pheu Thai's candidate for prime minister Yoshanan Wongsawat at 21.5%.

The poll surveyed 26,621 people from the January 16 to 28 period.

The People's Party is the successor to Move Forward, which won the 2023 elections but was subsequently blocked by conservative lawmakers from forming a government and was later dissolved by court order.

Anutin called a snap election on December 12 after less than 100 days as premier during a chaotic parliamentary session that could have led to a no-confidence vote and the collapse of his fragile minority government.

It also came during Thailand's fierce three-week border conflict with Cambodia.

Another poll by the National Institute of Development Administration also showed Natthaphong in front with support from 29% of respondents, up from 24.7% earlier in the month , with Anutin up modestly at 22.2%.

Anutin faces pressure to consolidate conservative-leaning voters and present a post-election governing path in what are expected to be tight coalition negotiations after the vote.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 04:21:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6I2CJKQLRJ43C5PT6J3MJAC2Y.jpg?auth=7df7fff4d558186f897d7a2f45fa42b21525a0b7413da1aa66bb428fb5133493&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Force won't bring true peace for Taiwan, president tells Pope Leo in letter</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/force-wont-bring-true-peace-taiwan-president-tells-pope-leo-letter-2026-01-30/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Any attempt to change Taiwan's status quo by force or coercion cannot bring true peace, Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said in a letter to Pope Leo released by the presidential office on Friday.

The Vatican is one of only 12 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Chinese-claimed Taiwan, and the only one in Europe, though the Vatican has worked to improve relations with Beijing, including the appointment of Catholic bishops .

Writing to Pope Leo in response to his January 1 World Day of Peace message, Lai said he had repeatedly emphasised that democracy, peace, and prosperity are "Taiwan's national path and also Taiwan's link with the world".

In the face of long-term military coercion and political intimidation from "authoritarian states in the region", Taiwan has always chosen to safeguard peace in the Taiwan Strait through concrete actions, Lai added, without directly naming China.

"I firmly believe that any attempt to change Taiwan's status quo through force or coercion cannot bring true peace," he said.

China's military operates near Taiwan on a daily basis in what the government in Taipei says is an ongoing pressure and harassment campaign. China held its latest war games around the island in late December.

China refuses to talk to Lai, believing he is a dangerous "separatist".

Lai says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

In his letter to the Pope, Lai also called out "efforts to distort" World War Two documents and the interpretation of the 1971 U.N resolution , which led to Taipei losing the China seat at the global body to Beijing "in order to downgrade our sovereign status".

Beijing says World War Two documents like the Cairo Declaration , as well as the 1971 U.N. resolution, give international legal backing to its sovereignty claims over Taiwan.

The government in Taipei says that is nonsense given the U.N. resolution made no mention of Taiwan, and that the People's Republic of China did not exist until the end of World War Two.

Taiwan's formal name is the Republic of China, the name of the government that fought on the side of the Western allies in World War Two.

The republican government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with Mao Zedong's communists who established the People's Republic of China.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 04:22:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P4BZSMCQGJI6XCOMQO5FNTQBGU.jpg?auth=623417bb4932ef31a7ac93b2047898142a96a08df0a5563f2032f4bfff33cb44&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why Thailand will vote to decide a new constitution</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/why-thailand-will-vote-decide-new-constitution-2026-01-30/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Voters in Thailand's general elections on February 8 will also be asked to decide if a new constitution should replace a 2017 charter.

The referendum is the outcome of a decades-long struggle between the pro-military royalist establishment and popular democratic political movements.

Those backing change say the current military-backed charter entrenches unelected power, weakening democratic checks and civil liberties.

The ballot will ask, "Do you approve that there should be a new constitution?" and offer a choice of "Yes", "No" or "No opinion".

A majority "Yes" vote would give parliament a public mandate to begin drafting a new national charter.

A majority "no" vote will leave intact the current constitution, which took effect in 2017 after being drafted by a military-appointed committee following a 2014 coup.

Two prior referendums, in 2007 and 2016, differed from the approaching exercise as they sought approval of drafts written after military coups.

Thailand has had 20 constitutions since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932. Most of the changes followed military coups, 13 of which have been successful in the last 94 years.

Critics say the 2017 constitution concentrated power in undemocratic institutions, weakened popular rule and limited decentralisations of power and meaningful checks and balances.

Central to this is the Senate, or upper house of parliament, whose 200 members are chosen through a complex indirect selection process with little public participation, allowing powerful political groups to influence its composition.

The Senate has an oversight role in lawmaking and holds key powers, such as the appointment of judges to the Constitutional Court and other unelected bodies with outsize influence on politics, including dissolving political parties and banning elected leaders from politics.

The empowerment of such unelected bodies over elected ones, critics say, stemmed from a two-decade long tussle between the conservative establishment, backed by the military, and popular political movements, chiefly those linked to former premier Thaksin Shinawatra .

The charter broadly limits civil rights and freedoms by subordinating them to state security and public morality.

Most mainstream political parties , including the ruling Bhumjaithai Party as well as the opposition People's Party and Pheu Thai , back amending the constitution and are urging supporters to vote "yes" in the referendum.

Bhumjaithai, however, says changes must not affect charter provisions on the monarchy.

Opponents of change come mostly from ultra conservative figures and parties such as the pro-military United Thai Nation Party, which backed former junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha but has since lost influence, winning just 36 of 500 seats in the last election.

If "Yes" voters prevail, the new government and lawmakers can start the amendment process in parliament with two more referendums required to adopt a new constitution.

The first task will be to layout the framework and key principles of the drafting process, as well as identifying those responsible for writing the charter.

A second referendum will then seek approval of the process. If secured, a third referendum is next required to approve the finished draft.

Experts say the process could run at least two years after the first referendum.

If the February 8 referendum fails, lawmakers can still propose charter amendments to individual articles in parliament.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 04:22:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J73QT2EJO5MTLNKVHFHCYIFKK4.jpg?auth=19a7a6898da9e3477225985f660e0fa8603e173712c5897c27f35eb247ccf84c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens new tariffs on countries supplying Cuba with oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-trump-threatens-new-tariffs-countries-supplying-cuba-oil</link><description>US President Donald Trump threatened ⁠new tariffs on Thursday on countries supplying oil to Cuba, escalating a pressure campaign against the Communist-run island and long-time foe of the United States.

The move, ​authorised by an executive order under a national emergency declaration, ‍stopped short of specifying tariff rates or singling out any countries whose products could face US tariffs .

Cuba's ​state-run media shot back shortly after Trump's announcement, warning that the ​order threatened to paralyze electricity generation, agricultural production, water supply and health services on an island already suffering a crippling economic crisis.

"What is the goal? A genocide of the Cuban people," Cuba's government said in a statement on the nightly TV newscast. "All spheres of life will be suffocated by the US government."

Emboldened by the US military 's ‍seizure of ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a deadly raid earlier this month, Trump has repeatedly ​talked of acting against Cuba and pressuring its leadership.

Trump said this week that "Cuba will be failing pretty soon," adding that Venezuela, once the island's ‌top oil supplier, has not recently sent oil or money to Cuba.

Reuters exclusively reported last week that Mexico - Cuba's top ‍supplier after Venezuela cut off shipments in December - wasalso reviewing whether to continue sending oil amid growing fears it could face reprisals from the United States over the policy.

Trump has used tariff threats as a foreign policy tool throughout his second term in office.

The New START treaty is set to end on February 5. Without it, there would be no constraints on long-range nuclear arsenals for the first time since Richard Nixon and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev signed two historic agreements in 1972 on the first-ever trip by a U.S. president to Moscow.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed the two sides should stick to existing missile and warhead limits for one more year to buy time to work out what comes next, but U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to formally respond.

Trump said this month that "if it expires, it expires", and that the treaty should be replaced with a better one.

Some U.S. politicians argue Trump should reject Putin's offer, freeing Washington to grow its arsenal to counter a rapid nuclear build-up by a third power: China.

Trump says he wants to pursue "denuclearisation" with both Russia and China. But Beijing says it is unreasonable to expect it to join disarmament talks with two countries whose arsenals are still far larger than its own.

Since the darkest Cold War days when the United States and the Soviet Union threatened each other with "mutually assured destruction" in the event of nuclear war, both have seen arms limitation treaties as a way to prevent either a lethal misunderstanding or an economically ruinous arms race.

The treaties not only set numerical limits on missiles and warheads, they also require the sides to share information - a critical channel to "try to understand where the other side is coming from and what their concerns and drivers are", said Darya Dolzikova at the RUSI think-tank in London.

With no new treaty, each would be forced to act according to worst-case assumptions about the weapons the other is producing, testing and deploying, said Nikolai Sokov, a former Soviet and Russian arms negotiator.

"It's a self-sustaining kind of process. And of course, if you've got an unregulated arms race, things will get quite destabilising," he said.

Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia and the United States have repeatedly replaced and updated the Cold War-era treaties that limited the so-called strategic weapons they point at each other's cities and bases.

The most recent, New START, was signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, a Putin ally who was then serving as Russian president for four years.

It caps the number of deployed strategic warheads at 1,550 on each side, with no more than 700 systems to deliver them from land, sea or air, by intercontinental ballistic missile, submarine-launched missile or heavy bomber.

Replacing it with a new treaty would be no simple task. Russia has developed new nuclear-capable systems - the Burevestnik cruise missile, the hypersonic Oreshnik and the Poseidon torpedo - that fall outside New START's framework. And Trump has announced plans for a space-based "Golden Dome" missile defence system that Moscow sees as an attempt to shift the strategic balance.

Meanwhile, China's arsenal is growing, unchecked by agreements between Washington and Moscow. Beijing now has an estimated 600 warheads and the Pentagon estimates it will have more than 1,000 by 2030.

A bipartisan Congressional commission in 2023 said the United States was now facing an "existential challenge" from not one but two nuclear peers, and needed to be prepared for simultaneous wars with Russia and China.

Its recommendations included preparing to bring out of storage some or all of the strategic nuclear warheads removed under New START and kept in a reserve stockpile.

That could involve restoring warheads removed from Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-fired Trident D5s, and returning to nuclear roles some 30 B-52 strategic bomber planes converted to conventional missions.

"The warheads are there. The missiles are there. You’re not buying anything new," said a former senior U.S. official involved in nuclear weapons policy who requested anonymity.

The former official expected only "modest" increases in warhead reloads should Trump order those options.

But Kingston Reif, a former Pentagon official now at the RAND research organization, told a recent webinar that at the high end the United States could "roughly double" its deployed warheads from the New START limit, while Russia would be in a position to add around 800. Both sides would take at least the best part of a year to make significant changes, he said.

PUTIN'S OFFER DIVIDES VIEWS IN THE U.S.

In policy circles in the United States, views are divided on whether Trump should agree to Putin's offer to keep existing limits in place for a year.

Trump should take steps "to reduce the risk of a wasteful nuclear arms race and to reduce the risk of a catastrophic misinterpretation (of the other side’s intent) that could spiral out of control during a crisis," said Paul Dean, a former arms control official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, an advocacy group.

Arms control advocates point out that the United States is already facing huge expenses from a nuclear force modernization program - including a new submarine, bomber and ICBM – that is suffering serious delays and massive cost overruns.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that it will cost U.S. taxpayers nearly $1 trillion between 2025 and 2034 to modernize, sustain and operate the nuclear forces.

"If the U.S. exceeds New START limits by uploading warheads, Russia will do the same, and China will use it as another excuse to build up their nuclear arsenal," Democratic Senator Ed Markey, a leading arms control proponent, told Reuters.

"Ultimately, Trump will have started a new arms race that we do not need, nor can we win. More weapons will not make use safer."

On the other side of the debate, experts and former officials say the U.S. shouldn't trust Putin, noting that he halted mutual inspections under New START in 2023 because of U.S. support for Ukraine in its war with Russia.

Franklin Miller, a member of the bipartisan Congressional commission, said the threats from Russia and China require an increase in deployed U.S. strategic nuclear warheads.

"We now have to be able to deter Russia and China simultaneously," said Miller. "The force that the treaty confined the U.S. to in 2010 is not sufficient to address Russia and China together."

U.S. weapons requirements should increase, although "not radically, not monumentally," he said, in a process that would probably take several years.

Asked about Trump's intentions, a White House official said: "The president will decide the path forward on nuclear arms control, which he will clarify on his own timeline."

Medvedev, the former Russian president who signed New START, told the Kommersant newspaper that Trump was unpredictable.

The Union and Solidarity Party (USDP) dominated all phases of the vote, winning an overwhelming majority in Myanmar's two legislative chambers. It secured 232 of the 263 seats up for grabs in the lower Pyithu Hluttaw house and 109 of the 157 seats announced so far in the Amyotha Hluttaw upper chamber, according to results released on Thursday and Friday.

Myanmar's parliament is expected to convene in March to elect a president , with a new government set to take over in April, pro-military Eleven Media Group reported earlier this month, citing junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun.

The final round of voting in late January brought an end to an election that began on December 28, more than four years after the military seized power in a coup that overturned the elected government of Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.

Myanmar has been in political turmoil since the coup, with the crushing of pro-democracy protests sparking a nationwide rebellion. Around 3.6 million people have been displaced, according to United Nations.

The 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations has said it would not endorse the process, and human rights groups and some western countries have also denounced the election as a sham.

Myanmar's military government insists the polls were free and fair, and supported by the public.

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy was dissolved along with dozens of other parties, and some others declined to take part, drawing condemnation from critics who say the process was designed to entrench military rule.

Under Myanmar's political system, the military is also guaranteed 25% of parliamentary seats, ensuring continued control even after power is formally transferred to a civilian-led administration.

The USDP was founded in 2010 after decades of military-led rule in the southeast Asian country, with the aim of serving as a proxy for the armed forces, also known as the Tatmadaw.

The party is chaired by a retired brigadier general and packed with other former high-ranking officers. It contested the poll with 1,018 candidates, a fifth of the total registered.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing is also expected to play a central role in the next administration.

He has defended the polls as a step toward stability, rejecting criticism from opponents and foreign governments and affirming that state responsibilities will be transferred to the elected government.

"Regardless of any changes among political parties or organizations in the country, Tatmadaw continues to carry out its responsibilities for national defence and security faithfully and without neglect up to the present day," he was quoted by state media as saying on Monday.

Turnout reached around 55% over all three phases, lower than the figure of around 70% in previous elections, including a 2015 vote that brought Suu Kyi to power, as well as the ill-fated 2020 poll, the results of which were cancelled by the junta before staging the coup.

Voting took place in 263 of Myanmar's 330 townships, some of which are not under the complete control of the junta.

It was cancelled in many areas due to ongoing fighting between the military and armed ethnic groups, as well as local resistance forces that emerged after the 2021 coup.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 06:52:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KJBIBLQJ7RMI5LD5OVLNX7K2Y4.jpg?auth=4b8b2f1a0a23b8025527d3757f3ea432209673a39c43aba1f8886326087b6ea6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Early warning of 'Apocalyptic Wasteland' in Gaza blocked by US envoys to Israel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/early-warning-apocalyptic-wasteland-gaza-blocked-by-us-envoys-israel-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. Agency for International Development staffers in early 2024 drafted a warning to senior officials in Joe Biden’s administration: Northern Gaza had turned into an “Apocalyptic Wasteland” with dire shortages of food and medical aid.

Three months after the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks and Israel's incursion into the Gaza Strip, the internal message laid out in gruesome detail scenes observed by United Nations staff who visited the area on a two-part humanitarian fact-finding mission in January and February.

The staff reported seeing a human femur and other bones on the roads, dead bodies abandoned in cars and “catastrophic human needs, particularly for food and safe drinking water.”

But the U.S. ambassador to Jerusalem, Jack Lew, and his deputy, Stephanie Hallett, blocked the cable from wider distribution within the United States government because they believed it lacked balance, according to interviews with four former officials and documents seen by Reuters.

Reuters is the first to report on the cable and why it was suppressed.

Hallett and Lew did not respond to requests for comment.

The February 2024 cable was one of five sent in the first part of that year documenting the rapidly deteriorating health, food and sanitary conditions and breakdown of social order for Palestinians living in Gaza resulting from Israel's military campaign, six former U.S. officials told Reuters.

Reuters saw one of those cables. The other four, also blocked by Lew and Hallett because of their concerns about balance, were described by four former officials.

Three former U.S. officials said that the descriptions were unusually graphic and would have commanded the attention of senior U.S. officials had the message been widely circulated within Joe Biden’s administration.

It would have also deepened scrutiny of a National Security Memorandum, issued by Biden that month, which conditioned the supply of U.S. intelligence and weapons on Israel’s compliance with international law, they said.

"While cables weren't the only means of providing humanitarian information ... they would have represented an acknowledgement by the ambassador of the reality of the situation in Gaza,” said Andrew Hall, then a crisis operations specialist for USAID.

The U.S. embassy in Jerusalem oversaw the language and distribution of most of the cables about Gaza, including those from other embassies in the region.

One former senior official said Lew and Hallett often told USAID leadership that the cables included information that had been widely reported in the media.

Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken and representatives for former President Joe Biden did not respond to requests for comment about the fact that the cables never reached upper leadership of the U.S. government.

The Gaza war started with the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks that killed more than 1,250 people. The death toll in Gaza now stands at over 71,000, according to Palestinian Health Ministry data.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by his side, President Donald Trump announced his Gaza peace plan in the Oval Office last September, but the fighting has not stopped. Some 481 people have been killed since the ceasefire, according to Palestinian health ministry data.

The Biden administration’s backing for Israel during the war deeply divided the Democratic Party and remains an unresolved issue for its political candidates.

More than 80% of Democrats believe that Israel’s military response in Gaza has been excessive and that the United States should help people in the enclave who are facing starvation, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll last August.

As the cables were being drafted in early 2024, the White House and other senior U.S. officials were broadly aware of the worsening humanitarian situation in northern Gaza from National Security Council reporting, four former officials said. And humanitarian organizations were warning of famine risks.

"There are a lot of innocent people who are starving, a lot of innocent people who are in trouble and dying, and it's got to stop,” Biden told reporters at the White House in February 2024, describing Israel’s response in Gaza as “over the top.”

In January 2024, the embassy did approve the wider distribution of a cable about food insecurity throughout Gaza, and the information made it into the president’s daily briefing – a compilation by the intelligence community of the most important national security information and analysis.

The cable, which was described to Reuters, looked at the risk of famine in northern Gaza and the potential for severe food insecurity in the rest of the strip because of a lack of food deliveries. It was one of the first detailed reports from USAID into the rapidly deteriorating situation inside Gaza, including growing food insecurity in the south of the enclave.

That cable caught the attention of several senior White House officials, including deputy national security adviser Jon Finer, who told colleagues he was surprised by how quickly the food situation had deteriorated, according to two of the former U.S. officials.

Finer did not respond to a request for comment.

But senior U.S. officials were not receiving regular first-hand accounts because of restricted access to the area during an intense battle between Israel and Hamas, six former U.S. officials said.

“Simply put, humanitarian expertise was repeatedly sidelined, blocked, ignored,” a former member of USAID’s Middle East disaster response team said.

Until the USAID was reduced to a skeleton staff inside the State Department by the Trump administration, U.S. officials relied heavily on the agency’s reporting in situations where diplomatic presence and human intelligence were scarce.

Because USAID has had no staff inside Gaza since 2019, much of that reporting drew on information provided by U.N. agencies – including UNRWA, the Palestinian refugee agency - and international aid organizations funded by the U.S. government.

That dependence on third parties contributed to some Biden officials’ skepticism of USAID reporting, three former U.S. officials told Reuters.

Biden’s Middle East envoy Brett McGurk and his aides often asked in meetings if the USAID had verified the information and why it diverged, sometimes drastically, from Israel’s version of events, the three former officials said.

“The question was always like ‘where are all the skinny kids?’” one of the former officials said.

McGurk declined to comment.

The two former officials said Hallett sometimes asked for cables to be reframed or edited. She questioned the necessity of one cable, which focused on health, arguing that much of the information was in the public domain.

Two of the former Biden officials also said Hallett sometimes viewed USAID disaster team cables as too sensitive to be published during contentious negotiations on a ceasefire and hostage deal.

The February 2024 cable about northern Gaza drew on a fact-finding mission by UNRWA, the U.N. Mine Action Service, and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, according to two former U.S. officials and documents reviewed by Reuters.

The cable cleared USAID’s West Bank and Gaza mission offices and the State Department’s Office of Palestinian Affairs, before Hallett barred wider distribution, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. Cables only needed one sign-off from the head office of the embassy, and Hallett would not have barred its distribution without Lew’s knowledge or approval, two former officials said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 06:52:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CFVE2UHMWJOKVCXA55NEVACHGU.jpg?auth=b3ab5ec97e23be3bf220f015c1f95536255030e286af4fa5a049c942e685cc81&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: What is the New START nuclear treaty and why does its expiry matter?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/what-is-new-start-nuclear-treaty-why-does-its-expiry-matter-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - The last Russia-U.S. nuclear arms control treaty, known as New START, is due to expire on February 5.

Here is a guide to the treaty and why it matters.

New START was signed in 2010 by U.S. President Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev, an ally of Vladimir Putin who served a single term as Russia's president. At the time, relations between the two countries were undergoing a "reset". The treaty came into force the following year.

The treaty sets limits on strategic nuclear weapons - the kind that each side would use to strike the opponent's vital political, military and industrial centres in the event of a nuclear war. It caps the number of deployed strategic warheads at 1,550 on each side, with no more than 700 deployed ground- or submarine-launched missiles and bomber planes, and 800 launchers.

The treaty included a system of short-notice, on-site inspections so each side could satisfy itself that the other was complying. But in 2023, Putin suspended Moscow's participation because of U.S. support for Ukraine in the war with Russia. That brought a halt to inspections - which in any case had been suspended during the COVID pandemic - and forced each side to rely on its own intelligence assessments of what the other was doing. However, neither has accused the other of breaching the warhead limits, which remain in force.

The treaty text says it can only be extended once, and this has already happened - in 2021, just after Joe Biden became U.S. president. With expiry looming, Putin proposed last September that each side should agree informally to stick to the warhead limits for another year. U.S. President Donald Trump has yet to respond formally to that suggestion.

We don't know yet, and time is running short. In the U.S., there are arguments for and against accepting it. Those in favour say it would demonstrate political will to avoid an arms race and buy time to figure out what happens next. Others say the U.S. should free itself now from the New START limits in order to boost its arsenal to take account of a rapid nuclear build-up by China, and that doing otherwise would send a signal of weakness.

If Moscow and Washington cease observing mutual limits on their long-range nuclear arsenals, it will mark the end of more than half a century of constraints on these weapons. The expiry of New START leaves a void, as no talks have taken place on a successor. Arms control advocates fear that raises nuclear risks, especially at a time of heightened international tension because of wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Experts say the value of nuclear treaties lies not just in setting numerical limits but in creating a stable, transparent framework to prevent arms races from spiralling out of control.

Each side would be free to increase its missile numbers and deploy hundreds more strategic warheads. However, experts say this poses some technical and logistical challenges and would not happen overnight - it would take at least the best part of a year to make significant changes. Longer term, the concern is that an unregulated arms race would ensue, in which each side would keep on adding weapons based on worst-case assumptions about what the other was planning.

Trump says he wants a new, better treaty but experts say this would be a long, hard process. A successor treaty would probably need to address other classes of nuclear weapons including short- and intermediate-range, as well as "exotic" new systems that Russia has developed since New START was agreed, such as the Burevestnik cruise missile and Poseidon torpedo.

Apart from the fact such deals are complex and technical, there isn't even agreement on who should take part. While Trump has stated he wants to pursue "denuclearisation" with both Russia and China, Beijing says it is unreasonable and unrealistic to ask it to join three-way talks with countries whose arsenals are still many times larger than its own. Russia says the nuclear forces of NATO members Britain and France should also be up for negotiation, which those countries reject.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 06:53:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ARAE2LIGVBKO7AOC6QUEEMUPEI.jpg?auth=19bebc611f3d8d2e4dc2e5913fb325f9ac55d14b4d3917693dfb2f79c6041219&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump says he hopes to avoid military action against Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260130-live-trump-says-hopefully-won-t-need-iran-military-action</link><description>President Donald Trump said ⁠on Thursday he planned to speak with Iran, even as the US dispatched another warship to the Middle East and Pentagon chief Pete Hegseth said ​the military would be ready to carry out whatever the ‍president decided.

Perhaps. Nine French rap, pop and urban music composers recently joined forces with Afrobeats artists to produce 60 tracks for international audiences.

In under a week, French, English, Nigerian Pidgin and Creole blended in musical melodies for future hits at the premises of renowned Nigerian label Mavin Records in the economic and cultural hub, Lagos.

The label produces Afrobeats stars such as Rema, Ladipoe, Ayra Starr and Magixx.

"If one or two songs hit like Ayra Starr's 'Rush' or Rema's 'Calm Down' then we would have achieved it all," said Akotchaye Okio, the director of international artists' rights group Sacem, which organised the camp in collaboration with the French embassy and Mavin Records.

The Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers (Sacem) has hosted similar tie-ups outside Africa , showcasing different musical genres in the United States, France , South Korea and the Netherlands .

Afrobeats, which blends traditional African rhythms with contemporary pop sounds, has become one of the most popular genres in the world, driven largely by the Nigerian diaspora.

Born in the 1970s through the influence of Fela Kuti, regarded as the father of Afrobeats, the genre continues to attract a global audience.

After the camp, Mavin Records' artists will "choose the beats they prefer and record over them", said Okio, in the waiting room at the record label's offices, a building decorated with posters and gold and diamond plaques from its heavyweights.

Nigerian and French artists were divided into groups according to themes.

In one of the studios, French producer PSK, whose real name is Maxime Pasquier, and his Nigerian counterpart Dunnie Alexandra Lawal produced several tracks together.

Like some of the other participants, the 21-year-old Frenchman, who had always yearned for an international collaboration, had never been to Africa.

"What I found interesting and different from the way we work in France is how people let songs carry them away," said PSK, who has worked with major French artists such as Ninho, Jok'Air and Genezio.

"They explore their ideas much further" to compose songs that are both mellow and rhythmic, the beatmaker and pianist said.

Mavin Records' singer and songwriter Elestee, whose real name is Treasure Apiafi Banigo, fine-tuned the compositions.

"This song with the piano puts you in a good mood while also making you thoughtful. I could listen to it at six in the morning while driving, with a smile on my face. The audience will love it," she said.

For Lawal, the collaborations can only be positive.

"Afrobeats might have originated in west Africa, but the future of Afrobeats is international," the Nigerian producer said.

Kizito Ahams, a senior licensing and publishing manager at Mavin Records, said such collaborations met a growing demand for Afrobeats on the international scene, especially in France.

Tie-ups between French and Nigerian artists have soared in recent years.

Last year, Tiakola and Asake released the track "Badman Gangsta", while Joe Dwet File and Burna Boy enjoyed a huge success with their hit "4 Kampe II".

"In every release, when you look at the top of the charts, there is always a track influenced by Afro sounds, especially Afrobeats" in France, said 24-year-old French producer Nassim Diane, also known as Voluptyk.

He attributes the vibrancy of the Nigerian music scene to the talent of the artists and the important role music plays in everyday life in the country.

"There's music everywhere. As soon as you arrive, it's on the buses, in the hotels. It is everywhere. It's truly a country of music," he said.

For Shannon, a singer-songwriter from Martinique , one of the most important parts of the camp was the bridging of different styles that are rarely mashed up, such as Afrobeats and Shatta, a Caribbean mix of dancehall, trap and electronic sounds – to open up new creative paths.

"It blends together beautifully," she said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 07:43:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cb4ada30-fdad-11f0-ac7d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25202734587276.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian Kurdish-led SDF agree ceasefire, phased integration deal with government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-kurdish-led-sdf-agree-ceasefire-phased-integration-deal-with-government-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - The Kurdish-led Democratic Syrian Forces said on Friday they had agreed to a comprehensive ceasefire and a phased integration of military and administrative bodies into the Syrian state under a broad deal, following recent clashes.

The follow-up round of talks was supposed to take place in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, but Zelenskiy said that he did not know when the next meeting would take place.

"It is very important for us that everyone we agreed with be present at the meeting, because everyone is expecting feedback," he told reporters in remarks released by his office on Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had said on Wednesday that President Donald Trump's top envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, who attended the previous round of talks, would not participate in the weekend meeting in Abu Dhabi.

"But the date or the location may change – because, in our view, something is happening in the situation between the United States and Iran. And those developments could likely affect the timing," Zelenskiy said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:40:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NKE2AXPYLBMZ7ODDI6GYI7ZV4E.jpg?auth=4d377c0ab442e5066e208233c4095c1a97c4d71d855163b8509196ca061684c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea, Japan defence ministers agree to upgrade cooperation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-japan-defence-ministers-agree-upgrade-cooperation-2026-01-30/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The defence ministers of South Korea and Japan agreed on Friday to upgrade defence cooperation and plan to work together in incorporating artificial intelligence and unmanned weapon systems, South Korea's Defence Ministry said.

Japanese Defence Minister Shinjiro Koizumi and his South Korean counterpart Ahn Gyu-back held talks in Yokosuka, Japan, and agreed to conduct joint naval search-and-rescue drills, it said in a statement.

The two Asian allies of the United States have in recent months drawn closer in political ties under new leaders, as they looked to put behind years of frosty relations rooted in Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula in the early 20th century.

Ahn and Koizumi discussed working together to ensure peace and stability in the region amid the challenges of the global security environment and continuing defence cooperation with the United States, the ministry said.

The meeting follows talks they held in September in South Korea.

Earlier, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported Koizumi told Ahn defence cooperation between the two countries, and with the United States, was more important than ever.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:41:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4P7M2DOPXBID3ISUWHEJ2E4N6M.jpg?auth=c267b53a37e8ee40442053b70dc7783a22c3b2a62f692fa007fd65b82e773b33&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump brands Minneapolis shooting victim 'agitator and perhaps insurrectionist'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-trump-brands-minneapolis-shooting-victim-agitator-and-perhaps-insurrectionist</link><description>US President Donald Trump said Friday that the man shot dead by US federal agents in Minneapolis last week was an "agitator and perhaps insurrectionist."

"Agitator and, perhaps, insurrectionist, Alex Pretti's stock has gone way down with the just released video of him screaming and spitting in the face of a very calm and under control ICE Officer," he posted on Truth Social.

Trump was referring to footage reportedly showing Pretti in a scuffle with federal agents 11 days before he was shot dead.

The shooting death of Pretti, an intensive-care nurse, by federal agents spurred widespread public outrage, prompting the Trump administration to de-escalate operations in the ‌region.

His killing came just weeks after another activist, Renee Good, was fatally shot blocks away during a separate immigration operation.

The deaths created outrage over the conduct of federal officers operating under Trump's aggressive enforcement campaign.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 08:42:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0a5123ea-fdb0-11f0-8fa2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2258955724.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian forces capture three villages in Ukraine, state media report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-forces-capture-two-villages-ukraine-tass-reports-2026-01-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Russian troops captured three more villages across two regions of Ukraine, state news agencies reported on Friday, citing the Defence Ministry.

He follows Canadian counterpart Mark Carney, who struck a trade deal on a similar visit weeks ago, before heading to Davos to herald a new global trade order as U.S. President Donald Trump disrupts long-standing ties with allies.

European leaders have also visited, as have India's Narendra Modi and others since Trump began his second term a year ago, but it is less clear what tangible long-term economic and security benefits such visits yield for Western powers.

"Traditional U.S. allies feel hard done by and are now hedging their bets, but they are far from being able or willing to substitute China for the United States," said John Quelch, an expert in global strategy at Duke Kunshan University.

From the perspective of London, Ottawa and other Western capitals, the visits demonstrate to Trump that alternatives exist if he keeps up pressure on issues from Greenland to renegotiating the USMCA trade deal among the United States, Canada and Mexico.

But these are "superficial gestures amid stalled global growth," said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.

"These visits highlight the severe limits of any 'pivot' to China," she said. "They expose middle powers' vulnerability, chasing scraps while China's export flood overwhelms their industries."

And they benefit Beijing, by supporting the narrative of a broad pivot to China as the world's " reliable partner ", in contrast with Trump's chaotic tariff policies and his growing list of threats and demands towards partners and rivals alike.

"President Trump’s efforts to decouple the United States from China are also decoupling the United States from the world," Quelch added.

The deals clinched by Western powers on such visits come in return for deeper integration with a country that ran a trade surplus the size of the Dutch economy last year but where consumption is too weak for even its own producers to prosper at home.

On his trip to the world's second largest economy, Starmer secured 30-day visa-free access for Britons travelling to China and lower tariffs on whisky, while British drugmaker AstraZeneca (AZN.L) , opens new tab unveiled a $15 billion investment in China.

He got nothing beyond "frank dialogue" on tension arising from China's increasingly assertive stance on Taiwan, its stronger ties with Russia after the Ukraine invasion and a rights crackdown on Britain's former colony of Hong Kong.

British and U.S. politicians who criticised Starmer's trip also aired accusations of espionage and human rights abuse, which Beijing denies.

Similarly, Carney left China with expectations that Beijing will cut or drop tariffs on canola, lobsters, crabs and peas, but that triggered threats of 100% tariffs from Trump, who warned Ottawa about allowing Chinese EVs into North America.

And even before Starmer has wrapped up his China visit, Trump warned Britain it was dangerous to get into business with Beijing , after the prime minister extolled the economic benefits of resetting relations with China.

China's imports last year were flat at $2.6 trillion, but they were largely driven by energy and commodities from emerging markets, rather than the West.

Its trade surplus, however, jumped a fifth, to a record $1.2 trillion, as its manufacturers responded to Trump's tariff measures by muscling into virtually every other market in the world, at the expense of domestic producers.

Such a pace of growth puts China's trade surplus on track to roughly reach the size of the $3-trillion French economy by 2030 and the $5-trillion German economy by 2033.

Its exports to the European Union last year jumped 8.4%, while imports dipped 0.4%. China shipped 7.8% more to Britain, while buying 4.7% less. With Canada, sales grew 3.2% while purchases plunged 10.4%.

"This makes it an especially risky proposition for countries trying to protect or grow their own manufacturing industries to substantially increase trade integration with China," said Eswar Prasad, a former China director at the International Monetary Fund.

"China hardly provides a safe harbour for countries trying to cope with the adverse economic effects of U.S. tariffs," added Prasad, who now teaches trade policy at Cornell University.

Still, say some analysts, significant trade wins with China may not be as important - or even realistic - for countries such as Britain or Canada right now.

Resetting ties may be the best they can get, but that could still be valuable, as previous deterioration in relations exposed critical supply chain dependencies on China.

The Asian giant's trade countermeasures helped to widen two-way trade imbalances, rather than narrow them, analysts said.

The visits by Starmer and Carney are "a propaganda coup for Beijing," said Noah Barkin, Europe-China expert at the German Marshall Fund and Rhodium Group, while warning, "This is not a pivot to China. It is about reducing tension with Beijing."

He added, "No country wants to be in open conflict with the two superpowers at the same time."</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:35:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4CRQDQE7VO3TKACWVKYRVMTKI.jpg?auth=1b6a86af4d0af5a4bfe1fd581509145fe1cd299cdb4e8bcaab212d8f98a17502&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German commuter transport faces 'standstill' on Monday amid call for strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/world-at-work/german-commuter-transport-faces-standstill-monday-amid-call-strike-2026-01-30/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 30 (Reuters) - German bus and commuter rail services will likely grind to a halt across the country as the main public services trade union called for an almost nationwide strike in a dispute with municipal and state employers over work conditions.

They have arrested two people but one suspect remains at large, he said.

"This is a record catch," Dacic said in a statement, adding that police had also seized four assault rifles and an anti-tank rocket launcher.

Cannabis production remains illegal in Serbia, although activists are promoting its legalisation for medicinal use.

Dacic said the investigation would ascertain the origin of the cannabis.

Serbia, which wants to join the European Union, has stepped up efforts against drug trafficking and production in recent years.

"Within hours of Russian drones with Starlink connectivity appearing over Ukrainian cities, the Ministry of Defence team promptly contacted SpaceX and proposed ways to resolve the problem," Fedorov said on social media.

"I'm grateful to SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell and personally to Elon Musk for their swift response."

Fedorov and the US-based Institute for the Study of War said earlier this week that the Russian army used Starlink satellites to guide its drone attacks deep into Ukraine.

Russia has been battering the country's energy grid as temperatures tumble below freezing and the invasion's fourth anniversary looms.

The ISW said that "Russian forces are increasingly using Starlink satellite systems to extend the range of BM-35 strike drones to conduct mid-range strikes against the Ukrainian rear".

Starlink is also widely used by the Ukrainian army for communications.

"Elon Musk's decision to urgently activate Starlink and send the first batch of terminals to Ukraine at the start of the full-scale invasion was critically important for our country's resilience," Fedorov said.

"Western technologies must continue to support the democratic world and protect civilians, not be used for terror and the destruction of peaceful cities."</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:44:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/76edd494-fdc4-11f0-bda8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-14T113541Z-1679002033-RC2X0JAZHQ92-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-MINISTERS-DEFENCE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria, Kurdish-led SDF reach integration deal after weeks of clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260130-syria-kurdish-led-sdf-reach-integration-deal-after-weeks-of-clashes</link><description>Syria 's government and Kurdish forces reached a comprehensive agreement on Friday that included the gradual integration of the Kurds' forces and administration into the central state, following weeks of clashes between the two sides that led to a ceasefire .

The agreement, shared by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces and Syrian state television, came after the Kurds lost control of swathes of territory to government forces during weeks of fighting.

They now find themselves restricted to Kurdish-majority areas, having once held sway over much of north and northeastern Syria.

The agreement stipulates that government forces will enter the Kurdish-controlled cities of Hasakeh and Qamishli in the northeast, while three Syrian army brigades will be created out of the SDF.

Damascus and the SDF on Sunday extended their ceasefire for 15 days while pursuing talks on integration.

Syria's new Islamist authorities, who took over after the ousting of longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, are seeking to extend state control across Syria.

Syrian security forces will "be deployed in the cities of Hasakeh and Qamishli" in the northeast, currently controlled by Kurdish forces, while a separate brigade will be created for the Kurdish-majority town of Kobane in the north.

The agreement deals a blow to the Kurdish minority's hopes for self-rule, after having established a de facto autonomous administration in areas under their control during Syria's 13-year civil war.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 10:44:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c02ce11c-fdc0-11f0-8134-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TV363-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Viktor Orban’s vampiric presence in Transylvania</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260130-viktor-orban-s-vampiric-presence-in-transylvania-romania-hungary-szekely</link><description>“I refuse to say that I'm from Romania or Hungary , I just will not say that,” states 25-year-old Dalma. “So I always say, ‘I'm from Transylvania, comma, Romania'.”

Dalma is keen to set the record straight: she was born into a Hungarian family in the Szekely Land, a sub-region of Transylvania. She is Romanian by nationality, but she grew up immersed in Hungarian culture and language . She therefore sees herself first and foremost through this identity: Hungarian, from Transylvania, in Romania.

In her home region, Dalma's case is far from isolated: the Szekely Land is home to more Hungarians than Romanians. Some villages are even exclusively Hungarian-speaking, while larger cities are bilingual. In Dalma’s native town of Targu Mures, known in Hungarian as Marosvasarhely, street names, signs and inscriptions at building entrances are all in both languages.

“I feel Romanian, Transylvania is a part of Romania,” says Radu, a 24-year-old medical student who also grew up in Targu Mures, in a Romanian family. He considers himself “100% Romanian” and like many Romanians in the region, he speaks almost no Hungarian, although he does acknowledge that knowing the language would be a significant advantage for practising medicine there.

The presence of a large Hungarian community in Transylvania dates back centuries. And for good reason: until 1920, the region was part of Hungary. At the end of World War I , the Treaty of Trianon was signed in Versailles, marking the dismantling of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Thus the Kingdom of Hungary lost part of its territory, and a large number of its Hungarian-speaking citizens, including those in Transylvania.

Today, the two communities cohabit rather peacefully in Transylvania, but some people still feel strongly about the issue. In 2018, several Hungarian parties in the region presented a plan for territorial and cultural autonomy, based on the model of Catalonia in Spain or South Tyrol in Italy. To date, this initiative has not been successful.

“It's a very taboo subject,” says Radu. “We have to respect our minorities, (...) [but] personally I view Transylvania as a part of Romania. I truly believe that Transylvania belongs to Romania.”

In neighbouring Hungary, the highly conservative Viktor Orban continues to present this chapter in Transylvanian history as a gaping wound for his country. Although in many ways a rhetorical tool, the Hungarian prime minister's attachment to Transylvania is also reflected in very real investments in the region, with Hungary financing schools, nurseries, media outlets, places of worship, stadiums, and more.

In 2011, Orban also decreed that it was no longer necessary to reside on Hungarian territory to obtain Hungarian citizenship. Speaking the language and proving one's Hungarian origins have since then deemed sufficient criteria. Following his decree, over one million Hungarians residing abroad, most of them in Romania, obtained citizenship. And along with it, the right to vote…

Dalma also obtained a Hungarian passport, and she is grateful for it. She now lives and works in the Hungarian capital Budapest. But she also views Orban’s measures with skepticism. “When [being granted citizenship] is tied with the idea that (...) ‘I'm giving you the right to vote,’ I think it transfers a different message,” she says.

Even though the votes of the Hungarian diaspora in Transylvania only account for a very small number of seats in the Hungarian Parliament, Orban may seek to stack the odds in his favour by securing them ahead of the next Hungarian parliamentary elections in April 2026.

Meanwhile, some right-wing Romanian politicians are playing the “Romanian patriotism” card to garner voter support, scapegoating minorities, including the large Hungarian minority, for their own political aims.

The top military officer at the Civil-Military Command Center, a three-star lieutenant general, is expected to be replaced by a U.S. commander of a lower rank, while the top civilian has returned to his job as U.S. ambassador to Yemen.

The CMCC was set up in October in the first phase of President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war, and is meant to supervise the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, facilitate the entry of aid and shape Gaza policy.

The overhaul in its leadership comes amid what western officials and diplomats say is growing uncertainty over the body's future role, as Trump pursues the next phase of his plan including by setting up a "Board of Peace" of foreign dignitaries to supervise Gaza policy.

Lieutenant-General Patrick Frank, the top commander of U.S. Army forces in the Middle East, has been leading the CMCC in southern Israel since it was established. The U.S. military announced last month that he was being promoted to deputy head of U.S. Central Command.

Four diplomats told Reuters he is expected to leave as soon as next week. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The State Department said in a statement that the CMCC's civilian lead, career diplomat Steve Fagin, had returned to his post as U.S. Ambassador to Yemen after holding "the transitional role as civilian lead for CMCC". The department did not say who would replace him. The four diplomats said a replacement for Fagin had not yet been announced.

Diplomats have said the centre has failed to increase aid flows or achieve political change, with some U.S. partners now reconsidering their involvement.

Under the first phase of the ceasefire plan, major fighting has been halted, hostages were released in exchange for prisoners and Israeli forces have withdrawn from nearly half of the Gaza Strip.

But the warring sides accuse each other of violations. More than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed. The vast majority of Gaza's more than 2 million people now live in a small strip of land outside an Israeli-occupied zone, mostly in makeshift tents or damaged buildings.

Trump has announced the second phase of his plan this month, under which Israel would withdraw further and Hamas would relinquish day-to-day control to an internationally backed administration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:29:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6FYCIHXBDVNUTMR5LXGPVYEIUU.jpg?auth=b0fc3d6b0d28740ad82a2b1482dba19b86cd2bd52b9f41f56afb289e6fb52894&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nationwide protests, walkouts planned over fatal ICE shootings in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/nationwide-protests-walkouts-planned-over-fatal-ice-shootings-minneapolis-2026-01-30/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Student organizers have called for walkouts and protests across the United States on Friday to demand that federal immigration agents withdraw from Minnesota, after two fatal shootings of U.S. citizens generated public outrage.

The call for a general strike follows last Friday's protests when thousands marched through Minneapolis in the bitter cold, urging an end to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown in their city.

Protesters said they want to step up pressure even after Trump said he would "de-escalate a little bit" in Minnesota.

"We want this to be more of a sustained movement, so going forward: more striking, more protesting," Brianna Jackson, part of the Black Student Union at the University of Minnesota, said in a video promoting the strike.

On Thursday, U.S. border czar Tom Homan, newly installed as leader of Trump's immigration enforcement surge in Minneapolis, said federal officers would focus on targeted operations , shifting away from the broad street sweeps.

Newly issued internal guidance from a high-ranking official of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency directs federal officers to refrain from unnecessary communication and engagement with "agitators" to avoid "inflaming the situation."

"No work. No school. No shopping. Stop funding ICE," ran a slogan on the website nationalshutdown.org that listed 250 sites for Friday's protests across 46 states and in major cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington.

Voters ousted the Democrats from the White House and returned Trump to power in 2024 partly out of frustration with a surge in illegal immigration to the United States.

But after weeks of videos showing aggressive tactics by heavily armed and masked officers in Minneapolis, American approval of Trump's immigration policy has fallen to its lowest in his second term, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed.

A majority of respondents said his crackdown had gone too far.

A day after last Friday's protests, immigration officers shot and killed Alex Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse at a hospital for military veterans.

Many people were already upset at the shooting death of Renee Good, 37, a mother of three, in her car on January 7.

Good and Pretti had been monitoring immigration officers, as part of a movement that enabled witnesses to capture both shootings on cellphone video.

At a memorial at the site where Pretti was killed, a woman laid a bouquet of flowers and quietly wept on Thursday, saying she felt moved to protest in his memory.

"I’m absolutely not spending any money tomorrow," said Stacy, who asked that her last name not be used. "It’s my little way of being a voice for those who don’t have them, like Alex."

In the southern state of Georgia, students at 90 high schools from Atlanta to Savannah plan to walk out of class on Friday.

"We are saying no business as usual while ICE is allowed to terrorize our communities," said Claudia Andrade, an immigrant rights organizer with Atlanta's Party for Socialism and Liberation.

On the eve of the protests, police in Washington, D.C., arrested 54 demonstrators of different religious affiliations who sat on the floor at the Hart Senate Office Building, holding banners that read "Do Justice, Love kindness, Abolish ICE."

They were demanding that the U.S. Senate withhold funding to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:30:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIXUNSPISNLHRBUQ6WEVRKIH64.jpg?auth=3cb69237ca95085993dc78ba657f0f0262406d97b180cec7be3d01a5cb006b8e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Patagonia wildfires stir criticism over Milei austerity cuts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/patagonia-wildfires-stir-criticism-over-milei-austerity-cuts-2026-01-30/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Patagonia forest fires have destroyed an area more than twice the size of Buenos Aires, stirring criticism over austerity measures under President Javier Milei that have significantly cut aid resources.

On Thursday, the government said it would declare an emergency in the southern provinces of Chubut, Rio Negro, Neuquen and La Pampa to help unlock funds.

Wildfires are common in Patagonia during the summer months, but the current fires have breached Los Alerces National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site famed for its alerce trees, which can live more than 3,600 years, making them the world's second-longest-living tree species.

The current forest fires are concentrated in the province of Chubut, where firefighters are battling strong winds and high temperatures. The government of Chubut has said that more than 110,000 acres (44,515 hectares) have been destroyed so far. The first forest fires of the season began in December.

Milei’s government has pursued aggressive fiscal tightening dubbed "chainsaw" spending cuts and environmental groups have criticized budget cuts that have significantly reduced funding for wildfire prevention and response.

Argentina's 2026 budget slashed funding for the National Fire Management Service by 71% in real terms compared with the previous year, according to FARN, a local non-profit group.

"These fires are absolutely predictable," said Ariel Slipak, an economist at FARN, adding that Milei's government had prioritized a balanced budget over emergency funds "at all costs."

Argentina's Ministry of Security on Thursday said it would allocate about $69 million to support fire fighting efforts.

Milei has previously referred to climate change as a "socialist lie," drawing criticism from environmental activists.

His government has said it is also considering withdrawing from the Paris Agreement, the world's main climate pact, following the example of U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally of Milei, who exited the accord this year.

"To continue denying or underestimating the effects of climate change, which science and the ecological movement have long warned about, is a political irresponsibility that will be paid for by forests and homes," Hernan Giardini of Greenpeace in Argentina in a statement.

The descriptions, based on Reuters interviews with more than two dozen witnesses, included four accounts of fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) telling families the children would be used as slaves, to herd animals.

The RSF has been locked in war with Sudan's army since April 2023 over which side will run a country endowed with rich mineral reserves, plentiful arable land and Red Sea ports. While human rights groups have reported alleged war crimes by both sides including the recruitment of child combatants, the abduction and enslavement of children by the RSF and allied militias has not been previously reported by other media.

The 26 witnesses spoke to Reuters in person or by phone after fleeing to the North Darfur town of Tawila or to eastern Chad. They described 23 separate incidents in which at least 56 children aged between two months and 17 years were abducted in attacks dating back to 2023.

Six described their own relatives being taken.

Reuters could not determine how many children in total have been abducted, and could not independently verify the witness accounts or trace what happened to the children after they were taken.

The RSF did not respond to requests for comment about the reported abductions and abuse of minors and killing of their parents. Previously it has denied deliberately targeting civilians and says it has placed fighters suspected of abuses under investigation.

Three legal experts said the abductions may constitute unlawful imprisonment and torture, and amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.

The accounts gathered by Reuters may also constitute acts of enslavement and slave trading that violate international laws and multiple international treaties, said one of the experts, Patricia Sellers, an international lawyer and former special adviser for slavery crimes at the International Criminal Court.

Sheldon Yett, head of U.N. children's agency UNICEF in Sudan, said he had not received any reports of children being kidnapped specifically to be used as slaves or to tend to livestock, but said the accounts gathered by Reuters "are sadly consistent with the broader pattern of grave violations we continue to see against children". He did not elaborate.

The RSF evolved from the so-called Janjaweed militias that fought alongside government forces under the rule of former Sudanese leader Omar al-Bashir and were accused of genocide in Darfur in the early 2000s. During that conflict, the Janjaweed abducted children and forced them to do domestic work, look after livestock, or work as sex slaves, according to reports at the time by activists and human rights groups.

Asked for comment on the witness accounts of abductions during the current war, the Sudanese army said such acts were "consistent with those of the Janjaweed militia during the previous regime."

Sudan's army-backed government "cannot accept leaving citizens hostage to the militias' violence," it said in a statement to Reuters.

The RSF has previously denied responsibility for atrocities blamed on its fighters in Darfur.

The war has killed tens of thousands of people and led to famine and disease, in what the United Nations has called the world's largest humanitarian crisis. The RSF and its allies have been blamed for mass killings against ethnic non-Arabs.

In late October the RSF consolidated its grip over Darfur when it took al-Fashir, a city that had sheltered many displaced people and which the paramilitary force had attacked and besieged for 18 months. Witnesses accused it of abuses including summary killings .

During a briefing at the U.N. Security Council on January 20, deputy ICC prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan said her office was investigating alleged crimes committed by the RSF in al-Fashir, with a particular focus on violence against women, girls, and children.

Khan said that based on the evidence collected so far, her office believes war crimes and crimes against humanity occurred in the city in late October during the culmination of the RSF's siege of al-Fashir.

The RSF did not respond to a request for comment on Khan's assertion.

In most cases, the witnesses described RSF fighters taking children whose parents had recently been killed, at gunpoint or after beating the children.

In some cases, six witnesses said, the children had seen their parents being killed.

Ten witnesses interviewed by Reuters in Chad described RSF fighters abducting children during the takeover of al-Fashir.

Abductions took place in the city and along the road to Tawila, a town about 50 km (31 miles) to the west where the U.N. estimates approximately 665,000 displaced people are sheltering, the witnesses said.

Madina Adam Khamis, 38, said she was held captive at al-Fashir University with other women and children after they tried to flee the city on October 26.

At the university she said she watched an RSF fighter known as Abu Lulu shoot many of the captives, including a woman seven months pregnant, and 10 children.

She said Abu Lulu and his group of fighters took three girls and two boys aged between two and five years old, whose mothers they had killed, and put them in the back of a Toyota Land Cruiser. Another fighter took a 2-month-old baby from the arms of one of the girls and sat in the vehicle with the baby as well, she said. She said the children were from al-Fashir, but did not know their names.

"There was one child who lost her mother, the mother died in front of our eyes, and the child was touching her mother to try to get her to wake up," Khamis said.

Reuters could not independently corroborate Khamis' account.

The RSF told Reuters in December that Abu Lulu was in its custody and it was investigating him and several other RSF soldiers regarding abuses committed in the aftermath of the takeover of al-Fashir.

In the wake of the RSF seizing the city, videos online showing Abu Lulu shooting dead unarmed captives, some of which have been verified by Reuters, gained global attention.

The RSF did not respond to a Reuters request to speak to Abu Lulu.

Mohammed Adam Bashir, 38, said he saw RSF fighters take two boys of around four to five years old and a girl of about three years old, after shooting their mothers dead, as he was fleeing north from al-Fashir to Torro village on October 26. He said the fighters put the children in the back seat of an armoured Land Cruiser.

"They pulled the children away from their two mothers who were dying," he said. "They took them to the car and then they came back to ask us for money."

None of the witnesses interviewed by Reuters saw what happened after children were taken. One, Abdulmajeed Abdulkarim, 28, said he heard children crying for their parents at night while he was being held captive in a bush area close to the village of Garney in the days after al-Fashir fell.

Researchers who have interviewed people displaced by the violence in Darfur collected similar testimonies.

A report last month by Amnesty International documented the account , opens new tab of one child who said he was abducted by RSF fighters in Zamzam displacement camp close to al-Fashir, and forced to work.

He said he was chained at night and forced to herd sheep by day for more than six weeks.

His captor called his relatives to demand a ransom of five million Sudanese pounds ($1,500). After they paid, he was released, Amnesty said.

Reuters, which didn't independently verify Amnesty's findings, has previously reported that the RSF has held large groups of adult survivors from al-Fashir for ransom. An RSF adviser said at the time that rivals disguised in RSF uniforms were responsible for most such cases.

Seven witnesses who spoke to Reuters said fighters referred to the children they took as "falungiat", or children of falungi, a term that roughly translates to house slaves and is used as a derogatory term for allies of the Sudanese army.

The witnesses, who were mainly from the Zaghawa tribe, said fighters from the RSF's Arab-dominated force addressed them with racial slurs. The RSF did not respond to a question about possible racial motivations for the abductions.

Several of the witnesses described the RSF taking children alongside seized livestock. Four said RSF fighters told them the children would be used to look after animals - a role commonly assigned to children in the region.

Sixteen witnesses described abductions that took place before the takeover of al-Fashir.

Imam Ali, 26, said he fled besieged al-Fashir in March 2025 with his family and was attacked southeast of Tawila by RSF fighters who arrived with camels, motorcycles, and a car. The fighters shot two of his brothers and abducted the other two, aged 15 and 13, along with 60 of their sheep, he said. He hasn't heard from the kidnapped brothers since.

Fatima Yahya, 47, said she left Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, in October 2023, and was stopped by a group of RSF fighters in a village called Karamaje, as she fled to al-Fashir with other families.

There the fighters blindfolded two boys and one girl of about nine years old and put the children in the middle seats of three double-cabin Land Cruisers, with two fighters on either side, she said. She said she did not know the children but that they were from Nyala, and two had lost their mothers in bombardments there.

"They told us the kids would look after the animals," Yahya said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:30:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D5MLLLLLCROITKTMZ3DAT4DVBM.jpg?auth=63c41339ecd28b16fdf69f7cbd94a499ff33f71da4263ae3a498aca861d7a426&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US energy assistance for Ukraine stalls as winter bites</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-energy-assistance-ukraine-stalls-winter-bites-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - U.S. and European officials are growing increasingly worried as hundreds of millions of dollars in U.S. energy assistance promised to Ukraine remain unreleased, even as a bone-cold winter pushes the nation's war‑damaged power grid to the brink, said several sources familiar with the matter.

The funds in question were originally slated to help Ukraine import liquefied natural gas and rebuild energy infrastructure damaged by Russian strikes, said the sources, who include a U.S. official and a Ukrainian official. The U.S. Agency for International Development had notified Congress during former President Joe Biden's administration of its intention to disburse at least some of the funds, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

After USAID was effectively shuttered in the opening weeks of the Trump administration, however, some of the funds fell into what the sources described as bureaucratic limbo.

Some administration officials have argued for the State Department - which oversees what is left of USAID - to disburse the funds, the sources said. Others have instead pushed for a role for the Development Finance Corporation, a previously obscure federal agency expected to play a major role in Ukraine's reconstruction.

The Trump administration has paused or delayed Ukraine aid before. For example, the U.S. has temporarily halted military aid shipments several times, in some cases to force concessions from Ukraine amid ongoing U.S.-led peace negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv.

This time, the delay in energy aid appears to stem from bureaucratic confusion and infighting instead of an attempt to exert leverage over Ukraine, two of the sources said.

Still, the stalled aid - valued at roughly $250 million by two of the sources - has stirred frustration in recent weeks, as Russian attacks on power plants and pipelines have left millions of Ukrainians exposed to brutal winter cold, according to a Ukrainian official, a U.S. official, a European official and two others with knowledge of the matter.

One source said aides on Capitol Hill were aware of the stalled funds and were seeking additional information.

A Ukrainian official said Kyiv was also aware, but fearful that broaching the topic could provoke diplomatic blowback. U.S. President Donald Trump has at times reacted coolly to Ukrainian requests for assistance.

Halyna Yusypiuk, a spokeswoman for the Ukrainian embassy in Washington, said Ukraine and the U.S. were working closely on energy-related matters.

"(The) Ukrainian and American sides are working on a daily basis to strengthen the stability of Ukraine's energy system," she wrote in an e-mail.

A Development Finance Corporation spokesperson said the agency is "working closely with all interagency partners with the goal of supporting Ukraine's reconstruction efforts and advancing shared economic security and prosperity for the United States and Ukraine."

The White House's Office of Management and Budget, in an apparent reference to a critical USAID inspector general report, suggested energy assistance funds for Ukraine had been misused in the past.

"The Biden Admin support to Ukraine's energy sector was a disaster, we have an USAID IG report showcasing how contractors in Ukraine likely lost millions worth of energy products due to no oversight, corruption, theft, etc," a spokesperson wrote in an email.

"President Trump has done more than anyone to bring peace to this brutal war."

The sweeping changes to the federal bureaucracy imposed by the Trump administration have complicated U.S. efforts to distribute aid to its allies.

The de facto elimination of USAID, for instance, has caused confusion about how and when to disburse funds, several sources told Reuters.

Additionally, the National Security Council, which in previous administrations would sort out conflicts between intelligence, national security and diplomatic agencies, has been radically downsized.

Beyond this, energy assistance for Ukraine has long been slow to go out the door amid concerns about widespread corruption in the nation's power sector, said one source.

Residents of Ukraine's major cities, including Kyiv, are currently struggling with power outages that are lasting hours or days, as well as cuts to heating that leave homes as cold as 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Celsius). Water supplies have also been disrupted.

The rumble of generators is a near-constant presence on city streets, which are often plunged into widespread darkness in the evenings. Overnight lows in Kyiv are expected to fall to around -12 Fahrenheit next week.

Ukrainian officials told foreign diplomats in Kyiv in recent days that all of the country's major energy plants had been "damaged or ruined," according to a presentation seen by Reuters. The presentation identified roughly 675 million euros ($807 million) in unfunded energy needs.

"They're preparing for the fact that people in the upper (stories) of apartment buildings are going to freeze to death," Mykola Murskyj, the director of advocacy at Razom, a non-profit group supporting Ukraine, said of next week's expected cold snap.

"They're preparing to retrieve the bodies. It's extremely grim."</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q2IYZCGQPFL77DGVIAYNZ2MTWY.jpg?auth=1740058c7d54976ebdada0c6cc97c579f8bb785aea1735ae024e5d44d1be0253&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa declares Israel's chargé d'affaires persona non grata</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/south-africa-declares-israels-charg-daffaires-persona-non-grata-2026-01-30/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - South Africa has declared Israel's chargé d'affaires Ariel Seidman persona non grata, its foreign affairs ministry said on Friday.

It accused Seidman of "unacceptable violations of diplomatic norms and practice which pose a direct challenge to South Africa's sovereignty".

"These violations include the repeated use of official Israeli social media platforms to launch insulting attacks against His Excellency President Cyril Ramaphosa, and a deliberate failure to inform DIRCO (South Africa's foreign affairs ministry) of purported visits by senior Israeli officials," the ministry said.

Israel's diplomatic mission in Pretoria did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

His declarations and executive orders have led to the dismantling of slavery exhibits, the restoration of Confederate statues and other moves that civil rights advocates say could reverse decades of social progress.

Here are some actions that Trump has taken to reshape American historical sites and cultural bodies since returning to the White House:

Trump signed an executive order just weeks after taking office targeting what he said was the spread of "anti-American ideology" at the Smithsonian Institution and calling for the ideology's removal from the vast museum and research complex, a premier exhibition space for U.S. history and culture.

The order also directed the Interior Department to restore federal parks, monuments and memorials that had been "removed or changed in the last years to perpetuate a false revision of history."

Last August, Trump decried in a social media post what he said was an excessive focus on " how bad slavery was ." This month, in an interview with the New York Times, he said civil rights protections hurt white people, when asked about policies that followed from the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

The NAACP, the largest U.S. civil rights group, said Trump's remarks were laying the groundwork to roll back social progress. Racial justice group Black Lives Matter said , opens new tab Trump's remarks showed he wanted to deny the atrocities of slavery.

Following Trump's March 2025 executive order on anti-American ideology, the U.S. Interior Department said all national parks' interpretive signage - the plaques and panels that explain sites and events - was under review as the Trump administration attempted to reshape public spaces and museums.

U.S. National Park Service staff subsequently removed a slavery exhibit on January 22 from a Philadelphia historic site where George Washington once lived. The exhibit included a reference to Washington's ownership of enslaved people.

The Washington Post reported that U.S. officials have also ordered national parks to remove dozens of signs and displays related to slavery and the mistreatment of Native Americans by settlers.

The National Park Service said last August it would reinstall a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike that had been toppled and vandalized in 2020 during racial justice protests after George Floyd's murder.

Civil rights groups say such moves undermine the acknowledgment of critical phases of American history. "Stripping enslaved people's stories from museum exhibits, monuments, and digital archives is not neutrality - it is erasure," the NAACP said , opens new tab .

Trump harshly criticized the Smithsonian in a social media post last year, saying it would face the same process as colleges and universities whose funding came under threat for policies that displeased the Trump administration.

The 180-year-old Smithsonian, which includes 21 museums and galleries and the National Zoo, receives most of its budget from the U.S. Congress but is independent of the government in decision-making.

The White House launched an internal review of some Smithsonian museums last year, saying it would assess the tone and historical framing of exhibition text, websites, educational materials and digital content. The Smithsonian said it would engage "constructively."

Trump named himself chairman of the Kennedy Center and filled its board with allies last year. In December, the institution's board voted to rename it the Donald J. Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Trump has previously criticized the institution as too liberal.

Many groups and artists have since withdrawn from the center, citing the Republican leader's takeover. Democrats, noting that the center's name was established by Congress, have said Trump's rebranding has no force of law. John F. Kennedy's family denounced the renaming as undermining the slain president's legacy.

The Trump administration announced last April that the Environmental Protection Agency would close a one-room museum at its headquarters on the agency's history, citing cost cuts.

Last May, Trump attacked historian Kim Sajet , director of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, calling her partisan. She announced the following month that she would step down. Late last year, the White House fired several members of the National Council on the Humanities.

Internationally, Trump has withdrawn the U.S. from dozens of global and U.N. entities, including cultural and refugee agencies, saying they do not benefit Washington.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:32:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6SGP5FCPTBLJRND45ZNUP5GTQE.jpg?auth=8a43bd06213796f9cd54deb275bf08ef662c8b86230271a2d76c4b0381839e8b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel military reported to accept death toll of around 70,000 in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-military-reported-accept-death-toll-around-70000-gaza-2026-01-30/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Israel's military has accepted that around 70,000 Palestinians were killed during the war in Gaza, after having earlier cast doubt on death tolls reported by the enclave's health officials, Israeli media reported on Friday citing senior military officials.

The United Nations has long accepted death tolls recorded by health authorities in Gaza as accurate. Israel has cast doubt on the figures, arguing that the health ministry in the enclave was run by Hamas and could not be trusted.

The Gaza health ministry publishes names and ages of those it records as killed. It now says the toll stands at over 71,000, including more than 480 killed in Israeli attacks since the start of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in October.

It says many thousands more are still buried beneath the rubble of Gaza's destroyed cities. It does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has identified most of the dead as women or children.

Citing a briefing on Thursday with senior military officials, Israel's Ynet news website and other leading outlets reported that the military had adopted a similar estimate.

"In our estimation, around 70,000 Gazans were killed during the war, not including missing persons," Ynet cited an official as saying.

"We are currently doing the work of distinguishing between terrorists and those who were not involved," the official was quoted as saying.

Asked for comment, Israel's military said that "the details published do not reflect official (Israel Defence Forces) data."

It added: "Any publication or report on this matter will be released through official and orderly channels."

"The return of residents from Egypt to the Gaza Strip will be permitted, in coordination with Egypt, for residents who left Gaza during the course of the war only, and only after prior security clearance by Israel," COGAT said.

The Rafah crossing is effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there.

Israel seized the border crossing in May 2024, about nine months into the Gaza war . Reopening it was an important requirement under the first phase of U.S. President Donald Trump 's plan to stop fighting between Israel and Hamas militants, which followed a ceasefire agreed in October.

Israel had said it would reopen it only after recovering the body of the last Israeli hostage in Gaza, which took place this week.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:55:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T42RYOAPMRJ3FOMZCTD7N45UM4.jpg?auth=70ae5ac53f776c773138d28e5fac34a94da6f34ee11661ff4080c07873271eb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: How does Iran's system of power work?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/how-does-irans-system-power-work-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United States is considering new military strikes against the Islamic Republic of Iran over its deadly suppression of protests this month.

The complexities of Iran's ruling system, the ideological nature of its support base, and the power of its Revolutionary Guards make it hard to predict its resilience or vulnerability in the face of external attack, or what might come next.

The following explains how the system operates and who the main figures are in today's Iran:

Iran's political system is based on the theory of vilayat-e faqih ("rule of the jurist"), which holds that until the return of the Shi'ite Muslim 12th Imam, who disappeared in the ninth century, power on earth should be wielded by a supreme cleric.

The first Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, was the charismatic father figure of the 1979 Islamic Revolution who developed the model of a cleric standing above an elected government.

His successor, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has cemented that role since becoming leader in 1989. This has ensured he retains the ultimate say on all major policy decisions and has built a parallel system of rule, alongside that of the elected government, staffed with loyalists.

Khamenei's sway has often been wielded through the National Security Council headed by longtime adviser Ali Larijani. Other advisers to Khamenei, including former defence minister Ali Shamkhani and former foreign minister Ali Akbar Velayati, have also played prominent roles.

Khamenei, 86, has not named a successor and it's not clear who would replace him if he was killed or ousted.

His son, Mojtaba Khamenei , has at times been seen as a possible candidate. His predecessor's grandson, Hassan Khomeini, has been another, as have some older senior clerics.

Iran's clerical elite control powerful bodies that extend their influence throughout the political system.

The Assembly of Experts, made up of senior ayatollahs elected every eight years, is the body that appoints the supreme leader. The constitution also gives it power to question and even dismiss a leader, but it has never done so.

The Guardian Council - half appointed by the leader and half by the judiciary chief - can veto laws passed by parliament and disqualify election candidates, a mandate that has been used to block potential critics of Khamenei.

Another clerical body, the Expediency Council, appointed by Khamenei, resolves disputes between the elected parliament and the Guardian Council.

Iran follows Shi'ite interpretations of Islamic sharia law and its judges are also clerics under a judiciary chief named by Khamenei. The current head, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, was sanctioned by Western countries for a violent crackdown on protesters in 2009 when he was intelligence minister.

Other influential clerics include Expediency Council head and former judiciary chief Sadiq Larijani, the brother of Ali Larijani; Assembly of Experts and Expediency Council member Mohsen Araki; and Tehran Friday prayer leader Ahmad Khatami.

However, not all clerics - even senior ones - are necessarily supporters of Iran's theocratic system or its current rulers. Some have been dissidents, others like former President Mohammed Khatami have unsuccessfully tried to reform and soften the existing system.

Unlike the ordinary military, which comes under the Defence Ministry in the elected government, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps answers directly to the Supreme Leader.

Formed soon after the revolution, the IRGC's role defending the Islamic system greatly expanded during the 1980-88 war with Iraq and it is now the strongest and best-equipped section of Iran's armed forces.

Over the decades, the Guards have extended their influence through the worlds of politics and business, gaining in power at home and abroad.

The Quds Force, an elite Guards unit, has spearheaded Iran's regional strategy of supporting affiliated Shi'ite groups across the Middle East, most notably in Lebanon and Iraq. That strategy was hard-hit by the U.S. assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani in a 2020 air strike in Iraq, and by Israel's pummelling of Lebanon's Hezbollah in a 2024 war.

The Basij militia, a part-time paramilitary force under Guards control, is often used to quell protests inside Iran.

Since the early 2000s, the Guards' economic power has grown as its contracting company Khatam al-Anbiya won projects worth billions of dollars in Iran's oil and gas sector.

The targeted nature of Israeli strikes on senior Guards commanders last year and Hezbollah leaders in 2024 has raised questions over possible Western intelligence penetration in the corps' upper echelons.

However, Guards commander Mohammad Pakpour, his deputy Ahmad Vahidi, the IRGC's naval chief Alireza Tangsiri and current Quds Force commander Esmail Ghaani remain powerful figures.

Iranians elect a president and a parliament to four-year terms. The president appoints a government that handles daily policy within parameters permitted by the Supreme Leader.

During the early years of the Islamic Republic the votes drew mass participation. But Guardian Council restrictions on candidates and a much-disputed election outcome in 2009 undermined trust among many voters, while the Supreme Leader's overarching role has reduced the scope for elected bodies.

President Masoud Pezeshkian, seen as a moderate, was elected in 2024 after a first-round vote with around 40% turnout, and a run-off in which about half the electorate took part. He defeated Saeed Jalili, a Khamenei loyalist and anti-Western hardliner who remains influential.

The parliament speaker since 2020 has been former Guards commander Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 11:55:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KF4KTQHCGRKELF4N5X635Q6GII.jpg?auth=e05cfdf6de4c77800a4ad9abb8351b0b963ae93c04779475a6406d1e22102894&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: European crisis fund worth over $500 billion could be used for defence, says ESM chief</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/500-billion-euro-crisis-fund-could-be-used-defence-says-esm-chief-2026-01-30/</link><description>FRANKFURT, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A European crisis fund with more than 430 billion euros ($514 billion) of firepower could lend money to countries for defence, the head of the European Stability Mechanism told Reuters, as the bloc scrambles to reinforce its military.

Pierre Gramegna, managing director of the European Stability Mechanism, said the ESM could give credit lines for defence and would not demand stringent economic reform in return, in part to dispel any stigma that might arise from asking the emergency euro zone fund for money.

"In these times of geopolitical turmoil, which have triggered higher expenditure , defence costs for all countries, we must use the full potential of the ESM," said Gramenga.

He pointed to the use of credit lines for defence for countries in good financial health but whose budgets are stretched, in particular smaller euro zone states.

"We have instruments," he said. "It is in the best interests of Europe ... to use the full potential."

"It is obvious that the relationship between Europe and the United States is becoming more and more bumpy."

Any such financial support would be symbolically important, repurposing a fund set up at the height of the euro zone debt crisis to stave off the collapse of national economies, banks and shore up the currency.

U.S. President Donald Trump's open hostility towards Europe is forcing its political leaders to scour for alternative means of defending the region against Russian aggression .

Gramegna's remarks suggest a willingness to use the vast European reserve to reinforce euro zone countries, in particular smaller Baltic nations bordering Russia, although loans first need to be signed off by the 21 euro zone countries backing the ESM.

Only countries in the euro zone could get the loans, excluding those who do not use the currency, such as Poland. The ESM makes no explicit mention of defence in its mission and any such shift would require the blessing of member states, including from militarily neutral countries like Austria, Cyprus, Malta or Ireland.

Europe's attempts to boost its defences, four years after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine , have taken on greater urgency since Trump threatened trade tariffs on countries that rejected his claim on Greenland, a Danish territory.

Gramegna hinted at a potential role for the ESM, which was set up during the debt crisis to lend to countries such as Greece but has since become largely redundant.

"It is one of our instruments," he said, referring to using so-called precautionary credit lines for defence. "It's available. We need to rediscover the potential of that instrument."

"You need to guarantee that this facility ... has to be used for defence expenditure," he said, adding that it would not come with draconian terms. "The whole goal here is to avoid that this type of tool is combined with restructuring of the economy."

His comments breathe fresh life into a "defence support line" earlier suggested by former Italian prime minister Enrico Letta to lend up to 2% of a country's economic output at low interest rates for defence.

Gramegna's proposal mirrors an ESM crisis support scheme worth up to 240 billion euros set up during the COVID pandemic to help countries spend on healthcare. That ultimately remained unused.

The Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia could stand to benefit. They have almost quadrupled spending on defence since Russia invaded Ukraine to roughly 5% of their economic output, borrowing heavily to cover the bill.

Those countries, which border Russia and its close ally Belarus, have suffered an increasing number of sabotage attacks that law enforcement agencies blame on Russia.

They borrowed billions of euros from the EU's oversubscribed SAFE loans scheme for defence projects, where the EU jointly borrows money on the market to lend it on at cost to EU governments for defence. ESM support would work similarly.

If set up like the pandemic support, the loans would have considerable weight across the EU. Estonia had a gross domestic product of roughly 40 billion euros in 2024 - 2% of that would be less than 1 billion euros.

Gramegna said countries could make "collective requests", which would avoid any stigma attached to asking for assistance from the ESM. "The impetus has to come from the member countries," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:57:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXZE2EW2YNPFDPMBNAPWZVORYY.jpg?auth=23527f4d4cbd3a75700fe14100cc37011f38e922dade381ab3362f7f65c8c780&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China to lift restrictions on UK lawmakers, PM Starmer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/china-lift-restrictions-uk-lawmakers-pm-starmer-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 30 (Reuters) - China is set to lift restrictions which it had imposed on a group of British lawmakers, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Friday, meaning that they will now be free to travel to China.

Starmer made the announcement during his four-day visit to China , the first by a UK leader in eight years, aimed at improving relations despite ongoing concerns over espionage, human rights and other issues.

The Prime Minister told the BBC that he raised the issue of sanctioned lawmakers with China's President Xi Jinping, who responded that "restrictions no longer apply".

"President Xi said to me that means all parliamentarians are free to travel to China," Starmer said. "One of the benefits of engaging is to not only seize the opportunities, but to raise those difficult sensitive issues."

In 2021, China imposed sanctions on nine Britons, including Iain Duncan Smith, the former leader of the Conservative Party, accusing them of spreading what it called "lies and disinformation" about alleged human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

Starmer's spokesperson said Britain would not be lifting sanctions on Chinese individuals in return for the lifting of restrictions on the British parliamentarians.

Some of the group of sanctioned British lawmakers said in a statement responding to the possible lifting that they would rather remain under sanction than have their status used as a "bargaining chip" to justify the removal of Chinese officials from Britain's sanctions list.

"We would reject any deal that prioritises our personal convenience over the pursuit of justice for the Uyghur people," the group, which includes former security minister Tom Tugendhat, said in a statement.

China last year lifted sanctions on members of the European Parliament and its human rights subcommittee.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:57:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FLTBWQC2WRL5RJ26UU2FDNHR3A.jpg?auth=f3e6c59ee89154254ea80ce89c86cbbbfa2ab525c24266c9e63431137f4485fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran to label EU armed forces as 'terrorists' over Guards blacklist</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-label-eu-armed-forces-terrorists-over-guards-blacklist-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - Iran plans to designate the armed forces of European Union countries that have blacklisted the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as "terrorists", according to a post by top Iranian security official Ali Larijani on X.

"I have known Kevin for a long period of time, and have no ‌doubt that he will go down as one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best. On top of everything else, he is 'central casting, and he will never let you down," Trump said in announcing his latest move to put his stamp on a Fed he persistently criticizes for not caving to his demands for deep reductions in borrowing costs.

U.S. stock index futures pared declines after Trump's announced pick of Warsh, who markets perceive as someone who would support lower rates but who would stop well short of the more aggressive easing associated with some of the other potential nominees.

Trump announced the nomination, which requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate, in a post on social media. No public events have been listed on the president's schedule for Friday involving the ‌Fed.

The Fed has long been seen as a stabilizing force in global financial markets due in no small part to its perceived independence from politics.

Trump's escalating efforts to test ​that independence, including his Justice Department's decision earlier this month to open a criminal probe into Powell, have set the stage for a challenging Senate confirmation process for any successor.

Republican U.S. Senator Thom Tillis has said he will not support any of Trump's Fed nominees amid the ongoing probe , while fellow Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has called for an investigation into the department's actions.

It has also opened the door to the possibility that Powell, who called the criminal probe a pretext to pressure ‍the Fed into setting monetary policy as the president wishes, may opt to stay on at the Fed as a governor even after his term as central bank chief is up in a bid to safeguard it from political capture.

The nomination caps a months-long process that often resembled a public audition as Warsh, White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett and other top contenders - including sitting Fed governor Christopher Waller and Wall Street insider Rick Rieder - appeared regularly on television to tout their credentials and showcase their thoughts about the economy and Fed policy.

Trump in August named ⁠White House economic adviser Stephen Miran to fill a vacant governor's seat on the Fed, where he has become a leading proponent of the aggressive rate cuts that Trump has long sought. Trump has also tried to force out Fed Governor Lisa Cook in ‍a battle now before the Supreme Court that, if successful, would mark the first time a president has ever fired a U.S. central bank policymaker.

While Warsh is no White House insider, he has been a confidant of ‌the president and ‌a guest at the president's Florida estate, and looks poised to push many of Trump's priorities as a "shadow" Fed chief until Powell's tenure in the top job ends in mid-May.

A lawyer and distinguished visiting fellow in economics at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, Warsh has said he believes the president is right to press the central bank for steep rate cuts, and has criticized the Fed for underestimating the inflation-busting potential of productivity growth supercharged by artificial intelligence.

He has also called for a broad overhaul of the central bank that would slim its balance sheet and ease bank regulations.

Warsh, 55, was nearly named to the job in Trump's first term before being passed over for Powell, and since then has kept a steady ⁠public profile through speeches and essays that have taken Powell ⁠and his colleagues to task for their management of ​the Fed's balance sheet, interest rates and other actions.

He now will be responsible for an institution he has said should scale back its footprint in the economy and change the way it manages monetary policy.

It is not clear how the pick may affect the trajectory of rates in the short term. The Fed's three rate cuts in 2025 brought its benchmark interest rate to the 3.50%-3.75% range. Earlier this week, citing stronger growth and a stabilizing labor market, it left rates on hold and signaled a pause ahead; ‍markets for now don't expect another rate cut until the June 16-17 meeting, when Powell's successor is expected to be in place.

With a background on Wall Street, including as a partner in the office managing the wealth of investing giant Stanley Druckenmiller, and family ties to major Trump supporter Ron Lauder, Warsh will be under an intense spotlight to prove his independence from the president.

As a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011, Warsh's familiarity with Wall Street executives and investors made him a chief liaison to the financial community for then-Fed Chair Ben ​Bernanke during the 2007-2009 financial crisis.

Though he did not dissent against the massive bond purchases Bernanke used to nurse the economy out of ‍what proved a long downturn, he was concerned they would stoke inflation and eventually resigned. Warsh's inflation concerns proved misplaced, but the large size of the Fed's balance sheet, and the role it plays in managing interest rates, remain a concern.

He now argues that shrinking the Fed's big balance ​sheet would allow it to "redeploy" excess liquidity in financial markets to the real economy by lowering the central bank's policy rate.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 12:59:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3A3YORDCFOP7PZRREBJNTN5BU.jpg?auth=079d675f57424ad7f2ffa023cc031db796e2cea944619453c790a64954f043dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump names former Fed governor ‍Kevin Warsh to replace Powell as US ‌central ‍bank head</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-trump-names-former-fed-governor-kevin-warsh-to-replace-powell-as-us-central-bank-head</link><description>President Donald Trump on Friday chose former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh to head the US central bank when Jerome Powell 's leadership term ends in ⁠May, giving a frequent Fed critic a chance to put his idea of monetary policy "regime change" into practice at a moment when the president has pushed for more control over the central bank.

"We have not been able to determine exactly what happened or who was behind the breach but we do believe that the digital domain still is the main suspect," the permanent secretary of the committee that bestows the award told Reuters on Friday.

Bets on Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado winning the prize spiked on October 10, hours before the name of the 2025 laureate was due to be announced in Oslo.

An initial bet was placed on Machado's name to win the prize, rising quickly to some $2.2 million as others followed, Kristian Berg Harpviken said. Machado's name had not been mentioned ahead of time by any of the experts nor the media.

One of Norway's three intelligence agencies was involved in the ensuing investigation of whether there was an internal leak or whether it was the result of spying, either by a criminal actor or a state entity, but it remains unclear who was behind the leak and how it unfolded, Harpviken said.

And while financial bets were placed, it was not known whether the ultimate purpose was to profit from the incident or to inflict damage to the credibility of the prize, he said, adding that the institute's efforts have now turned to preventing future breaches.

Machado won the award for fighting dictatorship in Venezuela and dedicated the award in part to U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly insisted he deserved to win himself.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NPO5JJN5KNIBLNGGPTW5NPCQVE.jpg?auth=f5aa6d1ef69105fb9668ae78f5d68ce1a1ed51e1ae7c491ff73ae5cb36f8800b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief Guterres warns of 'imminent financial collapse'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/un-chief-guterres-warns-imminent-financial-collapse-2026-01-30/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.N. chief has told states that the organisation is at risk of "imminent financial collapse", citing unpaid fees and a budget rule that forces the global body to return unspent money, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Friday.

"The crisis is deepening, threatening programme delivery and risking financial collapse. And the situation will deteriorate further in the near future," United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in a letter to ambassadors dated January 28.

The U.N. is facing a cash crisis as the world body's largest contributor - the United States - has slashed voluntary funding to U.N. agencies and refused to make mandatory payments to the U.N.'s regular and peacekeeping budgets.

In the letter, Guterres said "decisions not to honour assessed contributions that finance a significant share of the approved regular budget have now been formally announced."

It was not immediately clear which state or states he was referring to and a U.N. spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

“Either all Member States honour their obligations to pay in full and on time – or Member States must fundamentally overhaul our financial rules to prevent an imminent financial collapse," he said, warning that cash could run out by July.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CFSJJ7WOTZJ5BB3FKZ3LJ37ZCE.jpg?auth=15c3f4bbf40fc19af023fa47c05c4ff62b6ea43232c17cba788286e04e64dc81&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudanese man jailed in UK for murdering asylum hotel worker</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/sudanese-man-jailed-uk-murdering-asylum-hotel-worker-2026-01-30/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A Sudanese asylum seeker was jailed on Friday for a minimum of 29 years for murdering a woman who worked at the hotel in central England where he and other migrants were being housed.

Anti-immigration activists have seized on other criminal cases involving asylum seekers, predominantly young men, in hotels to argue that they are a danger to nearby communities.

Last summer, a number of protests at asylum hotels across England – sparked by the arrest of an Ethiopian asylum seeker for sexually assaulting a teenage girl and a woman – turned violent.

The Labour government, nervous of the rise of the anti-immigration Reform UK party in opinion polls, has promised to clamp down on illegal immigration and, by 2029, to stop placing asylum seekers in hotels while their cases are processed.

Deng Chol Majek followed Rhiannon Whyte, 27, to a railway station in October 2024 after she finished her shift.

He stabbed her 23 times to the head, chest and arm with a screwdriver. She died in hospital three days later.

Majek was convicted in October and sentenced on Friday to life imprisonment with a minimum of 29 years at Coventry Crown Court, where some anti-immigration protesters gathered outside for the hearing.

Judge Michael Soole said the murder was "particularly vicious" and told Majek there had been a "chilling composure in every aspect of your behaviour".</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark plans tougher deportation laws, challenging European human rights framework</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/denmark-plans-tougher-deportation-laws-challenging-european-human-rights-2026-01-30/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Denmark said on Friday it would introduce legislation allowing the expulsion of more foreigners including criminals despite the risk of clashing with Europe's human rights court.

In a global hardening of attitudes on asylum and migration issues, various European governments including Denmark have expressed frustration with how the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights has often blocked deportations.

Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Friday her centre-right coalition government would act without waiting for the court to revise its interpretation of the European Convention on Human Rights as relates to immigration.

"Some experts might think that we are breaking the convention with this. We see it the other way around," she said at a press conference.

Frederiksen is under pressure from nationalist and anti-immigration parties who are gaining support ahead of an election due by October 31.

"It is because a majority of the countries behind the (rights) convention share Denmark's desire to change the interpretation that we are now tightening further," the prime minister added, acknowledging that could bring legal challenges.

Denmark has in particular criticized rulings by the European court stopping deportations due to family ties.

The proposed reforms, to take effect from May 1 if approved, would increase requirements to deport foreign nationals sentenced to a year or more for serious crimes.

Other plans include introducing electronic tagging for people without residency permits who breach reporting requirements, reopening Denmark's embassy in Syria - the source of many migrants - and appointing a deportation envoy.

Copenhagen also plans to explore a potential first EU reception centre outside the bloc and intensify reviews to revoke refugee permits.

Frederiksen's government has seen a poll boost for its handling of a standoff over U.S. President Donald Trump ´s demands to acquire Greenland but its ratings remain below those of the 2022 election.

Frederiksen, of the Social Democratic Party, took a tougher stance on immigration when she became prime minister in 2019, with coalition partners Moderates and the Liberal Party following her lead.

With a population of around 6 million, Denmark granted asylum to 839 people in the first 11 months of 2025, on track to approve fewer than 1,000 claims in the year for only the fourth time since 1983. Most asylum applicants in recent years have come from Syria, Afghanistan, Eritrea, and Somalia.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5HUJ3Q4NTFNM5NRL2AHWOQ7UY4.jpg?auth=76924ec55e2aa1e4891fb024dc626fb1d6975e7440fdf32ac6b8c9d8af4e7b25&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Panama ports will operate undisrupted after CK Hutchison ruling, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/panama-president-says-ports-will-operate-without-disruption-after-court-ruling-2026-01-30/</link><description>PANAMA CITY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino said on Friday that ports in the country will operate without disruption, despite a Supreme Court decision to annul key port contracts held by a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison.

The ruling on Thursday left the future operations of some key ports near the Panama Canal unclear.

Mulino said that APM Terminals Panama, a Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) , opens new tab subsidiary, has shown willingness to temporarily take over the operation of the Balboa and Cristobal terminals, following a transition period during which the current operator will stay on.

He said there have been discussions with several companies.

About the process with CK Hutchison, Mulino said during a press conference that he had instructed the Panama Maritime Authority to meet immediately with the Panama Ports Company to coordinate the next steps.

Mulino said there would not be any layoffs.

The ruling comes amid a growing U.S.-China rivalry over global trade routes and is seen as a win for Washington, where President Donald Trump has pushed to curb what he calls Chinese influence over the Panama Canal, which carries about 5% of global maritime trade.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 13:59:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4X5GJVVEJJPOFMQ5SUKFWS6LBE.jpg?auth=59dc32830e1146d14bf9bd4fd9131f538d23f07ff55997b8c60f2b85e72a2c0c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Islamic State claims deadly attack on airport in Niger capital</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/islamic-state-claims-deadly-attack-airport-niger-capital-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 - Islamic State claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on the airport in Niger's capital Niamey in a statement on Friday, according to SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist activity and communications worldwide.

The Islamic State affiliate in the region has been linked to high-profile attacks in Niger in recent months, killing over a 120 people in strikes targeting the Tillaberi region in September and abducting an American pilot in Octover.

Niger's government said in a statement that the attackers arrived on motorcycles and security forces quickly repelled their advance. In the fighting that ensued, four soldiers were wounded, it said.

Material losses at the airport included a stash of ammunition that caught fire, the government said, and several civilian airplanes that were damaged.

Islamic State described the assault as a "surprise and coordinated attack" that inflicted "significant damage" without providing further details.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:42:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RZL4LEIBP5JKDE2L7HCNRGWMDU.jpg?auth=637892b796f22a1292fc206d96c9e8500a9879c7d76aad4532a5ff759d93816e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Dutch government plans 'freedom tax' to fund defence spending</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/new-dutch-government-plans-freedom-tax-fund-defence-spending-2026-01-30/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The incoming Dutch government plans to add a surcharge to income and corporate taxes to generate around 5 billion euros ($6 billion) per year for increased defence spending, coalition parties said on Friday.

To meet a target set by NATO countries last year, the government aims to increase defence spending to 2.8% of gross domestic product by 2030 and to 3.5% by 2035, compared with around 2% now.

Ultimately, the increase in defence spending would be around 19 billion euros per year, which would be funded by broad budget cuts, including in healthcare and welfare, as well as the tax increment the government has named a freedom tax.

In its coalition agreement presented on Friday, months after the October election, the new government also said it planned to invest in housing, while limiting the government deficit to around 2% of GDP.

"We are charting a new course for our country, with investments aimed at the long term," leader of the D66 party Rob Jetten said.

Earlier this week , Jetten and other political leaders agreed to form a rare minority government in which the centrist pro-EU D66, will team up with the conservative Christian Democrats and right-wing VVD.

This coalition will only hold 66 of the 150 seats in the lower house of parliament, and will need to find support among opposition parties for its proposals.

The main leftwing opposition party said it would strive for more social and greener policies.

As the leader of the new government, Jetten, aged 38, will become the youngest prime minister in Dutch history.

Other cabinet posts will be filled in the coming weeks, and the government is expected to be officially installed within a month.

MSF, which supports and helps staff hospitals in Gaza, is one of 37 international organisations that Israel ordered this month to stop work in the Palestinian territories unless they meet new rules including providing employee details.

The aid groups say sharing such staff information could pose a safety risk, pointing to the hundreds of aid workers who were killed or injured during the two-year Gaza war.

Israel's diaspora ministry, which manages the registration process, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Israel has previously said the registrations were meant to prevent diversions of aid by Palestinian armed groups. Aid agencies dispute that substantial aid has been diverted.

MSF had said last week it would be prepared to share a partial list of Palestinian and international staff who had agreed to release that information, provided the list be used only for administrative purposes and not put its team at risk. It also said it wanted to retain control over the management of medical humanitarian supplies.

"However, despite repeated efforts, it became evident in recent days that we were unable to build engagement with Israeli authorities on the concrete assurances required," MSF said in a statement.

It said there could be a devastating impact on humanitarian services if it is banned from operating in Gaza and the West Bank, amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.

The Ministry of Health in Gaza said in a statement on Friday that it rejected sharing data of health staff working with partner health institutions, saying it threatened the personal safety of workers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 14:43:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WKF762VVNJKMBI5WSDN2GCAPII.jpg?auth=7f93edb23922d9bb5a2169c98748b1f4b1049eb5a6e988ed3be79349f3058ecd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rohingya survivors expect UN's highest court to find Myanmar committed genocide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rohingya-survivors-expect-uns-highest-court-find-myanmar-committed-genocide-2026-01-30/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Rohingya survivors of the 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar expect the International Court of Justice, the United Nations' highest court, to rule the country committed genocide against them, they said on Friday.

A judgment is expected in three-to-six months' time following three weeks of hearings at the court in the Hague that is also known as the World Court.

The outcome of the case will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, including affecting South Africa’s genocide case at the court against Israel over the war in Gaza.

GAMBIA BROUGHT THE CASE

In their final submissions this week, lawyers for Gambia, a mainly Muslim country that brought the case, told the court that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from Myanmar's conduct is that it intended to destroy the Rohingya as a group.

Myanmar has denied accusations of genocide and said the 2017 offensive that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh was a legitimate counterterrorist operation.

Speaking on Friday on the sidelines of a meeting of survivors of mass atrocities, Yousuf Ali, a 52-year-old Rohingya refugee who says he was tortured by the Myanmar military, said he believed the court would declare a genocide had been committed.

"The world has witnessed us suffering for so many years (... ) how we were deported, how our homes were destroyed and we were killed," he said.

A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded the offensive had included "genocidal acts" and survivors recounted killings, mass rape and arson.

At the international court, Myanmar's lawyers said the fact-finding mission was biased and that its conclusions did not have the standard of proof needed for a finding of genocide.

Gambia's Justice Minister Dawda Jallow asked the court to reject Myanmar's arguments and said a judgment declaring genocide would help to break Myanmar's "cycle of atrocities and impunities".</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S2772TPVAVPE3JVKCVIDBHO6DE.jpg?auth=00ec33e0dd203b5467d9d0ee128ab8f2f0eb3f22e0172d4a438be644c06fa885&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN says Houthi seizure of telecom gear threatens Yemen aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-says-houthi-seizure-telecom-gear-threatens-yemen-aid-2026-01-30/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Yemen's Iran‑aligned Houthi paramilitary has removed critical telecommunications equipment belonging to the U.N., the global body said on Friday, warning that further restrictions on its work would fuel a worsening humanitarian crisis

The Houthis, who control areas in north Yemen, entered at least six unstaffed U.N. offices in the capital Sanaa and took telecommunications equipment and several vehicles to an unknown location, the U.N.'s Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen Julien Harneis said in a statement.

"This equipment is part of the minimum infrastructure needed by the United Nations to be present and to implement programmes," said Harneis.

The U.N. has warned of a worsening humanitarian crisis in Yemen with some 21 million people needing aid.

Yemen has suffered 11 years of conflict between the Houthis, who took over the capital Sanaa in 2014 and the internationally-recognised government in Aden. Some 4.8 ‎million people are internally displaced and nearly half a million children need treatment for severe malnutrition.

The situation has been aggravated by economic collapse, disruption of health and education services, political uncertainty and funding cuts, the U.N. previously said.

The Houthis did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They have previously called the work of some U.N. agencies like the World Food Programme a political, military and intelligence operation aimed at subjugating Yemenis.

The U.N. also raised concern of further constraints on aid, stating that the Houthis have not authorized the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service to fly to Sanaa for more than a month, nor the city of Marib, which is controlled by the internationally-recognised government, for more than four months.

These flights are the only way for NGO workers to enter and exit Houthi-controlled areas, Harneis said.

U.N. operations are limited to government-held areas, with U.N. agencies unable to help in Houthi-held areas accounting for about 70% of humanitarian needs, Harneis said.

Staff security is worsening with 73 U.N. colleagues now detained since 2021.

In September the U.N. said it had relocated the base of its resident coordinator for Yemen to Aden, more than a week after at least 18 U.N. personnel were detained in the capital Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthis.

Houthi officials have previously accused U.N. staff of espionage.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4LIRVS5GVBKVRKPNBYKORZ5PC4.jpg?auth=ce24314394136c62681f241f12917ce655717fc2de1842ed697bb091a70fb4e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>25 killed in Nigeria's deadliest reported Islamist attack since US Christmas strikes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/25-killed-nigerias-deadliest-reported-islamist-attack-since-us-christmas-strikes-2026-01-30/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 30 (Reuters) - At least 25 people were killed when suspected Boko Haram militants attacked a town in northern Nigeria, relatives of victims said, the deadliest reported Islamist attack since U.S. President Donald Trump ordered air strikes on Christmas Day.

The victims were labourers who had travelled to Sabon Gari town in northeastern Nigeria's Borno State to work at a construction site, when gunmen swept in on Thursday and opened fire, relatives Hassan Usman and Auwal Isa told Reuters.

Aliyu Ndume, a senator who represents the region, said he was "shocked and saddened" by the killing of his constituents.

In a separate militant attack, also on Thursday in Borno, at least nine soldiers and two members of a civilian task force assisting them were killed by fighters who launched a pre-dawn assault on an army base. Sixteen people were wounded.

Borno, where Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency.

Nigeria, plagued by Islamist attacks and mass kidnappings, is under additional pressure to restore security since Trump accused it last year of failing to protect Christians. U.S. forces struck what they described as terrorist targets on December 25. The Nigerian authorities say they are cooperating with Washington to improve security.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US issues fresh Iran-related sanctions, Treasury Dept website says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-issues-fresh-iran-related-sanctions-treasury-dept-website-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday issued fresh Iran and counter terrorism-related sanctions, targeting seven Iranian nationals and at least one entity, according to the U.S. Treasury Department's website.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 15:35:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4TNLFG3EIBLJFN4HB2RXOJ3CWU.jpg?auth=fefc35bde85eb161e55c0ca8cdcbd2580fabc846c93fd3b9646856a09a8aec7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge dismisses murder, weapons charges against alleged UnitedHealth CEO killer Mangione</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/judge-dismisses-murder-weapons-charges-against-alleged-unitedhealth-ceo-killer-2026-01-30/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A New York federal judge on Friday dismissed murder and weapons charges against alleged UnitedHealthcare CEO killer Luigi Mangione , a major blow to prosecutors that means Mangione no longer faces a possible death penalty if convicted.

Mangione, 27, previously pleaded not guilty to murder, weapons and stalking charges for allegedly gunning down the CEO of UnitedHealthcare in Midtown Manhattan in 2024. Public officials condemned the shocking killing, but Mangione became a folk hero of sorts to some Americans who decry steep healthcare costs and insurance practices.

U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Garnett in Manhattan said she dismissed the murder and weapons charges because they were legally incompatible with the two counts of stalking Mangione faces.

Garnett previously scheduled jury selection to begin in the case in September.

Mangione has separately pleaded not guilty to murder, weapons and forgery charges in Manhattan state court.

Investigators traced at least 31 crypto transactions from virtual wallets controlled by the suspect to addresses that are suspected of being linked to an entity used by the Islamist group, whose attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, triggered a two-year war in the Gaza Strip.

Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation by the 27-member European Union and other Western nations.

Police declined to comment on the suspect's possible motives and on whether he had interacted knowingly with Hamas or was just an intermediary, citing the sensitivity of the investigation.

During searches of the suspect's hair salon and home, officers seized cryptoassets, cash, some 9,000 cigars, jewellery, computers and mobile phones, the police said.

They also froze several bank accounts, with the total value of seized and blocked assets exceeding 370,000 euros.

Their investigation began last June during a separate probe into fraud and money laundering, police said.

Authorities have warned in recent years that militant groups are using cryptocurrencies to move funds across borders, complicating efforts to track and disrupt terrorism financing .

The claim of responsibility was contained in a statement on Amaq News Agency, the group's propaganda wing, that said it was “a surprise and coordinated attack” that inflicted heavy losses.

The IS group's affiliate in the region has been linked to high-profile attacks in Niger in recent months, killing over a 120 people in strikes targeting the Tillaberi region in September and abducting an American pilot in October.

Material losses at the airport included a stash of ammunition that caught fire, the government said, and several civilian airplanes that were damaged.

Niger has struggled to contain deadly jihadist violence that has battered parts of Africa’s Sahel region, where neighbouring Burkina Faso and Mali also are run by military juntas.

In 2025, al Qaeda and IS group-backed militants escalated their campaigns in the Sahel, further threatening the stability of the fragile region and of Niger, which was the key security ally of the West in the region until a 2023 military coup.

Niger state television reported that one of the assailants killed was a French national, as footage showed several bloodied bodies on the ground. It provided no evidence.

Niger’s military leader has accused the presidents of France, Benin and Ivory Coast of supporting the armed group behind the attack.

Since seizing power, Niger’s military rulers – along with those in neighbouring Mali and Burkina Faso – have cut ties with France and other Western powers and turned to Russia for military support to fight insurgencies.

The U.S. military said on January 21 it had started to transfer the detainees. Its announcement followed the rapid collapse of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in northeast Syria, which caused uncertainty about the security of prisons and detention camps they were guarding.

The United States had expected to transfer up to 7,000 fighters to Iraq within days . But more than a week later, only about 500 have been moved, according to two Iraqi judicial officials, two Iraqi security officials and three diplomats, some from countries whose nationals are among those transferred.

An Iraqi foreign ministry official put the number at under 500 so far.

Baghdad asked the U.S. to slow the influx to make time for negotiations with other countries on repatriating their own nationals among the detainees and to prepare additional facilities to host the fighters, the Iraqi officials and a Western diplomat told Reuters.

Those moved to Iraqi facilities so far include about 130 Iraqis and some 400 foreigners, the Iraqi judicial sources, the Iraqi security officials and a Western diplomat said.

The slowdown, which has not previously been reported, is linked to Western governments' reservations about bringing home their own citizens who joined the Islamic State's brutal self-declared caliphate across swathes of Syria and Iraq from 2014.

Most foreign fighters were subsequently captured in Syria and held in prisons in the northeast for years without trial.

The U.S. State Department and the Pentagon did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on the transfers.

Iraq agreed to host the detainees being moved by the U.S. military after a brief escape by dozens of fighters from one facility in Syria prompted concerns that more could flee, Iraqi government officials said.

But although it has already tried and sentenced dozens of foreign fighters in recent years, Baghdad balked at the prospect of having the full 7,000 in its custody, the officials said.

The influx could overwhelm Iraq’s courts and prisons, and sentencing detainees to death would prompt criticism from Western countries and rights groups, they said.

"It's a trap," one of the senior Iraqi judicial sources said. "These Western countries object to the death penalty, but refuse to receive their terrorists. Why should we bear the burden of being seen as the butcher?"

Responding to questions from Reuters, Hisham al-Alawi, Undersecretary of Iraq's Foreign Ministry for Political Planning, said fewer than 500 detainees had been transferred to Iraq so far.

"For years, Iraq has been urging foreign states to assume their responsibilities by taking back their citizens and dealing with them in accordance with their own laws. While some countries have taken the initiative, a large number of states have not responded to our requests," Alawi said.

The dilemma of what to do with foreign nationals who joined Islamic State has plagued Western countries for the last decade.

Securing guilty verdicts against such detainees in their home countries could be harder than in Iraq, said four diplomats from countries whose nationals were captured in Syria, citing a greater need to prove direct participation in violent crimes.

Governments in such countries could face a public backlash if Islamic State fighters were repatriated and then freed, the diplomats said.

The return of an Islamic State-linked woman to Norway in 2020 caused a cabinet crisis that ultimately brought down the government.

As a result of Western nations' hesitations, thousands of foreign fighters detained in Syria and Iraq remained there for nearly a decade - even though the U.S., which repatriated and tried its nationals, urged other countries to do the same .

The senior Iraqi judicial source said Baghdad was working with the U.S. State Department on increasing pressure on other countries to begin repatriations.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said after transfers had begun that foreign Islamic State members would be in Iraq temporarily. "The United States urges countries to take responsibility and repatriate their citizens in these facilities to face justice," he said.

Two diplomats from countries with nationals now in Iraq said their governments faced an uncomfortable choice between repatriation - which would be unpopular domestically - and the possibility that their nationals would face the death penalty if tried in Iraq, an outcome that could outrage voters at home.

One of the diplomats said Baghdad had begun conversations with their country about repatriations but that their government's policy was unchanged.

"It would be difficult for us to accept that they are transferred to Iraq if they are then going to get their head chopped off," the second diplomat said.

Letta Tayler, an associate fellow at the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism, said the mass transfer of detainees to Iraq "has mind-boggling legal implications, none of them positive."

It could prolong their indefinite detention without trial and place detainees at risk of torture and executions based on flawed convictions, Tayler said. The U.S. has raised concerns about unfair trials of Islamic State detainees in Iraq.

"The only viable solution is for countries with fair justice systems to repatriate their nationals," Tayler said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:34:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q6FDEGBYQZKFNOWUSKQXIH5VSI.jpg?auth=589f21a90899ad2bb53b8c163035c356e73a817d765c854baaa10c1cbfe8a3f5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico to seek diplomatic solution after US threatens Cuba oil tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-seek-diplomatic-solution-after-us-threatens-cuba-oil-tariffs-2026-01-30/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Friday her country would seek diplomatic solutions and alternatives to help Cuba after the United States threatened tariffs on nations that supply the Caribbean nation with oil.

"We need to know the scope because we don't want to put our country at risk in terms of tariffs," Sheinbaum said in a morning press conference, adding that she had instructed her foreign minister to reach out to the U.S. State Department.

Mexico is one of Cuba's only remaining suppliers of oil and its shipments are a lifeline for the island.

Sheinbaum said cutting off oil shipments could cause a serious humanitarian crisis in Cuba, affecting transportation and key infrastructure including hospitals and electricity generation.

"Applying tariffs on countries that supply oil to Cuba could trigger a far-reaching humanitarian crisis, directly affecting hospitals, food and other basic services for the Cuban people, a situation that must be avoided," she said.

Sheinbaum did not say whether Mexico would cut shipments of oil or refined products to Cuba, which Sheinbaum said accounted for 1% of Mexico's production, but emphasized the country is looking at alternatives to help the island.

U.S. President Donald Trump and Sheinbaum spoke on Thursday morning, hours before his administration announced the tariffs, but he did not mention the measures, she said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 17:35:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N5FST77MGFJPZKVK4WFC674WFE.jpg?auth=747c87f9c49dd0f8e53f1ffbfa3901631aaec0a92c42f66efba7532703a2c59c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge temporarily blocks end of Ethiopians' deportation protections</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-end-ethiopians-deportation-protections-2026-01-30/</link><description>BOSTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from ending protections from deportation that had been granted to thousands of Ethiopians living in the United States.

U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston said he would issue an order delaying the February 13 effective date of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's termination of the Temporary Protected Status granted to over 5,000 Ethiopians in order to provide more time for a legal challenge to be heard.

Murphy, who was appointed by Democratic President Joe Biden, during a virtual hearing said an order administratively staying the effective date would allow DHS time to produce records detailing how it made its decision so he can then consider whether to block the agency's action for even longer.

The U.S. Department of Justice had requested more time to respond to the lawsuit filed by immigrant rights advocates before Murphy, after he set the case down for arguments on Tuesday.

At the same time, it opposed even a temporary court-ordered delay in the expiration of the protections the Ethiopians had from deportation. Murphy said he would schedule further arguments after the agency's records are produced, which a government lawyer suggested could be done within weeks.

"I want to do everything I can to keep this case going," Murphy said.

DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Under federal law, Temporary Protected Status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

DHS has moved to end the status for about a dozen countries as part of Trump's crackdown on immigration , saying TPS was always meant to be temporary and not a "de facto amnesty program."

The case before Murphy was filed last week by three Ethiopian nationals and the group African Communities Together after DHS said on December 12 it was ending the TPS designation for Ethiopia, citing improved conditions in the African nation.

The lawsuit argues DHS unlawfully terminated the TPS designation first granted to Ethiopia in 2022 by the Biden administration with just 60-days notice, even though armed conflicts there continue.

The plaintiffs say Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem took that action based on an unconstitutional animus against non-white immigrants.

Officials in Argentina were moving to finalize this month the third-country deal with the U.S., the New York Times reported.

Reuters could not independently confirm the report. A U.S. State Department spokesperson declined to comment.

Argentina's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

A third-country deal with Argentina would bolster President Donald Trump's intention to deport millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally. His administration has aimed to ramp up removals to third countries , including to South Sudan, Eswatini, El Salvador, Costa Rica and Panama.

While Argentina has historically had a relatively open immigration policy, President Javier Milei, a close ally of Trump, has sought to tighten immigration by cracking down on those with criminal records and requiring that travelers are covered by health insurance.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:44:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin envoy Dmitriev to travel to Miami, meet members of Trump administration, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-envoy-dmitriev-travel-miami-meet-members-trump-administration-sources-say-2026-01-30/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, will travel to Miami on Saturday for meetings with members of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration, two sources with knowledge of the visit told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHIJGKFNIVPBFLAQKMECGARI6Q.jpg?auth=bf541580f7c05e624b64e6ce8c73b2efced5bbac8908dba3515a75746cf59ba1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria to close camps housing thousands linked to Islamic State</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-close-camps-housing-thousands-linked-islamic-state-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - Syria plans to permanently close two displacement camps in the northeast that hold civilians, including foreigners, linked to Islamic State militants , a government official said on Friday.

The al-Hol and Roj camps hold more than 28,000 people, mostly Syrians and Iraqis, according to the U.N. About 6,000 foreigners are housed in al-Hol and a further 2,000 in Roj.

A charity that has worked in both camps, the Swiss-based Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund, told Reuters it understands Damascus aims to empty and shut the sites within a year.

Syrian forces recently took control of al-Hol after the chaotic withdrawal of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF still holds Roj where residents had in recent days reported being confined to their tents as aid groups evacuated due to rising security worries.

More than 50,000 people who fled IS's last strongholds as the group lost territory over the last decade were once held at the two camps. Numbers have fallen due to repatriations, primarily by Iraq.

Among the foreigners held is Shamima Begum , a British-born woman who joined IS.

The civilian displacement camps are for families and others with alleged IS links, distinct from detention facilities that hold suspected fighters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C5WAOEMGYRKGFCH3G3VJQ3UPMM.jpg?auth=60c0d07b16bf9e4f1adf1eadee504503e732f8ae8ea3d2f588418b51bd2400aa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge bars prosecutors from seeking death penalty against Luigi Mangione</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-us-judge-bars-prosecutors-from-seeking-death-penalty-against-luigi-mangione</link><description>A US judge on Friday barred prosecutors from seeking the death penalty against Luigi Mangione, the man accused of gunning down a health insurance CEO in New York in December 2024.

The judge dismissed two charges against Mangione that could carry the death penalty: murder and using a gun with a silencer. The 27-year-old suspect is still charged with two counts of stalking in his federal case, and faces state-level murder charges.

He has pleaded not guilty to the state and federal charges.

Friday's decision "is solely to foreclose the death penalty as an available punishment to be considered by the jury", Judge Margaret Garnett wrote in a court filing.

Mangione faces life in prison without parole if convicted of the stalking charges. The federal trial is to begin with jury selection on September 8.

The murder of UnitedHealthcare executive Brian Thompson, captured on surveillance video, shocked the United States and exposed public anger with the profit-driven private healthcare system.

Mangione was arrested five days after the killing at a McDonald's restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, some 230 miles (370 kilometres) from the crime scene, following a tip from a staff member.

In another significant ruling Friday, Garnett rejected Mangione's lawyers' efforts to suppress as evidence the police search of a backpack recovered at the time of his arrest.

Inside, officers found a handgun, a silencer, a magazine with bullets wrapped in underwear and a red notebook described as a "manifesto".

The defence argued the search breached legal standards.

Following through on Donald Trump ’s campaign promise to vigorously pursue capital punishment, Attorney General Pam Bondi had ordered Manhattan federal prosecutors last April to seek the death penalty against Mangione.

It was the first time the Justice Department was seeking to bring the death penalty in Trump’s second term.

The contract emerged last week after it was first revealed by independent media outlet l’Observatoire des multinationales. It concerns “skip tracing” services – a form of data-driven locating and tracking of individuals whose whereabouts are unknown – used by ICE to verify home and work addresses and support removal operations. The framework agreement is capped at over $365 million, with nearly $4.8 million already committed.

In practical terms, contractors use government-supplied case data alongside commercial databases, public records, phone and social media information and even physical observation to confirm a person’s location for enforcement purposes.

The solicitation , revealed by US magazine Wired in October, outlines an incentive structure offering monetary bonuses for high performance, with companies assigned thousands of cases at a time. To meet these targets, contractors are expected to carry out “commercial data verification” and, if required, “physical observation services” to verify the address information.

Wired described parts of the initiative as relying on private "bounty hunters" paid to locate and track immigrants. A language echoed by The Intercept , which reported on December 23 that at least 10 companies had already earned more than $1 million and could collectively make well over $1 billion from the programme through 2027. The largest potential single share, the investigative outlet outlined, was expected to go to Capgemini Government Solutions.

Capgemini group CEO Aiman Ezzat said Sunday on LinkedIn that senior management had only recently become aware of the contract “through public sources”, adding that it was “not currently being executed” and was subject to legal challenge. An internal message sent to staff and seen by AFP said the US subsidiary had launched a process to examine the contents of the deal, as scrutiny intensified from unions, politicians and investors.

According to The Washington Post , ICE told prospective contractors in a written Q&amp;A in November that the intelligence they gathered "may lead to raids", and that the government "may send correspondence to the alien or take an enforcement action".

French investigative outlet Les Jours reported on Wednesday that Capgemini Government Solutions’ ties with ICE stretched back nearly two decades. Government spending records from USAspending.gov show that 65% of the contracts awarded to the company by US federal agencies were with ICE . As early as 2007, the contracts already covered operational planning, including modelling the agency’s detention capacity.

“If you fire them, ICE would be paralysed. They’ve become essential to certain parts of the system, it’s very hard to get rid of them,”  a former senior ICE official told Les Jours.

This dependency is reinforced by a "revolving door" process, with many employees moving between ICE and CGS, ensuring continuity and deep institutional knowledge.

The relationship has endured for nearly two decades, as documented by Les Jours, and came under scrutiny in a 2021 audit by the DHS Office of Inspector General , which flagged performance and oversight failures. “Although ICE had controls in place that required the contractor to provide qualified labour, ICE did not properly construct or monitor the contract,” the report said.

It also found that the contractor had failed to specify staffing levels for key labour categories, meaning ICE “cannot ensure it received all services and may have overpaid $769,869 in labour cost”. The watchdog further concluded that ICE did not ensure the contractor – Capgemini Government Solutions – met requirements for staff skills, education and experience, or that all contractor personnel worked at the designated place of performance.

This dependence on Capgemini’s services spans operations ranging from detention capacity management to deportation logistics and individual tracking, underscoring how deeply embedded CGS has become to core ICE functions.

These revelations have triggered mounting pressure on Capgemini from unions, politicians and parts of the French government. French union CFDT strongly condemned the ICE contract and has called for more transparency from management at a time when Capgemini is planning to cut up to 2,400 jobs in France . The more hardline CGT called for the ‘immediate and public cessation of any collaboration with ICE’, arguing that the agreement runs counter to the company’s stated values.

French Finance Minister Roland Lescure on Wednesday urged full transparency, saying Capgemini – which is partly state-owned – must "shed light, in an extremely transparent manner, on its activities" and "question the nature of these activities". Defence Minister Catherine Vautrin has meanwhile called for close ethical scrutiny of such contracts.

Capgemini has scheduled an extraordinary board meeting for this weekend in Paris as scrutiny intensifies, with unions warning that its outcome could set a precedent for how European firms engage with US security agencies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/92ca346a-fe09-11f0-a98a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/USA-ICE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Justice Department releases 3 million pages of new Epstein files</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260130-us-justice-department-releases-3-million-pages-of-new-epstein-files</link><description>The US Justice Department announced Friday it was releasing more than three million pages from the Jeffrey Epstein files along with photos and videos, adding fuel to a political drama putting pressure on President Donald Trump .

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said all images of women were redacted from the documents being released aside from those of Ghislaine Maxwell , the accomplice of the convicted sex offender.

The latest release is expected to contain previously unseen material from the investigation into Epstein, a wealthy US financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls.

Previous releases have shed light on Epstein's ties to leading business executives, celebrities, academics and politicians, including Trump and former president Bill Clinton .

Perhaps the most significant documents published so far are two FBI emails from July 2019 which mention 10 "co-conspirators" of Epstein.

Only one person – Epstein's former girlfriend Maxwell – has ever been charged in connection with his crimes and the names of the alleged "co-conspirators" are redacted from the emails.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for recruiting underage girls for Epstein, whose death was ruled a suicide.

According to Axios, major documents which have not been released yet include a draft 60-count federal indictment of Epstein that was inexplicably quashed, and an 82-page prosecution memo from 2007.

Trump, a one-time close friend of Epstein, and Clinton both figure prominently in the records published so far but neither has been accused by officials of any wrongdoing.

A Republican-led House panel has voted to launch contempt of Congress proceedings against Bill and Hillary Clinton over their refusal to testify before its probe into Epstein.

Trump, 79, fought for months to prevent release of the vast trove of documents about Epstein.

But a rebellion inside his Republican Party forced him to sign off on a law mandating release of all the documents.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA) called for all of the documents held by the Justice Department to be released by December 19.

The department missed that deadline. Blanche has blamed the delay on the need to painstakingly redact the identities of Epstein's more than 1,000 victims from the files.

The sweeping redactions across many of the documents – combined with tight control over the release by the Trump administration – have stoked scepticism that conspiracy theories of a high-level cover-up will be silenced.

As soon as the president's name began surfacing in the released files, the Justice Department issued a statement saying that some documents "contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump".

But the documents already released confirm that Trump was once close to Epstein.

They moved in the same social circles in New York and Florida and documents confirm that Trump flew multiple times on Epstein's private jet.

A January 2020 note from New York federal prosecutors who were investigating Maxwell had Trump making eight trips on Epstein's plane between 1993 and 1996.

Trump has given varying accounts of why he eventually fell out with Epstein. He has criticised the file dumps, expressing concern that people who "innocently met" Epstein over the years risked having their reputations smeared.

A spokesman for Clinton has urged the Justice Department to release all materials in the files related to the former president, saying he had nothing to hide.

"Someone or something is being protected. We do not know whom, what or why. But we do know this: We need no such protection," Angel Urena said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 18:45:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/17424ca2-fdf9-11f0-9115-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/c78fb3ddc59591e57e22ce07fc3f18ec063da38f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's Justice Department releases massive cache of Jeffrey Epstein files</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trumps-justice-department-releases-new-cache-jeffrey-epstein-files-2026-01-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Friday published a new and final cache of millions of documents related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, under a law passed in November that required the release of all Epstein-related records.

Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said at a press conference that Friday's massive batch of files marked the end of the Trump administration's planned releases under the law. The new cache includes more than three million pages, 2000 videos, and 180,000 images, he said.

The files include "extensive" redactions, he said, given the law's exceptions permitting certain documents to be blacked out, including identifying information of victims or materials related to active investigations. Previous releases have been heavily redacted, drawing criticism from some members of Congress.

Reuters is in the process of reviewing the files.

Trump, who was friends with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s before they had a falling out years before Epstein's first conviction, spent months resisting any release until both Democrats and Republicans in Congress forced his hand by advancing the law over his objections.

Trump has not been formally accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, and he has denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes. But the scandal has dogged him for months, in part because he promised to release the files during his 2024 presidential campaign.

It was not immediately clear how many of the newly released files included mentions of Trump. The Justice Department's first major release in December contained relatively few references to the president.

In a press release announcing Friday's document production, the Justice Department wrote, "Some of the documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear, the claims are unfounded and false, and if they have a shred of credibility, they certainly would have been weaponized against President Trump already."

Blanche said the department has also withheld some files based on legal privilege, including work product and attorney-client privilege. Some lawmakers have said those withholdings appear to run counter to the law, which required the department to produce internal communications related to decisions on whether to charge or investigate Epstein or any associates.

The Justice Department will provide Congress a report that includes a summary of all redactions and withheld documents, as required under the law, Blanche said in a letter sent to Congress on Friday.

Asked whether he believed all the files had been released in compliance with the law, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said, "We believe it is not."

Epstein, a New York financier with ties to high-profile political and business figures, was found hanged in his jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. While his death was ruled a suicide, it has engendered years of conspiracy theories, some of which Trump himself boosted to his own supporters during his 2024 presidential campaign.

Blanche expressed frustration with accusations that the Justice Department had declined to pursue associates of Epstein who may have participated in illegal activity.

"There's this built-in assumption that somehow there's this hidden tranche of information of men that we know about, that we're covering up, or that we're not we're choosing not to prosecute. That is not the case," he said.

The Epstein scandal has become a persistent political problem for Trump, who is already facing sagging approval ratings on a range of issues, including his handling of the economy and his immigration crackdown.

The department's investigation could potentially lead to criminal charges against the officers involved, though there is a high legal bar to bring such a case.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the FBI was examining Saturday's shooting with potential assistance from the department's Civil Rights Division, which typically plays a leading role in investigations into use of force by law enforcement. He cautioned the review was preliminary and he downplayed its scope.

"This is what I would describe as a standard investigation by the FBI when there's circumstances like what we saw last Saturday," Blanche said at a news conference.

Pretti's shooting by agents taking part in an immigration crackdown has stirred widespread outrage and prompted the Trump administration to make changes in the operation in Minnesota. Local officials have said the administration cannot be trusted and are pursuing their own investigation.

“The family’s focus is on a fair and impartial investigation that examines the facts around his murder," Steve Schleicher, an attorney representing the Pretti family, told Reuters in a statement.

A preliminary review by U.S. Customs and Border Protection said Pretti, 37, was shot by two federal officers, a Border Patrol agent and a customs officer. Pretti was the second protester to be shot and killed by federal agents in Minneapolis this month.

Video of the encounter verified by Reuters showed Pretti holding a cell phone as he was wrestled to the ground by agents. Video also showed that an officer removed a gun from Pretti’s body shortly before the first shots were fired.

Blanche's statement followed days of uncertainty over the nature of DOJ's involvement in the probe.

A Justice Department official told Reuters earlier this week that a criminal civil rights investigation would only begin if warranted by evidence. A DHS official said in a sworn court statement following the shooting that DHS was the lead investigative entity.

The department has so far not opened a criminal civil rights investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer earlier this month. Blanche previously said there was no basis for a criminal probe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 19:32:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5ZOKRPOAV5LS3MCTZQHD34V3T4.jpg?auth=33c0f1cf653ef208d025b9efa8196eefd983c5b2e4bcd1f3ad02c7f4f815ad26&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Catherine O'Hara, 'Schitt's Creek' and 'Home Alone' star, dies at 71</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260130-catherine-o-hara-schitt-s-creek-and-home-alone-star-dies-at-71</link><description>Catherine O'Hara, the Emmy-winning actor known for comedic roles across the decades – from Kevin's mum in “Home Alone” to the iconic Moira Rose in “Schitt's Creek” – died Friday at 71.

The Canadian-born O'Hara died at her home in Los Angeles “following a brief illness”, according to a statement from her agency, Creative Artists Agency. Further details were not immediately available.

O’Hara’s career was launched at the Second City in Toronto in the in 1970s. It was there that she first worked with Eugene Levy, who would become a lifelong collaborator – and her “Schitt’s Creek” costar. The two would be among the original cast of the sketch show “SCTV,” which would help launch the careers of other top Canadian comedians, like Martin Short and Andrea Martin.

O'Hara's dramatic turn in HBO's “The Last of Us” earned her an Emmy nomination, as did her recent role as a Hollywood producer in “The Studio.”

A report , opens new tab by Poland's Computer Emergency Response Team on the incident - which a Polish minister said was the worst of its kind in years - pointed to a team of hackers from Russia's Federal Security Service, known by its Russian acronym FSB.

The hacks were "purely destructive in nature," the report said, comparing them to arson.

"It is worth noting that this period coincided with low temperatures and snowstorms affecting Poland, shortly before New Year’s Eve,” the report said.

The Russian aim was to irreversibly destroy data stored on devices within the combined heat and power plant but security software blocked that portion of the attack, according to the report.

The Russian embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment.

Poland says its critical infrastructure has been subject to a growing number of cyberattacks by Russia since the war in Ukraine began in February 2022. Moscow regularly denies responsibility for malicious cyber activity.

The report tied the incident to an FSB hacking operation tracked under several nicknames, including "Berserk Bear" and “Dragonfly.” An August 20, 2025 report from the FBI linked the groups to the FSB’s specialised unit Center 16.

While the group has historically had “significant interest” in the energy sector and the ability to attack industrial devices, “this is the first publicly described destructive activity attributed to this cluster,” the Polish cyber officials said, referring to the FSB hacking group.

The report’s verdict on the hacks involved partially backs an independent analysis published last week by researchers at the Slovakia-based cybersecurity firm ESET.

ESET said that the malware involved in the Polish attack overlapped with prior destructive cyber operations tied to Russia, but linked it to a Russian military intelligence hacking unit known as Sandworm, not the FSB.

ESET issued a second report , opens new tab Friday expanding on its analysis of the malware which again tied it to Sandworm, although it cautioned that other aspects of the operation might have been carried out by different hacking groups.

John Hultquist, chief analyst at Google Threat Intelligence Group, said Friday that if the attack truly is Berserk Bear, the activity represents an escalation from its penetration of targets for long-term espionage towards damaging action.

"They have the means, the question was always did they have the motivation,” Hultquist said. "Now, potentially based on this attribution, proven to us that they do have the motivation, which puts us in a much more serious situation.”

Hultquist said the situation should raise concerns about the security of the Winter Olympics, set to kick off February 6.

“Russia has previously attempted to knock the opening ceremonies of the Winter Olympics offline, and they were extremely active during the last summer games," Hultquist said. “Disruptive cyberattacks are a very real threat.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 20:33:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ICRDGL3XGROGZI6WG4YDIW6GEQ.jpg?auth=746b565700b3c9fc21716622fcef6ddde5c97d106b2d356509bee10ca3f87485&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 200 killed in coltan mine collapse in east Congo, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/more-than-200-killed-coltan-mine-collapse-east-congo-official-says-2026-01-30/</link><description>Jan 30 (Reuters) - More than 200 people were killed this week in a collapse at the Rubaya coltan mine in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Lubumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesperson for the rebel-appointed governor of the province where the mine is located, told Reuters on Friday.

Rubaya produces around 15% of the world's coltan, which is processed into tantalum, a heat-resistant metal that is in high demand by makers of mobile phones, computers, aerospace components and gas turbines. The site, where locals dig manually for a few dollars per day, has been under the control of the M23 rebel group since 2024.

The collapse occurred on Wednesday and the precise toll was still unclear as of Friday evening.

"More than 200 people were victims of this landslide, including miners, children and market women. Some people were rescued just in time and have serious injuries," Muyisa said.

An adviser to the governor said the number of confirmed dead was at least 227. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to brief the media.

The United Nations says M23 has plundered Rubaya's riches to help fund its insurgency, backed by the government of neighboring Rwanda, an allegation Kigali denies.

The heavily-armed rebels, whose stated aim is to overthrow the government in Kinshasa and ensure the safety of the Congolese Tutsi minority, captured even more mineral-rich territory in eastern Congo during a lightning advance last year.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 21:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisia extends state of emergency by 11 months until Dec 31</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/tunisia-extends-state-emergency-by-11-months-until-dec-31-2026-01-30/</link><description>TUNIS, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Tunisian President Kais Saied has extended a long-running state of emergency by 11 months until December 31, the official gazette showed on Friday.

"Russian production of military goods was supplied last year to more than 30 countries and the amount of foreign exchange earnings exceeded $15 billion," Putin told a meeting on military-technical cooperation in the Kremlin in a pool video.

Putin said the sector was operating in "complicated conditions".

"Pressure from Western countries remained and was even intensified to slow down or block business ties with Russia," he said. "But despite all these attempts, our export contracts were on the whole being honoured consistently."

African countries, he said, were particularly expressing interest in Russian production.

"Despite pressure from the West, African partners are showing readiness to expand their relations with Russia in the military and military-technical fields," he said.

Russia has been cultivating ties with a string of African countries, including in the domain of military cooperation.

The Central African Republic in 2018 brought in Russia's Wagner mercenaries to fend off rebel groups. Its newly reelected president, Faustin-Archange Touadera, invited Putin this month to visit the country.

Russia has also boosted relations with military administrations in Mali and Burkina Faso.</description><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jan 2026 23:49:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7ZEK6CCLRM77MSH7BINQBFFAA.jpg?auth=3e7e002dcd3d922b829cb24dea9306183afb70eb3afa55f83a561165883234f5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands marched for democracy in Myanmar. Some died in prison.</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/thousands-marched-democracy-myanmar-some-died-prison-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Shwe Theingi was instantly drawn to Wutt Yee Aung when they met at the start of their second year at Myanmar's Dagon University in 2019.

The 19-year-old zoology major stood out with her boyish clothes, short hair and a friendly but outspoken personality, Shwe Theingi said. The two young women, who were active in the student union, quickly became friends.

At about the same time and in the same city, Khant Linn Naing was working at a printing press. He was also pursuing a degree in history at a different university and involved with a student union.

All three students were part of the first generation in decades to come of age in a quasi-democratic Myanmar, enjoying newfound freedoms in the commercial capital of Yangon before the February 1, 2021 military coup .

And all three were caught up in a brutal crackdown against the tens of thousands of young people who took to the streets in support of democracy five years ago.

Many of those protesters took up arms against the junta. Others fled or were detained in prison, where some of them died.

At least 74 political prisoners aged between 18 and 35 have died in detention since the coup, according to previously unreported data from the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, whose information on Myanmar is often cited by United Nations agencies.

The tally was corroborated with the Political Prisoners Network of Myanmar (PPNM), which monitors the country's prison system. A total of 273 people charged with public incitement and insurrection after the coup have died while incarcerated, according to PPNM.

Reuters interviewed three associates and relatives of detained students and the two prison monitor groups, and reviewed letters sent by inmates and correctional authorities. Together, they provide the fullest account to date of the conditions experienced by Wutt Yee Aung and Khant Linn Naing and the circumstances of their deaths.

The news agency could not independently verify all the accounts, but they echo allegations made by U.N. investigators last year of "systematic torture, killing and other serious abuses during interrogations and in detention facilities operated by the security forces of Myanmar."

The junta information ministry did not return multiple requests for comment about the allegations of mistreatment.

The military government's foreign ministry last year denied U.N. reports of torture and abuse, without addressing specifics. "These one-sided and unfounded allegations are persistently advanced based on such unverified data," it said in October.

Arrests, torture and conscription, as well as displacement within and outside Myanmar, "have disproportionately affected the younger generation," the U.N. said in a report last year.

An estimated 300,000 to 500,000 young people have fled the country, which has a population of about 51 million, since the coup, according to the U.N. Development Programme.

When the 2021 crackdown began, Shwe Theingi left Yangon. Wutt Yee Aung remained, participating in the anti-junta resistance until she was arrested in September 2021.

After a junta court convicted her on charges that included insurgency and incitement, she was sentenced to seven years in Yangon's notorious Insein prison.

Through letters and the occasional phone call, she stayed in touch with her family and Shwe Theingi.

"Mother, I hope you are well," Wutt Yee Aung said in a letter from prison in February 2024. "I have run out of snacks and medicine, so please transfer 200,000 kyat."

The hand-written plea for around $100 at official exchange rates also contained a list of medicines, including some for treating nerve damage and asthma.

It was during interrogation in the fortnight after her arrest that Wutt Yee Aung sustained head injuries, according to Shwe Theingi and the Dagon University Students' Union, which also said that she had no health problems prior to her imprisonment.

Her health eventually deteriorated so severely that she was hospitalised inside prison at least once in mid-2025, Shwe Theingi said.

In one undated letter intended for Shwe Theingi, Wutt Yee Aung asked for about $150 for a medical test. "Please don't tell my mother about this," she wrote, "I miss everyone."

Wutt Yee Aung died in prison on July 19, 2025, at age 25. Authorities told her family that the cause of death was a heart condition, Shwe Theingi said.

The student union challenged the junta version of her death in a statement.

"Due to political prisoners not being given adequate medical treatment, the lack of medicine and restrictions on contact with her family, Ma Wutt Yee Aung died in prison at around 9.30 p.m. on July 19, 2025," it said, using an honorific for her name.

Khant Linn Naing's family learnt of his arrest on television news.

The 19-year-old was picked up in December 2021 and accused of inciting people to commit offences against the state and insurrection. He was held at Daik-U prison, some 110 km from Yangon, and sentenced by a junta court to 15 years.

In July 2023, his family was jolted again, this time by a letter from correctional authorities, which said Khant Linn Naing had been shot and killed while trying to escape during a prison transfer.

The contents of the letter were described to Reuters by a family member, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retaliation.

Reuters also viewed a letter sent in June 2023 by prison authorities to the family of another inmate at Daik-U, which said he was killed after "security personnel fired warning shots" when he attempted to escape during a transfer.

A colonial-era rule book that a lawyer and a prison monitor said is still used by correctional authorities allows officials to use weapons like firearms against inmates who are attempting to escape only when "there are no other means available to prevent the prisoner from escaping," according to a section of the manual reviewed by Reuters.

Neither death notice provided more information about the circumstances of the alleged escape attempts and the junta information ministry did not respond to requests for specific details.

Khant Linn Naing's parents were not given access to his remains and, over two years after receiving the notice, they have not conducted a funeral, the relative said.

"Because that letter was so unclear, we don't believe he is dead," the person said.

PPNM spokesperson Thaik Tun Oo said he found it implausible that Khant Linn Naing had been trying to escape because prisoners are typically restrained and paired with police officials during a transfer.

He added that his organization had been informed by prison sources that Khant Linn Naing had been subject to harsh interrogation shortly before the alleged transfer.

In the years after Wutt Yee Aung and Khant Linn Naing protested the junta, youth uprisings have upended politics and ousted governments elsewhere in Asia, including Bangladesh and Nepal.

Myanmar's generals, however, have endured. While they have lost territory in their borderlands, the junta has fought back by introducing conscription and expanding aerial power. This month, it concluded a three-phase election that will likely see a military-backed party take power.

"I wanted to become a news presenter. Wutt Yee wanted to do more volunteer work," Shwe Theingi said. "Each of us had different dreams."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 01:59:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DYS4EFEQGJLH5APUZU3IUG7UJA.jpg?auth=b29e78321511f9c394cac24d0360f9ccd4aeff1210c115842b4525aa3bfc59b3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Modi ally proposes social media ban for India's teens as global debate grows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/modi-ally-proposes-social-media-ban-indias-teens-global-debate-grows-2026-01-31/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Jan 31 (Reuters) - An ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has proposed a bill to ban social media for children, as the world's biggest market for Meta and YouTube joins a global debate on the impact of social media on young people's health and safety.

"Not only are our children becoming addicted to social media, but India is also one of the world's largest producers of data for foreign platforms," lawmaker L.S.K. Devarayalu told Reuters on Friday.

"Based on this data, these companies are creating advanced AI systems, effectively turning Indian users into unpaid data providers, while the strategic and economic benefits are reaped elsewhere," he said.

Australia last month became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, blocking access in a move welcomed by many parents and child advocates but criticised by major technology companies and free-speech advocates. France's National Assembly this week backed legislation to ban children under 15 from social media, while Britain, Denmark and Greece are studying the issue.

Facebook operator Meta (META.O) , opens new tab , YouTube-parent Alphabet (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab and X did not respond on Saturday to emails seeking comment on the Indian legislation. Meta has said it backs laws for parental oversight but that "governments considering bans should be careful not to push teens toward less safe, unregulated sites."

India's IT ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

India, the world's second-biggest smartphone market with 750 million devices and a billion internet users, is a key growth market for social media apps and does not set a minimum age for access.

Devarayalu's 15-page Social Media (Age Restrictions and Online Safety) Bill, which is not public but was seen by Reuters, says no one under 16 "shall be permitted to create, maintain, or hold" a social media account and those found to have one should have them disabled.

"We are asking that the entire onus of ensuring users' age be placed on the social media platforms," Devarayalu said.

The government's chief economic adviser attracted attention on Thursday by saying India should draft policies on age-based access limits to tackle "digital addiction".

Devarayalu's legislation is a private member's bill - not proposed to parliament by a federal minister - but such bills often trigger debates in parliament and influence lawmaking.

Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Europe ‍had ​stirred tensions in the recent protests ‌that gripped ‍the country and "provoked" people.

The United States on Friday approved a sale of $9 billion in Patriot defense missiles for Saudi Arabia, with the deal coming as tensions rise with nearby Iran.

The kingdom, a longtime US partner, plans to buy 730 Patriot missiles from the United States, the State Department said.

The Trump administration has approved a massive new series of arms sales to Israel totaling $6.67 billion, including 30 Apache attack helicopters and related equipment and weapons as well as 3,250 light tactical vehicles.

The State Department announced the package of four separate sales late Friday amid rising tensions in the Middle East over the possibility of US military strikes in Iran.

The Apache helicopters, which will be equipped with rocket launchers and advanced targeting gear, are the biggest part of the total package, coming to $3.8 billion, according to the department.

The next largest portion are the light tactical vehicles, which will be used to move personnel and logistics “to extend lines of communication” for the Israel Defense Forces and will cost $1.98 billion, it said.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the department would be releasing more than 3 million pages of documents along with more than 2,000 videos and 180,000 images.

The files, posted to the department’s website, include some of the several million pages of records that officials said were withheld from an initial release in December.

Included were documents concerning some of Epstein's famous associates, including Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, formerly known as Britain’s Prince Andrew, and email correspondence between Epstein and Elon Musk and other prominent contacts from across the political spectrum.

Friday's disclosure represents the largest document dump to date about a saga the Trump administration has struggled to shake because of the president's previous association with Epstein. Criminal investigations into the financier have long animated online sleuths, conspiracy theorists and others who have suspected government cover-ups and clamored for a full accounting, demands that Blanche acknowledged might not be satisfied by the latest release.

“There’s a hunger, or a thirst, for information that I don’t think will be satisfied by the review of these documents," he said.

The latest batch includes correspondence either with or about some of Epstein's friends.

The records have thousands of references to Trump, including emails in which Epstein and others shared news articles about him, commented on his policies or politics, or gossiped about him and his family.

Also included was a spreadsheet created last August summarizing calls to the FBI’s National Threat Operation Center or to a hotline established by prosecutors from people claiming without corroboration to have some knowledge of wrongdoing by Trump.

Mountbatten-Windsor's name appears at least several hundred times in the documents, sometimes in news clippings, sometimes in Epstein’s private email correspondence and in guest lists for dinners organized by Epstein. Some records document an attempt by prosecutors in New York to get the former prince to agree to be interviewed as part of their Epstein sex trafficking probe.

The records also show Musk, the billionaire Tesla founder, reached out to Epstein on at least two occasions to plan visits to the Caribbean island where many of the allegations of sexual abuse purportedly occurred.

In a 2012 exchange, Epstein asked how many people Musk would like flown by helicopter to the island he owned.

“Probably just Talulah and me,” Musk responded, referencing his then-partner, actress Talulah Riley. “What day/night will be the wildest party on our island?”

It’s not immediately clear if the island visits took place. Musk has said he repeatedly rebuffed Epstein's overtures.

Epstein also appears to have tried to connect New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch with women, according to emails.

Tisch said in a statement that he had a “brief association” with Epstein where they emailed about adult women and other topics. He said he “never went to his island” and that he “deeply regrets” the association.

The documents show that Steve Bannon , a conservative activist who served as Trump’s White House strategist earlier in the president’s first term, bantered over politics with the financier, discussed get-togethers with him and, on March 29, 2019, asked Epstein if he could supply his plane to pick him up in Rome.

Epstein told him his pilot and crew “are doing their best” to arrange that flight but if Bannon could find a charter flight instead, “I’m happy to pay.” Apparently in France at the time, Epstein sent a text message saying: “My guys can pick you up. Come for dinner.” The exchange did not show how that played out.

In December 2012, Epstein invited Howard Lutnick, now Trump's commerce secretary, to his private island for lunch, the records show. Lutnick’s wife accepted the invitation and said they would arrive on a yacht with their children. On another occasion in 2011, the two men had drinks, according to a schedule shared with Epstein.

Lutnick has said he cut ties with Epstein long ago. A Commerce Department spokesman said Lutnick had “limited interactions with Mr. Epstein in the presence of his wife and has never been accused of wrongdoing.”

Another Epstein contact surfacing in the records is former Obama White House general counsel Kathy Ruemmler. In one of several exchanges, Epstein emailed Ruemmler to advise that Democrats should stop demonizing Trump as a Mafia-type figure even as he derided the president as a “maniac.”

A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs , where Ruemmler is general counsel and chief legal officer, said in a statement that Ruemmler “had a professional association with Jeffrey Epstein when she was a lawyer in private practice” and "regrets ever knowing him.”

The documents were disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, the law enacted after months of public and political pressure that requires the government to open its files on the late financier and his confidant and onetime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell .

Lawmakers complained when the Justice Department made only a limited release last month, but officials said more time was needed to review additional documents that were discovered and to ensure no sensitive information about victims was released.

After missing a December 19 deadline set by Congress to release all the files, the Justice Department said it tasked hundreds of lawyers with reviewing the records to determine what needed to be redacted, or blacked out.

It denied any effort to shield Trump, who says he cut ties with Epstein years ago after an earlier friendship, from potential embarrassment.

Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

In 2008 and 2009, Epstein served jail time in Florida after pleading guilty to soliciting prostitution from someone under the age of 18. At the time, investigators had gathered evidence that Epstein had sexually abused underage girls at his Palm Beach home. The U.S. attorney's office agreed not to prosecute him in exchange for his guilty plea to lesser state charges.

A draft indictment from that period released Friday shows prosecutors contemplated federal charges against not just Epstein but three others who were his personal assistants and were suspected of participating in a conspiracy to recruit underage girls to perform lewd acts with Epstein.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 06:56:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/28718252-fe69-11f0-ae35-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031020763767.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Are the West's tightening oil sanctions finally taking their toll on Russia’s economy?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-are-the-west-tightening-oil-sanctions-finally-taking-toll-russia-economy</link><description>Across the world's vast oceans, more and more tankers bearing crude oil drawn from the Russian soil have begun to sit idle in the water.

Reuters estimates suggest 19 million barrels of Urals crude loaded before December 15 are still in transit as traders deliberately slow their journeys, struggling to nail down buyers amid declining demand.

And where the oil does flow, it's bringing in less and less in return. Last year, Russia’s revenue from oil and gas sales dropped by about a fifth to their lowest point in five years.

That Russia is getting less and less money from flogging fossil fuels is not in itself surprising – a global glut of crude has pushed oil prices down all over. On top of that, a strong rouble means that Moscow is getting less in its own currency for each dollar it earns from its exports.

But years of Western sanctions , including US President Donald Trump ’s decision in October to target Rosneft and Lukoil – Russia’s two largest oil exporters – also appear to be increasingly eating into Moscow’s much-needed oil rents.

Since the October sanctions, the discount at which Russia is forced to sell its oil to tempt trading partners to risk taking sanctioned crude has doubled. In December, the country’s Urals crude fell below $40 a barrel – its lowest point since global oil prices plummeted in the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Taken with the outgoing Biden administration’s decision in January to impose sanctions on the country’s third- and fourth-largest oil exporters, four-fifths of Russia’s oil production is now under US sanctions .

And unlike earlier sanctions, these latest measures hit not just the named companies themselves, but anyone doing business with them.

Alexander Kolyandr, a financial analyst and a senior scholar at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said that the secondary sanctions imposed by Trump threatened to cut companies receiving Russian oil off from the US-run financial infrastructure that underpins much of the global economy.

“The main feature of the American sanctions is that the United States, unlike Europe, is ready to apply secondary sanctions – in other words, if the United States sanctions you, and I trade with you, the US feels within its rights to fine or sanction me,” he said.

“We saw that, for example, in China, the main buyer of the Russian oil was not the state-owned companies or large companies, but rather, what's called ‘teapot refineries’ – small refineries which get sanctioned oil, refine it and then sell it. They have no exposure to the United States, and they can risk it.”

Targeting Russia’s oil rents has been a core strategy of Western governments’ economic response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine . In the months that followed the Russian advance, European Union and Group of 7 countries imposed a “price cap” on Russia’s seaborne oil exports.

The cap effectively banned commercial operators based in EU or G7 countries from transporting Russian oil – or providing insurance or other financial services to those who did – unless it was sold for less than a fixed price.

Originally set at $60 a barrel, the price cap will fall to under $44 a barrel as of February 1.

Catherine Wolfram, the William Barton Rogers professor of energy economics at MIT’s Sloan School of Management, said that the price cap had been designed to avoid a sudden spike in oil prices that could have been triggered by keeping Russian oil off the world market altogether. Russia is the world’s third-largest producer of oil.

“The price cap was designed to A, drive a wedge between the global price and what Russia received for its oil, and B, keep oil on the market – especially in 2022 when oil prices were very high and inflation was running rampant,” she said. “It succeeded with B. With A, it drove a bit of a wedge, but the Trump administration’s actions on Rosneft and Lukoil widened that wedge.”

To sell its oil at higher prices, Russia has become increasingly reliant on what some have dubbed a “shadow fleet” of ageing commercial oil tankers of unclear ownership.

Earlier in January, the French navy boarded an oil tanker in the Mediterranean and forced it to dock in Marseille . The captain who, like all members of the crew is an Indian national, has been taken into custody. French President Emmanuel Macron accused the tanker of helping to “finance Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine”. He was released from custody on Monday.

“We see a mounting campaign against Russia’s shadow fleet – it seems that both the Americans and the Europeans are ready to up the ante and start seizing these ships, which increases the cost of transportation,” Kolyandr said. “It all results in the buyer’s attempt to push prices lower. That’s where the discount is coming from.”

Increasingly cut off from Western markets, Moscow initially found willing buyers in India and China , where refiners have jumped at the chance to buy Russian crude at bargain prices.

But Daniel Spiro, an associate professor at the department of economics at Sweden's Uppsala University, said that the latest US sanctions seemed to have spooked even these once-eager buyers.

“For maybe the first time, it seems to have affected India's and China's willingness to buy Russian oil,” he said. “India decreased the volumes and China seems to have demanded a higher discount on the oil it buys. And this hasn't really been the case previously.”

Another casualty of these sanctions has been Lukoil’s extensive overseas assets. Founded in the frantic privatisations that marked the former Soviet Union’s wrenching transition to a market economy, Lukoil is believed to have some $22 billion worth of assets across the world, including in Iraq , Egypt , Nigeria and Mexico .

This week, the company announced that US private equity titan the Carlyle Group had agreed to buy up these assets – except for those in Kazakhstan – for an undisclosed price. The deal would require final approval from the US Treasury.

Spiro said that while the sale would likely eat into Russia’s oil and gas revenue, it would nevertheless boost the country’s critical foreign reserves.

“Presumably they do that at a low price compared to if this would have just been any regular market exchange,” he said. “So it is reducing the profits from oil and gas for Russia, but it is increasing the money they have – because they sold it off.”

He said that it was unclear what impact the sale would have on Russia’s vast oil and gas industry.

“Sanctions are a cat-and-mouse game – somebody imposes sanctions on Russia, and initially, they can be quite painful,” he said. “And Russia, of course, tries to avoid it in some way. For all I know, it could be that when they sell these assets, they use the money to invest in oil and gas production in Russia.”

Wolfram said that the planned sale was partly born from financial necessity.

“This feels like eating your seed corn, but Russia really needs the funds now,” she said.

Russia’s shrinking oil revenues risk eating into the wider state budget.

Oil and gas revenue made up less than 23 percent of the federal budget by the end of 2025 – something not seen for 20 years. With government spending outstripping revenue, last year's budget deficit ended up around 2.6 percent of GDP.

To make up for the shortfall, the Russian government has already begun increasing a range of domestic taxes, including raising VAT to 22 percent – as well as the threshold under which small businesses are exempt from paying it.

Spiro said that declining oil and gas revenues would push the government into making difficult decisions.

“Russia has a few choices. They can raise other taxes – that has a cost, and it's not going to be popular,” he said. “Or they need to increase government take in Russian oil and gas, but it's already quite high – I don't think there's a lot of margin to move on there. Or it has to reduce spending.”

While Russia's war-time economy has driven up wages in some of the country's poorest regions as workers man the production lines of a growing military-industrial complex, the overall economic situation is less rosy.

Economic growth has slowed as the central bank cracks down on inflation with double-digit interest rates, and social spending has already been slashed from 38 percent in 2021 to 25 percent this year.

“There's essentially two ways it can reduce spending – either reduce the war effort or reduce pensions and things like that,” Spiro said. “One of the key questions since the full-scale invasion has been, how far can the Russian government push its economy – or essentially push the costs onto its population.”

Ultimately, though, Kolyandr said it was unlikely the rising cost of Western sanctions would impact Putin’s determination to continue the nearly four-year war in Ukraine.

“Those decisions can only be made by Putin himself if he decides to wind down the war,” he said. “And I think his priorities are pretty clear – that the war and all this geopolitical struggle has priority. That the Russians had a couple of years of pretty good economic growth, and they can suffer a little bit. I don't think that it will derail his ideas.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/14fd6f62-fdfe-11f0-aaac-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25316184713361.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela announces amnesty push targeting mass release of political prisoners</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260131-venezuela-announces-amnesty-push-targeting-mass-release-of-political-prisoners</link><description>Venezuela 's acting president announced on Friday a proposal for mass amnesty in the country, in her latest major reform since the US toppling of Nicolas Maduro just weeks ago.

Delcy Rodriguez , in a speech at the Venezuelan Supreme Court attended by top government officials, said she will propose a "general amnesty law covering the entire period of political violence from 1999 to the present."

Leftist revolutionary Hugo Chavez assumed the presidency in 1999, and was succeeded upon his death in 2013 by Maduro, who oversaw an increasingly authoritarian government and whose two re-elections were widely dismissed as fraudulent.

"This law will serve to heal the wounds left by political confrontation, fueled by violence and extremism. It will allow us to put justice back on track in our country," Rodriguez said, also announcing a "major national consultation for a new judicial system."

She also announced plans to close the notorious El Helicoide prison in Caracas, where rights groups say political prisoners were tortured by Maduro's intelligence services.

The massive facility, originally built as a shopping mall, will be turned into a "sports, cultural and commercial center for police families and neighboring communities," Rodriguez said.

A mother interviewed by AFP near El Helicoide was overjoyed that her son, imprisoned inside, may soon be released under the law.

"It's wonderful! I haven't heard from my son in six months, so, damn it, this is a huge joy, it's an amnesty, my God, it's total liberation," said Betsy Orellana, 63.

Formerly Maduro's vice president, Rodriguez, 56, has quickly moved in less than four weeks in power to overhaul Venezuelan society in ways sought by the United States, earning high praise from US President Donald Trump .

Along with her brother, National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez, she has passed a new law opening up the country's critical oil sector to private investments – a key demand of Trump.

The move on Thursday was almost immediately followed by a rollback on US sanctions targeting Venezuela's oil industry.

The government also agreed on January 8, five days after Maduro was seized in a deadly US military operation, to free inmates considered political prisoners by rights groups.

Families – many of whom began camping outside the prisons – and rights groups have criticized the slow pace of the releases, with the Foro Penal NGO counting less than 300 in total released since January 8.

Opposition figures in Venezuela have voiced reserved optimism at the changes taking place, wary that Maduro's closest allies still remain in power.

Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado said Friday that Rodriguez's amnesty proposal came only after she was pushed by Washington.

"This is not a voluntary gesture by the regime, but a response to pressure from the United States government. And I hope that the prisoners will soon be able to be with their families," she posted on social media.

Opposition lawmaker Tomas Guanipa, whose two brothers are imprisoned, said he hope the amnesty would end "an era of repression."

"May this be the beginning of a path that leads us to freedom and democracy, definitively and forever," he told AFP in an interview at his home in Caracas.

US authorities on Friday announced that all Americans known to be held prisoner in Venezuela had been released.

The announcement came hours after the release of Peruvian-American political prisoner Arturo Gallino Rullier, whom the Foro Penal group said was on his way to the United States.

For years, Venezuela has routinely arrested foreigners and domestic opposition actors on a range of charges from spying to plotting attacks – charges critics dismiss as fabricated.

In a sign of Trump's satisfaction with the new Venezuelan authorities, his administration lifted a ban on US flights to the South American country.

And after years of the US embassy being shuttered, Washington is also preparing to re-establish its diplomatic presence in Caracas.

Seasoned diplomat Laura Dogu was recently named US charge d'affaires for Venezuela – the highest level representative below an ambassador.

Dogu is expected to arrive in Caracas on Saturday, diplomatic sources told AFP.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:32:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5af68142-fe45-11f0-b037-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/17256d9719472ab9bfb1c2fa45b4e6c32ca296a4.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia landslide death toll rises to 49, agency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesia-landslide-death-toll-rises-49-agency-says-2026-01-31/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - The death toll from a landslide a week ago in Indonesia's West Java province has risen to 49, the country's main rescue agency Basarnas said on Saturday, with 15 still missing.

Twenty-three soldiers were also killed while conducting border patrol training, the navy said on Tuesday.

The January 24 landslide that hit Pasir Langu village in the Bandung Barat was triggered by heavy rains. The landslide followed cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra late last year that killed 1,200 people and displaced over one million residents.

The rescue agency extended the emergency response period for seven days to February 6.

Basarnas had its funding cut by a parliamentary panel on Wednesday, despite concerns over the number of disasters the agency has to deal with.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 07:51:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7Z7VQWI3CJK5FEXZ5CBZAFAISU.jpg?auth=5f2d8f0a5d27d8b7212c554f9dbab1ca59b7ddb7bebced65839963706e959741&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran president says Trump, Netanyahu, Europe stirred tensions in protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-president-says-trump-netanyahu-europe-stirred-tensions-protests-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that U.S., Israeli and European leaders had exploited Iran's economic problems, incited unrest and provided people with the means to "tear the nation apart” in recent protests.

The two-week long nationwide protests, which began in late December over an economic crisis marked by soaring inflation and rising living costs, have abated after a bloody crackdown by the clerical authorities that U.S.-based rights group HRANA says has killed at least 6,563, including 6,170 protesters and 214 security forces.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told CNN Turk that 3,100, including 2,000 security forces, had been killed.

The U.S., Israeli and European leaders tried to "provoke, create division, and supplied resources, drawing some innocent people into this movement," Pezeshkian said in a live state TV broadcast.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced support for the demonstrators, saying the U.S. was prepared to take action if Iran continued to kill protesters. U.S. officials said on Friday that Trump was reviewing his options but had not decided whether to strike Iran.

Israel's Ynet news website said on Friday that a U.S. Navy destroyer had docked at the Israeli port of Eilat.

Trump, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Europeans "rode on our problems, provoked, and were seeking — and still seek — to fragment society," said Pezeshkian.

"They brought them into the streets and wanted, as they said, to tear this country apart, to sow conflict and hatred among the people and create division," Pezeshkian said.

"Everyone knows that the issue was not just a social protest," he added.

Regional allies including Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia have been engaging in diplomatic efforts to prevent a military confrontation between Washington and Tehran.

The U.S. is demanding that Iran curb its missile programme if the two nations are to instead resume talks, but Iran has rejected that demand.

Foreign Minister Araqchi said in Turkey on Tuesday that missiles would never be the subject of any negotiations.

In response to U.S. threats of military action, Araqchi said Tehran was ready for either negotiations or warfare, and also ready to engage with regional countries to promote stability and peace.

"Regime change is a complete fantasy. Some have fallen for this illusion," Araqchi told CNN Turk. "Our system is so deeply rooted and so firmly established that the comings and goings of individuals make no difference."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4X4WMN3PFNWZJ46HQSQYMWUCU.jpg?auth=613700e4aaef77a4559a23eb8aaa05ad01f407efcb0f2ceaad0fc9e006efeca5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French fishermen repurpose used nets to help Ukraine protect against drone attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-french-fishermen-repurpose-used-nets-help-ukraine-protect-drone-attacks</link><description>"These fishing nets were used to catch monkfish, a strong fish that hits the net hard," said Christian Abazou from the Brittany-based NGO Kernic Solidarités.

One airstrike hit an apartment in Gaza City killing three children and two women, according to a family member and the official Palestinian news agency WAFA. Another airstrike hit a tent in Khan Younis, further south, according to WAFA.

The Israeli military said it was looking into the report and did not immediately say whether it had carried out airstrikes in the enclave.

Video showed charred, blackened and destroyed walls at an apartment in a multi-storey building, and debris scattered inside it and outside on the Gaza City street.

"We found my three little nieces in the street, they say ceasefire and all, what did those children do, what did we do?" said Samer al-Atbash, a relative.

Israeli fire has killed more than 500 people, most of them civilians according to Gaza health officials, since a U.S.-brokered truce between Palestinian militant group Hamas and Israel took effect in October after two years of war .

Palestinian militants have killed four Israeli soldiers since the truce, according to Israeli authorities.

On Friday, the Israeli military said that its forces identified eight gunmen emerging from a tunnel in Rafah , in southern Gaza. Three of them were killed and a fourth, whom it described as a key Hamas commander in the area, was arrested.

The two sides have traded blame over truce violations, even as Washington presses them to proceed to the next phases of the ceasefire deal meant to end the war for good.

The next phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan includes complex issues such as Hamas disarmament , which the group has long rejected, further Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and the deployment of an international peacekeeping force.

Gaza's main gateway, the Rafah border crossing with Egypt that has been largely shut during the war, is expected to reopen on Sunday .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:52:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AZHVMLGAQFMQHKDPFHPFWMRPFA.jpg?auth=e7dc01be6fc3da67793e1b8945b5d17ed2fe7e8810599496c6edbdedf59a48b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands flee northwest Pakistan after mosques warn of possible military action</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thousands-flee-northwest-pakistan-after-mosques-warn-possible-military-action-2026-01-31/</link><description>BARA/KARACHI, Pakistan, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people have fled a remote mountainous region in northwestern Pakistan in recent weeks, residents said, after warnings broadcast from mosques urged families to evacuate ahead of a possible military action against Islamist militants.

Residents of the Tirah Valley, in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that borders Afghanistan, said they have moved out of the area into nearby towns despite heavy snowfall and cold winter temperatures because of the announcements to avoid the possible fighting.

"The announcements were made in the mosque that everyone should leave, so everyone was leaving. We left too," said Gul Afridi, a shopkeeper who fled with his family to the town of Bara located 71 km (44 miles) east of the Tirah Valley.

Local officials in the region, who asked to remain unidentified, said thousands of families have fled and are being registered for assistance in nearby towns.

The Tirah Valley has long been a sensitive security zone and a stronghold for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, an Islamist militant group that has carried out attacks on Pakistani security forces.

The Pakistani government has not announced the evacuation nor any planned military operation.

On Tuesday, Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif denied any operation was planned or underway in Tirah, calling the movement a routine seasonal migration driven by harsh winter conditions.

However, a Pakistani military source with knowledge of the matter said the relocation followed months of consultations involving tribal elders, district officials and security authorities over the presence of militants in Tirah, who they said were operating among civilian populations and pressuring residents.

The source asked to remain unidentified as they are not authorized to speak to the media.

The source said civilians were encouraged to temporarily leave to reduce the risk of harm as "targeted intelligence-based operations" continued, adding there had been no build-up for a large-scale offensive due to the area's mountainous terrain and winter conditions.

Pakistan's military media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, the interior ministry, and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provincial government did not respond to requests for comment made on Friday.

Residents rejected suggestions that winter alone drove the movement.

"No one left because of the cold," said Abdur Rahim, who said he left his village for Bara earlier this month after hearing evacuation announcements. "It has been snowing for years. We have lived there all our lives. People left because of the announcements."

Gul Afridi described a perilous journey through snowbound roads along with food shortages that made the evacuation an ordeal that took his family nearly a week.

"Here I have no home, no support for business. I don't know what is destined for us," he said at a government school in Bara where hundreds of displaced people lined up to register for assistance, complaining of slow processes and uncertainty over how long they would remain displaced.

Abdul Azeem, another displaced resident, said families were stranded for days and that children died along the way. "There were a lot of difficulties. People were stuck because of the snow," he said.

The Tirah Valley drew national attention in September after a deadly explosion at a suspected bomb-making site, with officials and local leaders offering conflicting accounts of whether civilians were among the dead.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 09:53:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4LLIDQPKRNLQHNZUWG6JH2FOSE.jpg?auth=06785e09330ab7bbb70f666e3386bf1105c74522df75a9365f8dd568829a7980&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's corruption watchdog probing emergency management minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-corruption-watchdog-probing-emergency-management-minister-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - China's minister of emergency management, Wang Xiangxi, is being investigated for suspected "serious violations of discipline and law," a common euphemism for corruption, the anti-graft watchdog said on Saturday as a purge of senior officials continues.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection did not provide details in its statement on Wang, a Communist Party secretary. It is relatively rare for a sitting minister to undergo investigation.

In President Xi Jinping’s years-long corruption purge, the defence ministry announced last week it was investigating the nation's top general, Zhang Youxia, who is second only to Xi in the military leadership.

Xi said this month that anti-corruption is a battle China must not lose, following a record 65 probes into high-ranking officials last year, while scrutiny has expanded to former leaders of universities and state-owned enterprises.

Wang, 63, took office in July 2022, after serving as chairman of state-owned power generator National Energy Investment Corp.

He appeared on Tuesday, speaking at a regular internal meeting where cadres engage in self-criticism, according to an official release from the Ministry of Emergency Management.

Pakistan has been battling a separatist insurgency in Balochistan for decades, where militants target state forces, foreign nationals and non-locals in the mineral-rich southwestern province bordering Afghanistan and Iran .

"The terrorists ... launched coordinated attacks this morning at more than 12 locations", a senior security official said on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

"Thirty-seven terrorists have been eliminated... Ten security personnel were martyred while a few others were injured," the official added.

A senior security official based in the provincial capital of Quetta said at least four policemen were killed in Quetta, although it was not clear whether they were included in the 10 officials killed.

A senior military official based in Islamabad confirmed the attacks, adding they were "coordinated but poorly executed".

The attacks "failed due to poor planning and rapid collapse under effective security response", the official added.

Separatists had also abucted the deputy commissioner of Nushki district, a senior official in Quetta said.

Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the security forces for "foiling coordinated attacks" in 12 locations.

"I, along with the entire nation, am proud of our martyrs," Sharif said in a statement accusing India of backing the separatists.

"We will continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication from the country," he said.

At least four police officials in as many districts confirmed that the situation was not completely under control yet.

Mobile phone services have been jammed and traffic disrupted in the affected districts, while train services have been suspended across the province.

The Baloch Liberation Army (BLA), the most active militant separatist group in the province, claimed responsibility for the attacks in a statement sent to AFP.

The group claimed to target military installations and police and civil administration officials during gun attacks and suicide bombings, adding that major highways were also blocked to disrupt the military's operation.

In Quetta, an AFP journalist heard several explosions as heavy security was deployed across the city, with major roads deserted and business activity shut down.

"Since morning, there have been explosions one after another," Abdul Wali, a 38-year-old private employee, said as he struggled to find blood for his hospitalised mother.

"The police point guns at us and say go back otherwise they beat us. What should we do?" he added.

Saturday's attacks come a day after the military said it had killed 41 insurgents in two separate operations in the province.

Balochistan is Pakistan's poorest province, despite an abundance of untapped natural resources, and lags behind the rest of the country in education, employment and economic development.

Baloch separatists have intensified attacks on Pakistanis from neighbouring provinces working in the region in recent years, as well as foreign energy firms, which they believe are exploiting the province's riches.

Pakistan routinely accuses neighbouring India and Afghanistan of fomenting militancy.

"Throughout the operation, the terrorists were reportedly in continuous contact with their handlers in Afghanistan," the security official said.

Last year, ethnic Baloch separatists attacked a train with 450 passengers on board, sparking a two-day siege during which dozens of people were killed.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:28:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4c341cd6-fe87-11f0-a6ca-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/8ad3e8510b89b341c1573ef4570f8860ac833f9f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moldova hit by widespread power cuts amid Ukraine grid problems</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/moldova-hit-by-widespread-power-cuts-amid-ukraine-grid-problems-2026-01-31/</link><description>CHISINAU, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Moldova's energy system was hit by an emergency outage on Saturday due to problems in neighbouring Ukraine's grid, officials said, with the capital Chisinau and other parts of the country experiencing power cuts.

According to a Moldovan energy ministry statement on the Telegram app, disruptions in Ukraine's grid led to a voltage drop on one of the power lines into Moldova.

Most districts in Moldova's Chisinau were without electricity supplies, the city mayor Ion Ceban said on Telegram, with officials adding that even traffic lights were not working.

Ukrainian energy officials have yet to comment on the situation. Emergency power cuts have also been introduced in some parts of Ukraine, power company DTEK said, and the metro in Kyiv has stopped operating.

The grid emergency has also led to a temporary halt to Kyiv's water supply, officials said.

Ukraine's power grid has been one of the main targets of months of Russian strikes, and there have been significant restrictions to power supplies for consumers there for weeks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 10:52:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cubans under siege as US stranglehold sets in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-under-siege-us-stranglehold-sets-2026-01-31/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S. threatens a stranglehold on the communist-run nation.

Reuters interviewed over three dozen residents of towns and neighborhoods around the capital Havana – the country's political and economic engine - from street vendors to private sector workers, taxi drivers and state employees.

Together, those discussions paint a picture of a people pushed to the limit as goods and services - particularly those tied to ever more limited fuel supplies - become scarcer and more expensive.

For much of rural Cuba, this is not entirely new. The island's frail and antiquated power generation system has been slowly failing for years and residents have grown accustomed to spending hours at a time without functioning electricity , internet or water pumps.

But the seaside capital, where the streets are lined with 1950s-era cars and colorful if decrepit Spanish colonial architecture, has until recently fared better.

Now crisis looks set to swamp it, too, as fuel shortages take hold, with first Venezuela , then Mexico halting oil shipments to the island.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs will be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe in the wake of the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.

In many other countries, the conditions would have sent people out into the streets. So far, in a nation where dissent has long been curbed, there has been little sign of protest. But it is unclear how much more Cubans will be willing to endure.

Cuba's peso has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar in three weeks, pushing up the price of groceries.

"This has put me in an impossible situation," said Yaite Verdecia, a Havana resident and housewife. "There's no salary that can cope with this."

Trump, when asked about the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in Cuba shortly after the capture of Maduro, said he did not think an attack was necessary because "it looks like it's going down."

On Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an "international emergency" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted "an unusual and extraordinary threat."

But the government has said little about how it will manage the growing threat of humanitarian crisis.

Many of the Cubans Reuters spoke with said daily life - already difficult - had been reduced to basics like assuring food, fuel for cooking, and water, and that it had become noticeably harder in recent days.

Lines for gasoline have grown significantly this week at a handful of service centers in the city still supplied with fuel. And since the U.S. blocked Venezuelan deliveries of oil to Cuba in mid-December, virtually all gas has been sold at a premium, in dollars - a currency to which few Cubans have access.

"It used to be that you could sign up and get fuel once a month (in pesos)," said Havana resident Jesus Sosa, referring to an app that would let residents know when it was their turn to fill up their cars. "Not anymore. Sales in national currency have stopped."

The crunch has hit both public and private transportation, putting some buses and private taxis out of business and forcing others to raise their prices.

Daylan Perez, a 22-year-old who hails private taxis for clients in old Havana, said fewer buses mean people now have no choice but to pay rising fees for private transport.

"You have to pay the price or stay home," he said.

Even transportation by electric vehicle - once thought to be a panacea in a city short of fuel - has been hit by blackouts that now last for eight to 12 hours or more.

Taxi driver Alexander Leyet of Havana swapped to an electric three-wheeled taxi recently, thinking he had outsmarted the pack.

"Now because of the blackouts I can only charge my taxi for four or five hours," he said.

For decades, the government that has its roots in Fidel Castro's 1959 Cuban Revolution has survived despite sometimes brutal economic struggles, upending regular predictions of imminent collapse or an uprising.

It has long alleged a U.S.-led effort to foment revolt, but the most recent widespread protests were in the pandemic year of 2021, despite a 12% contraction of the economy between 2019 and 2024.

Sharp crackdowns on any form of dissent, combined with the emigration of between one and two million people since the pandemic, have all but eliminated organized in-country opposition. The Cubans interviewed by Reuters generally declined to answer questions about the prospect of protests.

But none of those interviewed disputed that change was necessary.

"I'm just praying God finds a way to get us out of this (mess)," said Mirta Trujillo, a 71-year-old street vendor from Guanabacoa who burst into tears as she told Reuters she could no longer afford food. Previously, she had depended on a ration book of basic goods provided by the government, but that was phased out post-pandemic as tourist income and other sources of hard currency dried up.

"I'm not against my country... but I don't want to die of hunger," she said.

On a recent weekday evening, Reuters witnessed an accident at a busy intersection in Havana where the stoplights were not functioning as a result of a power outage.

"Sometimes when the power goes out, accidents happen because the traffic lights don't work," said Raysa Lemu, whose apartment overlooks a boulevard in Marianao, on the outskirts of Havana.

"It used to be they turned off the power two or three times a week, but now it's every day and sometimes it's up to 12 hours."

Julia Anita Cobas, a 69-year-old housekeeper from Guanabacoa, gets up at 4 a.m. each morning for a 10-mile (16-km) commute that now approaches four hours round-trip. With less public transportation available, the journey has become longer and more costly.

"I leave my house before sunrise and I don't know how I'll get back," she said.

But Cobas, who was born just before Castro's revolution, said she had no expectation that Trump would make things any better.

"Since I was born the (United States) has been threatening us, and every day we deal with hardship. But we've survived it all," she said.

Aimee Milanes, a 32-year-old resident of Reparto Electrico, just outside Havana, said neither the Cuban nor the U.S. government offered her much hope.

"We're drowning. But there's nothing we can do," said Milanes. "This is about survival. Nothing else."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:20:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EU4GIFNX7RL4XOMZLGHJT35TVA.jpg?auth=3e1a72443b77e9d6e1059a5ba667b2a6e895c4f7d1dfd42086c86d6c92804358&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Technical malfunction' causes mass power outages in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-technical-malfunction-causes-mass-power-outages-in-ukraine</link><description>Ukraine 's power grid experienced mass outages on Saturday after a "technical malfunction" caused electrical lines between Moldova , Romania and Ukraine to fail, Ukraine's energy minister said.

The malfunction "caused a simultaneous shutdown of the 400 kilovolt line between the power grids of Romania and Moldova and the 750 kilovolt line between western and central Ukraine", Denys Shmygal said on Telegram.

Problems ​in Ukraine's ⁠power grid also led to the emergency ​shutdown ‍of Moldova's ​energy system on Saturday, Moldova's ​energy ministry said.

The latest outages come amid recent Russian attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure that have caused major disruptions to heat, electricity and water provision as the country faces a particularly harsh winter.

Due to the power shortages on Saturday, Kyiv 's metro system temporarily closed, the operator said.

The Kyiv metro is a vital transport artery for the capital and rarely pauses operations, even during intense Russian bombardment.

Around 800,000 passengers use the system daily, according to data published last year. Many of them rely on it to commute to work.

Residents also use its 52 stations as bomb shelters during Russian attacks.

"Due to a power outage from external power supply centres, train service and escalator operation have been temporarily suspended in the metro," Kyiv Metro said in a post on Facebook.

The system will serve as a shelter until power resumes, Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said in a post on Telegram.

Russia has hit Ukrainian energy infrastructure throughout its nearly four-year invasion, but Kyiv says this winter has been the toughest yet, as attacks cut power and heating to millions during sub-zero temperatures.

The Kremlin said Friday said that President Vladimir Putin had agreed to stop striking Kyiv for a week until Sunday following a request from US counterpart Donald Trump .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:24:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f5db951e-fe93-11f0-b136-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-30T174851Z-1518836082-RC2PBJAM6D77-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-COLD-KYIV.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria's Fela Kuti is first African musician honoured with Grammys Lifetime Achievement award</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260131-fela-kuti-first-african-honored-grammys-lifetime-achievement-award-afrobeat</link><description>Afrobeat legend Fela Kuti to make history as first African honoured with posthumous Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. After a lifetime of clashes with successive powers in Nigeria , the recognition comes nearly three decades after Fela's death and long after his influence reshaped global music.

He is one of several artists getting the award at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Saturday, the eve of the main Grammys gala.

Others are Cher, Whitney Houston, Carlos Santana, Paul Simon and Chaka Khan.

In the 1970s, Fela the multi-instrumentalist and full-of-life performer invented Afrobeat: a mixture of jazz , funk and African rhythms.

That laid the groundwork for Afrobeats – a later genre that has attracted a global audience by blending traditional African rhythms with contemporary pop sounds, with its roots in Nigeria.

Two years ago the Grammys introduced the category of Best African Performance in 2024 and it has been dominated by Afrobeats artists, especially from Nigeria.

Of the five nominees for the Best African performance this year, three are Nigerian Afrobeats singers, after another Nigerian, Tems, won last year.

"Fela's influence spans generations, inspiring artists such as Beyonce, Paul McCartney and Thom Yorke, and shaping modern Nigerian Afrobeats," said a citation on the Grammys list of this year's honourees.

Known also as the "Black President", the activist and legendary musician, died in 1997 at the age of 58.

His legacy lives on through his sons, Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti, and grandson Made.

"This acknowledgment coming at this time when all three of us are present. It feels wonderful," Grammy-nominated Made Kuti said.

"It feels wonderful that all of us are still practicing Afrobeat, still taking the legacy as far as we can take it."

Yemisi Ransome-Kuti, Fela's first cousin and head of the family, said on Friday the award was "a celebration for the African people and they should take (it).. as their award. Another African is being celebrated."

"But we also want to send a message to those who are giving these acknowledgements, please ...not wait till people are dead," she said.

As to what would have been Fela's reaction, Ransome-Kuti said: "I'm sure he would have said better late than never" although "in his lifetime he was not particularly interested in being recognised in the external world, particularly the western world".

Fela was arrested frequently by military governments during his career, sometimes for political activism and sometimes also on allegations of theft, which he denied.

His first brush with the law dated back to 1974 when he released his famous album "Zombie", generally considered by the military authorities in power as a diatribe levelled at them.

His songs were long, defiant and explicitly anti-governments in power and anti-corruption.

His manager, Rikki Stein, speaking on the phone from Los Angeles where he will join the Kuti family at the ceremony, was confident the award would "significantly uplift Fela's music".

"Fifty albums out there. I'm sure it's going to continue onward and upward."

"An increasing number of people what weren't even born when Fela died are expressing interest in listening to Fela's music and hopefully Fela's message," he said</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 11:44:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/32de12d0-fe98-11f0-9909-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP8609130557-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone strikes in Ethiopia's Tigray region kill one, injure another</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/drone-strikes-ethiopias-tigray-region-kill-one-injure-another-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - One person was killed and another injured in drone strikes in Ethiopia's northern Tigray region on Saturday, a senior Tigrayan official and a humanitarian worker said, in another sign of renewed conflict between regional and national forces.

Ethiopia's national army fought fighters from the Tigray People's Liberation Front for two years until late 2022, in a war researchers say killed hundreds of thousands through direct violence, the collapse of healthcare and famine.

Fighting broke out between regional and national forces in the disputed territory of western Tigray earlier this week, according to diplomatic and government sources .

The senior Tigrayan official said the drone strikes hit two Isuzu trucks near Enticho and Gendebta, two places in Tigray about 20 kilometres apart. A humanitarian worker confirmed the strikes had happened. Both asked not to be named.

The Tigrayan official said the Ethiopian National Defence Force launched the strikes but did not provide evidence.

A spokesperson for the ENDF did not respond to a request for comment.

It was not immediately clear what the trucks were carrying.

TPLF-affiliated news outlet Dimtsi Weyane posted pictures on Facebook which it said showed the trucks damaged in the strikes. It said the trucks were transporting food and cooking items.

Pro-government activists posting on social media said the trucks were carrying weapons.

Earlier this week national carrier Ethiopian Airlines cancelled flights to Tigray, where residents rushed to try to withdraw cash from banks.

The Tigray war ended with a peace pact in November 2022, but disagreements have continued over a range of issues, including contested territories in western Tigray and the delayed disarmament of Tigray forces.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 12:50:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion occurs at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas, Iranian media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-occurs-irans-southern-port-bandar-abbas-iranian-media-reports-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - An explosion occurred at Iran's southern port of Bandar Abbas on Saturday, Iranian media reported, without giving a cause for the blast.

The semi-official Tasnim news agency said that social media reports alleging that a Revolutionary Guard navy commander was targeted in the explosion were "completely false".

Iranian media said the blast was being investigated but gave no further information. Iranian authorities could not immediately be contacted for comment.

The port of Bandar Abbas lies on the Strait of Hormuz, a vital waterway between Iran and Oman which handles about a fifth of the world's seaborne oil.

The reported explosion comes amid heightened tensions between Tehran and Washington after Iranian authorities quelled the biggest protests to convulse the country in three years, and also amid ongoing Western concerns over Iran's nuclear programme.

The nationwide protests erupted in December over economic hardship and posed one of the toughest challenges to the country's clerical rulers.

At least 5,000 people were killed in the protests, including 500 members of the security forces, an Iranian official told Reuters.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday an "armada" was heading toward Iran . Multiple sources said on Friday that Trump was weighing options against Iran that include targeted strikes on security forces.

Earlier on Saturday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian accused U.S., Israeli and European leaders of exploiting Iran's economic problems, inciting unrest and providing people with the means to "tear the nation apart”.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 12:50:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBQRDVLZZNOOLEZID2WCMW545E.jpg?auth=0b5d5d815aa14e48446b7c52410d4cfe59a4cc3ff5ce7cb84d5c54e466383810&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan says 67 militants killed after coordinated attacks in Balochistan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-says-67-militants-killed-after-coordinated-attacks-balochistan-2026-01-31/</link><description>QUETTA, Pakistan, Jan 31 (Reuters) - At least 67 militants were killed on Saturday as they battled Pakistan's security forces in multiple cities across the southwestern province of Balochistan, four security officials told Reuters.

Some 10 police and security personnel and 11 civilians were also killed during the orchestrated militant attacks, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Twenty-four police officers were injured.

The military's media wing did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Pakistan's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, in a statement, condemned the attacks and praised security forces for repelling them, saying they had killed dozens of militants.

The attacks came a day after Pakistan's military said it killed 41 militants in separate raids in Balochistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan and has faced a decades-long separatist insurgency.

The banned separatist group Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for Saturday's attacks, saying it had launched them simultaneously across the province. The BLA said it had killed 84 Pakistan security personnel.

Security officials said armed men launched attacks in several urban areas, including the provincial capital Quetta and the port city of Gwadar, prompting operations by the army, police and counterterrorism units.

Hospitals were placed on emergency footing in some districts, officials said.

In Gwadar, militants attacked a camp accommodating migrant workers, killing 11 people, Atta-ur-Rehman, a senior police officer said, revising an earlier death toll of five. Those killed included five men, three women and three children..

Security forces killed six militants in Gwadar after responding to the attack, he said.

Officials said the situation was critical in Noshki, a district of Balochistan, after militants abducted the area's top civil administrator. He said in a social media video that he was in the custody of the militants. Reuters could not independently verify the video.

Armed men briefly blocked roads in parts of Quetta and a blast was heard near a high-security area, authorities said, though they later said the situation had been brought under control.

Security officials said in text messages that forces had responded effectively to the attacks and that clearance operations were still underway.

Balochistan is Pakistan's largest but poorest province and has faced a decades-long insurgency by ethnic Baloch militant groups. Pakistan says the violence is backed by foreign actors, a charge denied by India.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 13:43:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli strikes kill at least 30 across Gaza in one of highest tolls since October ceasefire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260131-israeli-strikes-kill-30-palestinians-including-children-gaza-ceasefire-inches-forward</link><description>Hospitals in Gaza said Israeli strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians Saturday, one of the highest tolls since the October ceasefire aimed at stopping the fighting.

A day after Israel accused Hamas of new ceasefire violations, strikes hit locations throughout Gaza, including lethal ones on an apartment building in Gaza City and a tent camp in Khan Younis, officials at hospitals that received the bodies said.

The casualties included two women and six children from two different families. An air strike also hit a police station in Gaza City, killing at least 14 and wounding others, Shifa Hospital director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said.

The series of strikes also came a day before the Rafah crossing along the border with Egypt is set to open in Gaza’s southernmost city . All of the territory’s border crossings have been closed throughout almost the entire war. Palestinians see Rafah as a lifeline for the tens of thousands in need of treatment outside the territory, where the majority of medical infrastructure has been destroyed.

The crossing's opening, limited at first, marks the first major step in the second phase of the US-brokered ceasefire. Reopening borders is among the challenging issues on the agenda for the phase now underway, which also include demilitarising the strip after nearly two decades of Hamas rule and installing a new government to oversee reconstruction.

Still, Saturday’s strikes are a reminder that the death toll in Gaza is still rising even as the ceasefire agreement inches forward.

Nasser Hospital said the strike on the tent camp caused a fire to break out, killing seven, including a father, his three children and three grandchildren. Meanwhile, Shifa Hospital said the Gaza City apartment building strike killed three children, their aunt and grandmother on Saturday morning, while the strike on the police station killed at least 14 – officers, including four policewomen, civilians and inmates held at the station. The hospital also said a man was killed in a strike Saturday in the eastern side of Jabaliya refugee camp.

Hamas called Saturday's strikes “a renewed flagrant violation” and urged the United States and other mediating countries to push Israel to stop strikes.

Israel’s military, which has struck targets on both sides of the ceasefire’s dividing line, said its attacks since October have been responses to violations of the agreement. It said in a statement that Saturday’s strikes followed what it described as ceasefire violations a day earlier, when the army killed at least four militants emerging from a tunnel in an Israeli-controlled area of Rafah.

The number reported killed Saturday was several times higher than the daily average since the ceasefire began. As of Friday, Gaza’s Health Ministry had recorded at least 520 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire since the start of the ceasefire on October 10. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by UN agencies and independent experts.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 13:46:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b61a3024-fea3-11f0-9b72-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031346989500.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four killed in gas blast in residential building in Iran's Ahvaz, media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/four-killed-gas-blast-residential-building-irans-ahvaz-media-reports-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Four people were killed after a gas explosion at a residential building in Iran's Ahvaz, the state-run Tehran Times reported citing the head of the city's fire department.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 14:27:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's Orban denies need for spending cuts after April election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-orban-denies-need-spending-cuts-after-april-election-2026-01-31/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban denied on Saturday that he will have to impose austerity measures to rein in the budget deficit if he wins an election in April, and said his right-wing Fidesz party would keep its flagship spending policies in place.

In power since 2010, the veteran nationalist is lagging a centre-right challenger in most opinion polls and battling the weakest economic stretch of his 16-year rule, with the economy nearly stagnant since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine caused inflation across central Europe.

Economists say whoever wins the April 12 ballot will have little choice but to tighten purse strings after heavy pre-election spending.

"That's a flat-out lie," Orban told a campaign rally, citing economists' view of Hungary's finances. "The state of the Hungarian economy does not require any kind of austerity."

Late last year, Orban's government raised its budget deficit targets to 5% for 2025 and the 2026 election year to make way for pre-election spending, steps which contributed to Fitch Ratings cutting its outlook on Hungary's debt to negative.

Orban said Hungary's budget deficit, which has exceeded government forecasts in recent years, would have to be lowered "calmly, slowly and gradually" as economic prospects improve.

"We need no austerity and nothing should be taken away from the people", Orban said. He said a 3% subsidised mortgage rate or a plan to exempt mothers of two from income tax by the end of the next government cycle would remain intact if he is elected.

With Fidesz trying to fend off centre-right rival Tisza, Orban's government has launched a 100 billion forint ($310 million) scheme to help the restaurant industry and a 50 billion forint ($160 million) measure to curb household heating bills.

Data released on Friday showed Hungary's economy mired in near-stagnation for a third year, underperforming nearby Poland and the Czech Republic. Some analysts have lowered their 2026 growth outlook after the weak figures.

The party said at a convention in the city of Calgary on Saturday that Poilievre won 87.4% of votes cast in the review mandated after the Liberal Party, led by Prime Minister Mark Carney, defeated the Conservatives in the election last April.

Under Poilievre, the Conservatives had held a more than 20-point lead over the Liberals last January but U.S. President Donald Trump’s repeated threats to make Canada the 51st U.S. state united much of the country behind Carney.

Poilievre lost his own seat in the election but returned to parliament after winning a by-election in August.

Before the leadership review, Ashton Arsenault, a former ministerial staffer under ex-Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, said Poilievre should aim to win at least 75% of the vote to demonstrate the party’s confidence in his leadership.

"That lets every outside observer and party member know that people are behind (Poilievre) and this is the horse we’re riding with in the next election," Arsenault said.

According to the pollster Angus Reid, Carney’s approval rating among Canadians is now at 60%, his highest such rating since he became the Liberal leader.

Although 80% of Conservative voters support Poilievre, who is 46 and has been party leader since 2022, views of him among the wider public are more negative, with 58% holding an unfavourable view of him.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:30:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MOX3ZNCOWBK77H2ZNI3SFIVZCI.jpg?auth=ca128faa121bd5fa77c19b710557fd86cec0bc4167b480509c6536d66f4c1637&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy investigates church painting of angel restored to look like Meloni</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/italy-investigates-church-painting-angel-restored-look-like-meloni-2026-01-31/</link><description>ROME, Jan 31 (Reuters) - An angel in a church in central Rome has been restored to look like Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, a national newspaper reported on Saturday, prompting the culture ministry to investigate and Meloni to laugh off the affair.

In a front-page story, la Repubblica daily was the first to note that one of two angels in a chapel of the Basilica of St Lawrence in Lucina had been altered to resemble the 49-year-old conservative, Italy's first female prime minister.

The article ran with before-and-after pictures of the painting. It said the angel had previously looked like a "generic cherub".

The culture ministry said it had instructed Rome's top art heritage official to carry out a same-day inspection of the restored painting before "deciding what to do next".

The opposition Five Star Movement complained: "We cannot allow art and culture to risk becoming a tool for propaganda or anything else, regardless of whether the face depicted is that of the prime minister."

The parish priest, Daniele Micheletti, told ANSA news agency that the decorations in the chapel had recently been touched up following water damage. The originals dated only to 2000, so were not under any heritage protection.

The restoration was carried out by the same artist who created the original painting, Bruno Valentinetti. He disputed the suggestion he had altered the image, telling reporters: "I restored what was there before... 25 years ago".

As for Meloni, she posted a picture of the disputed painting on Instagram, with the caption "No, I definitely don't look like an angel", with a laughing emoji.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:57:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VGXAFFMD6JMFFET44ILLWCFC3A.jpg?auth=f78e4aadee9bfe7117dfb828ab67040b5cfab7042264795f75ce3e3863868eab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Creeping fascism': Milan protesters slam ICE deployment at Winter Olympics</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-creeping-fascism-milan-protesters-slam-ice-deployment-at-winter-olympics</link><description>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered Saturday in Milan to protest the deployment of ICE agents during the upcoming Winter Olympics , despite the fact that agents would be stationed in a control room and not operating on the streets .

The protest in Piazza XXV Aprile, a square named for the date of Italy’s liberation from Nazi fascism in 1945, drew people from the left-leaning Democratic Party, the CGIL trade union confederation and the ANPI organisations that protect the memory of Italy’s partisan resistance during World War II , along with many other people.

Organisers handed out plastic whistles, which participants blew as music blared from a van. The protest was as much against the news that agents from a division of ICE would participate in security for the US delegation as against what many saw as creeping fascism in the United States.

“No thank you, from Minnesota to the world, at the side of anyone who fights for human rights ,’’ read one banner. “Never again means never again for anyone,’’ read another, and “Ice only in Spritz’,’ a reference to a popular aperitif, read yet another.

News of the deployment of ICE agents has provoked a backlash in Italy. Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala has said they were not welcome. Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi has been called to Parliament to testify about the deployment this week.

Protester Silvana Grassi held a sign that read “Ice = Gestapo.” She said the scenes of ICE agents in Minneapolis shooting and killing protesters and detaining children were deeply upsetting.

“It makes me want to cry to think of it,’’ Grassi said. “It’s too terrible. How did they elect such a terrible, evil man?’’

The ICE agents to be deployed to Milan are not from the same unit as the immigration agents cracking down in Minnesota and other US cities.

Homeland Security Investigations, a ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the US is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.

“Even if it’s not the same ones, we don’t want them here,’’ Grassi said.

Paolo Bortoletto, also holding a banner, was aware that the officers would have an investigative and not a street role.

Still, he said, “We don’t want them in our country. We are a peaceful country. We don’t want fascists. It’s their ideas that bother us."

The Olympics begin February 6 with an opening ceremony that will be attended by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio .</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 16:58:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fd87ebcc-febc-11f0-ab2d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26031540142092.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Morocco deploys army to help evacuate thousands after floods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/morocco-deploys-army-help-evacuate-thousands-after-floods-2026-01-31/</link><description>RABAT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Morocco has deployed army rescue units to help with the evacuation of thousands of people after floods triggered by torrential rains and rising river levels hit parts of the country's northwest, state TV reported on Saturday.

Weeks of heavy rainfall, combined with water releases from a nearly full dam nearby, increased water levels in the Loukous River and flooded several neighbourhoods in the city of Ksar Kbir, about 190 km (118 miles) north of the capital Rabat, a national flood follow-up committee said.

More than 20,000 people had been moved to shelter and camps by Saturday, official media reported.

Authorities set up sandbags and temporary barriers in flood-prone districts as waters began to recede.

Schools in Ksar Kbir have been ordered to remain closed until February 7 as a precaution.

In the nearby province of Sidi Kacem, the Sebou River's rising levels prompted evacuations from several villages as authorities raised vigilance levels.

The abundant rainfall ended a seven-year drought that drove the country to invest heavily in desalination plants.

The average dam-filling rate has risen to 60%, with several major reservoirs reaching full capacity, according to official data.

Last month, 37 people were killed in flash floods in the Atlantic coastal city of Safi , south of Rabat.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 17:49:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protesters in Copenhagen rally for Danish veterans after Trump remarks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/protesters-copenhagen-rally-danish-veterans-after-trump-remarks-2026-01-31/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Danes gathered outside the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen on Saturday in support of veterans who said they had been insulted by President Donald Trump's comment that European allies had kept "off the front lines" in the Afghanistan war.

Denmark, with a population less than 2% the size of the United States, was one of the major combat allies in the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan, losing 44 service members killed, a per capita death toll on par with that of the Americans themselves.

Trump had already antagonised Danes by demanding the annexation of Greenland, a semi-autonomous territory of the Danish kingdom, when he made the remarks last week questioning the role of NATO allies during the conflict.

The remarks sparked widespread backlash from Europeans, with Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer calling them "insulting and frankly appalling". Trump subsequently singled out British troops for praise, but stopped short of apologising or addressing the role of European troops more broadly.

"Behind all these flags, there's a guy, there's a soldier, there's a young man," said retired Danish Lieutenant-Colonel Niels Christian Koefoed, who served in Afghanistan, as demonstrators planted Danish flags embroidered with the names of the deceased outside the U.S. Embassy.

The protesters, many wearing medals received for their NATO service, marched to the embassy, where the names of Danish soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq were read aloud. The event concluded with a moment of silence.

"I lost a very close friend and colleague of mine," said Afghanistan veteran Jesper Larsen. "So I was hurt by what Mr Trump said, and I think he owes all my combat friends an apology."</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 18:33:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IA5FQDOKLRL2JO7XPLNQWLWRPI.jpg?auth=5d8b2e9563c438bbfa81f8da27d07beb9dfe72d99c5221556f9787618c4fd2a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s policies ‘erodes the fabric of global cooperation’, ex-Swedish PM Bildt says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260131-trump-s-policies-erodes-the-fabric-of-global-cooperation-ex-swedish-pm-bildt-says</link><description>&gt;&gt; Click on video player above to watch the full interview</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 18:36:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/80b6733c-fecd-11f0-a1c9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260131-180206-182104-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says Ukraine is getting ready for new peace talks next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-is-getting-ready-new-peace-talks-next-week-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that Ukraine was waiting for more information from the United States about further peace talks and expected new meetings to take place next week.

Zelenskiy's statement during his nightly video address appeared to suggest that a meeting scheduled for Sunday in the United Arab Emirates between representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the United States would not take place. The three sides held a round of talks a week ago.

"We are in constant communication with the American side and are expecting specific details from them regarding further meetings," Zelenskiy said.

"Ukraine is ready to work in all working formats. It is important that there be results and that the meetings take place. We are counting on meetings next week and are preparing for them."

U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff led a team of representatives in talks in Florida on Saturday with Kremlin envoy Kirill Dmitriev and described the discussions as "productive and constructive."

The U.S. has been spearheading diplomatic efforts to end the war, launched nearly four years ago by the Kremlin's invasion of its smaller neighbour.

Witkoff has singled out the question of territory as the key to making progress in the negotiations, with Kyiv rejecting Moscow's demand that it cede all of the Donbas region, including areas its army has not captured.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said this week that land was not the sole key issue under discussion but did not identify other unresolved issues.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 19:22:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PVACHLFTVVKTTDJFYODHGSNMTM.jpg?auth=05d8f6b11473924cfe5a5fa20a13ca6d06182a4b8fa6c2a5abb6b761f932c1bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK’s Starmer says ex-Prince Andrew should testify before Congress over Epstein ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-starmer-says-ex-prince-andrew-should-testify-before-congress-over-epstein-2026-01-31/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 31 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Saturday that the former Prince Andrew should testify before a U.S. congressional committee, following new revelations about Andrew's links to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

New files related to Epstein published by the U.S. justice department on Friday included emails that showed King Charles's brother maintaining regular contact with Epstein for more than two years after he was found guilty of child sex crimes.

The files also include pictures appearing to show Andrew crouching over and touching the waist of an unidentified woman lying on the floor. Her face was blacked out in the redacted images.

The king stripped his brother of his title of prince and evicted him from his mansion in the grounds of Windsor Castle in November, in the wake of previous revelations about his links with Epstein.

The former prince, 65, now uses the family name Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor. He has denied wrongdoing in connection with Epstein and had previously denied maintaining ties with the financier after Epstein's 2008 conviction, apart from a 2010 visit to New York to end their relationship.

He did not reply to a Reuters request for comment on the latest revelations. Buckingham Palace declined to comment.

Starmer, speaking to reporters on the plane to Japan after a four-day visit to China , said the former prince should appear before U.S. lawmakers to explain everything he knows about Epstein to help his victims.

"Anybody who has got information should be prepared to share that information in whatever form they are asked to do that,” Starmer said. "You can’t be victim centred if you’re not prepared to do that."

In November, members of a U.S. congressional committee investigating the Epstein case intensified their calls for Andrew to answer questions.

Epstein died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. He was jailed in 2008 for soliciting paid sex from a minor.

The files show Andrew maintained regular contact with Epstein after his conviction, including discussing potential business deals and social meetings.

In several emails, Epstein and Andrew discuss women that the financier proposes to put in touch with the prince. In one email, Epstein offered to bring three women to Buckingham Palace.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:26:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SCDTIH2QXJMRVPXFLDXS264SEY.jpg?auth=115658303f8031c035fe22e14f40f629a349883f3998eab7e2a72c35620fcf92&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq's Shi'ite bloc reaffirms backing for Maliki despite Trump's warnings</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-shiite-bloc-reaffirms-backing-maliki-despite-trumps-warnings-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Iraq's alliance of Shi'ite political blocs, the Coordination Framework, reaffirmed on Saturday its support for former premier Nouri al-Maliki to lead the next government, despite a warning from U.S. President Donald Trump that Washington would no longer help Iraq if Maliki returned to power.

The bloc, which holds a majority in parliament, picked Maliki , Iraq's first elected prime minister after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003, as its nominee for the post following an election .

"The choice of the prime minister is a purely Iraqi constitutional matter and should proceed without foreign interference," the Coordination Framework said in a statement, adding that it seeks balanced relations with international partners based on mutual respect.

Trump's threats are the starkest example yet of the Republican president's campaign to curb Iran-linked groups' influence in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:27:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7GKVTFRZ5BI5PEV7EIR63MT2SY.jpg?auth=33dff3ba3956c8a3ff45d136784295d3cae412fb8ca881cc05abc5a8236dd9dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff holds ‘constructive’ Ukraine talks with Russia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260131-us-envoy-witkoff-holds-constructive-ukraine-talks-with-russia</link><description>US envoy Steve Witkoff said Saturday he had held constructive talks with a Russian envoy in Florida as part of Washington's drive to end the war in Ukraine .

The meeting came just a day before Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were scheduled to meet in Abu Dhabi to discuss a US-backed plan to halt the nearly four-year conflict that began with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"Today in Florida, the Russian Special Envoy Kirill Dmitriev held productive and constructive meetings as part of the U.S. mediation effort toward advancing a peaceful resolution of the Ukrainian conflict," Witkoff posted on X.

"We are encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine," he added.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, President Donald Trump 's son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House Senior Advisor Josh Gruenbaum also attended the talks, he said.

Earlier Saturday, a source close to the talks had told AFP that they had started at 8:00 am (1300 GMT) and that Dmitriev had arrived in Miami.

Neither side released details of what was discussed.

Dmitriev, Russian President Vladimir Putin 's top economic envoy, met Witkoff and Kushner earlier in January on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

He also held talks with US negotiators on Ukraine in a visit to Miami in December.

The second round of talks in Abu Dhabi are set to start on Sunday, even if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested earlier this week that it might be postponed because of the US-Iran crisis.

Zelensky said in his evening address Saturday his negotiators were also waiting to hear from the United States on further meetings.

"Ukraine is ready to work in all working formats," said Zelensky. "It is important that there are results and that the meetings take place. We are counting on meetings next week and are preparing for them."

Teams from Ukraine and Russia met Friday and Saturday last week in Abu Dhabi in their first in-person negotiations on a plan being pushed by Trump.

The United States says both sides are close to a deal, but they have so far been unable to find a compromise on the key issue of territory in a post-war settlement, according to Kyiv.

The Kremlin on Friday said Putin had agreed to a pause on striking Kyiv -- ending Sunday -- following a request by Trump.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:52:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a59538c6-fee3-11f0-b2a1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26029832554221.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly blast rips Iranian port city as Tehran plans naval drills in Strait of Hormuz</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260131-deadly-blast-rips-iranian-port-city-as-tehran-plans-naval-drills-in-strait-of-hormuz</link><description>An explosion tore through an apartment building Saturday in Iran 's port city of Bandar Abbas, killing a 4-year-old girl as local media footage purportedly showed a security force member being carried out by rescuers.

The blast happened a day before a planned naval drill by Iran in the Strait of Hormuz , the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which a fifth of all oil traded passes. Already, the US military had warned Iran not to threaten its warships or commercial traffic in the strait, on which Bandar Abbas sits.

State television quoted a local fire official as blaming the blast on a gas leak. Media reported at least 14 others suffered injuries in the explosion at the eight-story building, which blew out windows and covered the street below in debris.

A local newspaper, Sobh-e Sahel, aired footage of one of its correspondents speaking in front of the building. The footage included a sequence that showed a man in black boots and a green security force uniform being carried out on a stretcher. He wore a neck brace and appeared to be in pain, his left hand covering the branch insignia on his uniform.

The local newspaper did not acknowledge the security force member being carried out elsewhere in its reporting. Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard itself did not discuss the blast, other than to deny that a Guard navy commander had been hurt in the explosion.

Another explosion blamed on a gas explosion Saturday in the southwestern city of Ahvaz killed five people, state media reported.

It comes as Iran remains tense over a threat by US President Donald Trump to potentially launch a military strike on the country over the killing of peaceful protesters or the possible mass execution of those detained in a major crackdown over the demonstrations.

Ali Larijani, a top security official in Iran, wrote on X late Saturday that “structural arrangements for negotiations are progressing.” However, there is no public sign of any talks with the United States, which Iran's 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has repeatedly ruled out.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 20:52:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3bed7d40-fecd-11f0-b8ac-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-31T135958Z-507358427-RC2ACJAE8D5D-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-CRISIS-USA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Qatari PM meets Iran's Larijani in Tehran, discusses easing regional tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/qatari-pm-meets-irans-larijani-tehran-discusses-easing-regional-tensions-2026-01-31/</link><description>Jan 31 (Reuters) - Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani met with top Iranian security official Ali Larijani in Tehran and reviewed efforts to de-escalate tensions in the region, Qatar's foreign ministry said on Saturday in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:22:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HC4U4YBF6BNLHCMGR4TJIOWWAQ.jpg?auth=210b258168ff277f19ad0a440e8a02c1c661421190c856e9d039e26361b3acba&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge orders release of 5-year-old, father detained in Minnesota ICE raid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-orders-release-5-year-old-father-detained-minnesota-ice-raid-2026-01-31/</link><description>DETROIT, Jan 31 (Reuters) - A federal judge has ordered the release of Adrian Conejo Arias and his five-year-old son, Liam Conejo Ramos, whom immigration officers detained during a Minnesota raid.

The boy — seen in a now viral photo that showed him wearing a blue bunny hat outside his house as federal agents stood nearby — was one of four students detained by immigration officials earlier this month in a Minneapolis suburb, according to the Columbia Heights Public School District.

"The case has its genesis in the ill-conceived and incompetently-implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children," U.S. District Judge Fred Biery wrote in a ruling published on Saturday.

"Ultimately, Petitioners may, because of the arcane United States immigration system, return to their home country, involuntarily or by self-deportation. But that result should occur through a more orderly and humane policy than currently in place."

The Ecuadorean boy and his father, who entered the United States legally as asylum applicants, were sent to a family detention facility in Dilley, Texas, their attorney Marc Prokosch previously told Reuters .

Prokosch and the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return requests for comment.

Armed and masked officers detained two 17-year-olds and a 10-year-old in addition to Liam, school district Superintendent Zena Stenvik said last week.</description><pubDate>Sat, 31 Jan 2026 21:45:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBIWWWBB6NJCDAUTZZGTNGJ7BQ.jpg?auth=ccefa05895a64c413db7db0a924836dcb1439a2a0175802c9fb8f4a801e3a819&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
