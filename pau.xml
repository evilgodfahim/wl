"After careful reflection, I have decided to resign from the government. The decision to appoint Peter Mandelson was wrong. He has damaged our party, our country and trust in politics itself," Morgan McSweeney, Downing Street's chief of staff, said in a statement.

"I advised the Prime Minister to make that appointment, and I take full responsibility for that advice," he added.

The resignation came as the foreign ministry said it was reviewing an exit payment to Mandelson, who was sacked by the Labour premier last September over his friendship with the late Epstein .

Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics and the Labour Party for decades, received an estimated payout of between £38,750 and £55,000 ($52,000 to $74,000) after only seven months in the job, according to a report in the Sunday Times.

Documents released on January 30 by the US Justice Department appear to show that Mandelson allegedly leaked confidential UK government information to financier Epstein when he was a British minister, including during the 2008 financial crisis .

The revelation has placed intense pressure on Starmer and triggered a police investigation into Mandelson, 72, for alleged misconduct in a public office.

The Foreign Office said in a statement it had launched a review into Mandelson's severance payment "in light of further information that has now been revealed and the ongoing police investigation".

Cabinet minister Pat McFadden earlier insisted Starmer should remain in office despite his "terrible mistake" in appointing Mandelson.

The close Starmer ally told broadcasters the party should stick with the prime minister.

"He (Starmer) should be realistic and accept that this has been a terrible story, that this appointment was a terrible mistake," McFadden, the Work and Pensions Secretary, told BBC television.

He said the real blame lay "squarely with Peter Mandelson", who put himself forward for the job despite knowing the extent of his relationship with Epstein.

Starmer's deputy, David Lammy, became the first cabinet minister to appear to distance himself from the premier, according to a report in the Sunday Telegraph.

The deputy prime minister had not been in favour of appointing Mandelson, a pivotal figure in British politics for decades, due to his known links to Epstein, the report quoted friends of Lammy as saying.

Starmer's Labour Party took power just over 18 months ago in a landslide election victory.

But it has been trailing Nigel Farage 's anti-immigrant Reform UK as the government has come under fire over immigration, economic growth and the cost of living crisis.

Reform UK has led by double-digit figures in the polls for the past year.

Mandelson, also a former European Union trade commissioner, stood down from parliament's unelected upper chamber, the House of Lords, earlier this week.

The ex-envoy was one of numerous prominent figures further embarrassed by last week's latest revelations of ties to financier Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 while facing charges of alleged sex trafficking.

US officials ruled Epstein's death a suicide.

A spokesperson for law firm Mishcon de Reya, representing Mandelson, said he "regrets, and will regret until his dying day, that he believed Epstein's lies about his criminality".

"Lord Mandelson did not discover the truth about Epstein until after his death in 2019. He is profoundly sorry that powerless and vulnerable women and girls were not given the protection they deserved," the law firm said.

Starmer paid tribute to McSweeney in a statement. It was "largely thanks to his dedication, loyalty and leadership that we won a landslide majority" in the 2024 election, he said.

"Our party and I owe him a debt of gratitude, and I thank him for his service," he added.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 16:31:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4796794e-0503-11f1-aeaa-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26036440795144.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand PM Anutin’s party leads snap election, rejects coalition bid</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260208-thailand-pm-anutin-s-party-leads-snap-election-rejects-coalition-bid</link><description>Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul 's party was far ahead in Sunday's general election , leading a three-way race with a commanding margin that could make it easier to form a coalition and reduce the ​risk of further political instability.

Anutin set the stage for the snap election in mid-December during a border conflict between ‍Thailand and Cambodia, a move political analysts said appeared to be timed by the conservative leader to cash in on surging nationalism.

At that point, he had been in power ​for less than 100 days, taking over after the ouster of Premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the populist Pheu ​Thai Party over the Cambodian crisis.

With nearly 80% of polling stations reporting, preliminary results released by the election commission showed Anutin's Bhumjaithai Party with a sizeable lead over the progressive People's Party in second place, followed by the Pheu Thai Party.

People's Party leader Natthaphong Rueangpanyawut said that while votes remained to be counted, his party did not look likely to win.

Natthaphong said the party would not join a Bhumjaithai-led government but would also not form a competing coalition. "If Bhumjaithai can form a government, then we have to be the opposition," Natthaphong told ‍a press conference.

With a message of structural change and reforms to Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, the People's Party had led most opinion polls during the campaign season.

But in a ​survey conducted during the campaign's final week and released on Sunday, the National Institute for Development

Administration projected that Bhumjaithai would be the winner with between 140 and 150 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, ahead of 125-135 for the People's ‌Party.

"We have done everything that we can," Anutin told reporters after casting his vote in Bhumjaithai's stronghold of Buriram city, northeast of the capital, Bangkok. "We hope the people will have confidence in us."

Thai voters ‍were also asked during the vote to decide if a new constitution should replace a 2017 charter, a military-backed document that critics say concentrated power in undemocratic institutions, including a powerful senate that is chosen through an indirect selection process with limited public participation.

The election commission's early count showed voters backing the referendum by a margin of nearly two to one. Thailand has had 20 constitutions since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, with most of the changes following military coups.

If voters back the drafting of a new national charter, the new government and lawmakers can ‍start the amendment process in parliament with two more referendums required to adopt a new constitution.

"I believe that the party that wins in the next election will ‌have an outsized influence ​on the direction of constitutional reform, whether we move away from the junta-drafted constitution or not," said Napon Jatusripitak of the Bangkok-based Thailand Future think tank.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 17:26:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/632ebbbe-0510-11f1-93bc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26039569318072.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Betting on catastrophe: the dizzying rise of prediction markets</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260208-betting-catastrophe-dizzying-rise-prediction-markets</link><description>Only a handful of people in the world knew what was going to happen in the early hours of January 3, before ‘Operation Absolute Resolve’ was launched. The extraordinary two-hour-and-twenty-minute military intervention by air, land and sea culminated in the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife. It was a top-secret operation, which stunned the world.

But a hint of what was to occur emerged in the online, crypto-based prediction market portal Polymarket, where anonymous users bet on real world events. User 0x31a56e wagered $32,537 that Maduro would be out of power by the end of January when the odds of that happening on the afternoon of January 2 were placed at just 6.5% . By midnight, those odds jumped to 11% and surged just before the operation was executed. The suspiciously timed bet paid off – anonymous user 0x31a56e made a neat profit upwards of $436,000 in just one night . The account has since vanished .

This odd incident pushed the online prediction market – which was growing but still fairly niche – into the mainstream spotlight. These are platforms where people can bet on the outcome of an enormous variety of future events – from the common (who will win the Super Bowl) to the bizarre (will Jesus be resurrected in 2026). These companies insist that they are not gambling portals, but legitimate financial markets, a chimera of a stock exchange and a crypto platform (though some watchdogs disagree ).

Two players, Kalshi and Polymarket, have dominated the space in recent years. Of a total volume of $44 billion in prediction markets in 2025, Kalshi and Polymarket were responsible for a combined total of $38 billion: one of the fastest growing financial markets is one that most people ignore, or don’t know about.

Trades on these websites are not to be confused with polls, insists Polymarket’s precocious founder Shayne Coplan, in an interview with 60 Minutes . Coplan, who founded the company in 2020 when he was just 21 years old, said that Polymarket tries to predict actual outcomes – "You make money if you're right. You lose money if you're wrong. And as a result it creates this information that's useful for people."

Some people have profited from making informed wagers – including a prolific, successful Polymarket trader who goes by the name Domer and features in the same 60 Minutes report. The former professional poker player moved to Polymarket because it was ‘more exciting’. He won over $100,000 predicting an American Pope , and even more after he picked JD Vance to be Donald Trump 's presidential running mate. Domer went against the odds because he believed US President Donald Trump likes one syllable names because “he (Trump) is very into marketing”.

Even established media outlets like CNN and CNBC have struck deals to incorporate Kalshi prediction markets into coverage.

But prediction markets do not come without an enormous share of criticism. Polymarket, specifically, has been at the root of controversy because it relies on cryptocurrency and blockchain to run.

Users like 0x31a56e, who predicted Maduro’s capture, can trade anonymously, without being traced. While it is possible that they just got very lucky, analysts say it’s far more likely that someone with inside information realised they could make a quick buck. On crypto-native platforms, there’s no real way of knowing.

It’s because of this reason that in most of Europe, where a patchwork of rules must be adhered to, Polymarket is not legal or easily accessible . Some countries treat prediction markets as gambling, and the ones that do not still require licensing. Regulators are wary, with good reason.

Prediction markets were also heavily regulated under the Biden administration, but under President Trump, these sites have profited from deregulation and a huge boom in power.

But critics are concerned about the platforms commodifying real world events and encouraging people to bet on political, military and diplomatic events that have real-world consequences.

Maduro is only one example of a litany of shady trades made on prediction markets. Hours before the announcement of Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, one user bet thousands in her favour: the likelihood of her winning leapt from 3.75 percent to nearly 73 percent within two hours – prompting authorities in Norway to open an investigation.

Similarly, in early January, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt ended her briefing after 64 minutes and 30 seconds. Her abrupt exit left traders wondering whether Leavitt had deliberately stopped before the 65-minute mark to turn a profit. Polymarket had predicted at 98 percent odds that the briefing would run past 65 minutes.

Alex Goldenberg, an intelligence analyst and fellow at the Miller Center on Policing and Community Resilience at Rutgers University, says the signs are clear: “Across these cases, a consistent pattern emerges: new accounts with no trading history taking high-conviction, low-probability positions hours before those events occur. These aren't gradual market movements reflecting evolving public information. They bear the textbook signatures of insider trading in traditional financial markets.”

The point of these markets is to reward people with superior information i.e., those who collect the right data and analyse accurately could stand to make money. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, he says, but there’s a fine line between analysis and inside information. “Scale that logic to domains governed by secrecy: military operations, covert action, diplomatic negotiations. In those domains, ‘superior information’ means access to classified or non-public knowledge. The platform architecture doesn't distinguish between a well-informed analyst and someone with a security clearance who just walked out of a briefing.”

Prediction markets’ blurry lines can also create serious problems for national security.

One account, originally named RicoSauve666 and later Rundeep, bet on several operations connected to Israeli military action with extremely consistent outcomes . Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet ) ultimately opened an investigation into the user.

“The high-conviction, low-probability trades we saw before the Venezuela operation and Israeli strikes bear the hallmarks of someone with access monetizing what they know,” says Goldenberg. “That's privatizing state secrets. Diplomats, military personnel, intelligence analysts, contractors, and anyone in the national security apparatus now has a potential avenue to monetize non-public, sensitive information for personal profit.”

Dangerous biases can occur when an outcome is presumed – Goldenberg presents a hypothesis: “Suppose the US is about to carry out an operation against Iran and multiple high-conviction, low-probability bets suddenly appear on a prediction market that it's going to happen tomorrow,” he posits. “You've potentially given an adversary advance notice of an operation through publicly visible market activity.

"An adversary placing large bets on specific military outcomes can create a situation where we ask ourselves, does someone know something? That alone sows confusion and distorts decision-making."

The predictions on these platforms are visible to anyone. Diplomatic, geopolitical and military decisions could potentially be made on assumed outcomes – which could be particularly dangerous if these markets can be manipulated.

“When a prediction market shows odds on a US strike suddenly jumping, that movement could become news. Media reports it, policymakers see it. The market doesn't just predict. It shapes perception.”

This is a far greater risk on crypto native platforms like Polymarket, where trades take place anonymously, often in offshore jurisdictions. They are extremely difficult to trace back to an individual.  “Who investigates? Which jurisdiction applies?” asks Goldenberg. “Today, the honest answer is that in many cases, they wouldn't be caught. Several countries, including France , have already concluded these platforms can't be adequately regulated and banned them outright.”

There’s also the important question of who runs the market themselves: the US president's son Donald Trump Jr. is an adviser to both Kalshi and Polymarket . His venture capital firm 1789 invested an undisclosed “double-digit millions of dollars” into Polymarket in 2025. Polymarket’s founder sees this as a positive – saying in an interview , “This admin is very pro-innovation, and pro-crypto, and pro-Polymarket, which is amazing… I'm a young entrepreneur. If I have people who believe in what I do, who understand how politics works and can help me… there's nothing wrong about that.”

Furthermore, Trump Media and Technology Group, the owner of the president’s social-media platform, Truth Social, has announced its own platform, Truth Predict .

There are real, human consequences of turning the world into one big casino where serious events with real repercussions are being reduced to a set of numbers. “When you're looking at a screen that says 'Will Country X invade Country Y by March 31? Yes/No', you're interacting with an abstraction. But the underlying event involves air strikes, casualties, displaced populations. The platform strips away human reality and replaces it with a contract and a price,” says Goldenberg.

“It fundamentally changes civic discourse. Instead of asking ‘should we strike’, which is a moral and strategic question, we're asking ‘what are the odds we strike’. We've taken events with real human consequences and made them feel like any other financial instrument. That normalization is worth paying attention to."</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 17:26:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d77159e-0389-11f1-a5b3-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25308629933285.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran sentences Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to six years in prison</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260208-iran-sentences-nobel-peace-prize-laureate-narges-mohammadi-to-six-years-in-prison</link><description>An Iranian court sentenced Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi to a six-year prison term, her lawyer told AFP on Sunday.

"She has been sentenced to six years in prison for gathering and collusion to commit crimes," lawyer Mostafa Nili said, adding that she had also received a two-year ban on leaving the country.

Mohammadi was also handed a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for propaganda activities and is to be exiled for two years to the city of Khosf in the eastern province of South Khorasan, the lawyer stated.

Under Iranian law, jail sentences run concurrently.

Nili expressed hope that due to Mohammadi's health issues, she could be temporarily "released on bail to receive treatment". Nili, who was able to speak briefly with his client for the very first time nearly two months after her arrest, "was not informed that this unfair trial was taking place," said her lawyer in France, Chirinne Ardakani.

He added that the verdict issued was not final and could be appealed.

Over the past quarter-century, Mohammadi, 53, has been repeatedly tried and jailed for her vocal campaigning against Iran 's use of capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women.

Mohammadi has spent much of the past decade behind bars and has not seen her twin children, who live in Paris, since 2015.

In December 2024, she was released on medical grounds, initially for three weeks, due to "her physical condition after the removal of a tumour and a bone graft", according to her lawyer.

However, she ultimately spent much of last year outside of custody, continuing to make statements in spite of her lawyers' fears she could be sent back to prison any time.

On December 12, Mohammadi was arrested in the northeastern city of Mashhad with other activists after speaking at a ceremony honouring a lawyer who had been found dead.

Even behind bars, the Nobel laureate has not been silent, staging protests in the prison yard and going on hunger strikes.

Born in the northwestern city of Zanjan in 1972, Mohammadi studied physics and pursued a career in engineering alongside work as a journalist for several reformist media outlets.

In the 2000s, she joined the Defenders of Human Rights Center set up by 2003 Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi, an organisation of which Mohammadi remains vice president.

She was jailed from May 2015 to October 2020 for "forming and leading an illegal group", campaigning for the abolition of the death penalty in Iran.

Mohammadi won the peace prize in 2023, primarily for her advocacy against capital punishment. Her children collected the award on her behalf, as she was in prison at the time.

Human rights groups, including Amnesty International , say Iran carries out more executions each year than any other country except China , for which no reliable figures are available.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 20:28:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dd5d463e-dc35-11f0-9898-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/narges-3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Centre-left candidate António José Seguro leads far-right rival in Portugal presidential race</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260208-centre-left-candidate-ant%C3%B3nio-jos%C3%A9-seguro-leads-far-right-rival-in-portugal-presidential-race</link><description>Centre-left Socialist candidate António José Seguro recorded a thumping victory over hard-right populist André Ventura in Portugal’s runoff presidential election Sunday, exit polls indicated.

Polls by the country’s three main broadcasters suggested the moderate Seguro won a five-year term in Lisbon’s riverside “pink palace” with around 70% of the votes, compared with about 30% for Ventura. Most official results were expected by 11 p.m.

The ballot was an opportunity to test the depth of support for Ventura’s brash style, which has struck a chord with voters and helped make his Chega (Enough) party the second-biggest in the Portuguese parliament, as well as gauge the public appetite for Europe’s increasing shift to the right in recent years.

Seguro, a longstanding Socialist politician, positioned himself as a moderate candidate who will cooperate with Portugal’s centre-right minority government, repudiating Ventura’s anti-establishment and anti-immigrant tirades.

He won the backing of other mainstream politicians on the left and right who want to halt the rising populist tide.

In Portugal , the president is largely a figurehead with no executive power. Traditionally, the head of state stands above the political fray, mediating disputes and defusing tensions.

However, the president is an influential voice and possesses some powerful tools, being able to veto legislation from parliament, although the veto can be overturned. The head of state also possesses what in Portuguese political jargon is called an “atomic bomb,” the power to dissolve parliament and call early elections .

In May, Portugal held its third general election in three years in the country's worst bout of political instability for decades, and steadying the ship is a key challenge for the next president.

Ventura, an eloquent and theatrical politician, has rejected political accommodation in favour of a more combative stance.

Making it through to the runoff was already a milestone for Ventura and his party, which have recalibrated Portuguese politics.

One of Ventura's main targets has been what he calls excessive immigration, as foreign workers have become more conspicuous in Portugal in recent years.

“Portugal is ours,” he said.

During the campaign, Ventura put up billboards across the country saying, “This isn’t Bangladesh” and “Immigrants shouldn’t be allowed to live on welfare.”

Although he founded his party less than seven years ago, its surge in public support made it the second-largest party in Portugal’s parliament in the May 18 general election.

In March, the winner will replace centre-right President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, who has served the constitutional limit of two five-year terms.</description><pubDate>Sun, 08 Feb 2026 20:54:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/08352b80-052e-11f1-a996-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-06T224605Z-790890318-RC2LGJAK03E3-RTRMADP-3-PORTUGAL-ELECTION-PRESIDENT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Flash floods sweep northern Morocco, killing at least four including toddler</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260208-flash-floods-sweep-northern-morocco-killing-at-least-four-including-toddler</link><description>Four people including a two-year-old child died after being swept away by floods in northern Morocco , authorities said on Sunday, adding that a fifth person was missing.

The four dead were in a car in Tetouan when the vehicle was caught in "sudden flooding" on a road near a major river, officials said in a statement.

Anticipation was high for the 31-year-old's set, amid rampant speculation about whether he would use his platform to renew his criticism of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in front of tens of millions of viewers.

But the wildly popular musician, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, instead made good on his pre-game promise to joyously share his culture – and largely avoided overt political statements in favor of subtle messaging through symbols.

In a set featuring a sugar cane plantation, a traditional "piragua" cart selling treats, and even a wedding, he opened with "Titi Me Pregunto" and feminist anthem "Yo Perreo Sola," with a cast of dancers fueling the party atmosphere.

Actors Pedro Pascal and Jessica Alba, and rapper Cardi B were among the guest stars vibing in his familiar "La Casita" backdrop, representing a home in Puerto Rico .

Bad Bunny wore an all-white ensemble, with a football jersey featuring the number "64" and "Ocasio," before donning a classy suit jacket.

He delved into more political territory with "El Apagon" (Blackout), which touches on the displacement of Puerto Ricans on their own island, and the constant problems caused by the unreliable power grid. He carried a Puerto Rican flag at one point.

The performance also included a young boy watching the Grammys on an old television set. Bad Bunny, who won the Album of the Year prize a week ago, presented the child – perhaps a younger version of himself – with a golden gramophone.

The internet went wild with unverified rumors that the child was Liam Conejo Ramos, a five-year-old Ecuadoran boy recently detained by US immigration agents in Minnesota.

An NFL spokesman confirmed to AFP that the boy was an actor, and an Instagram post seemingly from the child in question, Lincoln Fox, was hashtagged #youngbadbunny.

Surprise musical guests included Lady Gaga, who sang a Latin-inflected version of her hit "Die with a Smile" – the only English lyrics in the show – and Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin.

At the Grammys, Bad Bunny made a searing statement about Trump's sweeping immigration crackdown, earning cheers for saying "ICE out" from the stage.

But on Sunday, he did not call out the Republican president.

At the end of the set, after listing Latin American countries, Puerto Rico, the United States and Canada, Bad Bunny spiked a football that said "Together, we are America."

A giant screen in the stadium read: "The only thing more powerful than hate is love."

Trump nevertheless quickly took issue with the performance, saying: "Nobody understands a word this guy is saying" – even though government data shows more than 41 million Americans speak Spanish.

Posting on his Truth Social account, he called the show "an affront to the Greatness of America."

Bad Bunny has been Spotify's most-streamed artist in the world four separate times, including last year, and won Album of the Year at the Grammys with "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos" – the first Spanish-language work to win music's highest accolade.

But the decision to showcase his work at the Super Bowl in California was met with conservative outrage – specifically about the idea that he would not sing in English.

The NFL entered into an agreement in 2019 with Jay-Z's entertainment company Roc Nation, which leads the league's entertainment strategy.

Since that time, the list of Super Bowl headliners included Jennifer Lopez and Shakira (with a guest spot for Bad Bunny), but the duo did not perform exclusively in Spanish, leaving Bad Bunny to set that benchmark.

Bad Bunny grew up in Vega Baja, a small municipality near Puerto Rico's capital San Juan.

He was working at a supermarket bagging groceries when he got a call from a label over his viral plays on the DIY platform SoundCloud.

Thus began the reggaeton star's rapid explosion to the top of global music.

Late last year, Bad Bunny released "Debi Tirar Mas Fotos," a history lesson in Puerto Rican music that he promoted with a hometown concert residency in San Juan and a world tour.

In Puerto Rico, a US territory since 1898, there was nothing but pride for the island's native son.

"For someone from here to be at one of the most important events in the United States is a source of pride for every Puerto Rican," Olvin Reyes, 39, told AFP.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:07:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75e93c28-055d-11f1-bfbc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/76a4a2dfd576befa1c969cbfe1f39e8037472874.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong sentences pro-democracy mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in jail</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260208-hong-kong-sentences-pro-democracy-mogul-jimmy-lai-to-20-years-in-jail</link><description>A Hong Kong court sentenced pro-democracy media mogul Jimmy Lai to 20 years in prison on Monday for national security crimes, a punishment rights groups condemned as "effectively a death sentence" and a symbol of the city's shrivelling press freedoms.

The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper was found guilty in December on two counts of foreign collusion under a sweeping national security law imposed by Beijing , as well as one count of seditious publication.

His sentence is by far the harshest handed out under the national security law, surpassing the previous record of 10 years given to legal scholar Benny Tai in 2024.

A summary document from the judges said they had settled on 20 years' imprisonment "after considering the serious and grave criminal conduct of Lai".

Two of those years will overlap with Lai's existing prison term, meaning that he will serve an additional 18 years, the judges wrote.

Lai, who has been behind bars since 2020, sat impassively in the dock as his sentence was read out, an AFP journalist in the court saw.

As he was led away, he waved solemnly to people in the public gallery, including his wife Teresa, former Hong Kong bishop Cardinal Joseph Zen, and former Apple Daily reporters.

His defence lawyer Robert Pang declined to comment on whether Lai would lodge an appeal, which can be done in the next 28 days.

Asked if the sentence was in line with expectations, Pang told AFP: "In these times I don't know what to expect."

Teresa Lai was grim-faced during the hearing and made no comment as she left the court, but their children, who live abroad, condemned the sentence in a statement.

"Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father," Lai's son Sebastien said.

His daughter Claire called it "a heartbreakingly cruel sentence" given his declining health in prison, and if carried out, "he will die a martyr behind bars".

Rights groups also said Lai's punishment amounted to a grave injustice.

"The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust," Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement.

Amnesty International called the case "another grim milestone in Hong Kong's transformation from a city governed by the rule of law to one ruled by fear".

Jodie Ginsberg, the CEO of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said "today's egregious decision is the final nail in the coffin for freedom of the press in Hong Kong".

Britain's Keir Starmer previously said he had raised the issue of Lai, a British citizen, during his meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing last month, while US President Donald Trump has also called for his release.

Taiwan said Lai's sentencing created a "chilling effect" across borders and "tramples on freedom of speech".

Under the national security law, the self-ruled island's Mainland Affairs Council added, Hong Kong's judiciary "has been reduced to a tool for political suppression and the purging of dissent".

Beijing has dismissed critics as smearing Hong Kong's judicial system, while Hong Kong authorities say Lai's case "has nothing to do with freedom of speech and of the press".

National security police welcomed the 20-year sentence, telling reporters it indicated the "very serious nature" of Lai's case and was "well-deserved".

Dozens of former Apple Daily employees and others braved the cold to queue overnight outside the West Kowloon court for a spot in court, while journalists gathered outside the building's entrance.

The mood was tense as police deployed dozens of officers, an armoured car and a bomb disposal van to the area.

"I think this is equivalent to sentencing Lai to life imprisonment," Lam Ying-kit, a former history teacher in his 50s, told AFP.

Lai's supporters, children, lawyers and rights groups have all raised concerns about his deteriorating health in prison.

Lai was kept in solitary confinement at his own request to avoid harassment, according to prosecutors, while authorities maintain he receives "adequate" care.

Long a thorn in Beijing's side, Lai was prosecuted under the national security law imposed by China on Hong Kong in 2020, following huge pro-democracy protests.

Apple Daily was forced to close in 2021 following police raids.

Eight other defendants, including six Apple Daily executives, are due to be sentenced alongside Lai on Monday, all of whom pleaded guilty.

As of the start of the month, Hong Kong had arrested a total of 386 people for various national security crimes, with 176 of them being convicted.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 06:07:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9a38bc14-3c38-11eb-b27b-005056bf18d4/w:1280/p:16x9/d4101a6e66cc19a370ccddd5cfc17bf9aeb6d9ad.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia pummels Ukraine's Odesa and Kharkiv with deadly drone strikes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260209-live-russia-pummels-ukraine-odesa-kharkiv-deadly-drone-strikes</link><description>Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) has accused the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) of ordering the attempted assassination of General Vladimir Alexeyev in Moscow last week, the Interfax news agency reports.

The FSB said that Polish intelligence had been involved in the recruitment of the shooter, without offering any evidence.

A Ukrainian-born Russian citizen has been extradited to Moscow from Dubai on suspicion of gravely injuring Alexeyev, Russian security officials said on Sunday.

In the northeastern Kharkiv region, state emergency services said they recovered the bodies of a woman and a 10-year-old boy after a Russian drone attack.

"Three more people were wounded," the services added in a post on Telegram.

Farther south in Odesa, local officials said drone attacks killed a 35-year-old man and injured two others.

Overnight Russian strikes on Odesa and Kharkiv killed at least three people, Ukrainian officials said early Monday.

The attacks come days after Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky said US President Donald Trump had given the warring sides until June to find a deal on ending the conflict triggered by Russia's invasion in 2022.

Russia has continued bombarding its neighbour while engaging in US-backed talks to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 07:37:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/effae2e2-0174-11f1-bb9b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/fe9666f074442cca1fe4f224658cc4640f81462a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela opposition leader Machado says ally kidnapped after release from prison</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260208-venezuela-opposition-leader-machado-says-ally-kidnapped-after-release-from-prison</link><description>Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado said on Monday that armed men have kidnapped one of her close allies shortly after his release by authorities following the capture of the country's ousted leader Nicolas Maduro .

Her claim about the former National Assembly vice president Juan Pablo Guanipa's kidnap came after his release from prison on Sunday along with two other opposition figures.

The alleged incident comes as lawmakers prepare to vote Tuesday on a historic amnesty law covering charges used to lock up dissidents during almost three decades of socialist rule.

"A few minutes ago, Juan Pablo Guanipa was kidnapped in the Los Chorros neighborhood of Caracas. Heavily armed men dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force," she posted on social media platform X shortly after midnight on Monday.

"We demand his immediate release."

Guanipa had appeared earlier on Sunday in a video posted on his X account, showing what looked like his release papers.

"Here we are, being released," Guanipa said in the video, adding that he had spent "10 months in hiding, almost nine months detained here" in Caracas.

Speaking to AFP later on Sunday, he had called on the government to respect the 2024 presidential election, which opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia was widely considered to have won. Maduro claimed victory and remained in power till January.

"Let's respect it. That's the basic thing, that's the logical thing. Oh, you don't want to respect it? Then let's go to an electoral process," Guanipa said.

The opposition ally of Machado was arrested in May 2025, in connection with an alleged conspiracy to undermine legislative and regional elections that were boycotted by the opposition.

He was charged with terrorism, money laundering and incitement to violence and hatred.

Guanipa had been in hiding prior to his arrest. He was last seen in public in January 2025, when he accompanied Machado to an anti-Maduro rally.

Following Maduro's capture by US special forces on January 3, authorities have started to slowly release political prisoners. Rights groups estimate that around 700 people are still waiting to be freed.

A former Machado legal advisor, Perkins Rocha, was also freed on Sunday. So was Freddy Superlano, who once won a gubernatorial election in Barinas, a city that is the home turf of the iconic late socialist leader Hugo Chavez.

"We hugged at home," Rocha's wife Maria Constanza Cipriani wrote on X, with a photo of them.

Machado, who was awarded the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for her efforts to advance democracy in Venezuela, had initially celebrated Guanipa's release.

"My dear Juan Pablo, counting down the minutes until I can hug you! You are a hero, and history will ALWAYS recognize it. Freedom for ALL political prisoners!!" she wrote on X on Sunday.

NGO Foro Penal said it had confirmed the release of 35 prisoners on Sunday. It said that since January 8 nearly 400 people arrested for political reasons have been freed thus far.

Lawmakers gave their initial backing to a draft amnesty last week which covered the types of crimes used to lock up dissidents during 27 years of socialist rule.

But Venezuela's largest opposition coalition denounced "serious omissions" in the proposed amnesty measures on Friday.

Meanwhile, relatives of prisoners are growing increasingly impatient for their loved ones to be freed.

Acting President Delcy Rodriguez , who was Maduro's vice president, is pushing the amnesty bill as a milestone on the path to reconciliation.

Rodriguez took power in Venezuela with the blessing of US President Donald Trump , who is eyeing American access to what are the world's largest proven oil reserves.

As part of its reforms, Rodriguez's government has taken steps towards opening up the oil industry and restoring diplomatic ties with Washington, which were severed by Maduro in 2019.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 07:38:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/52c6e31a-0523-11f1-8498-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/96ff5642646aac44834fbdff55d984164331f2a1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Curtain falls on Hong Kong press freedom': Jimmy Lai prison sentence sparks outcry</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260209-curtain-falls-on-hong-kong-press-freedom-jimmy-lai-prison-sentence-sparks-outcry</link><description>Hong Kong pro-democracy media tycoon Jimmy Lai was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison for foreign collusion and sedition, the harshest penalty yet under a Beijing-imposed national security law .

The 78-year-old founder of the now-defunct Apple Daily newspaper has been behind bars since 2020.

Here are some key reactions:

Jimmy Lai's son Sebastien said in a statement: "Sentencing my father to this draconian prison sentence is devastating for our family and life-threatening for my father."

His daughter Claire added: "This is a heartbreakingly cruel sentence. Over the last five years, I have watched my father's health deteriorate dramatically and the conditions he's kept in go from bad to worse. If this sentence is carried out, he will die a martyr behind bars."

Hong Kong leader John Lee said Lai's crimes were "heinous and evil in the extreme".

"(Lai's) heavy sentence of 20 years' imprisonment demonstrates the rule of law, upholds justice and is deeply gratifying," Lee said in a statement.

Lin Jian, spokesperson of China's foreign ministry, said Lai was a Chinese citizen and was "a key planner and participant in a series of anti-China and disruptive activities in Hong Kong".

"This is reasonable, legitimate, and legal; there is no room for argument," Lin said at a press briefing.

Britain's Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper said Lai's penalty was "tantamount to a life sentence" and reiterated calls for the tycoon's release on humanitarian grounds.

"Following today's sentencing we will rapidly engage further on Mr Lai's case. We stand with the people of Hong Kong," Cooper added.

The European Union said it "deplores" Lai's sentencing and called for his "immediate and unconditional release".

"The EU calls on the Hong Kong authorities to restore confidence in press freedom in Hong Kong... and to stop prosecuting journalists," EU foreign affairs spokesperson Anitta Hipper said.

Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong urged China to "cease suppression of freedoms" and repeal Hong Kong's national security law.

"The Australian Government is gravely concerned by the sentences handed down to Jimmy Lai and his co-defendants in Hong Kong today.

"We continue to call on China to ​cease suppression of freedoms of expression, assembly, media and civil society, consistent with UN Human Rights Committee recommendations, and to call for the repeal of ​the national security law in Hong Kong."

Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that China and Hong Kong "have brought media influence and international connections within the scope of national security measures, aiming to create a chilling effect across sectors and borders".

Thibaut Bruttin, director general of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), said Lai's case was "nothing more than a sham".

"Today, the curtain falls on press freedom in Hong Kong. We are outraged by the harsh sentences handed down to Jimmy Lai," Bruttin said in a statement.

"Democracies, such as the UK and the US, must stop prioritising the normalisation of relations with China and instead exert pressure on the Chinese regime and Hong Kong authorities to ensure that Jimmy Lai and all other journalists are released from prison," he added.

Lai's 20-year jail term is tantamount to a death sentence, said Elaine Pearson, Asia Director at Human Rights Watch (HRW).

"The harsh 20-year sentence against 78-year-old Jimmy Lai is effectively a death sentence. A sentence of this magnitude is both cruel and profoundly unjust.

"Lai’s years of persecution show the Chinese government’s determination to crush independent journalism and silence anyone who dares to criticise the Communist Party."

Simon Young, a law professor at the University of Hong Kong, said the parts of Lai's sentencing related to foreign collusion "appear to be on the high side".

"I think the Court is wrong to say that (pre-national security law) conduct can be considered in assessing the gravity of the offences," Young told AFP.

Lai's legal team should consider an appeal of sentence, he added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 10:03:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/85b683b0-0597-11f1-9e57-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25349696240875.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ghislaine Maxwell to testify before US Congress in Epstein investigation</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260209-ghislaine-maxwell-testify-before-us-congress-in-epstein-investigation</link><description>Jeffrey Epstein 's accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell will be questioned behind closed doors by the US Congress on Monday, though she's expected to invoke her right to not answer questions.

Maxwell, currently serving 20 years in prison for trafficking girls to the disgraced financier Epstein, will face questions from prison via video-link, in a deposition by the House of Representatives' Oversight Committee.

Though no new US prosecutions are expected after the latest dump of government files on Epstein, numerous political and business leaders have fallen into scandal or resigned as their ties to the convicted sex criminal were revealed.

The Republican-led House Oversight Committee is probing Epstein's connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.

Maxwell, however, is expected to invoke her right to not incriminate herself, guaranteed in the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution.

Epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting a minor. His extensive ties to the world's rich and powerful, especially after he was released in 2009, have become politically explosive across the globe.

He died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children in what was ruled a suicide.

Maxwell's lawyers have pushed for Congress to grant her legal immunity in order to testify in the deposition, but lawmakers refused.

Without that, her legal team said she would invoke her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

"Proceeding under these circumstances would serve no other purpose than pure political theater," her lawyers said in a letter.

Though the deposition will occur behind closed doors, Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat, published a letter of the questions he intended to ask Maxwell even if she refuses to answer.

Some touch on Trump's ties to Epstein and Maxwell.

Others focus on four "co-conspirators" as well as 25 other men who allegedly "sexually abused minors at Epstein's island".

One of the questions asks: "Why do you believe they were not indicted?"

Another question claims that it is "well documented" that Maxwell, Epstein and US President Donald Trump had a "social relationship", citing several photographs of the trio together.

It further probes whether she or Epstein ever "arranged, facilitated or provided access to underage girls" to Trump.

Beyond the trafficking charges, Maxwell will also be asked if she had any knowledge of Epstein sharing "information" with "foreign governments or intelligence services" with Russia and Israel used as examples.

As Maxwell prepares for the closed-door discussion, scrutiny of the Trump administration's handling of her case has again come under fire.

Last year Maxwell was moved to a minimum-security prison in Texas after meeting twice with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, who previously served as US President Donald Trump's personal lawyer.

Trump himself was a longtime Epstein associate, but has not been called to testify by the Oversight Committee, which is led by members of his Republican Party.

Trump has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing related to Epstein's activities.

Also expected to be deposed by the committee are former president Bill Clinton and his wife, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton , both Democrats.

The Clintons have called for their depositions to be held publicly to prevent Republicans from politicizing their testimony.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 11:24:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0ec4af60-05a2-11f1-8d84-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26034758403175.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Super Bowl 2026: Cultural takeaways and what it says about the USA today</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260209-super-bowl-2026-cultural-takeaways-and-what-it-says-about-the-usa-today</link><description>Super Bowl , the USA’s biggest annual sporting event, kicked off to a boring start, with NFL fans moaning about a defensive struggle between the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots, which saw not a single touchdown in the first half of the game.

But if there was little excitement in the game, there were plenty outside the playing field. America’s most-watched television event is not just about sports, it’s about culture , and the 2026 Super Bowl once again captured the country’s zeitgeist.

Here are some of the non-sporting highlights of the world superpower’s one-night ode to competition, capitalism and entertainment.

The top Super Bowl cultural moment is never a rabbit-out-of-a-hat act, and this year, it was a pre-announced big bunny.

Puerto Rican superstar Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, aka “Bad Bunny”, took the stage at the Levi’s Stadium on Sunday exactly a week after he delivered his searing Grammy-winning speech blasting ICE and the Trump administration’s immigration policies.

But at the Super Bowl, the 31-year-old superstar opted for far more subtle messaging. Instead of calling out the Republican president’s xenophobia, Bad Bunny delivered a triumphant celebration of diversity, love and above all, a tribute to his self-governed Caribbean home that is part of US “commonwealth” territory.

Politics of subtility was on full display as Bad Bunny belted out "El Apagon" (Blackout), a song that underscored the hypocrisy of the term “commonwealth” since Puerto Ricans still face Third World problems of an unreliable energy grid – which powers their displacement to the mainland.

On Sunday, Bad Bunny’s surprise star guests included Lady Gaga, whose Latin-inflected version of her hit "Die with a Smile" featured the only English lyrics in the show.

The historic all-Spanish act earned President Donald Trump’s ire. "Nobody understands a word this guy is saying," said Trump on his Truth Social account, putting himself at odds with more than 41 million Americans who speak Spanish. The show, he noted, was “an affront to the Greatness of America".

California punk-pop vets Green Day took the pre-game stage this year to render a tribute to the Super Bowl's 60th edition.

Green Day lead singer and guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong has been around since the 1980s and is not one to mince his political words. The expectations were high, particularly since Armstrong, at a San Francisco event just days before the Super Bowl, called on ICE agents to “quit their shitty jobs”.

But on Sunday, Green Day opted to omit their political hard-hitters – much to the delight of Fox News . “Trump critics take issue with Green Day's Super Bowl LX performance,” read a Fox headline above an explanatory, “Trump critics wanted Green Day to criticize the president on the Super Bowl stage".

When the group launched into “Holiday”, Trump opponents were on alert for the group’s most political bridge, which begins with the line “Sieg Heil to the President Gasman”, a dig at former President George W. Bush , who was president when the song was released in 2004.

But on Sunday, the band just skipped the controversial bridge and wrapped up the song.

“Disappointing show,” said one fan on X . “Pretty cowardly if you ask me. I expected real protest from them.”

For those outside the US awaiting a mass national mobilisation against Trump – and watching the rollover of much of corporate America instead – it was a fitting statement of the current times in the land of the free.

The second Sunday of February draws millions of Americans to their TV sets to watch the ads, an important part of the Super Bowl cultural package. In 2025, a record 127.7 million US viewers watched the game across television and streaming platforms, which means advertisers are willing to cough up millions for a Super Bowl spot.

This year's Super Bowl ads cost an average of $8 million per 30-second unit, but a handful of spots sold for a record $10 million-plus, Peter Lazarus, who leads advertising and partnerships for NBC Sports, told AP.

Super Bowl ads generate headlines, data, expert commentary as well as debates about what they say about consumers and markets today.

The business pundits were in agreement even before kick-off on Sunday: Artificial Intelligence (AI) would dominate this year’s Super Bowl.

They were not wrong.

Super Bowl 2026 sparked an AI advertising war when Anthropic aired a pair of commercials pointing out that Claude, its chatbot, doesn't have ads.

Humour and wit are important components of American ads and the Anthropic commercial ticked all the boxes in its 30-second spot. The ad features a nerdy young man struggling with pull-ups while a muscular bystander watches. The sweating young man asks the brawny man about achieving “six-pack abs”. But the bystander instead delivers a plug for a product – delivered in soulless, robotic style and content.

The skinny man looks disappointed with the reply before the kicker line fills the screen: “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude”.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, the whiz behind ChatGPT , hit back at his competitor. In a long post on X, Altman said Anthropic was "clearly dishonest" and employed “doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads”.

Altman’s objections, alas, were not well received, with commentators on X noting that the Anthropic boss didn’t like the taste of his “ own medicine ” and that his reaction was “the digital equivalent of a toddler throwing a tantrum ".

Amazon this year struck a nerve with an ad starring actor Chris Hemsworth that pokes fun of people's fears of AI.  The ad ticked all the Super Bowl boxes, including a celebrity poking fun at technological anxiety.

But it didn’t go down well since it came days after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos fired journalists at the Washington Post, which he also owns, in addition to laying off 16,000 corporate workers, some of whom may be replaced with AI.

“I suspect this is meant to be funny,” Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing at Northwestern University, told AP. “But it might reinforce some people’s very real concerns about AI.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 13:53:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20c13178-0559-11f1-ad47-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-09T013651Z-1535292428-MT1USATODAY28190507-RTRMADP-3-NFL-SUPER-BOWL-LX-SEATTLE-SEAHAWKS-AT-NEW-ENGLAND-PATRIOTS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan's Takaichi vows 'major policy shift' after resounding election victory</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260209-japan-s-takaichi-vows-major-policy-shift-after-resounding-election-victory</link><description>Japanese premier Sanae Takaichi said Monday that the public saw an "urgent need" for major reform after a historic election landslide , pledging to boost the country's defences in order to protect its territory.

Sunday's snap vote saw Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) win a two-thirds majority in the lower house for the first time in its history, capitalising on her strong popularity since taking office in October.

The outcome allows Japan 's first woman prime minister to stamp her mark on the country of 123 million people over the next four years, having pledged to boost the economy and get tough on immigration.

"This is the start of a heavy, heavy responsibility to make Japan stronger, more prosperous," Takaichi, 64, told a news conference on Monday.

"We believe that the public has shown understanding and sympathy regarding our appeals concerning the urgent need for a major policy shift," she said.

The admirer of "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher also said she would bolster Japan's defences, including through creating a new intelligence bureau and revising key security policy documents.

"No one will come to the aid of a nation that lacks the resolve to defend itself with its own hands," Takaichi said.

"We will steadfastly protect our nation's peace and independence, our territory, territorial waters, airspace, and the lives and safety of our citizens," she added.

Such comments are likely to go down badly in China – which has territorial disputes with Japan and others around the region – especially after Takaichi suggested in November that Japan could intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.

China, which regards the democratic island as part of its territory and has not ruled out force to annex it, was furious.

On Monday, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry again urged Japan to retract the comments.

Beijing warned Tokyo that "reckless" actions would be met with a "resolute response from the international community".

"Our nation is open to various dialogues with China. We already have exchanges of views. We will continue the exchanges of views. But we will deal with them in calm and appropriate ways," Takaichi said.

Capitalising on her honeymoon start after becoming Japan's fifth premier in as many years in October, Takaichi called the snap election last month.

The gamble paid off, with the LDP winning around 316 of the 465 seats contested, according to Japanese media.

That takes the party past the 310-seat threshold needed for a two-thirds majority for the first time in its history and may prompt the government to try and make changes to the country's constitution.

US President Donald Trump – who is due to host Takaichi in Washington next month – congratulated her after an earlier endorsement.

"I wish you Great Success in passing your Conservative, Peace Through Strength Agenda," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

Takaichi said that the talks on March 19 will "reaffirm the unshakeable unity between Japan and the United States".

A heavy metal drummer in her youth, Takaichi was on the ultra-conservative fringe of the LDP when she became party chief.

Despite being her country's first woman premier, Takaichi has shown little appetite for framing her leadership around gender in male-dominated Japanese politics.

She has been a hit with voters, especially young ones, with fans lapping up everything from her handbag to her jamming to a K-pop song with South Korea 's president.

But she will have to deliver on the economy to remain popular.

"With prices rising like this, what matters most to me is what policies they'll adopt to deal with inflation," voter Chika Sakamoto, 50, told AFP on Sunday.

But helping households could make markets jittery about Japan's colossal debts, which are more than twice the size of the economy.

This was shown by yields on long-dated Japanese bonds hitting record highs during the election campaign after Takaichi floated suspending a food tax.

Tokyo's Nikkei index of stocks jumped more than five percent early Monday and closed 3.9 percent higher.

Takaichi reiterated on Sunday her mantra of having a "responsible" fiscal policy but added that she wanted "to build a strong and resilient economy."

"In reality, the policies of a Takaichi administration are unlikely to curb the inflation that voters expect her to address," said Tetsuo Kotani at the Japan Institute of International Affairs.

"An income tax hike linked to increased defence spending will also be unavoidable. If these policies lead to a triple decline in stocks, the yen, and government bonds, people's lives will become even more difficult," Kotani told AFP.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 13:53:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a7bd7d5c-05a5-11f1-9db8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-09T093017Z-929402302-RC29IJAY1A38-RTRMADP-3-JAPAN-POLITICS-TAKAICHI.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran ready to dilute its enriched uranium if 'all sanctions are lifted'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-ready-dilute-enriched-uranium-all-us-sanctions-lifted-mohammad-eslami</link><description>Iran is prepared to dilute its highly enriched uranium if the US lifts all sanctions on the country, the head of its atomic energy agency said Monday after talks resumed with Washington .

"In conclusion, in response to a question about the possibility of diluting 60 percent enriched uranium ... the head of the Atomic Energy Agency said that this depends on whether all sanctions would be lifted in return," the official IRNA news agency reported, referring to agency chief Mohammad Eslami, without specifying whether this included all sanctions on Iran or only those imposed by the US.

Diluting uranium means mixing it with blend material to reduce the enrichment level, so that the final product does not exceed a given enrichment threshold.

Before US and Israeli strikes on its nuclear facilities in June last year, Iran had been enriching uranium to 60 percent, far exceeding the 3.67 percent limit allowed under a now-defunct nuclear agreement reached with world powers in 2015.

Western countries, led by the US, suspect Tehran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons , a claim denied by Iran.

According to the UN's nuclear watchdog, Iran is the only non-nuclear-weapons state enriching uranium to 60 percent.

It is also unknown where more than 400kg of highly enriched uranium that Iran possessed prior to the war has ended up, with UN inspectors last recording its location on June 10.

Such a stockpile could allow Iran to build more than nine nuclear bombs if enrichment reached 90 percent.

US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for Iran to be subject to a total ban on enrichment, a condition unacceptable to Tehran and far less favourable than the 2015 agreement.

Iran maintains it has a right to a civilian nuclear programme under the provisions of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, to which it and 190 other countries are signatories.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 14:52:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/424445b2-05bb-11f1-b60e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-11-10T083620Z-1430781414-MT1ZUMA0007CPK8Q-RTRMADP-3-ZUMA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vance becomes first sitting US VP to visit Armenia in push to advance Azerbaijan peace deal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260209-vance-becomes-first-sitting-us-vp-visit-armenia-push-advance-azerbaijan-peace-deal</link><description>US Vice President JD Vance landed in Armenia on Monday – a country that no sitting US vice president or president has visited before – as the Trump administration looks to advance a US-brokered deal aimed at ending a decades-long conflict with Azerbaijan .

Vance and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan signed an agreement to push forward negotiations on a civil nuclear energy deal, and Vance said the US was ready to export advanced computer chips and surveillance drones to Armenia and invest in the country's infrastructure.

The visit comes after Pashinyan signed a deal at the White House in August with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev where the leaders signed agreements reaffirming their commitment to signing a peace treaty. The text of the treaty was initialed by foreign ministers, which indicates preliminary approval. But the leaders have yet to sign the treaty and parliaments have yet to ratify it.

“Peace is not made by cautious people,” said Vance, who plans to travel to Azerbaijan on Tuesday. “Peace is not made by people who are too focused on the past. Peace is made by people who are focused on the future.”

The August deal between the two former Soviet republics calls for the creation of a major transit corridor dubbed the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity . It is expected to connect Azerbaijan and its autonomous Nakhchivan exclave, which are separated by a 32-kilometre-wide (20-mile-wide) patch of Armenian territory.

The land bridge had been a sticking point in resolving a conflict that lasted for nearly four decades over control of the Karabakh region, known internationally as Nagorno-Karabakh . The region had been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since 1994. A six-week war in 2020 resulted in Azerbaijan regaining control of parts of the region and the surrounding areas. In September 2023, Azerbaijan launched a blitz that forced the separatist authorities to capitulate. After Azerbaijan regained full control of Karabakh, most of its 120,000 Armenian residents fled to Armenia .

Vance said that the Armenian prime minister had his endorsement in upcoming elections and he emphasised that the country was among the oldest to have identified as Christian.

Pashinyan expressed his gratitude toward President Donald Trump and Vance, noting that he had accepted an invitation to participate in the first meeting of Trump's Board of Peace on February 19 in Washington. The group, founded by Trump, is overseeing the ceasefire plan in Gaza.

He said Vance's visit was “of truly historic and symbolic importance” and it “reflects the depth of the strong and strategic partnership forged between the Republic of Armenia and the United States of America”.

The vice president and his wife, Usha, arrived in Yerevan after spending four days in Milan at the Winter Olympics with their family. They were greeted with a red carpet, an honour guard and a delegation of officials. Armenian and American flags hung from poles from as the delegation drove to the vice president’s meeting, with some demonstrators on the side of the road, including one with a sign that said, “Does Trump support Devils?”</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 18:10:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/23d7579a-05d4-11f1-a00b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26040498083703.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Arab states condemn Israel as it expands control over occupied West Bank</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260209-arab-states-condemn-israel-expands-control-over-occupied-west-bank</link><description>Saudi Arabia , Jordan and the United Arab Emirates led regional states on Monday in condemning Israel's move to ease settlement expansion and widen its powers in the West Bank , a step critics said went in the direction of annexing occupied land.

Sunday's decisions by Israel 's security cabinet will make it easier for Jewish settlers to buy land ​in the West Bank and give Israeli authorities more power to act in areas supposedly under full Palestinian control, two senior Israeli ministers said.

One of them, ‍ultra-nationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , said in announcing the decisions that the government would "continue to kill the idea of a Palestinian state".

A joint statement by foreign ministers of Middle Eastern and some other Muslim countries, including Egypt and ​ Turkey , denounced the decisions as a violation of international law that would undermine the vision of a two-state solution as well ​as stability in the region.

They said the moves meant to entrench Israeli settlement of the West Bank, displacing Palestinians and imposing unlawful Israeli sovereignty there. Annexing the territory has long been a priority of far-right parties in Netanyahu's coalition .

Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey all have diplomatic relations with Israel. Saudi Arabia has said it will not establish such relations until the formation of a Palestinian state.

Most nations have long backed the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel as the best way to resolve the generations-old conflict and see the West Bank, which Israel has occupied since 1967, as the largest part of that future state.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz and Smotrich issued a joint statement explaining the decisions of ‍the five-member security cabinet, which were not published in full.

The security cabinet decided to repeal a law dating from Jordan's control of the West Bank before 1967 to make land registries public rather than confidential, and to remove ​a requirement for a permit from a civil administration office.

They said these moves would make it easier for Jews to purchase land in the West Bank. Hagit Ofran from the Israeli settlement watchdog group Peace Now said the decision was barred by international law and represented a step towards annexation of the West ‌Bank.

"The decision to allow every Israeli the right to buy land in the West Bank without government approval, without inspection, is also another way of saying it's normal life. It's not occupied territories, it's like part of Israel," she said.

Annexation is opposed by US President Donald Trump , who last year said he would not allow Israel to carry out such a step.

"It's not going to happen," Trump, who is expecting Netanyahu at the White House for a meeting on Wednesday, said in September.

Katz and Smotrich also said the government had decided to expand monitoring and enforcement actions regarding water offences, damage to archaeological sites and environmental hazards to areas A and B of the West Bank.

Under the Oslo interim peace accords of 1993, Area A was designated as under security control of the Palestinian Authority and Area B as under joint control with Israel. Most of the West Bank became Area C under full Israeli security control.

Those changes could allow the Israeli military to carry out demolitions of Palestinian ‍property and prevent Palestinian development not only in Area C but throughout the West Bank, Peace Now said in a statement.

In Hebron, a West Bank city with extensive archaeological remains and a significant ‌Israeli settler community, Palestinians voiced dismay ​at the decisions.

"It becomes easier to confiscate land, easier and faster to expand settlements and easier to demolish Palestinian homes," said Issa Amr, who heads an organisation in Hebron called Youth Against Settlements.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 18:10:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/355de0ba-0548-11f1-8ccb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-08T163436Z-723218502-RC2P7JA6BDJI-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba implements emergency measures to save fuel under US pressure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260209-cuba-implements-emergency-measures-save-fuel-under-us-pressure</link><description>Havana 's streets were eerily quiet Monday as emergency measures to conserve Cuba 's fast-dwindling fuel supplies kicked in to counteract the paralysing effects of economic pressure from US President Donald Trump .

With oil supplies in a US stranglehold, the communist government has had to cut the work week for state-owned companies and reduce in-person school and university hours as it limited fuel sales.

Cuba warned ​international airlines that jet fuel will no longer be available on ‍the island beginning Tuesday. Air Canada said it was suspending service to the island starting Monday.

The government also announced the closure of certain hotels with low occupancy rates and the consolidation of tourists in other hotels.

“Hotels are being closed in Varadero,” Cuba's flagship beach resort, located 150km from Havana , “and in other provinces”, a professional in the sector who did not wish to give her name confirmed to AFP.

The few Cubans who were out and about in the capital Monday said they were worried.

"One wonders how long a country can live under such conditions," nurse Rosa Ramos, 37, said, adding the fuel-saving measures were creating "a lot of uncertainty".

With public transport also cut back, Ramos had been waiting for over an hour for a taxi or bus to get to work.

Users of private taxis noted that fares had shot up overnight from about 200 pesos (40 US cents) to 350 pesos.

The island of 9.6 million inhabitants, under a US trade embargo since 1962, has for years been mired in a severe economic crisis marked by extended power cuts and shortages of fuel, medicine and food.

It has now also been cut off from critical oil supplies from Venezuela, whose leader Nicolas Maduro was toppled in a deadly US military strike last month.

Trump has also threatened to impose tariffs on any country that provides oil to the island nation he has said is "ready to fall".

The resulting shortages have threatened to plunge Cuba into complete darkness, with power plants struggling to keep the lights on.

On Sunday, it was announced long-haul flights will not be able to refuel on the island for at least a month.

Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio , the Miami-born son of Cuban immigrants, have made no secret of their desire to bring about regime change in Havana.

Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez on Monday denounced the "cruel aggression" of the United States, which he said was aimed at "breaking the political will of the Cuban people".

"The situation is tough and will demand great sacrifice," said Rodriguez, reiterating Cuba's "willingness to engage in dialogue", though on its own terms .

On Sunday, Deputy Prime Minster Oscar Perez-Oliva Fraga announced a set of emergency measures to ration whatever fuel is left to "protect essential services for the population and indispensable economic activities".

He said these included food and electricity production and "fundamental activities that generate foreign currency".

The president of Mexico , which used to be Cuba's second-biggest oil provider after Venezuela, said Monday that sanctions that harm the people of Cuba were "not right".

"We will continue supporting them and taking all necessary diplomatic actions to restore oil shipments" to Cuba, Claudia Sheinbaum told reporters.

"You cannot strangle a people like this – it's very unfair, very unfair."

Sheinbaum had previously warned of a humanitarian crisis in Cuba, but is keen to avoid putting her own country at risk of tariffs from the United States, Mexico's main trading partner.

Mexico is seeking an agreement with Washington that would allow it to resume oil exports to Havana. On Sunday, it sent two ships with over 800 tons of humanitarian aid .

The Kremlin , too, accused Washington on Monday of using "suffocating measures" against Cuba.

"We are discussing possible solutions with our Cuban friends, at least to provide whatever assistance we can," spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 19:45:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/38d02d0e-05e1-11f1-ab99-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96QL6UU.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sanae Takaichi: Japan’s ‘Iron Maiden’ PM rises – again</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260209-sanae-takaichi-japan-iron-maiden-pm-rises-again</link><description>When Japan ’s first female prime minister staged a surprise drum session with visiting South Korean President Lee Jae-myung last month, it created ripples across the Sea of Japan, marking a new rhythm in Tokyo’s diplomacy.

Wearing matching blue shirts, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi and Lee banged out K-pop hits as the cameras caught Japan’s 64-year-old leader bobbing her head to the beat with a face-splitting smile. As the video clip went viral in both countries, international news outlets gushed about a new “ drumstick diplomacy ” turning into a “ cymbal of unity ”.

Before becoming prime minister in October, Takaichi was a regular visitor to Japan’s Yasukuni Shrine, which honours convicted war criminals along with 2.5 million war dead and is viewed as a potent symbol of the country’s militarist past.

More than a decade ago, when Takaichi’s political mentor, then prime minister Shinzo Abe , visited the shrine, it sparked furious reactions from China and South Korea , where memories of Japanese colonialism and Tokyo’s refusal to acknowledge the atrocities of the early 20 th century have left festering wounds.

Takaichi’s rise to the pinnacle of power in a deeply patriarchal country may have been enabled by Abe, Japan’s longest-serving prime minister who was assassinated in 2022 . But in style, if not substance, Takaichi as prime minister has taken things more cautiously. Since taking office, she has avoided a visit to the Yasukuni Shrine.

That was before she led her party to a thumping supermajority victory in Sunday’s snap poll. With her conservative Liberal Democratic Paty (LDP) sweeping more than two-thirds of parliamentary seats in the lower house, Takaichi now has the ability to give her hawkish instincts a free rein.

During an interview with Fuji Television on Sunday, Takaichi said she wanted to create an environment to allow a Yasukuni visit that can be understood by neighbouring countries.

But China, Japan’s largest trading partner, is unlikely to be understanding. Barely two weeks after taking office in October, Takaichi ignited a diplomatic storm when she was asked in parliament about her position if China used military force against Taiwan . That would constitute a “survival-threatening situation” for Japan, Takaichi replied, breaking a tradition for Tokyo, which is typically more circumspect on Taiwan issues.

Her reply, which suggested that Japan could intervene militarily if China sought to seize the self-ruled island, sparked a war of words and massive Chinese military exercises in December that were aimed to showcase Beijing's ability to cut off Taiwan from outside support.

Takaichi is known to be a China hawk, which has alarmed some of Japan’s doves. The results of Sunday’s vote, however, show that the majority of Japanese voters are ready for a more muscular foreign policy to contain Beijing’s territorial ambitions.

In Japan, Takaichi has a formidable reputation with monikers to match. An admirer of Margaret Thatcher , Takaichi is also famous for having carried several drum sticks during her heavy-metal days, as she would break them during intense performances. When she became Japan’s first female prime minister, headlines proclaimed the “Iron Maiden” had risen to “Iron Lady”.

It was an unlikely rise for the daughter of working-class parents in the ancient imperial capital of Nara.

Born in Nara on March 7, 1961, Takaichi was raised by conservative parents who taught her prewar moral values. Her mother was a police officer and her father worked at a machinery maker.

As a child, she enjoyed listening to her parents recite an 1890 imperial document praising paternalistic family values and loyalty to the government, Takaichi said in 2012.

After graduating from high school, she was accepted by a number of prestigious Tokyo universities, but she wasn’t allowed to enroll in any of the schools in the capital. Her parents made her attend Kobe University while living at home, which was normal in those days for unmarried daughters of conservative families.

In 1987, she won a sponsorship that enabled her to go to the US to work as congressional fellow for then Democratic congresswoman Pat Schroeder. Takaichi returned to Japan two years later with lessons learned by observing Schroeder, who was the first female representative elected from Colorado.

After returning to Japan from the US, a young Takaichi worked as a television personality, an author and a critic.

“She has a very unique upbringing for a politician in the sense that she comes from a working-class family,” said Kristi Govella from the Nissan Institute of Japanese Studies in an interview with FRANCE 24. “She was a heavy metal drummer. She's an avid motorcyclist and she’s just not in the mold of the typical LDP politician that many voters have become quite tired of in recent years. She has come onto the scene despite possible doubts about her ability to lead because she wasn’t a huge figure on the national scene. And she's really made a splash.”

But her rise in the patriarchal world of Japanese politics was not an easy one. Takaichi was first elected to parliament in 1993 after defying her parents’ opposition. Some voters insulted her as “a little girl”, she said in 2023, recalling her first campaign.

“In those days, women who were not considered old enough were unwelcome,” she said. She also faced groundless allegations of being a mistress of a senior politician, and criticism – often from women – for wearing heels, flashy jewellery and short skirts.

“I am who I am,” Takaichi said. “The only way to prove myself is with the work I do.”

Her work ethic has sometimes been at odds with the national mood. Takaichi’s vow, before she took office in October, that she would “work, work, work, work, and work” drew criticism from mental health workers and several ordinary Japanese in a country notorious for its long working hours. Lawyers representing people who died from overwork described her comments as unhelpful, and reports of her calling meetings at 3am raised alarm bells about her health in some quarters.

Responding to the criticisms, Takaichi said her comments had been misinterpreted. “I had no intention of encouraging people to overwork or suggesting that working long hours is a virtue,” she said, adding she was simply trying to communicate her determination to be an effective leader.

With her short, cropped hair and her passion for heavy metal and motorcycles, it’s easy to view Takaichi as a daring non-conformist. But that would be a misjudgment, according to Japan experts.

Takaichi supports the imperial family’s male-only succession and opposes same-sex marriage as well as amending the 19th-century law requiring married couples to have the same surname, under which most women are pressured into abandoning theirs.

“She tends to have quite socially conservative views,” said Govella. But the prime minister also has a political nose for issues that resonate with the electorate. “The interesting thing is that we haven't heard a lot of emphasis on that social conservatism. Since she's come to be prime minister, she seems to be trying to weigh the different concerns of voters across issues, and she seems to be accurately gauging that what voters really want to see is a response on the economic side, more than her pushing forward on any specific social issues.”

Takaichi may look up to Thatcher, but economic policies do not mirror those of the fiscally conservative former British leader. As an Abe protégé, Japan’s prime minister advocates boosting government spending while also promoting a sales tax cut.

This alarms conservative economists, who warn that Japan must trim its national debt.

But when it comes to defence spending, Takaichi has an ally in US President Donald Trump , who welcomed her pledge to push Japan’s annual defense budget to double 2022 levels – to 2 percent of its gross domestic product – by March.

Takaichi is set to visit Washington to meet with Trump at the White House on March 19. The US president announced the trip on social media as he endorsed the prime minister ahead of Sunday’s election.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 20:39:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e61bc8c-04e0-11f1-99c6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-07T220235Z-979292584-RC2DFJAJFDAL-RTRMADP-3-JAPAN-ELECTION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio to visit Hungary and Slovakia after Trump backs right-wing leader Orban</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260209-rubio-to-visit-hungary-and-slovakia-after-trump-backs-orban</link><description>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will travel next week to Hungary, the State Department said Monday, after President Donald Trump endorsed its right-wing leader Viktor Orban , who is trailing in polls ahead of April elections.

Rubio will travel to Hungary and Slovakia, also led by a right-wing ally of Trump, after addressing the Munich Security Conference, where last year Vice President JD Vance berated the European Union and championed the continent's far-right .

The trip comes as tensions again rise between the United States and the European Union after Trump mused about seizing Greenland from Denmark, a NATO ally.

In Budapest on Sunday and Monday, Rubio "will meet with key Hungarian officials to bolster our shared bilateral and regional interests, including our commitment to peace processes to resolve global conflicts and to the US-Hungary energy partnership," State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said.

Orban is the rare European Union leader to enjoy warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin and has often resisted EU initiatives to support Ukraine.

Orban had planned a summit last year between Trump and Putin which was scrapped as US officials became convinced that Russia was unlikely to compromise on Ukraine .

Last week Trump endorsed Orban in a social-media posting, calling the European Union's longest-serving national leader "a true friend, fighter, and WINNER."

But Orban is facing an unprecedented challenge in his quest for a fifth straight term on April 12, with polls showing him trailing the party of Peter Magyar, a former government insider turned critic.

Orban became a hero to many Trump supporters for his hostility to migration during the Syrian refugee crisis a decade ago.

When Orban visited the White House last year, Trump granted Hungary an exemption of sanction on Russian oil and gas imports.

Former president Joe Biden had a much more hostile relationship with Orban, whom he accused of "looking for dictatorship" in part by muzzling independent media and campaigning against LGBTQ rights.

Rubio will travel Sunday to Slovakia where Prime Minister Robert Fico has also found common cause with Trump.

Fico's recent visit to see Trump in Florida caused a stir when Politico, citing unnamed European diplomats, said that Fico had voiced concern about Trump's mental state. Both countries denied the account.

Rubio, often seen as the more civil face of the Trump administration, will represent the United States at Munich this year instead of Vance.</description><pubDate>Mon, 09 Feb 2026 23:37:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2312a3ec-fc73-11f0-851f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-28T160028Z-1922629124-RC2FAJAB8W9L-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-RUBIO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US forces board sanctioned tanker after globe-spanning pursuit</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260210-us-forces-board-sanctioned-tanker</link><description>US military forces boarded a sanctioned tanker in the Indian Ocean after tracking the ship from the Caribbean Sea as part of an oil quarantine meant to squeeze Venezuela , Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said on Monday.

Venezuela had faced US sanctions on its oil and relied on a shadow fleet of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains. Following the US raid to apprehend then-President Nicolás Maduro in early January, several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast, including the ship that was boarded in the Indian Ocean overnight.

Hegseth vowed to eventually capture all those ships, telling a group of shipyard workers in Maine on Monday that “the only guidance I gave to my military commanders is none of those are getting away”.

“I don’t care if we’ve got to go around the globe to get them; we’re going to get them,” he added.

Later on Monday, the US military said it had carried out another deadly strike on a vessel accused of trafficking drugs in the eastern Pacific Ocean.

US Southern Command said the strike killed two people, while one person survived. Southern Command said it had notified the US Coast Guard to activate its search and rescue system for the survivor. A video linked to the post shows a boat moving through the water before exploding in flames.

Monday’s attack raises the death toll from the Trump administration’s strikes on alleged drug boats to 130 people.

The Trump administration has seized seven tankers as part of its broader efforts to take control of the South American country’s oil. Unlike those previous actions, the Aquila II has not been formally seized and placed under US control, a defence official said.

Instead, the ship is being held while its ultimate fate is decided by the US, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing decision-making.

The Aquila II is a Panamanian-flagged tanker under US sanctions related to the shipment of illicit Russian oil. Owned by a company with a listed address in Hong Kong, ship-tracking data show it has spent much of the past year with its radio transponder turned off, a practice known as “running dark” commonly employed by smugglers to hide their location.

It was one of at least 16 tankers that fled the Venezuelan coast last month, according to Samir Madani, co-founder of TankerTrackers.com, who said his organisation used satellite imagery and surface-level photos to document the ship’s movements. According to data transmitted from the ship on Monday, it is not currently laden with a cargo of crude oil.

The Pentagon ’s post on X said the military “conducted a right-of-visit, maritime interdiction” on the ship.

“The Aquila II was operating in defiance of President Trump’s established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean,” the Pentagon said. “It ran, and we followed.”

A Navy official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss military operations, would not say what forces were used in the operation but confirmed the destroyers USS Pinckney and USS John Finn , as well as the mobile base ship USS Miguel Keith , were operating in the Indian Ocean.

In videos the Pentagon posted to social media, uniformed forces can be seen boarding a Navy helicopter that takes off from a ship matching the profile of the Miguel Keith . Video and photos of the tanker shot from inside a helicopter also show a Navy destroyer sailing alongside the ship.

Since the US ouster of Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid on January 3, the Trump administration has set out to control the production, refining and global distribution of Venezuela’s petroleum products. Officials in President Donald Trump ’s Republican administration have made it clear they see seizing the tankers as a way to generate cash as they seek to rebuild Venezuela’s battered oil industry and restore its economy.

Trump has also been trying to restrict the flow of oil to Cuba, which faces strict economic sanctions by the US and relies heavily on oil shipments from allies such as Mexico, Russia and Venezuela.

Since the Venezuela operation, Trump has said no more Venezuelan oil will go to Cuba and that the Cuban government is ready to fall. Trump also recently signed an executive order that would impose a tariff on any goods from countries that sell or provide oil to Cuba, primarily pressuring Mexico because it has acted as an oil lifeline for Cuba.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:28:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82cc56f6-ebda-11f0-84d5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89WN2PR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN waits for clarity on US payments as financial crisis looms</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260210-un-waits-for-clarity-on-us-payments-as-financial-crisis-looms</link><description>The United Nations said on Monday it is waiting to find out how much of the nearly $4 billion the United States owes the world organisation the Trump administration intends to pay, and when the money will arrive.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week that the world body faces an “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States .

The US owes $2.196 billion to the UN’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a UN official. The US also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the UN’s far-flung peacekeeping operations, a figure that is also expected to rise.

The US Mission to the United Nations confirmed that US Ambassador Mike Waltz said the Trump administration planned to make a significant down payment on its arrears within weeks, with the final amount still to be determined. His comments were first reported by Reuters.

UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Monday that Guterres has been in touch with Waltz “for quite some time”, and that the UN’s controller has also been in contact with US officials.

“We’re waiting to see exactly when payments will be made and in what amount,” Dujarric said.

Guterres said in a letter to all member nations last week that cash for the UN’s regular operating budget could run out by July, which could dramatically affect its operations.

President Donald Trump has said the United Nations has not lived up to its potential. His administration did not pay anything to the United Nations in 2025, and has withdrawn from UN organisations including the World Health Organization and the cultural agency UNESCO , while pulling funding from dozens of others.

UN officials have said 95% of the arrears to the UN’s regular budget are owed by the United States.

The country second on the list for failing to pay its mandatory regular dues is Venezuela , which owes $38 million, the UN official said. The South American nation, whose economy was struggling before a US military raid in January that deposed then president Nicolás Maduro , has lost its right to vote in the General Assembly for being two years in arrears.

Nearly 60 countries paid their annual dues by the Feb 8 deadline.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 02:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e55dc4ce-eaec-11f0-b95c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25175745805083.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran escalates crackdown on protestors amid potential US nuclear talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260210-iran-escalates-crackdown-on-protestors-amid-potential-us-nuclear-talks</link><description>Iran stepped up its crackdown on Monday after recent protests , making more arrests while holding the door open to Washington for further nuclear negotiations.

The arrests – including that of Javad Emam, the spokesperson for the main reformist coalition – came after Iranian and US officials held talks in Oman that both sides described as positive.

On Saturday, Iran added more jail time to Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi, and on Monday arrested Hossein Karoubi, the son of prominent dissident Mehdi Karoubi.

Weeks after repressing a wave of protests, one of the greatest challenges to the government since it came to power in the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Tehran has taken a two-track approach.

It is rounding up and jailing perceived critics, while at the same time pursuing a potential diplomatic opening with US President Donald Trump ’s administration.

A spokesperson for the Reformist Front coalition told local media on Monday that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards had arrested the group’s spokesman, Emam.

Emam was one of at least five Reformist Front figures to be detained, as were several activists and filmmakers who co-signed a protest statement.

Iran’s government has branded the protests “riots” fuelled by its arch-foes Israel and the United States .

On Monday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on the nation to show “resolve” against foreign pressure.

“National power is less about missiles and aircraft and more about the will and resolve of the people,” Khamenei said, adding: “Show it again and frustrate the enemy.”

Alongside its defiant pronouncements, Iran has signalled it could come to some kind of deal to dial back its nuclear programme to avoid further conflict with Washington.

The official IRNA news agency reported that Iranian atomic agency chief Mohammad Eslami had said Tehran could dilute its highly enriched uranium in return for sanctions relief.

“In response to a question about the possibility of diluting 60 per cent enriched uranium,” IRNA reported, Eslami “said this depends on whether all sanctions would be lifted in return”.

The report did not specify whether such an agreement would include only nuclear sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States, or all international economic measures targeting the Islamic Republic.

Diluting, or “downblending”, uranium means mixing it with other substances to reduce the enrichment level, so the final product does not exceed a given threshold – thus extending the amount of time it would take Iran to create sufficient nuclear material for a bomb.

Tehran adamantly insists it has never planned to build a nuclear weapon and that enrichment for civilian research and energy is its sovereign right, but the US, Israel and most Western capitals do not believe this.

At the talks in Oman last week, the US and Iran agreed to discuss Tehran’s nuclear programme , though Washington and Israel also want to put its ballistic missiles and support for regional militant groups on the agenda.

In separate calls with his Egyptian, Saudi and Turkish counterparts, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi “described the talks as a good start while emphasising the need to dispel mistrust about the American side’s intentions and objectives”, state television reported.

While Trump had initially threatened to intervene over Iran’s repression of last month’s protests, since the latest talks began the United States has not given any sign that the crackdown on Tehran’s domestic critics is a major concern.

On Saturday, Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi was sentenced to six years in prison on charges of harming national security.

She was also given a one-and-a-half-year prison sentence for “propaganda” against Iran’s Islamic system, her foundation said in a statement.

Already incarcerated for much of the past decade as a result of her campaigning against capital punishment and the mandatory dress code for women, she now faces up to 17 more years behind bars and 154 lashes.

The arrest of Reformist Front spokesman Emam followed those on Sunday of three other figures, including Azar Mansouri, who has led the coalition since 2023. Another reformist lawmaker was arrested on Monday.

The reformist camp largely backed incumbent President Masoud Pezeshkian in the 2024 presidential election.

Separately, Hossein Karoubi was also taken into custody. Karoubi’s father, Mehdi Karoubi, was a figure in the 2009 Green Movement protests and has been under house arrest more or less ever since.

The authorities in Iran have acknowledged that 3,117 people were killed during the protests, publishing a list of 2,986 names, most of whom they say were members of the security forces and innocent bystanders.

International organisations have put the toll far higher.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says it has verified 6,964 deaths, mostly protesters, and has another 11,730 cases under investigation.

It has also counted more than 51,000 arrests.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 04:53:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1ae47b2e-0631-11f1-a4d5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26040508512079.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens to block opening of Ontario-Michigan bridge financed by Canada</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-trump-threatens-to-block-opening-of-ontario-michigan-bridge-financed-by-canada</link><description>President Donald Trump threatened Monday to stop the opening of a new bridge between the United States and Canada , in a fresh salvo against the country he has suggested should become the 51st US state .

Trump said the United States should own "at least half" of the still under-construction Gordie Howe International Bridge that links the Canadian province of Ontario with the US state of Michigan.

Work on the $4.7-billion bridge – named after the late Canadian-born National Hockey League great Gordie Howe – started in 2018 and it is due to open later this year.

"I will not allow this bridge to open until the United States is fully compensated for everything we have given them, and also, importantly, Canada treats the United States with the Fairness and Respect that we deserve," Trump posted on Truth Social.

"We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY."

The 79-year-old Republican complained that Canada owned both sides of the bridge and used "virtually" no US products to build it.

According to a factsheet issued by the Windsor-Detroit Bridge Authority, the bridge was financed entirely by Canada and will be jointly owned by the governments of Canada and the state of Michigan.

"And now, on top of everything else, Prime Minister (Mark) Carney wants to make a deal with China – which will eat Canada alive. We'll just get the leftovers! I don't think so," Trump added.

Washington threatened to slap 100 percent tariffs on Canada after Carney visited Beijing last month and sealed a preliminary trade deal with China.

The US leader meanwhile repeated the outlandish claim that Beijing would "terminate ALL Ice Hockey being played in Canada".

Trump has clashed with Canada over trade since returning to office in January 2025. He previously called for the United States to annex Canada but has largely dropped that claim in recent months.

Carney for his part warned at the Davos forum last month that the US-led global system of governance is enduring "a rupture", in a thinly veiled reference to Trump's disruption, and argued for mid-level powers to group together.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 07:38:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ea1d5568-0650-11f1-ba6f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP5805076774309242.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia's Lavrov plays down hopes of a breakthrough in Ukraine talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260210-live-ukraine-long-way-to-go-in-talks-russia-lavrov-zelensky</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has defended a Winter Olympian's right to wear a helmet featuring athletes killed during the war with Russia after skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych said the IOC banned it at the Games.

Heraskevych wore the helmet during a training session in Cortina and had intended to use the Games in Italy to help maintain international pressure on Russia.

The 27-year-old said in a social media post on Monday that the International Olympic Committee had banned his custom helmet -- which has portraits of Ukrainian athletes killed since Russia's 2022 invasion -- from training and competition.

The IOC has yet to publicly confirm that.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said that there is no reason to be enthusiastic about US President Donald Trump's pressure on Europe and Ukraine as there is still a long way to go in talks on peace in Ukraine, RIA reports.

Ukrainian skeleton ​competitor Vladyslav Heraskevych said ⁠he was banned ‍from wearing a helmet at the ​ Winter Olympics showing images ​of the country's athletes killed during the war in Ukraine.

Pyongyang accused Seoul of flying a drone into Kaesong in January, releasing images that purported to show debris from the downed aircraft.

Seoul initially denied the government was involved, with President Lee Jae-myung saying it would be akin to "firing a shot into the North".

But authorities said on Tuesday they were investigating three active-duty soldiers and one spy agency employee.

Investigators from a joint military-police task force raided 18 locations of interest, including the Defense Intelligence Command and the National Intelligence Service.

"The task force said it will thoroughly establish the truth behind the drone incident through analysis of seized materials and a rigorous investigation of the suspects," a statement read.

Three civilians have already been charged for their alleged role in the drone scandal.

One of them has publicly claimed responsibility, saying he acted to detect radiation levels from North Korea's Pyongsan uranium processing facility.

Disgraced ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol is currently standing trial on charges he illegally sent drones into North Korea to help create the pretext for declaring martial law in late 2024.

His attempt to overturn civilian rule failed, and Yoon was impeached and ousted from office in April last year.

Prosecutors have accused Yoon of instructing Seoul's military to fly drones over Pyongyang and distribute anti-North leaflets in an attempt to provoke a response.

They said Yoon and others "conspired to create conditions that would allow the declaration of emergency martial law".

North Korea said last year it had proven that the South flew drones to drop propaganda leaflets over its capital.

Lee said in December that he felt an apology was due to North Korea over his predecessor's alleged order to send drones.

"I feel I should apologise, but I hesitate to say it out loud," he said at the time.

"I worry that if I do, it could be used as fodder for ideological battles or accusations of being pro-North," he added.

Lee has taken steps to ease tensions since taking office, including removing propaganda loudspeakers along the border.

Pyongyang unveiled new attack drones in August 2024, with experts saying the capability may be attributable to the country's budding alliance with Moscow.

North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un at the time ordered the "mass production" of attack drones, with analysts saying they may be designed to carry explosives and deliberately crash into enemy targets.

North Korea has previously sent trash-filled balloons over the South in what it called retaliation for activists in the South floating anti-regime propaganda missives northwards.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 07:38:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bc27ae14-0633-11f1-90d6-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/3bfe4a1dcb3ef7327c690b372a86916fce035da9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French left calls for Epstein inquiry as Macron says scandal 'mainly concerns' US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-france-epstein-inquiry-macron-says-scandal-mainly-concerns-usa</link><description>French National Assembly President Yaël Braun-Pivet said Tuesday she was opposed to the creation of a parliamentary inquiry into the scandal involving late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , warning that such a move would "compete with the justice system".

Braun-Pivet, an ally of French President Emmanuel Macron , was responding to calls by the left-wing La France insoumise (LFI) party for the establishment of a cross-party inquiry to investigate Epstein's French ties .

"The matter must be referred to the courts" to "shed light" on possible "French ramifications" to the Epstein revelations, Braun-Pivet told Europe 1.

LFI argued last week that a parliamentary inquiry was necessary to investigate possible "interference" or "funding" of political parties after more French public figures were named in files related to Epstein.

Former French minister Jack Lang on Saturday resigned from his longtime post as head of the Arab World Institute (IMA) in Paris over his links to the late sex offender, becoming the most high-profile French public figure to be caught up in the politically explosive scandal .

French prosecutors have opened a preliminary tax fraud probe into Lang and his daughter Caroline after they were mentioned in the Epstein files.

Braun-Pivet described the revelations as "terrifying", even as she praised "the quality of Jack Lang's commitment and work as a minister".

"I no longer want to see politicians taking advantage of the generosity of private individuals," she said. "These politicians who take advantage of private jets and have their holidays paid for are unacceptable."

Braun-Pivet's comments came a day after Macron sought to distance France from the Epstein affair, saying it was "a matter that mainly concerns the United States".

"The justice system there must do its job, and that's all," Macron said, adding that he did not want to "take part" in a public debate on the Epstein affair.

The French president also called for "real journalism", noting that the dump of US government files on Epstein had created "fuel for conspiracy theories".

When asked about Lang's decision to resign, Macron said he had taken note of it, adding the choice was made "in good conscience".

Lang, 86,  has denied any wrongdoing , saying he was "shocked" that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company that Epstein founded in 2016, and had only appealed to Epstein as a philanthropist.

His daughter Caroline, who allegedly owned half the shares in the company, resigned Monday from the board of the Fondation Le Refuge, dedicated to housing and supporting LGBTQ youth who have been estranged from their families.

She had previously resigned from her job as head of the Union of Independent Producers (SPI), which represents independent film producers in France.

A mere mention in the files does not imply wrongdoing.

Top US prosecutor Todd Blanche said on February 1 that authorities would not bring any more charges after the release of more than 3 million items made available at the end of January.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 11:28:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/934697f6-02d4-11f1-9b42-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94XA2WE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Bodega cats': New York seeks rights for corner shops' furry little helpers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-bodega-cats-new-york-seeks-rights-for-corner-shops-furry-little-helpers</link><description>Simba, a large cat with thick ginger and white fur, is one of thousands of felines that live in New York 's corner shops known as "bodegas" – even if their presence is illegal.

Praised for warding off pests, so-called bodega cats are also a cultural fixture for New Yorkers , some of whom are now pushing to enshrine legal rights for the little store helpers.

"Simba is very important to us because he keeps the shop clean of the mice," Austin Moreno, a shopkeeper in Manhattan, told AFP from behind his till.

The fluffy inhabitant also helps to entice customers.

"People, very often, they come to visit to ask, what is his name? The other day, some girls saw him for the first time and now they come every day," said Moreno.

Around a third of the city's roughly 10,000 bodegas are thought to have a resident cat despite being liable to fines of $200-$350 for keeping animals in a store selling food, according to Dan Rimada, founder of Bodega Cats of New York.

Rimada photographs the felines for his social media followers and last year launched a petition to legalize bodega cats, which drew nearly 14,000 signatures.

"These cats are woven into the fabric of New York City, and that's an important story to tell," he said.

Inspired by Rimada's petition, New York City council member Keith Powers has proposed a measure to shield the owners of bodega cats from penalties.

His legislation would also provide free vaccinations and spay or neuter services to the felines.

But animal shelters and rights groups say this wouldn't go far enough.

While Simba can nap in the corner of his shop with kibble within paw's reach, many of his fellow cats are locked in basements, deprived of food or proper care, and abandoned when they grow old or fall ill.

Becky Wisdom, who rescues cats in New York, warned that lifting the threat of fines could remove "leverage" to encourage bodega owners to better care for the animals.

She also opposes public funds being given to business owners rather than low-income families who want their cats spayed or neutered.

The latter is a big issue in New York, where the stray cat population is estimated at around half a million.

Regardless of what the city decides, it is the state of New York that has authority over business rules, said Allie Taylor, president of Voters for Animal Rights.

Taylor said she backs another initiative proposed by state assembly member Linda Rosenthal, a prominent animal welfare advocate, who proposes allowing cats in bodegas under certain conditions.

These would include vet visits, mandatory spaying or neutering, and ensuring the cats have sufficient food, water and a safe place to sleep.

Beyond the specific case of bodega cats, Taylor is pushing for a more radical overhaul of animal protection in New York.

"Instead of focusing on one subset of cats, we need the city to make serious investments, meaning tens of millions of dollars per year into free or low cost spay, neuter and veterinary care," she said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 11:28:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/624521e2-0624-11f1-8bb4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/ea04aa757d40185220bbc71015276561bc90515c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France calls for witnesses after 79-year-old charged with sexual abuse of 89 minors, two murders</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260210-france-calls-witnesses-after-79-year-old-charged-with-sexual-abuse-of-89-minors-two-murders</link><description>A French prosecutor on Tuesday appealed for further testimony in a mass abuse case across nine countries, after charging a 79-year-old former educator with rape and sexual assault of 89 minors since the 1960s.

Prosecutor Etienne Manteaux spoke to reporters in the southeastern city of Grenoble to publicise the case of the former teacher, who had also confessed to killing his terminally ill mother and his elderly aunt.

In an unusual move, French authorities named the suspect, Jacques Leveugle, who was born in 1946 in Annecy, an Alpine town an hour's drive away from Grenoble.

"This name must be known because the aim is to enable potential victims to come forward," the prosecutor said.

When asked why prosecutors did not reveal the information when Leveugle was placed under investigation, Manteaux said that it was a "somewhat unusual case, and we wanted to first ensure the veracity of the facts".

Then "it became essential to allow victims who could not be identified and who were not going to be heard to come forward", he added.

Leveugle, who is accused of committing sexual crimes against minors between 1967 and 2022, has been in custody since his indictment in 2024, the prosecutor said.

In May last year, a French court sentenced retired doctor Joel Le Scouarnec to 20 years in prison after he confessed to sexually abusing or raping 298 patients between 1989 and 2014.

Of those, more than 250 victims were under 15 years old.

Victims and child rights advocates say that case highlighted systemic flaws that allowed Le Scouarnec to repeatedly commit sexual crimes.

Leveugle allegedly committed the crimes against minors in Germany , Switzerland , Morocco , Niger , Algeria , the Philippines , India , Colombia , and the French overseas territory of New Caledonia , where he worked as a freelance teacher and instructor, said the prosecutor.

His varied roles included instructor of speleology, or the study of caves, and French teacher.

"He travelled to these different countries and in each of these places where he settled to provide tutoring and teach, he would meet young people and have sexual relations with them," according to the prosecutor.

The number of victims was established from writings compiled on a USB drive by the man, which refer to "sexual relations" with minors aged 13 to 17.

The USB stick on which the documents were stored by the man was discovered by his nephew, who was "questioning his uncle's emotional and sexual life", Manteaux added.

It "contains 15 tomes of very dense material, and investigators will review and read all of these writings and identify 89 minors", he said.

During the investigation, the man also confessed to suffocating his mother – a terminally ill cancer patient – with a pillow in the 1970s, according to the prosecutor.

He also suffocated his 92-year-old aunt, also with a pillow, in the 1990s, the prosecutor said.

Leveugle had to travel and the aunt "begged him not to go".

"He decided to kill her too, so while she was asleep, he took a pillow and suffocated her," the prosecutor said.

In his "memoirs", the man had written that he had "killed two people", Manteaux said.

A separate murder investigation has been launched.

The suspect "justifies his actions by saying that he would like someone to do the same for him if he found himself in this end-of-life situation", the prosecutor said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 15:11:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/627c4c1a-068a-11f1-bf68-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96UD8G3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kenya FM slams Russia's use of its citizens as 'cannon fodder', announces visit to Moscow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260210-kenya-slams-russia-use-citizens-lured-to-ukraine-as-cannon-fodder</link><description>Kenya on Tuesday condemned as "unacceptable" recruiters luring Kenyans to Russia with promises of lucrative jobs, only to send them to Ukraine's front lines as "cannon fodder".

The four, three of whom returned wounded, were given contracts written in Russian.

"These individuals are used as cannon fodder on the war front," Sing'Oei said.

"We have seen loss of lives, and I am planning to make a visit to Moscow so that we can emphasise that this is something that needs to be arrested," Mudavadi said in a statement to the media.

He said he would also pursue the release of Kenyans held as prisoners of war in Ukraine and "verify" the condition of those hospitalised.

It is targeting February 13 for the lift-off of Crew-12's mission aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with a window opening at 5:15am local time (10:15am GMT).

"Mission teams completed a weather review Tuesday morning and have waived off the Thursday, February 12, launch opportunity due to forecast weather conditions along Crew-12's flight path," NASA said in a statement.

Weather at the site in Florida has been in fact favourable, NASA officials told a briefing Monday, but higher winds forecast across the rest of the East Coast are to blame for the delays.

These winds could complicate any potential emergency maneuvers, like an early splashdown of the spacecraft carrying the astronauts, for example.

If Friday's launch goes as planned, the astronauts should arrive at the space station by approximately 3:15pm on Saturday.

Crew-12 is composed of Americans Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, along with French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.

They remain in quarantine in NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida , waiting to blast off.

The travelers will replace Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned in the first medical evacuation in the space station's history.

ISS, a scientific laboratory orbiting 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three.

Continuously inhabited for the last quarter-century, the ageing ISS is scheduled to be de-orbited and crashed into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:02:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/93f96d0e-0261-11f1-809f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/47c854a29c0361af6453fe5789114374cf263fda.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Democracy loses out': France sinks to new low in annual global corruption index</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260210-france-sinks-new-low-in-annual-global-corruption-index-democracy</link><description>France dropped on Tuesday to an all-time low in Transparency International ’s annual corruption perceptions index, with the organisation warning of “democratic danger” if politicians fail to act.

The Corruption Perceptions Index is compiled by experts and businesspeople who rank 182 countries on their perceived corruption levels in the public sector based on data from institutions including the World Bank and the World Economic Forum .

Countries score between zero, for those seen as highly corrupt, and 100, for those seen as very clean. In the 2025 edition released on Tuesday, Denmark ranked top with 89 points and South Sudan lowest with a score of 9.

France was given a score of 66 points, one point lower than 2024, and slipped down in the overall rankings to 27th place – its worst performance since the index, which was created in 1995, implemented its current methodology in 2012.

France’s poor score comes on the back of three high-profile corruption cases that dominated headlines last year.

A Senate report released in May found that the French government covered up consumer fraud by food giant Nestle, allowing the company to use prohibited treatments to produce "natural" mineral waters, including Perrier.

Ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy was imprisoned for 20 days in October after being found guilty of illegally seeking funding for his successful presidential campaign from former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi .

And, in an ongoing scandal, far-right leader Marine Le Pen and others from her National Rally party were found guilty in March of embezzling European Parliament funds.

Le Pen appeared in a Paris court this week to appeal the verdict which, if upheld, will ban her for running in the 2027 presidential elections.

These notable cases have “contributed to the deterioration in the perception of corruption”, said Florent Clouet, chief executive of Transparency International France.

But beyond the headline-grabbing scandals, the organisation has identified several key factors in France allowing an increase in the perception of corruption.

“The most significant problem, in our view, is the lack of political will – there is absolutely no political leadership in the fight against corruption,” Clouet said.

A recent plan to strengthen anti-corruption measures has not been championed by any MPs or presented at the weekly Council of Ministers chaired by President Emmanuel Macron , and accusations of corruption at the heart of government seem increasingly common.

Paris mayoral hopeful and current Culture Minister Rachida Dati is the latest in a series of serving ministers to face corruption charges .

The lack of political support for anti-corruption measures is compounded by under-resourced investigation and prosecution bodies.

The National Financial Prosecutor's Office ( Le parquet national financier ) is overrun, with “each pair of magistrates ... dealing with 80 cases, when the original plan was for them to handle eight cases”, Clouet said.

There is also a chronic lack of personnel at leading financial investigation agencies the central anti-corruption office ( l’Office central de lutte contre la corruption et les infractions financières et fiscales) and the High Authority for Transparency in Public Life .

“As a result, we find ourselves in a situation where, basically, they are unable to properly carry out the missions for which they were created,” Clouet said.

The president of the High Authority for Transparency in Public life in April called on the government to increase its budget , saying that of 13,000 declarations made by public officials in 2024, it only had capacity to verify 5,000.

While these organisations were set up to monitor high-ranking officials and public servants, an additional issue is the lack of oversight at lower levels of government.

“There is great difficulty detecting and combating what is known as 'low-intensity corruption', involving relatively small amounts of money that slip under the radar of prevention and detection mechanisms,” Clouet added.

Rather than being an outlier, Transparency International found the issues in France are part of a “worrying trend” of “backsliding scores in traditionally well-performing democracies” including Canada , New Zealand , Sweden and the UK .

Globally, more than two thirds of all countries surveyed received a score lower than 50 and “the vast majority of countries are failing to keep corruption under control", the report found.

Over the past decade, progress has “stalled” in Western Europe and “been deteriorating” in the US, which dropped to a new low of 64, it added.

Indeed, US President Donald Trump ’s dismantling of decades-old measures to fight corruption seem to have inspired other countries to loosen their own laws.

“In the current geopolitical climate, Europe should be raising, not lowering, its anti-corruption ambitions. Corruption is not inevitable,” said Flora Cresswell, regional adviser for Western Europe at Transparency International.

But “that's not what's happening. Europe tends to follow the United States’ lead,” Clouet said.

The degradation in the public's perception of corruption comes with serious consequences, he warned, causing disenchanted citizens "to abstain from politics" as well as driving "social anger, which can fuel illiberal political forces. In all cases, it's democracy that really loses out.”

A survey released on Monday by the Cevipof research institute found that just 22 percent of people in France say they have confidence in politics – a four percent drop on the previous year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 18:02:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/efd20604-f61d-11f0-ba0a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T161325Z-1705529737-RC245JA65JXM-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democrats introduce 'Virginia's law' named for Epstein accuser to end shield for sex traffickers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-democrats-introduce-virginia-law-named-epstein-accuser-end-shield-sex-traffickers</link><description>Congressional ​ Democrats introduced legislation on Tuesday that they said would eliminate the statute of limitations that has shielded sex ⁠traffickers such as the late financier Jeffrey Epstein .

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez announced the proposal alongside Epstein victims and Virginia Giuffre 's family. The proposal – Virginia's Law – is named after Giuffre, ​one of Epstein's most prominent accusers, who died by suicide last year .

The bill's fate ‍in the Senate and House of Representatives, which are both controlled by Republicans, is unclear.

However, a bipartisan effort was successful last ​year to compel the Department of Justice to release all unclassified files in its Epstein ​investigation .

"Virginia's dream was to inspire and empower survivors to come forward in a world that too often turns away from abuse and pushes it into the shadows. She wanted to bring light," said Sky Roberts, Giuffre's brother.

A teary-eyed Roberts, speaking at a press conference in the US Capitol, was asked about a photograph that has been made public showing former UK prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor with his arm around Giuffre.

"I think he should show up in front of ‍our Congress," Roberts responded, adding, "He has a lot of questions he needs to answer."

The Democrats' new bill would end the statute of ​limitations for adult victims or their survivors bringing civil suits, which would include many of Epstein's alleged victims. It broadens victims' legal recourse in additional ways, including covering applicable sex crimes occurring beyond US ‌soil if a US court has jurisdiction.

Though Epstein died in 2019, transparency and accountability for victims of his abuse have led to oversight investigations and passage of ‍the Epstein files law.

DOJ said it has released nearly 3.5 million pages of documents, though some files are heavily redacted. Members of Congress began reviewing unredacted files on Monday . Schumer has been calling for all the unreleased files, which he said number in the millions, to also be made public.

The House Oversight Committee interviewed Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell virtually on Monday in a private deposition.

The six photographs and three videos posted by FBI Director Kash Patel on his X account show an individual on a deserted doorstep in the dark, in eerie black-and-white imagery.

The person is described as an "armed individual".

Nancy Guthrie, mother of NBC News "Today" co-host Savannah Guthrie , is believed to have been kidnapped from her home in Tucson, Arizona, on the night of January 31 or in the early hours of February 1, sparking a massive hunt in a case that has gripped the country.

The images date to "the morning of her disappearance", Patel said on X, adding that authorities had worked to recover them from "residual data".

"As of this morning, law enforcement has uncovered these previously inaccessible new images showing an armed individual appearing to have tampered with the camera at Nancy Guthrie's front door the morning of her disappearance," Patel wrote.

White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt began a media briefing by saying she and President Donald Trump had just reviewed the newly released imagery.

"The president encourages any American across the country with any knowledge of the suspect to please call the FBI," she said.

Nancy Guthrie's family has received ransom letters with payment demands, the FBI has said.

Footage shows the individual approaching Guthrie's front door, head down, clad in long pants, a zip-up jacket, hat and gloves, and carrying a backpack.

The person's hands loom over the camera for several seconds before he or she turns, looking for something on the ground, then stepping outside the entryway and pulling up some plants.

Subsequent footage appears to show the person pushing the plants against the camera.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos last week stated that the doorbell camera outside Nancy Guthrie's home was disconnected at 1:47am on Sunday, February 1.

At 2:12am, "software detects a person on a camera, but there's no video available", he said.

Savannah Guthrie on Monday released the latest video appeal for public help in tracking down her ailing mother, who suffers from heart problems and needs regular medication.

"As we enter into another week of this nightmare ... thank you so much for all of the prayers and the love that we have felt," an emotional Guthrie said on Instagram .

"Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home, trying to find where she was taken, and we don't know where.

"We believe our mom is still out there. We need your help.

"If you see anything, you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you ... report to law enforcement. We are at an hour of desperation."

Nancy Guthrie's disappearance has garnered wall-to-wall coverage in US media , with dozens of reporters and camera crews descending on the quiet Arizona suburb where she lives.

Authorities said they believed the missing woman was still alive, and said blood discovered on her doorstep belonged to her.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 20:44:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f420aed6-06bc-11f1-85bd-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-10T190532Z-1364420265-RC27JJAYX6GK-RTRMADP-3-USA-CRIME-GUTHRIE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to repeal Obama-era basis for regulating greenhouse gas emissions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-us-to-repeal-legal-climate-regulations-tackling-greenhouse-gas-emissions</link><description>US President Donald Trump 's administration is set to finalise on Thursday its repeal of a foundational scientific determination that underpins the US government's authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .

The Environmental Protection Agency last summer proposed reversing the so-called Endangerment Finding of 2009, in what was seen as a major blow to climate action in the world's biggest historic contributor of planet-warming pollution.

"On Thursday, President Trump will be joined by Administrator Lee Zeldin to formalize the rescission of the 2009 Obama-era endangerment finding," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told a news briefing Tuesday.

"This will be the largest deregulatory action in American history, and it will save the American people $1.3 trillion in crushing regulation."

The finding under then-president Barack Obama concluded that six greenhouse gases – including carbon dioxide and methane – endanger public health and welfare by driving climate change .

That determination flowed from a 2007 Supreme Court decision, Massachusetts v. EPA, which ruled that greenhouse gases qualify as pollutants under the Clean Air Act and directed the EPA to determine whether they pose a danger to public health and welfare.

While the finding initially applied only to a section of the Clean Air Act governing vehicle emissions, it was later incorporated into other regulations.

As a result, repealing the determination would immediately be accompanied by revoking the requirement for federal greenhouse gas emissions standards for automobiles.

And it would place a broader suite of climate regulations in legal jeopardy, including limits on carbon dioxide from power plants and methane from oil and gas operations – a major boon to the fossil fuel sector.

The administration's draft proposal rests on both legal and scientific arguments.

Procedurally, it asserts that greenhouse gases should not be treated as pollutants in the traditional sense because their effects on human health are indirect and global rather than local.

Regulating them within US borders, it contends, cannot meaningfully resolve a worldwide problem.

On the scientific front, the administration has sought to downplay the scale and impacts of human-caused climate change.

It commissioned an Energy Department working group filled with skeptics of human-caused climate change to produce a report challenging the scientific consensus.

That report was widely criticised for mis-attribution and misstating the conclusions of the studies it cited. Environmental groups sued the Energy Department, alleging the panel was convened behind closed doors in violation of federal rules. Energy Secretary Chris Wright later disbanded the group.

The Trump administration has claimed that repealing the Endangerment Finding would lead to reduced new car costs, which have spiralled since the pandemic.

But the calculations have been challenged – an analysis by the EPA under the administration of Joe Biden concluded that the standards would save the average American driver an estimated $6,000 in reduced fuel and maintenance over the life of a vehicle.

Moreover, while the administration says the rules imposed more than $1 trillion in cumulative regulatory costs that were passed on as "hidden taxes ", it does not weigh those costs against the monetised benefits from climate protection, public health and fuel savings.

"The Trump EPA is cynically pretending climate change isn't a risk to Americans' health and welfare," said Meredith Hankins, federal climate legal director at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

"This is the biggest attack ever on federal authority to tackle the climate crisis, and a devastating blow to millions of Americans facing growing risks of unnatural disasters."

She added the legal arguments the administration has presented were "slaplash" and "should be laughed out of court", vowing to challenge the decision.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 20:44:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3f6db212-0695-11f1-846d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/198c99d0a54b6edb1cb8cec917c0c5c8cd952b48.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia's Petro says he survived assassination attempt</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-colombian-president-gustavo-petro-says-survived-assassination-attempt-this-week</link><description>Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Tuesday he had escaped an assassination attempt hours earlier, after months of warnings about an alleged plot by drug traffickers to target him.

On Monday night, Petro's helicopter was unable to land at his destination on the Caribbean coast because of fears that unspecified people "were going to shoot" at it, he said.

"We headed out to open sea for four hours and I arrived somewhere we weren't supposed to go, escaping from being killed," Petro said in a cabinet meeting that was broadcast live.

Petro's claim came amid a surge in violence months ahead of presidential elections , in a country marred by decades of conflict between guerrilla and other armed groups.

Petro, who is constitutionally barred from seeking a second term, has claimed that a drug-trafficking cabal has had its sights set on ending his life ever since assuming office in August 2022.

The alleged plot involves narco bosses and war lords such as Ivan Mordisco , who commands the largest group of dissidents who broke with the FARC guerrilla army after it agreed to disarm under a 2016 peace agreement.

Colombia has a long list of leftist leaders, including presidential candidates, assassinated over the years.

Petro, the South American country's first-ever leftist president, had reported another alleged attempt on his life in 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 21:42:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/466a8cf6-01dc-11f1-8914-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26034839890319.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gisele Pelicot publishes memoir of rape trial that shook France</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260210-gisele-pelicot-publishes-memoir-of-rape-trial-that-shook-france</link><description>Gisele Pelicot , the survivor of mass rapes organised by her husband at their home in southern France , has published her memoirs about the trial that turned her into an internationally celebrated figure in the movement to end violence against women.

Le Monde published some extracts of the original French on Tuesday.

Pelicot was drugged with tranquillisers for a decade by her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, then raped by him and dozens of men he recruited online.

In the 2024 trial in Avignon that garnered global attention, she declined the option to hold it behind closed doors, saying she wanted the world to know what she had been subjected to.

“When I think back to the moment I made my decision, I realise that if I had been 20 years younger, I might not have dared to refuse a closed session,” she wrote in her first-person account, titled "A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides" in English and "Et la joie de vivre" in the original French.

The book, written with journalist and novelist Judith Perrignon, will be published by Flammarion on February 17, in a worldwide release in 22 languages.

“I would have been afraid of the stares, those damned stares that a woman of my generation has always had to deal with,” she explained in an excerpt published by the newspaper.

“Perhaps shame fades all the more easily when you’re 70, and no one pays attention to you any more. I don’t know. I wasn’t afraid of my wrinkles, or my body,” she confided.

In the nearly four-month trial, 51 men, including her husband, were convicted .

Her courageous decision to lift the closed-door proceedings and her dignity during the hearing contributed to making Gisele Pelicot a leading figure in the fight against violence against women .

The book chronicles her “vague feelings” before the trial: “The closer it got, the more I imagined myself becoming a hostage to their stares, their lies, their cowardice, and their contempt,” she wrote. “Wasn’t I protecting them by closing the door?”

Her book also recounts her disbelief when police first showed her photos of the rapes taken by her husband.

“I didn’t recognise the men. Or this woman. Her cheek was so flabby. Her mouth so limp. She was like a rag doll.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 22:40:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cec7aa2c-f541-11f0-a335-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25030386341588.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU lawmakers back tougher asylum rules allowing fast-track rejections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260210-eu-lawmakers-back-tougher-asylum-rules-allowing-fast-track-rejections</link><description>EU lawmakers approved changes to the European Union asylum system on Tuesday, paving the way for fast-track asylum rejections and the possible transfer of asylum seekers to countries with which they have little or no connection.

The move underlines the rise in anti-immigration sentiment across the European Union over the past decade that has broadened popular support for far-right parties.

The text, which requires final formal approval from the 27 EU member governments, marks a sharp hardening of EU migration policy that has taken shape since an influx of over a million refugees and migrants in 2015–16.

The move drew heavy criticism from humanitarian groups, who said it could lead to human rights violations and a diminution of asylum rights under a 1951 convention that prohibits returns of asylum seekers to countries where they could be in danger.

The European Parliament approved changes to the Asylum Procedures Regulation to introduce a list of countries deemed “safe” to which failed asylum seekers could be returned. The list includes countries such as Egypt and Tunisia whose human rights records have come under scrutiny.

Under the new rules, EU countries may reject an asylum application if the person could have received protection in a country the bloc considers safe.

“Today’s vote will mean that people seeking asylum in the EU could have their applications rejected without review, and be sent to countries to which they have no connection and where they have never even set foot,” said Olivia Sundberg Diez, the EU advocate on migration and asylum at Amnesty International .

“These measures mark an abdication of the EU’s commitment to refugee protection and pave the way for EU member states to broker agreements with third countries for the offshore processing of asylum claims,” she said in a statement.

The new rules move a step closer towards allowing EU countries to set up “return hubs” outside the EU, similar to those established by Italy in Albania , although specific rules on return regulations are still under discussion in parliament.

The changes stem from an EU set of rules and processes for handling migration known as the Migration Pact, approved in 2023 but not due to be fully implemented until June 2026.

Anti-immigration rhetoric has surged throughout the EU since more than a million people, mainly from Syria , arrived via the Mediterranean in 2015. That sentiment has boosted public support for right-wing nationalist parties, pushing governments to adopt increasingly restrictive migration policies focused on returns.

“The text on safe countries of origin will place hundreds of thousands of people in situations of great danger. Third countries will be deemed safe despite an extremely worrying human rights situation,” said French Green lawmaker Mélissa Camara.</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 23:38:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dc6a5100-f61a-11f0-a27a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T122332Z-1577463871-RC2Z4JAKN9KP-RTRMADP-3-EU-PARLIAMENT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelan opposition ally placed under house arrest hours after release</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260211-venezuelan-opposition-ally-placed-under-house-arrest-hours-after-release</link><description>A close ally of Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was placed under house arrest Tuesday, detained just hours after his release from prison along with other dissidents jailed under ousted leader Nicolas Maduro .

Juan Pablo Guanipa, a former National Assembly vice president, walked out of jail on Sunday after spending more than eight months behind bars on vague charges often levelled against government critics, including “terrorism,” money laundering and inciting violence.

The 61-year-old was released with other political prisoners under a promise made by interim leader Delcy Rodriguez , who filled Maduro’s shoes after his toppling in a deadly US military raid in January.

During his few hours of freedom, Guanipa met relatives of other political prisoners, toured Caracas in a motorcycle caravan, shouted slogans outside the feared Helicoide prison, and demanded new elections.

After he was taken back into custody, prosecutors said Guanipa had violated his parole conditions.

The news sparked an outcry, with Machado claiming he had been “kidnapped,” and a US congresswoman warning of “grave consequences” if anything happened to him.

On Tuesday, the former lawmaker’s son Ramon wrote on X that his father was placed under house arrest in Maracaibo, in Venezuela’s northwest, and thanked the United States “for its efforts in support of freedom in Venezuela.”

“My father remains unjustly imprisoned, because house arrest is still imprisonment, and we demand his full freedom and that of all political prisoners ,” the younger Guanipa wrote.

Guanipa’s re-arrest sent a chilling message to those pushing for democratic reforms, and for Machado, who is pondering a return to her homeland from exile in the United States.

It came as Venezuela’s parliament is set to vote on an amnesty for political prisoners and those who put them behind bars during 27 years under Maduro and his predecessor, Hugo Chavez .

Rodriguez, who had served as Maduro’s vice president before taking his place, has been working with the United States, including granting access to Venezuela’s vast oil reserves , and freeing political detainees.

But the releases have not been quick or widespread enough, according to loved ones of hundreds of dissidents and critics still behind bars.

On Tuesday, about 40 relatives of political prisoners protested outside the National Assembly building to demand the amnesty bill be passed without delay.

“Amnesty now!” they chanted as riot police looked on. “Not one a criminal, they are all innocent,” shouted others.

Postponed from Tuesday, the unicameral parliament is scheduled to meet again Thursday, though it was not clear if the bill was on the agenda.

According to Andreina Baduel, head of the Committee for the Freedom of Political Prisoners (Clippve), the postponement of Tuesday’s sitting only served to “prolong the victims’ pain.”

She herself is the daughter of a former defence minister who died in prison in 2021, and the sister of another political prisoner held for “ terrorism .”

“The bill does not ensure that there will be justice,” Baduel said on Tuesday.

“State terrorism persists in Venezuela ,” she added, referring to Guanipa’s re-arrest.

By Monday, 426 people had been freed since prison releases began after Maduro’s toppling, according to the NGO Foro Penal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 02:25:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/252eae12-06a2-11f1-a2e9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-08T225647Z-1428678995-RC2YHJAIDZCQ-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-PRISONERS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Commerce Secretary admits Epstein island lunch as pressure mounts to resign</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-us-commerce-secretary-admits-epstein-island-lunch</link><description>Facing growing calls for his resignation, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick admitted Tuesday to having lunch on Jeffrey Epstein ’s private island in 2012, but strenuously denied any closer relationship with the convicted sex offender .

Lutnick’s ties to Epstein have come under intense scrutiny after email exchanges included in newly released files undermined his earlier insistence that he had cut all links with the late financier back in 2005.

So far, President Donald Trump ’s administration has stood by Lutnick, with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt saying the president “fully supports” him.

She added that he “remains a very important member” of Trump’s team.

Epstein, a convicted sex offender who had ties to top business executives, politicians, celebrities and academics, was found dead in his New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking minor girls.

In a podcast last year, Lutnick recounted moving in next door to Epstein in 2005 and receiving a house tour that left him disturbed. He and his wife decided that he would “never be in the room with that disgusting person, ever again”.

“So I was never in the room with him socially, for business or even philanthropy,” he said.

But records have emerged showing Lutnick’s plans in 2012 to meet Epstein for lunch in Little Saint James, notoriously known as “Epstein Island”.

“We had lunch on the island, that is true, for an hour,” Lutnick told a Senate committee hearing.

But he stressed that he was with his wife, children and nannies.

“We were on family vacation,” he said.

Asked if he saw anything untoward, Lutnick maintained that besides his family and that of another couple who were present, he only saw staff who worked for Epstein on the island.

High-profile people have come under scrutiny for visits to Little Saint James, the private redoubt in the US Virgin Islands where prosecutors alleged Epstein trafficked underage girls for sex.

Lutnick stressed to the Senate Appropriations Committee on Tuesday: “Over a 14-year period, I did not have any relationship with him. I barely had anything to do with that person.”

The billionaire was referring to the period starting in 2005 when he moved to a New York home where Epstein was his neighbour. He said that he met Epstein when they were both in New York.

He has come under fire from US lawmakers , however.

Democratic Senator Adam Schiff said Monday that “Lutnick has no business being our Commerce Secretary, and he should resign immediately”.

He added that Lutnick’s earlier denial of dealings with Epstein raises “serious concerns about his judgement and ethics”.

On Sunday, Republican lawmaker Thomas Massie also told CNN the commerce secretary “should just resign”, citing similar resignations in Great Britain .

And Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee, charged in a social media post that Lutnick “has been lying about his relationship with Epstein”.

“He said he had no interactions with Epstein after 2005, yet we now know they were in business together,” Garcia said.

Released documents indicated the men had become investors in a firm some time after the island visit, although it is unclear if they personally engaged over the deal. They also appear to have communicated through assistants on other occasions.

Lutnick denied Tuesday that he had dinner in Epstein’s New York City home in 2011, although he acknowledged that the documents indicated a planned meeting with Epstein in May that year.

The commerce chief was also questioned about documents that suggested Epstein had an interest in meeting his nanny, but said this “had nothing to do with me”.

“I have nothing to hide, absolutely nothing,” Lutnick said.

Lutnick – a close ally of Trump’s – served as chief executive of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald before becoming US commerce secretary last year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 02:25:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/69af0c08-c999-11f0-ab9f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-11-24T143709Z-360671371-RC223IA6XZWN-RTRMADP-3-EU-TRADE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>School shooting in British Columbia leaves 10 dead and dozens injured</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260211-school-shooting-in-british-columbia-leaves-10-dead-and-dozens-injured</link><description>A shooting at a school in British Columbia left eight dead, including the suspect, with two more people found dead at a home believed to be connected to the incident, Canadian authorities said Tuesday.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said more than 25 people were injured, including two with life‑threatening injuries, after the shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School.

RCMP Superintendent Ken Floyd told reporters that investigators had identified the shooter but would not release a name, and that the suspect's motive remained unclear.

“We are not in a place to understand why or what may have motivated this tragedy,” Floyd said.

He added that police are still investigating how the victims are connected to the shooter.

School shootings are rare in Canada .

The town of Tumbler Ridge, which has a population of about 2,400 people, is more than 1,000 kilometres (600 miles) north of Vancouver, near the border with Alberta.

“As part of the initial response to the active shooting, police entered the school to locate the threat. During the search, officers located multiple victims. An individual believed to be the shooter was also found deceased with what appears to be a self‑inflicted injury,” the RCMP said in a statement.

“Six additional individuals, not including the suspect, have been located deceased inside the school. Two victims have been airlifted to hospital with serious or life‑threatening injuries. A third victim died while being transported to hospital.”

The Peace River South School District said earlier Tuesday that there was a “lockdown and secure and hold” at both the secondary school and Tumbler Ridge Elementary School.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said he was "devastated" by the "horrific" shooting. "My prayers and deepest condolences are with the families and friends who have lost loved ones to these horrific acts of violence," Carney said in a social media post.

Larry Neufeld, the member of the legislature for Peace River South, told reporters at the legislature that an “excess” of resources, including RCMP and ambulance support, had been sent to the community.

He said he did not want to release any more information over concerns that it might jeopardise the safety of the ongoing operation.

Israel's President Isaac Herzog said he hoped talks between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump in Washington later in the day would help fight what he called Iran's "empire of evil".

Speaking beside Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in Canberra, Herzog wished them "success in bringing peace" as well as discussing "the next phase in Gaza which is important to all of us, which I hope will bring a better future for all of us".

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to push US President Donald Trump to take a tougher stance in ongoing nuclear talks with Iran in a meeting in Washington.

Trump said on the eve of the hastily arranged White House meeting – set to begin at 11am local time (1600 GMT) – that he was weighing sending a second US "armada" to the Middle East to pressure Tehran to reach a nuclear deal.

But Netanyahu, making his sixth visit to the United States since Trump took office, will also be urging the US leader to take a harder line on Iran's ballistic missile programme.

Netanyahu said as he left for Washington his talks would "first and foremost" be about the Iran negotiations, while adding that they would also discuss Gaza and other regional issues.

"I will present to the president our views regarding the principles for the negotiations," he said in a video statement. Netanyahu's office said he would highlight Iran's missile arsenal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 07:35:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/86496c7e-06fb-11f1-b162-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028570925534.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Person detained for questioning in Nancy Guthrie's kidnapping, police say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260211-person-detained-for-questioning-in-nancy-guthrie-s-kidnapping-police-say</link><description>A person was detained for questioning Tuesday in the kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie, hours after the FBI released surveillance videos of a masked person wearing a handgun holster outside Guthrie’s front door the night she vanished from her Arizona home.

Deputies detained the person during a traffic stop south of Tucson, according to the Pima County Sheriff’s Department.

The department and the FBI were conducting a court-authorised search Tuesday night at a location in Rio Rico, about an hour’s drive south of Tucson, the department said in a statement. It was expected to take several hours.

The department did not immediately provide details about the person or the location. The FBI referred questions to the sheriff's office.

Guthrie disappeared on February 1 and since then the case has gripped the nation. Until Tuesday, it seemed authorities were making little headway in determining what happened to the 84-year-old mother of “Today” show host Savannah Guthrie or finding who was responsible.

Savannah Guthrie and her two siblings have released a series of video statements pleading for the return of their mother and indicating a willingness to pay a ransom. Authorities have described Nancy Guthrie as mentally sound but with limited mobility. She takes several medications and there was concern from the start that she could die without them, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos has said repeatedly.

The community of Rio Rico – population 20,000 – is roughly an hour's drive from Guthrie's home and about 24 kilometres north of the US-Mexico border.

The videos released earlier Tuesday show a person wearing a ski mask and a backpack. At one point, they tilt their head down and away from a doorbell camera while approaching Guthrie's front door. The footage also shows the person holding a flashlight in their mouth and trying to cover the camera with a gloved hand and part of a plant ripped from the yard.

The videos – less than a combined minute in length – gave investigators and the public their first glimpse of who was outside Guthrie's home in the foothills outside Tucson. But the images did not show what happened to her or help determine whether she is still alive.

FBI Director Kash Patel said the “armed individual” appeared to "have tampered with the camera". It was not entirely clear whether there was a gun in the holster.

The videos were pulled from data on "back-end systems” after investigators spent days trying to find lost, corrupted or inaccessible images, Patel said.

“This will get the phone ringing for lots of potential leads,” said former FBI agent Katherine Schweit. “Even when you have a person who appears to be completely covered, they’re really not. You can see their girth, the shape of their face, potentially their eyes or mouth.”

Tuesday afternoon, authorities were back near Guthrie’s neighbourhood, using vehicles to block her driveway. A few miles away, law enforcement was going door-to-door in the area where daughter Annie Guthrie lives, talking with neighbours as well as walking through a drainage area and examining the inside of a culvert with a flashlight.

Investigators have said for more than a week that they believe Nancy Guthrie was taken against her will. She was last seen at home January 31 and reported missing the next day. DNA tests showed blood on her porch was hers, authorities said.

Until now, authorities have released few details, leaving it unclear if ransom notes demanding money with deadlines already passed were authentic, and whether the Guthrie family has had any contact with whoever took Guthrie.

Savannah Guthrie posted the new surveillance images on social media Tuesday, saying the family believes their mother is still alive and offering phone numbers for the FBI and county sheriff. Within minutes, the post had thousands of comments.

Investigators had hoped cameras would turn up evidence right away about how Nancy Guthrie disappeared from her home in an secluded neighbourhood.

But the doorbell camera was disconnected early on February 1. While software recorded movement at the home minutes later, Guthrie did not have an active subscription, so Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos had initially said none of the footage could be recovered. Officials continued working to get the footage.

Heartbreaking messages by Savannah Guthrie and her family shifted from hopeful to bleak as they made pleas for whoever took Nancy Guthrie. In a video just ahead of a purported ransom deadline Monday, Savannah Guthrie appeared alone and spoke directly to the public.

“We are at an hour of desperation,” she said. “We need your help.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 08:50:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d5c268e4-071b-11f1-90cc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26042252165960.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britney Spears sells rights to her music catalog for some $200 million, US media reports</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260210-britney-spears-sells-rights-to-her-music-catalog-for-some-200-million-us-media-reports</link><description>US singer Britney Spears has become the latest musician to sell the rights to her catalog that includes hits like "...Baby One More Time" and "Oops!...I Did It Again," US media reported Tuesday.

The deal is believed to be worth around $200 million, according to sources cited by celebrity site TMZ, though it said the exact amount is not detailed in legal documents.

That sum would be comparable to the sale of Canadian singer Justin Bieber's catalog in 2023.

Spears, 44, joins a growing list of artists who have sold their music rights in recent years including Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan , as well as Shakira and KISS.

US media reported that the rights were bought by music publisher Primary Wave, whose portfolio includes the works of Whitney Houston, Bob Marley, Prince and others.

Owners of a song's publishing rights receive payment for every broadcast, album sale or use in advertising and films.

The growing music rights market allows artists to monetise their catalogs, which are attractive long-term assets for investors in the streaming era.

Major labels like Sony, Universal and Warner have also expanded in this line of business, alongside specialist investors Recognition Music Group and Concord Music Publishing.

Spears shot to fame in the late 1990s but has largely stepped back from the music scene in recent years.

In 2021, a US court terminated a 13-year conservatorship that had allowed Spears's father to control her finances – an arrangement the singer had described as abusive.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 09:54:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/50ecd374-06d1-11f1-83c7-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/20749ca1effeda63497d09cd5ef4d0a39978e8ab.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France demands investigation into diplomat cited in Epstein files</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260211-france-demands-investigation-into-diplomat-cited-in-epstein-files</link><description>France 's Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot has requested a probe after the name of a French diplomat on leave appeared in numerous emails to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

"I was appalled," Barrot said on Wednesday.

In an X post late on Tuesday, he said he was referring allegations against Fabrice Aidan to the public prosecutor, and launching an internal inquiry.

The ministry described Aidan as a "principal foreign affairs secretary on leave for personal reasons and holding positions in the private sector".

A mere mention in released files from the investigation into the disgraced New York financier, who died in prison in 2019 while charged with sex trafficking underage girls, does not imply wrongdoing.

But French media, after unearthing his name in the files, reported he had shared email correspondence with Epstein from 2010 to 2017.

Investigative website Mediapart late Tuesday reported that the FBI had flagged Aidan as having consulted child sexual abuse websites while he was working at the New York-based United Nations from 2006 and 2013, leading to an internal probe and his resignation.

Aidan was during that time adviser to Norway 's Terje Rod-Larsen, an adviser to the UN secretary general. Norwegian police said on Monday they were investigating Rod-Larsen over his ties to Epstein.

Mediapart also reported that Aidan sent UN documents and reports to Epstein.

Aidan could not be immediately contacted for comment. He appeared to have deleted his Linkedin professional networking profile as of Wednesday morning.

After the UN headquarters in New York , Aidan then went on to work for the UN cultural agency UNESCO .

Energy group Engie, for whom he had been working more recently, told AFP it had let him go.

"In light of the information brought to our attention and reported in certain media, which would concern a period prior to his joining the group, Engie has decided to relieve Fabrice Aidan from his duties," it said.

The fallout of the latest Epstein files released by the US Department of Justice has led to former minister Jack Lang resigning from his position as the head of a top cultural body called the Arab World Institute.

He has however denied any wrongdoing, saying he was "shocked" that his name appeared in the statutes of an offshore company that Epstein founded in 2016.

His daughter Caroline, who allegedly owned half the shares in the company, has resigned from two positions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 13:11:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/35e1af82-fdfd-11f0-a704-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EPSTEIN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran will not give in to ‘excessive’ US demands in resumed talks, president says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260211-iran-will-not-give-excessive-us-demands-resumed-nuclear-programme-talks-ballistic-missile-president</link><description>Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Wednesday that his country would “not yield to excessive demands” on its nuclear programme , after Tehran resumed talks with the United States .

He also said Iran was ready for “any verification” of its nuclear programme and insisted it was not seeking an atomic weapon.

Iran and the United States resumed negotiations last week for the first time since the war with Israel last June that saw the US conduct strikes on nuclear sites in Iran.

“Our Iran will not yield in the face of aggression, but we are continuing dialogue with all our strength with neighbouring countries in order to establish peace and tranquility in the region,” Pezeshkian said.

He was speaking at Azadi Square in the capital Tehran to mark the 47th anniversary of Iran’s Islamic revolution.

“Our country, Iran, will not yield to their excessive demands,” he added.

Iran wants the talks to remain centred purely on its nuclear programme, while the United States also wants the Islamic republic’s ballistic missile programme and its support for militant groups in the region to be discussed.

Iran insists its nuclear programme is peaceful, though Western countries and Israel believe it is seeking to acquire a nuclear weapon.

Every year, supporters of Iran’s leadership turn out in force to mark the anniversary of the revolution that ousted the US-backed shah in 1979.

At Azadi Square on Wednesday, an AFP correspondent saw a large security presence, bigger than in previous years.

Veiled women waved the flag of the Islamic republic and carried pictures of Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

The Federal Aviation Administration said in a social media post that it has lifted the temporary closure of the airspace over El Paso, saying there was no threat to commercial aviation and that all flights will resume.

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said in a post on X that the FAA and the Defense Department “acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion. The threat has been neutralised and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.”

He said normal flights were resuming Wednesday morning.

He did not say how many drones were involved or what specifically was done to disable them.

The shutdown announced just hours earlier “for special security reasons” had been expected to create significant disruptions given the duration and the size of the metropolitan area.

El Paso, a border city with a population of nearly 700,000 people and larger when you include the surrounding metro area, is hub of cross-border commerce alongside the neighboring city of Ciudad Juarez in Mexico. The brief closure does not include Mexican airspace.

The airport said in an Instagram post after the closure was announced that all flights to and from the airport would be grounded from late Tuesday through late on February 20, including commercial, cargo and general aviation flights. It suggested travellers contact their airlines to get up-to-date flight information.

Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat whose district includes El Paso, had urged the FAA to lift the restrictions in a statement Wednesday morning. There was no advance notice given to her office, the city of El Paso or airport operations, she said.

“The highly consequential decision by FAA to shut down the El Paso Airport for 10 days is unprecedented and has resulted in significant concern within the community,” Escobar said. “From what my office and I have been able to gather overnight and early this morning there is no immediate threat to the community or surrounding areas.”

Mexican ​President Claudia Sheinbaum told her regular morning press conference she had “no information” of drones having been ​used ‌on the ⁠border with the US.

The airport describes itself as the gateway to west Texas, southern New Mexico and northern Mexico. Southwest, United, American and Delta all operate flights there, among others.

A similar temporary flight restriction for special security reasons over the same time period was imposed around Santa Teresa, New Mexico, which is about 24 kilometers northwest of the El Paso airport.

Southwest Airlines said in a statement that it has paused all operations to and from El Paso at the direction of the FAA.

“We have notified affected customers and will share additional information as it becomes available,” Southwest Airlines said. “Nothing is more important to Southwest than the safety of its customers and employees.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:33:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/add44538-075b-11f1-b8fe-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-11T143440Z-1527359830-RC2JJJAD8KV6-RTRMADP-3-USA-TEXAS-AIRSPACE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cyclone Gezani ravages Madagascar, leaving at least 20 dead and much of second city in ruins</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260211-at-least-20-dead-as-cyclone-gezani-ravages-madagascar-much-of-second-city-in-ruins</link><description>A cyclone packing violent winds killed at least 20 people as it struck Madagascar , toppling houses and causing major flooding, the Indian Ocean island's disaster authority said Wednesday.

Cyclone Gezani made landfall on Tuesday, slamming into the country's second-largest city, Toamasina, with winds reaching 250 kilometres per hour.

The National Office for Risk and Disaster Management (BNRGC) said it had recorded 20 deaths, many after houses had collapsed.

Fifteen people were missing and at least 33 had been hurt, it said, updating earlier tolls.

"What happened is a disaster: nearly 75 percent of the city of Toamasina was destroyed," said the country's new leader, Colonel Michael Randrianirina , who had travelled to Toamasina ahead of the cyclone's landfall to support residents.

"The current situation exceeds Madagascar's capabilities alone," said Randrianirina, who seized power in October, calling on "international partners and donors" to support the impoverished island.

Drone footage shared by the BNRGC on social media showed major flooding in the east coast city of 400,000 people, about 220km northeast of the capital Antananarivo, with residents wading through water and roofs ripped off buildings.

The city appeared battered, its streets littered with trees uprooted by the force of the cyclone.

The storm had also caused carnage in the Atsinanana region surrounding the city, the authority said, adding that post-disaster assessments were still underway.

"It's total chaos: 90 percent of house roofs have been blown off, entirely or in part," said the head of disaster management at the Action Against Hunger humanitarian group, Rija Randrianarisoa.

"The roads are completely inaccessible because of trees on the ground, sheet metal," he said.

The CMRS cyclone forecaster on France's Reunion island confirmed Tuesday that Toamasina had been "directly hit by the most intense part" of the storm.

The cyclone's landfall was likely one of the most intense recorded in the region during the satellite era, rivalling Geralda in February 1994, it said. That storm left at least 200 dead and affected half a million more.

A Toamasina resident told AFP by telephone late Tuesday that the winds had collapsed solid walls. "It's monstrous," the resident added.

Commercial flights to Toamasina airport were suspended except for humanitarian and military flights, airport management said.

Fifteen members of the army's civil protection unit were dispatched to assist with rescue operations, authorities announced.

The cyclone weakened after landfall but continued to sweep across the island, posing the risk of flooding despite being downgraded to a tropical storm.

It is forecast to return to cyclone status as it reaches the Mozambique Channel, according to the CMRS, and could from Friday evening strike southern Mozambique , which has already faced devastating flooding since the beginning of the year.

Besides Geralda in 1994, Cyclone Gretelle, which killed 152 people and displaced 60,000 in 1997, and Gafilo, which left 241 dead and affected more than 300,000 others, have also been particularly deadly.

More than 70 percent of houses in Madagascar are built from precarious materials such as clay, branches or foliage, according to the national statistical institute.

Cyclone season in the southwest Indian Ocean typically lasts from November to April and sees around a dozen storms each year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 17:33:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/81891a20-0761-11f1-a752-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/4fc9d98bb7d9c2856465379d28ebded2790c8c5e.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris appeals court sets verdict in far-right leader Le Pen’s graft case for July 7</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260211-verdict-for-french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-s-appeals-trial-expected-on-july-7</link><description>A Paris appeals court said Wednesday it will rule on July 7 in a fraud case against far-right leader Marine Le Pen , in what is expected to be a pivotal moment for French politics .

A lower court last year handed the 57-year-old veteran politician a five-year ban from public office over a fake jobs scam at the European parliament, dashing her presidential ambitions.

If the appeals court upholds last year’s bombshell ruling, the three-time presidential candidate would be banned from running in 2027, widely seen as her best chance at the top job.

At the end of Wednesday’s proceedings, the court’s president said it will deliver the ruling on July 7 in the early afternoon.

“The sooner, the better, I feel,” Le Pen told reporters after the hearing.

Le Pen made it to the second round in the 2017 and 2022 presidential polls, losing to President Emmanuel Macron both times. But he cannot run again next year after hitting the limit of two consecutive terms in office.

Le Pen has said she will decide whether to run for president after the ruling in the appeal trial, and has indicated that her lieutenant -- 30-year-old Jordan Bardella , who heads her National Rally (RN) party—could be the selected candidate instead.

A poll in November predicted that, should he run, Bardella would win the second round of the 2027 elections, no matter who stands against him.

Prosecutors last week demanded the court maintain a five-year ban and a four-year prison term with three years suspended for Le Pen in the case against her and other members of her anti-immigration RN party.

She had in the first trial received a four-year prison sentence, with two years suspended.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 19:04:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/184035f0-076e-11f1-a5d4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96Z27FU.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine will not hold elections until a ceasefire is in place, Zelensky says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260211-ukraine-elections-only-after-ceasefire-in-place-zelensky-says</link><description>Ukraine will only hold elections once it has security guarantees in place and a ceasefire with Russia , President Volodymyr Zelensky said Wednesday, pushing back at suggestions he was planning to stage fresh ballots under US pressure.

Elections in Ukraine have been effectively suspended since Russia invaded in 2022 due to martial law .

"We will move to elections when all the necessary security guarantees are in place," Zelensky told reporters, including AFP journalists, in a voice note.

"I have said it's very simple to do: establish a ceasefire, and there will be elections," he added.

If Russia also agrees, it may be possible to "end hostilities by summer", Zelensky said.

The Financial Times reported earlier that Ukraine was mulling the possibility of holding a presidential election within the next three months, after facing pressure from Washington.

Zelensky has repeatedly said Ukraine can hold elections after a peace deal with Russia is signed, but has recently signalled willingness for a speedy vote as part of a US plan to end the war.

He has also said any deal that involves ceding territory to Moscow should be put to a referendum .

Zelensky, a former comedian who played a fictionalised president on Ukrainian TV before running for office, was elected in 2019 for a five-year term.

Russia has repeatedly tried to question Zelensky's legitimacy post-2024, when that term would have expired.

There are a number of practical obstacles to holding a ballot, such as security during any campaign and vote, and what to do with the millions of Ukrainian refugees forced abroad.

Millions more have been displaced internally, while hundreds of thousands are living under Russian occupation or fighting at the front.

Polling shows little appetite among the Ukrainian public for a ballot during the war.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 20:02:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/217fa278-02a9-11f1-926e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/8674fbfbebf87bf42d1aa195c8d0cceba1c9188f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian Kurdish fighter's selfie video leads to allegations of massacre</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260211-syrian-kurdish-fighter-selfie-video-leads-allegations-massacre</link><description>Warning: readers may be disturbed by the content of this article.

The chilling video was posted on Facebook on January 22 by an account based in Germany which has since been shut down. The video is filmed by a man who appears to be part of the majority-Kurdish group the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), posing selfie-style in front of a row of bodies on the ground. He’s smiling broadly and has a rifle slung over his arm.

In the video, he claims that one of the fighters with the SDF – who are thought to have committed this massacre –  joked that they should blow the bodies up. A second video shows bullets being fired at the bodies, though it is unclear who is shooting.

This footage documents a massacre that took place on January 22 near Kobane in northwestern Syria . A local Facebook group Radar Sarine reported that the SDF had carried out extrajudicial killings of at least 21 young men. The SDF had allegedly just released the victims from Yeddi Qawi Prison near Kobane.

The massacre documented in the video took place against a complicated backdrop. January 2026 saw significant numbers of SDF forces retreating from the Syrian cities of Deir ez-Zor and Raqqa towards Kobane. On January 19, clashes broke out between these fighters and the Syrian Army near the Tishrin Dam south of Kobane.

Sometime after that, in circumstances that are still unclear, doors were opened at Yeddi Qawi, a prison located south of Kobane, resulting in the flight of many of the people who had been imprisoned there. Sometime after that, the massacre documented in the video posted online on January 22 took place.

A Facebook page dedicated to local news reported that members of the Syrian Civil Defence had recovered the bodies of 15 victims of a massacre they said took place near Kobane and handed them over to local authorities. The bodies were then transferred to Manbij National Hospital, where the families could collect them.

Mukhtar (not his real name) says he was incarcerated in the prison in the village of Yeddi Qawi. He shared with us a copy of the documents he received upon leaving the prison which were issued by the Kurdish Autonomous Administration, confirming that he was imprisoned in Yeddi Qawi.

According to Mukhtar, the massacre and the events leading up to it took place between January 19 and 22, 2026.

He describes the prison where he was being held as overcrowded, with hundreds of men being held. He says a majority of the prisoners there were Arab, with a small Kurdish minority.

"They were speaking to us about a general amnesty. But only the Kurdish detainees were being released. About a hundred of them. Meanwhile, they were telling us Arabs, ‘Your turn will come.’ Many believed it.”

The situation became increasingly tense and, on January 21, prisoners started burning sheets, mattresses and beds. There was smoke everywhere.

"We were choking. People were screaming. At one point, the SDF opened the doors. Not to let us out but to keep everyone inside from dying. I would say that between 300 and 400 prisoners, including me, left the prison and headed into the nearby fields. From there, we separated and dispersed. Some of us headed in the direction of Sarrin, and others – maybe about 30 people – headed towards Kobane."

Mukhtar says that when the fleeing prisoners had made it about 1.5km from the prison, they were intercepted by several vehicles carrying SDF fighters. Mukhtar then went on to describe extrajudicial killings that occurred before those documented in the video.

"They begin by firing shots in the air. People were running in every direction. Then, they started shooting at us. I saw men fall in front of me. They were carrying nothing – no weapons, not even cell phones.

They fell right in front of me. Four or five people died immediately, while others were injured. Everyone was panicking. I managed to hide in a field, but was later stopped at an SDF roadblock. They tied my hands and made all of us survivors lie face down on the asphalt. Some of the soldiers wanted to execute us then and there."

Mukhtar says that some of the female SDF soldiers intervened on their behalf and dissuaded the men from executing his group. He and his group were taken back to Yaddi Mawa prison. Others seem to have been sent elsewhere.

"I was finally released again on the evening of January 22, 2026. After we were released, I headed towards Ain al-Arab [also known as Kobane] while another group of about 27 people went towards the Sarrin region.

Members of the Autonomous Administration [Editor’s note: the civilian branch of the SDF] had them get into vehicles. They were going to drive them to the last point under Kurdish control before reaching territory under the control of the Syrian regime.

Most of those in the group of 27 people were killed. I was at a checkpoint at the south entrance to Kobane when I heard the news. I saw some of the injured people arrive. I recognised some of the people in the video.

These murders weren’t to prevent people from escaping. It was revenge and ethnic discrimination. The soldiers were insulting the victims and saying to the prisoners, 'In any case, you’ll die.'

I survived along with four other people. We made it to a service station alongside the road, and the owner let us in and gave us shelter. Three days later, he brought us to an area outside of Kurdish control."

Mukhtar thinks that between 40 and 45 people were executed on January 22.

“The number is much higher than the 21 bodies that you can see in the video because there were other executions elsewhere,” he explained.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said that the images were authentic , though they claimed that the bodies were those of armed fighters killed during clashes. Our Observer’s account casts doubt on this claim, as do the videos themselves. The bodies are lined up neatly, and there are no weapons to be seen. They are also all wearing civilian clothing.

Adnan Al-Hussein, a journalist based in the region, says that the videos provide evidence.

"Everything in the video indicates that the area has been secured. If there had been fighting, we would see the remnants. Here, you see men who have been gathered here, restrained and killed.”

Mukhtar says that speaking out comes with risks.

"I hesitated. But if I remain silent, then they die a second time. I am not asking for international justice. I’m asking for the truth to be spoken. I am telling my story for those who died.”

People in Manbij are still working to identify the bodies. However, the number of casualties remains unknown.

Tributes to two young men thought to have been killed in the massacre were published on the Radar Sarin Facebook page. One man, Ismail Al-Hassani, known as Abu Halab, was from the village of Al-Qubba. The second, Abbas Muhammad Al-Hussein, was from the village of Al-Abdkliya in Sarin district. Our Observer also spoke of the death of these two men.

Netanyahu spent nearly three hours at the White House , but entered and left out of view of reporters and neither he nor Trump took any questions.

Afterward, Trump took to his social media platform, describing it as “a very good meeting”, but that “there was nothing definitive reached, other than I insisted that negotiations with Iran continue to see whether or not a Deal can be consummated”.

“If it can, I let the prime minister know that will be a preference,” Trump wrote. “If it cannot, we will just have to see what the outcome will be.”

He added, “Last time Iran decided that they were better off not making a Deal” and were hit by US air strikes .

“Hopefully this time they will be more reasonable and responsible,” he wrote.

In a statement, Netanyahu’s office said the two leaders had discussed negotiations with Iran as well as developments in Gaza and around the region and they had “agreed to continue their close coordination and relationship”.

The meeting was their seventh during Trump’s second term and took place as both the US and Iran are projecting cautious optimism after holding indirect talks in Oman on Friday about how, once again, to approach negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme.

Prior to the meeting, Netanyahu’s office said that he wants the US-Iran talks to include limits on Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and its support for militant groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah .

“I will present to the president our outlook regarding the principles of these negotiations – the essential principles which, in my opinion, are important not only to Israel, but to everyone around the world who wants peace and security in the Middle East ,” Netanyahu said Tuesday before leaving Israel.

But it remains unclear how much influence Netanyahu will have over Trump’s approach toward Iran. Trump initially threatened to take military action over Iran’s bloody crackdown on nationwide protests in January, then shifted to a pressure campaign in recent weeks to try to get Tehran to make a deal over its nuclear programme.

Iran is still reeling from the 12-day war with Israel in June . The devastating series of air strikes, including the US bombing several Iranian nuclear sites, killed nearly 1,000 people in Iran and almost 40 in Israel.

Trump has said repeatedly that US strikes had “obliterated” Iran’s nuclear capabilities, though the amount of damage remains unclear. Satellite photos of nuclear sites have recently captured activity, prompting concern that Iran could be attempting to salvage or assess damage at the sites.

Israel has long called for Iran to cease all uranium enrichment, dial back its ballistic missile programme and cut ties to militant groups across the region. Iran has always rejected those demands, saying it would only accept some limits on its nuclear programme in return for sanctions relief.

In his post, Trump said he and Netanyahu had “also discussed the tremendous progress being made in Gaza, and the Region in general”.

Trump plans to hold the first meeting next week of his Board of Peace , which was initially framed to oversee future steps of the US-brokered Gaza ceasefire plan but has taken shape with Trump’s ambitions of resolving other global crises

.

Earlier Wednesday, Netanyahu met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at Blair House, across the street from the White House, and agreed to be part of the board.

On Iran, Trump said Friday that his special envoy, Steve Witkoff , and son-in-law Jared Kushner had “very good” talks and more were planned this week. But the Republican president kept up the pressure, warning that if Iran did not make a deal over its nuclear programme, “the consequences are very steep”.

Iran’s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, made similar comments, saying there will be consultations on “next steps”. He also said the level of mistrust between the two longtime adversaries remains a “serious challenge facing the negotiations”.

He signalled that Iran would stick to its position that it must be able to enrich uranium – a major point of contention with Trump.

Araghchi said in November that Iran was no longer enriching uranium due to the damage from last year’s war.

Before the war, Iran had been enriching uranium up to 60 percent purity , a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels. The UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ), had said Iran was the only country in the world to enrich to that level that was not armed with the bomb.

Iran has been refusing requests by the IAEA to inspect the sites bombed in the June war. Even before that, Iran has restricted IAEA inspections since Trump’s decision in 2018 to unilaterally withdraw the US from Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 21:58:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8de2dfc6-06f9-11f1-ac28-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/e2546da1a5199a5397956983139c432640924e69.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What we know about the Canadian school shooter</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260211-what-we-know-canadian-school-shooter-brisith-columbia-suicide</link><description>The killer, who police named as Jesse Van Rootselaar, committed suicide ​after Tuesday’s shooting in Tumbler Ridge , a remote community in the Pacific province of British Columbia. Police ⁠also revised the death toll down to nine from the initially reported 10.

“Police had attended that (family) residence on multiple occasions over the past several years, dealing with concerns of mental ‌health with respect to our suspect,” said Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, commander of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ⁠in British Columbia.

McDonald said Van Rootselaar, who was born male but began to identify as a female six years ago, had first killed her mother, 39, and 11-year-old step-brother at the family home.

The killings at the home occurred first, he said. A young family member at the home went to a neighbour, who called police.

She then went ​to the school, where she shot a 39-year-old woman teacher as well as three 12-year-old female students ‌and two male students, one aged 12 and one aged 13.

“We do believe the suspect acted alone ... it would be too early to speculate on motive,” he told a press conference.

“There is no information at this point that anyone was specifically targeted," McDonald said.

Police recovered a long gun and a modified handgun. McDonald said officers arrived at the school two minutes after the initial call. When they arrived, shots were fired in their direction.

More than 25 people were wounded Tuesday in the attack in the small mountain community of Tumbler Ridge, police said.

The town of 2,700 people in the Canadian Rockies is more than 1,000 kilometres northeast of Vancouver, near the provincial border with Alberta.</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 21:58:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3684911c-0789-11f1-9d2d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26042630928900.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Star of 'Dawson's Creek' James Van Der Beek dies at 48</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260211-james-van-der-beek-star-dawson-creek-dies</link><description>US actor James Van Der Beek, the star of the American TV series "Dawson's Creek," died on Wednesday at age 48 after a battle with colorectal cancer.

"Our beloved James David Van Der Beek passed peacefully this morning. He met his final days with courage, faith, and grace," read a post on his Instagram page.

Van Der Beek, who was married and had six children, announced his cancer diagnosis in 2024.

He was best known for playing Dawson, the lead character of the eponymous 1998-2003 teen drama that followed a group of friends living in a small Massachusetts town.

While he also had roles in the films "Varsity Blues" and "The Rules of Attraction," Van DerBeek never truly established himself in cinema as he struggled to separate himself from the legacy of "Dawson's Creek."

But the actor insisted he was happy with his career path.

"Overall, I've worn my past with pride rather than seeing it as something to get rid of," he told celebrity site Page Six in 2011.

Wednesday's Instagram post showed a picture of Van Der Beek wearing a white top and cardigan. It was also shared by his wife Kimberly.

"There is much to share regarding his wishes, love for humanity and the sacredness of time. Those days will come," the post added.

"For now we ask for peaceful privacy as we grieve our loving husband, father, son, brother, and friend."</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 22:39:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/514d9daa-0788-11f1-8c82-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/87b03808c5790a1350889b61cc4ee13cc0262981.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron calls Musk ‘over-subsidised,’ pushes Europe to support domestic industry</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260211-macron-musk-oversubsidised-guy</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday cited state support for Elon Musk 's Starlink as an argument for public investment in European industry, provoking a response from the world's richest man after calling him "over-subsidised".

Speaking at an industrial summit in the Belgian city of Antwerp, Macron argued for a "Buy European" competitiveness approach, and for massive investment partly financed through joint borrowing by the European Union .

"If you look at the US, you have a lot of private money... but you have a lot of public money" too, he said.

"Everybody is fascinated by Starlink... But if you are lucid, Mr. Musk is probably one of the guys of the world who has had in his pockets the most... billions dollars of the American taxpayers in order to be subsidised," he added.

"Elon Musk is first an oversubsidised guy by the federal agency in the US," he said, calling the approach "super-innovative".

The French leader earlier said that more joint EU debt was the "only way" to compete on an economic level with rivals such as the US and China.

Musk quickly hit back on X, the social media platform he owns, at Macron's remarks about him, responding that Europe's states subsidised its industries more than the US did.

"If you add up all the government funding Tesla and SpaceX have ever received, it is only about 1% of the combined value of the companies," he said.

"In contrast, if you do that with US and European major aerospace companies, the government money they have received *exceeds* 100% of their value!"</description><pubDate>Wed, 11 Feb 2026 23:32:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/97877ea4-0769-11f1-bca5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/e2f8a47a41a8fc327ba0c1f30edadbdf401ce797.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US vows to drive ‘dramatic increase’ in Venezuelan oil output</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260212-us-vows-to-drive-dramatic-increase-in-venezuelan-oil-output</link><description>US Energy Secretary Chris Wright vowed Wednesday to power a "dramatic increase" in Venezuelan oil output as part of a plan to "make the Americas great again."

Wright met interim leader Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas, becoming the highest-ranking US official to visit Venezuela since US special forces captured and overthrew socialist leader Nicolas Maduro on January 3.

After talks with Rodriguez, who took over from Maduro and has struck a cooperative relationship with US President Donald Trump , Wright told reporters relations between the nations were "at a pivot in history."

"I believe we will see an absolutely dramatic turn in the trajectory of this nation, in the state of the relationship between Venezuela and the United States, and in the business conditions in the hemisphere for commerce and trade ," he added.

In a meeting earlier with Rodriguez and oil industry executives, Wright insisted Trump was "passionately committed" to transforming ties between the two former foes.

Rodriguez said she supported a "long-term productive partnership" that was "beneficial to both countries."

Trump approved former vice-president Rodriguez's replacement of Maduro on the condition she complies with his demands on access to Venezuela's vast oil resources, and on easing state repression.

Venezuela, once a major crude supplier to the United States, has the world's largest proven reserves with more than 303 billion barrels, according to global oil cartel OPEC.

This amounts to about a fifth of the world's oil reserves.

But in 2024, the South American country produced only about one percent of the world's total crude, however -- its industry left haggard by years of underinvestment, mismanagement and US sanctions.

Wright said Wednesday that the US oil embargo on Venezuela, in place since 2019, was "essentially over."

Trump wants US oil majors to rapidly rebuild the sector and boost output by millions of barrels per day, saying the United States and Caracas will share the profits.

The United States carried out a first sale of Venezuelan oil last month that made the Caribbean country $500 million.

Wright called for a "dramatic increase" in Venezuela's production of oil, natural gas and electricity which would improve "the job opportunities, the wages and the quality of life" of all Venezuelans.

He said he and Rodriguez "spoke very candidly about the tremendous opportunities in front of us" as well as the challenges.

The president of Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA, Venezuela's diplomatic representative to the United States, and the US charge d'affaires in Caracas joined Wednesday's talks.

Rodriguez said she welcomed the opportunity for their two countries "to address their historical differences in a mature manner."

Wright's visit to Caracas comes amidst a dramatic thaw in US-Venezuelan relations, which Caracas broke off in 2019 after Washington refused to recognise Maduro as the winner of tainted elections.

In a series of head-spinning reforms since Maduro's fall, Rodriguez last month opened up the nationalised oil sector to private investment.

On Thursday, parliament could adopt a landmark bill granting amnesty to political prisoners.

Washington for its part has eased sanctions on Venezuela's oil industry, allowing US companies to work with PDVSA and the government.

The challenge now is to persuade oil companies to invest in Venezuela despite persisting political instability, security concerns, and the need for heavy investment to restore production capacity.

The country produced 1.2 million oil barrels per day in 2025 -- up from a historic low of about 360,000 in 2020 -- but still far from the 3.0 million bpd it was pumping 25 years ago.

Rodriguez's government aims to increase output by a further 18 percent this year.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 02:12:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1689dc3a-0786-11f1-bb8f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/fe694cb7117250e5c8a7511fc47d0319dc92455f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh votes in landmark polls after deadly 2024 uprising</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260212-bangladesh-votes-landmark-polls-deadly-2024-uprising</link><description>Bangladeshis voted Thursday in its first election since a deadly 2024 uprising, as parties crushed under Sheikh Hasina 's rule return to the fray with a powerful political heir facing an Islamist led coalition.

Queues stretched outside polling stations in the capital Dhaka as voting in the hugely anticipated election opened in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.

More than 300,000 soldiers and police are deployed countrywide, with UN experts warning ahead of voting of "growing intolerance, threats and attacks", and a "tsunami of disinformation", especially targeting millions of young first time voters.

"I voted in 1991 and today after many years, I cast my vote here," said Nur Alam Shamim, 50, who was first vote at the New Model Degree College in Dhaka-10 constituency.

Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College, lined up early to vote to avoid the crowds.

"This was my first vote and I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive," she said.

Leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman, 60, is confident his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) can regain power -- but he faces a stiff challenge from the Muslim-majority country's largest Islamist party, Jamaat e Islami.

Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign, and, if victorious, the former political prisoner could lead the first Islamist led government in constitutionally secular Bangladesh.

Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead -- with some suggesting a knife?edge race.

"The significance of this day is far-reaching," interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who will step down once the new government takes power, said in his address to the nation before the vote.

"It will determine the future direction of the country, the character of its democracy, its durability, and the fate of the next generation."

The 85 year old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Sheikh Hasina's 15?year rule ended with her ouster in August 2024. His administration has barred her Awami League from contesting the polls.

Hasina, 78, was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in neighbouring India.

Yunus has also championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a "completely broken" system of government and to prevent a return to one?party rule.

The 127 million voters will also decide in a referendum whether to endorse proposals for prime?ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.

Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.

Counting by hand begins after they close at 4:30 pm (1030 GMT). Results in past elections trickled in hours later -- though counting this time also includes referendum ballots.

"The crucial test for Bangladesh now will be to ensure the election is conducted fairly and impartially, and for all parties to then accept the result," said Thomas Kean, an analyst with the International Crisis Group.

Police records show that five people were killed and more than 600 injured in political clashes during campaigning.

The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world's second?largest garment exporter, alongside delicate relations with neighbouring India.

The BNP's Rahman -- whose late parents both led the country -- told AFP that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability. But he warned the challenges ahead were immense.

"The economy has been destroyed," he said. "There are a huge number of unemployed. We need to create businesses for these young people to have jobs."

But his Islamist political rivals, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades.

"We want to build a country of unity with everyone on board," Jamaat leader Rahman said in his closing campaign speech. "It will be a country where nobody gets the driving seat because of their family background."

Around 10 percent of Bangladesh's population are non-Muslim, most of them Hindu.

In his final address to the nation before voting, Yunus urged citizens to honour the "sacrifice" of the 2024 uprising and to put the "national interest above personal and party" agendas.

"Victory is part of democracy; defeat is also an inevitable part," he said. "Please dedicate yourselves to building a new, just, and inclusive Bangladesh."</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:36:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/61b231e6-07c0-11f1-adb8-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26043072155506.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US House overturn Trump’s Canada tariffs in rare bipartisan rebuke</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260212-us-house-overturn-trump-canada-tariffs-bipartisan</link><description>The House voted Wednesday to slap back President Donald Trump ’s tariffs on Canada , a rare if largely symbolic rebuke of the White House agenda as Republicans joined Democrats over the objections of GOP leadership.

The tally, 219-211, was among the first times the House, controlled by Republicans, has confronted the president over a signature policy, and drew instant recrimination from Trump himself. The resolution seeks to end the national emergency Trump declared to impose the tariffs, though actually undoing the policy would require support from the president, which is highly unlikely. It next goes to the Senate.

Trump believes in the power of tariffs to force US trade partners to the negotiating table. But lawmakers are facing unrest back home from businesses caught in the trade wars and constituents navigating pocketbook issues and high prices.

“Today’s vote is simple, very simple: Will you vote to lower the cost of living for the American family or will you keep prices high out of loyalty to one person -- Donald J. Trump?” said Rep. Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, who authored the resolution.

Within minutes, as the gavel struck, Trump fired off a stern warning to those in the Republican Party who would dare to cross him.

“Any Republican, in the House or the Senate, that votes against TARIFFS will seriously suffer the consequences come Election time, and that includes Primaries!” the president posted on social media.

The high-stakes moment provides a snapshot of the House’s unease with the president’s direction, especially ahead of the midterm elections as economic issues resonate among voters. The Senate has already voted to reject Trump’s tariffs on Canada and other countries in a show of displeasure. But both chambers would have to approve the tariff rollbacks, and send the resolution to Trump for the president's signature — or veto.

Six House Republicans voted for the resolution, and one Democrat voted against it.

From Canada, Ontario, Premier Doug Ford on social media called the vote “an important victory with more work ahead.” He thanked lawmakers from both parties “who stood up in support of free trade and economic growth between our two great countries. Let’s end the tariffs and together build a more prosperous and secure future.”

Trump recently threatened to impose a 100% tariff on goods imported from Canada over that country's proposed China trade deal, intensifying a feud with the longtime U.S. ally and Prime Minister Mark Carney.

House Speaker Mike Johnson tried to prevent this showdown.

Johnson insisted lawmakers wait for a pending Supreme Court ruling in a lawsuit about the tariffs. He engineered a complicated rules change to prevent floor action. But Johnson’s strategy collapsed late Tuesday, as Republicans peeled off during a procedural vote to ensure the Democratic measure was able to advance.

“The president’s trade policies have been of great benefit,” Johnson, R-La., had said. “And I think the sentiment is that we allow a little more runway for this to be worked out between the executive branch and the judicial branch.”

Late Tuesday evening, Johnson could be seen speaking to holdout Republican lawmakers as the GOP leadership team struggled to shore up support during a lengthy procedural vote, but the numbers lined up against him.

“We’re disappointed,” Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House’s National Economic Council, told reporters at the White House on Wednesday morning. “The president will make sure they don’t repeal his tariffs.”

The resolution put forward by Meeks would terminate the national emergency that Trump declared a year ago as one of his executive orders.

The administration claimed illicit drug flow from Canada constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat that allows the president to slap tariffs on imported goods outside the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

The Republican chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Brian Mast of Florida, said the flow of fentanyl into the US is a dire national emergency and the policy must be left in place.

“Let’s be clear again about what this resolution is and what it’s not. It’s not a debate about tariffs. You can talk about those, but that’s not really what it is,” Mast said. “This is Democrats trying to ignore that there is a fentanyl crisis.”

Experts say fentanyl produced by cartels in Mexico is largely smuggled into the US from land crossings in California and Arizona. Fentanyl is also made in Canada and smuggled into the US, but to a much lesser extent.

Ahead of voting, some rank-and-file Republican lawmakers expressed unease over the choices ahead as Democrats — and a few renegade Republicans — impressed on their colleagues the need to flex their power as the legislative branch rather than ceding so much power to the president to take authority over trade and tariff policy.

Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., said he was unpersuaded by Johnson’s call to wait until the Supreme Court makes its decision about the legality of Trump’s tariffs. He voted for passage.

“Why doesn’t the Congress stand on its own two feet and say that we’re an independent branch?” Bacon said. “We should defend our authorities. I hope the Supreme Court does, but if we don’t do it, shame on us.”

Bacon, who is retiring rather than facing reelection, also argued that tariffs are bad economic policy.

Other Republicans had to swiftly make up their minds after Johnson's gambit — which would have paused the calendar days to prevent the measure from coming forward — was turned back.

“At the end of the day, we’re going to have to support our president,” said Rep. Keith Self, R-Texas.

Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., said he doesn't want to tie the president's hands on trade and would support the tariffs on Canada “at this time.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:36:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09be0b1c-07bc-11f1-96b0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26035001501381.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo parliament elects Albin Kurti as PM ending year-long political deadlock</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260212-kosovo-parliament-elects-albin-kurti-pm</link><description>Kosovo 's parliament elected Albin Kurti as prime minister on Wednesday, securing the leader a third term and ending a year-long political gridlock in the country.

Following 12 months in a caretaker position, Kurti was confirmed as the Balkan nation's new prime minister after his Vetevendosje (Self-determination) party topped the results in a snap election in December.

He was elected to the leadership with 66 votes in favour in the 120-seat parliament -- drawing applause from his supporters.

Delivering his speech to parliament ahead of the vote, Kurti set out his legislative agenda, highlighting the economy and increasing investment in defence at its core.

"During these years, as we have all witnessed, we have faced constant attacks and threats from Serbia," he said of his country's northern neighbour, which has never recognised Kosovo's independence.

But he promised to "pursue normalisation of relations" with Belgrade.

"Normalisation is a matter of regulating relations between two states, that is, as a bilateral external relationship and not interference or meddling in internal affairs," Kurti told parliament.

Tensions in the country's north, where most of the ethnic Serb minority live, have remained high since the 1990s war between Serbia and Kosovo.

A normalisation of relations is a key requirement for both countries' stated EU ambitions.

A general election a year ago had left Kurti without the majority needed to form a government -- leading to months of parliamentary stasis.

Deeply divided lawmakers eventually forced a December snap poll, which Kurti's party won with over 51 per cent of the vote, securing 57 seats.

But the result took weeks to confirm, after alleged inaccuracies in the tally triggered a full recount and a criminal investigation.

More than 100 election staff have been arrested as the investigation continues.

Kurti has already flagged an intention to move quickly as he seeks to approve key international loans for Kosovo, including from Brussels, which require a two-thirds majority to pass.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 04:36:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/22dcacb2-07a2-11f1-8973-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26042627097592.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia evacuates village in Volgograd after military facility hit by debris</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260212-live-russia-evacuates-village-in-volgograd-after-military-facility-hit-by-debris</link><description>Another ⁠nearly ​2,600 apartment buildings ​were left without heating in the ​Ukrainian ‌capital Kyiv ⁠following a ‌Russian attack overnight, Mayor ⁠Vitali Klitschko said.

Klitschko said the buildings ​were located ‌both on the left and ‌right bank of ​the Dnipro River, in four city districts.

More ​than ​1,100 apartment ​buildings remained without ​heating as a result of the previous attacks, ⁠he added.

Russia ⁠launched ​24 ballistic ​missile, one cruise missile and 219 drones ​in ‌overnight ⁠attacks against Ukraine, Ukraine's ‌air force said ⁠on Thursday.

Air defence units shot ​down or ‌neutralised 16 missiles and 197 drones, ‌the air force ​said in a post on Telegram.

It ​added that ​the cities ​of Kyiv, Kharkiv, ​Dnipro and Odesa were the main targets of ⁠the strike.

Russia pounded Ukraine with ​drones and ballistic missiles overnight on Thursday, targeting energy systems and injuring at least seven people in the capital Kyiv, and the cities of Dnipro and Odesa, officials said.

"Hundreds of drones and ​ballistic missiles ‌targeted energy systems, depriving people of power, heating, and water," Ukrainian Foreign ⁠Minister Andrii Sybiha said in a post on X.

Two people were hurt in a "massive" attack on Kyiv, which also hit ‌various buildings, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

A ⁠Russian ​attack has ​damaged a substation in Ukraine's southern region ​of ‌Odesa, ⁠power company DTEK ‌said on Thursday.

"The damage ⁠is extensive. Repairs will take ​a long ‌time to restore the equipment ‌to working order," ​DTEK said on the Telegram messaging app.

It added ​that ​it was ​already the 31st ​large substation in the region that has been ⁠damaged by Russia.

WhatsApp said Wednesday that Russia "attempted to fully block" the messaging app in the country to push users to a competing state-controlled service, potentially affecting 100 million people.

Moscow has been trying to nudge Russians to use a more tightly controlled domestic online service.

It has threatened a host of internet platforms with forced slowdowns or outright bans if they do not comply with Russian laws, including those requiring data on Russian users to be stored inside the country.

Russia said Thursday that it repelled a missile attack in Volgograd region but that debris ignited a fire at a military facility and prompted the evacuation of a nearby village.

"Air defense units of the Russian Ministry of Defence repelled a missile attack on Volgograd region," regional Governor Andrey Bocharov posted on Telegram.

"Falling debris caused a fire on the grounds of a Ministry of Defence facility near the village of Kotluban," he added, without elaborating on the site.

While there were no were no casualties, he said evacuation orders were being carried out in the nearby village of Kotluban "to ensure civilian safety from the threat of detonation during firefighting".

Ukrainian capital Kyiv came under a "massive" attack from ​Russian ‌missiles early ⁠on Thursday, with various buildings hit ‌in the assault, officials said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 07:34:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5c03a604-07c4-11f1-a91c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026209372450.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands of costumes from Geneva's Grand Theatre opera house to go on sale</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260212-thousands-of-costumes-from-geneva-s-grand-theatre-opera-house-to-go-on-sale</link><description>Sandra Delpierre's fingers linger on a long blue and white fur coat and graze a pair of angel wings as she winds past thousands of colourful costumes used in opera performances.

"There are some real treasures to be found," the head of costume workshops at Geneva's Grand Theatre told AFP.

At a time when Bridgerton-style costume parties are all the rage, the Swiss opera house is planning to sell off 15,000 stage costumes, accessories and shoes from major productions through the years.

Delpierre marvels at the thousands of garments, ranging from vests and tunics to dresses and leotards displayed in a large warehouse near Geneva.

She shows off large animal heads, including a rat and a bull, and an embroidered dress with a ruffled hem made for the production of the Handel opera "Alcina".

There is also a costume inspired by crinoline, the stiff or structured petticoat designed to hold out a skirt or tutu, but whimsically reimagined using neoprene.

The Grand Theatre, a majestic building in the heart of Geneva which opened in 1879, is selling around half of its stock, calling it "a rare opportunity to step behind the scenes and take home a living fragment of the show".

"From valets to duchesses, from three-piece suits to the Roaring Twenties, there is something for every taste," it boasts on its website.

The pieces, some dating back to the 1980s, will go on sale on February 14 and 15, with a time slot reserved for professionals.

Prices range from five to 500 Swiss francs ($6.50-$650), although the star of the sale has been priced higher, at 995 Swiss francs.

That is because the work of Romanian costume designer Miruna Boruzescu for the piece in question is "monumental", said Marianne Perreau, in charge of sorting through, setting up and selling off the massive stash.

"It truly embodies everything that makes a remarkable costume," Perreau told AFP, lifting the heavy, green piece that evokes a luxurious plant creature, entirely composed of overlapping green leaves, embroidered with gold-coloured thread and dotted with peacock feathers.

The costume, which exists in several exemplars but only one of which is up for sale, was worn by dancers in the opera "JJR (Citizen of Geneva)", dedicated to the life and work of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, by Canadian director Robert Carsen.

"Each piece of fabric, each petal, is made from different material. It was top-stitched to give the impression of veining," she said.

The costume, which consists of a bodice placed over a boned skirt fitted with a farthingale – a kind of padded roll that provides volume at the hips – is part of the sale's "Remarkable" section.

A bit further along, Perreau unveils a light green piece, created by Italian costume designer Ezio Toffolutti for one of the fairies in William Shakespeare’s "A Midsummer Night's Dream".

Several designs are also available for children , in yellow and grey.

Also on display are imposing and extravagant birds in tailcoats, created by Greek costume designer Yannis Kokkos for a male choir, each with enormous, rounded artificial bodies affixed with real feathers that have been dyed pink.

After months of sorting, every costume has been labelled to identify the production it was part of, the role it was used for and the performer who wore it.

"A collection needs to be rotated, renewed and updated to fit current tastes," Delpierre explained.

"So we have to part with some of our heritage to make room for other productions."

Some little-worn pieces are in excellent condition. Others are a bit tattered.

Delpierre voiced regret that limited storage space is pushing the Grand Theatre to part with some outfits.

"We're forced to make a difficult choice," she said.

But the sale is sure to delight potential buyers.

Delpierre said the opera house expected to see independent companies and performing arts institutions, as well as collectors, and individuals just eager to dress up.

The sale will be perfect, she said, for "people who dress more eccentrically and want to find a truly exceptional piece for their wardrobe".</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 08:48:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/be791c2a-07e1-11f1-aaeb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/697cdc9e32275fb56d22c997c763c25bb1419abd.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Attorney General Bondi deflects questions, clashes with democrats over Epstein files</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260212-us-attorney-general-bondi-deflects-questions-clashes-with-democrats-over-epstein-files</link><description>US Attorney General Pam Bondi launched into a passionate defence of Donald Trump on Wednesday as she tried to turn the page from relentless criticism of the Justice Department’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, repeatedly shouting at Democrats during a combative hearing in which she postured herself as the Republican president's chief protector.

Besieged by questions over Epstein and accusations of a weaponised Justice Department, Bondi aggressively pivoted in an extraordinary speech in which she mocked her Democratic questioners, praised Trump over the performance of the stock market and openly aligned herself as in sync with a president whom she painted as a victim of past impeachments and investigations.

“You sit here and you attack the president and I’m not going to have it," Bondi told lawmakers on the House Judiciary Committee. "I am not going to put up with it.”

With victims of Epstein seated behind her in the hearing room, Bondi forcefully defended the department's handling of the files related to the well-connected financier, an issue that has dogged her tenure. She accused Democrats of using the Epstein files to distract from Trump's successes, even though it was Republicans who initiated the furore over the records and Bondi herself fanned the flames by distributing binders to conservative influencers at the White House last year.

The hearing quickly devolved into a partisan brawl, with Bondi repeatedly lobbing insults at Democrats while insisting she was not “going to get in the gutter” with them. In one particularly fiery exchange, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland accused Bondi of refusing to answer his questions, prompting the attorney general to call the top Democrat on the committee a “washed-up loser lawyer – not even a lawyer".

Aiming to help Bondi amid an onslaught of Democratic criticism, Republicans tried to keep the focus on bread-and-butter law enforcement issues like violent crime and illegal immigration . Bondi, for her part, repeatedly deflected questions from Democrats, responding instead with attacks seemingly gleaned from news headlines as she sought to cast them as disinterested in violence in their districts. Democrats grew exasperated as Bondi declined time and again to directly answer.

“This is pathetic. This is pathetic," said Rep. Becca Balint, a Vermont Democrat who tried to ask Bondi about different Trump administration officials revealed to have had ties to Epstein. “I am not asking trick questions here. The American people have a right to know the answers to this."

Bondi has struggled to move past the backlash over the Epstein files since she handed out the binders to a group of social media influencers in February 2025. The binders included no new revelations about Epstein, leading to even more calls from Trump’s base for the files to be released.

In her opening remarks, Bondi told Epstein victims to come forward to law enforcement with any information about their abuse and said she was “deeply sorry” for what they had suffered. She told the survivors that “any accusation of criminal wrongdoing will be taken seriously and investigated".

But she refused when pressed by Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., to turn and face the Epstein victims in the audience and apologize for what Trump's Justice Department has “put them through". She accused the Democrat of “theatrics".

Bondi’s appearance on Capitol Hill came a year into her tumultuous tenure, which has amplified concerns that the Justice Department is using its law enforcement powers to target political foes of the president. Just a day earlier, the department sought to secure charges against Democratic lawmakers who produced a video urging military service members not to follow “illegal orders". But in an extraordinary rebuke of prosecutors, a grand jury in Washington refused to return an indictment.

Turning aside criticism that the Justice Department under her watch has become politicized, Bondi touted the department’s work to reduce violent crime and said she was determined to restore the department to its core missions after what she described as “years of bloated bureaucracy and political weaponisation".

GOP Rep. Jim Jordan praised Bondi for undoing actions under President Joe Biden 's Justice Department that Republicans say unfairly targeted conservatives – including Trump, who was charged in two federal criminal cases that were abandoned after his 2024 election victory.

“What a difference a year makes," Jordan said. "Under Attorney General Bondi, the DOJ has returned to its core missions – upholding the rule of law , going after the bad guys and keeping Americans safe."

Democrats, meanwhile, excoriated Bondi over haphazard redactions in the Epstein files that exposed intimate details about victims and included nude photographs. A review by The Associated Press and other news organisations has found countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions that have revealed sensitive private information.

“You’re siding with the perpetrators and you’re ignoring the victims," Raskin told Bondi in his opening statement. “That will be your legacy unless you act quickly to change the course. You're running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice."

Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who broke with his party to advance the legislation that forced the released of the Epstein files, also took Bondi to task for the release of victims’ personal information, telling her, “Literally the worst thing you could do to survivors, you did.”

Bondi told Massie that he was only focused on the files because Trump is mentioned in them, calling him a “hypocrite” with “Trump derangement syndrome".

Department officials have said they took pains to protect survivors, but errors were inevitable given the volume of the materials and the speed at which the department had to release them. Bondi told lawmakers that the Justice Department had taken down files when it was made aware that they included victims’ information and said staff had tried to do their "very best in the time frame allotted by the legislation” mandating the release of the files.

After raising the expectations of conservatives with promises of transparency last year, the Justice Department said in July that it had concluded a review and determined that no Epstein “client list” existed and there was no reason to make additional files public. That set off a furore that prompted Congress to pass legislation demanding that the Justice Department release the files.

The acknowledgment that the well-connected Epstein did not have a list of clients to whom underage girls were trafficked represented a public walk-back of a theory that the Trump administration had helped promote when Bondi suggested in a Fox News interview last year that it was sitting on her desk for review. Bondi later said she was referring to the Epstein files in total, not a specific client list.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:51:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3b92d26a-07eb-11f1-aefb-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-976C8T4.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine skeleton racer disqualified from Olympics over memorial helmet</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260212-ukraine-skeleton-racer-disqualified-from-olympics-over-memorial-helmet</link><description>Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych was disqualified from the Winter Olympics on Thursday after refusing to back down over his banned helmet, which depicts victims of his country's war with Russia .

In a statement, the International Olympic Committee said Heraskevych had been kicked out of the Milan-Cortina Games "after refusing to adhere to the IOC athlete expression guidelines".

Heraskevych insisted he would continue to wear the helmet, which carries pictures of Ukrainian sportsmen and women killed since Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, during the men's skeleton heats on Thursday.

The gesture has been defended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky but Heraskevych has now been disqualified.

"Having been given one final opportunity, skeleton pilot Vladylsav Heraskevych from Ukraine will not be able to start his race at the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games this morning," the IOC statement said.

"The decision followed his refusal to comply with the IOC's Guidelines on Athlete Expression. It was taken by the jury of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF) based on the fact that the helmet he intended to wear was not compliant with the rules."

Athletes are permitted to express their views in press conferences and on social media, and on Tuesday the IOC said it would "make an exception" for Heraskevych, allowing him to wear a plain black armband during competition.

The IOC said its president, Kirsty Coventry, had spoken with Heraskevych on Thursday morning in a vain bid to make him change his mind.

Coventry, the IOC said, "explained to him, one final time, the IOC position. As in the personal meetings before, he refused to change his position".

Heraskevych displayed a banner which read "No War in Ukraine" at the last Olympics in Beijing , with Russia launching its invasion of its neighbour four days after the end of those Olympics.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 09:51:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/263c5644-07ef-11f1-afbb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/69c5bef5604ec5646bfe8b09d2317c94d1a7a38b.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia blocks WhatsApp for failing to comply with local law, pushes state-backed alternative</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260212-russia-blocks-whatsapp-for-failing-to-comply-with-local-law-pushes-state-backed-alternative</link><description>US messenger app WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms, has been completely blocked in Russia for failing to comply with local law, the Kremlin said on Thursday, suggesting Russians turn to a state-backed "national messenger" instead.

"Due to Meta's unwillingness to comply with Russian law, such a decision was indeed ​made and ‌implemented," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, proposing that Russians switch to MAX, Russia's state-owned messenger.

"MAX is an ⁠accessible alternative, a developing messenger, a national messenger, and it is available on the market for citizens as an alternative," said Peskov.

Critics say MAX is a surveillance tool, something the authorities deny.

The move ‌against WhatsApp is the culmination of six months of pressure on the US company and reflects a ⁠wider push by the Russian authorities at a time of war to create and control a "sovereign" communications infrastructure in which foreign-owned tech companies submit to local laws or disappear.

Meta Russia had already been designated as an extremist organisation, and WhatsApp ​had complained about what it said was an attempt to fully block its service.

"Today the Russian government ‌attempted to fully block WhatsApp in an effort to drive people to a state-owned surveillance app," it said in a statement.

"Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia."

Some domain names ‌associated with WhatsApp disappeared from Russia's national register of domain names, meaning that devices inside Russia stopped receiving its IP addresses from the app and that it could be accessed only by using ​a virtual private network (VPN).

Roskomnadzor, the state communications regulator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Russian authorities, who also block or restrict social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, have been heavily pushing MAX, which critics say could be ​used to track users.

The authorities have dismissed those accusations as false and say MAX, which integrates various government-related services into it, is designed ​to simplify and improve the everyday lives of citizens.

Roskomnadzor first began restricting WhatsApp and other messenger ​services in August, making it impossible to complete phone calls on them after accusing the foreign-owned platforms of failing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases.

It said in December it ​was taking new measures to gradually restrict the app, which it accused of continuing to violate Russian law and of being a platform used "to organise and carry out terrorist acts on the territory of the country, to recruit their perpetrators and to commit fraud and other crimes".

Russian courts have repeatedly fined WhatsApp for failing to delete banned content and the authorities have insisted that the company needs a local representative office ⁠in Russia to be compliant, something it does not have.

Since December, many Russians have been able to use WhatsApp only in conjunction with a virtual private network and ⁠have switched to using rival ​messenger apps, though some of those – like Telegram – are also under pressure from the authorities for the same reasons.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 11:39:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/608532fa-0801-11f1-acfa-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26043364735069-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France slashes renewable energy targets, expands nuclear power with new law</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260212-france-slashes-renewable-energy-targets-favour-of-nuclear-power-new-energy-law</link><description>France set out a new energy law after years of wrangling on Thursday which slashes its wind and solar power targets and drops a mandate for state-run firm EDF to shutter nuclear plants.

“We need to stop ​our internal family ‌squabbling. We need both nuclear and renewables,” Finance Minister Roland Lescure told reporters.

The law, to be ⁠pushed through by decree on Friday after almost three years of bitter disagreement among lawmakers, also reverses a previous legal mandate to shut 14 reactors.

That was a 2017 campaign ‌promise of President Emmanuel Macron , who later changed course, backing nuclear expansion with a plan for at ⁠least six new reactors .

The move to pare back renewables should help shield EDF, which operates a fleet of 57 reactors, as power demand grows more slowly than expected over the next decade. The company is struggling to ​remain competitive as abundant wind and solar in Europe have pushed down power prices and ‌forced reactors to lower output.

The new 10-year framework, known as the PPE, aims for EDF to produce 420 terawatt-hours of power from its existing fleet in 2035, a 5 percent increase.

“Nuclear is the backbone of our electricity system,” said Lescure, adding that a first new reactor should ‌be inaugurated by 2038.

EDF CEO Bernard Fontana welcomed the proposal, saying it would allow the company to advance toward its objectives. The law had triggered fierce debate among lawmakers pitting support ​for renewable subsidies against financing new nuclear at a time when France is struggling with high debt. The PPE also governs wind and solar tenders, and a decision on the matter is expected to be welcomed by the wind industry, which ​has struggled amid uncertainty over the plans and delayed tenders.

Still, wind and solar targets were lowered, to 105-135 gigawatts (GW) of installed ​capacity by 2035 from drafts that had called for 133-163 GW.

“If this PPE is ​more than two years late on paper, it’s at least a decade behind in its vision of an energy transition,” Greenpeace France said in a statement.

It lowers France’s 2035 target ​for installed offshore wind capacity to 15 GW from 18 GW the government had submitted for consultation in 2024.

The target for onshore wind capacity drops to 35-40 GW from the 45 GW previously communicated.

Solar capacity will be 55-80 GW by 2035, the report added, down from a previous forecast of 75-100 GW.  The law calls for France to consume 60 percent of its own energy ⁠from decarbonised electricity by 2030, shifting from 60 percent of energy from fossil fuels currently, and up to 70 percent from decarbonised electricity by 2035.

The new law is unlikely ⁠to lead to lower ​prices for end-users, said Emeric de Vigan, managing director of energy consultancy 42 Advisors, adding this could keep them from switching to electricity from oil and gas-based fuels.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 15:53:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4d93a5fc-0822-11f1-851f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP21148254545424.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron courts controversy by appointing loyalists to lead key French institutions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260212-macron-courts-controversy-appointing-loyalists-lead-key-french-institutions</link><description>France ’s Budget Minister Amélie de Montchalin will become head of the country’s supreme audit body the Cour des Comptes, the French government announced on Wednesday – a decision that has sparked outcry among opposition politicians and accusations that Macron is trying to shore up his political legacy by placing allies in key institutions.

The Cour des Comptes is one of France’s most powerful oversight bodies, tasked with monitoring use of public money, evaluating public policy and auditing state and local authorities. It informs parliament, the government and the public about the regularity of accounts. However, its reports are not binding.

Critics say positioning de Montchalin, a longstanding Macron ally, as its leader undermines the institution’s independence, especially as the 40-year-old politician will have the right to hold the position until she retires at 68.

They have also raised fears that the president is using his allies to lock down multiple national institutions, which are supposed to be independent from party politics, to secure his legacy.

With the President’s term due to end in 2027, far-right leader Marine Le Pen on Wednesday accused Macron of manoeuvring to “place his loyalists in positions of power and disrupt the future democratic transition”.

Backlash against de Montchalin’s appointment – which comes into effect on February 23 and will make her the Cour des Comptes’ first female leader – is also due to a potential conflict of interests: as outgoing budget minister, she will be positioned to audit her own work in her new role.

The budget has been an ongoing source of political turmoil in France and a long-term thorn in Macron’s side, toppling two prime ministers before current premier Sébastien Lecornu forced it through parliament in January.

“How can the current minister give a credible opinion on the budget that she herself prepared?” asked Éric Coquerel, president of the National Assembly's finance committee, who has been battling with de Montchalin for months over the 2026 finance bill.

“The controversy is around de Montchalin's proximity to power, and the difficulty that others perceive in her remaining independent in her assessment of that power,” says Andrew W M Smith, historian of modern France at Queen Mary University, London.

“She was elected in 2017 as part of that first wave of Macronist figures – a relatively young deputy, coming into politics from the private sector – and her career is really seen as tied to Emmanuel Macron .”

The head of the Cour des Comptes may not have the power to reject a budget outright but would typically be able to “push back and query things that don’t add up”, he adds.

With this year’s controversial budget made up of a patchwork of concessions aimed at placating different factions of France’s divided parliament, many politicians may have hoped for such pushback to be significant.

There are wider fears that de Montchalin’s appointment is part of a worrying trend of the president trying to wield political influence in national institutions.

De Montchalin’s career-long tenure at the Cour des Comptes is reminiscent of the politicisation of Supreme Court appointees in the US, says Smith, “because it really tips the balance in terms of the constitutional future of the country and the robustness of these institutions”.

In March the president appointed another key ally, former secretary of his Renaissance party Richard Ferrand, to lead the country’s highest constitutional authority, the Conseil Constitutionnel.

Ferrand, who had been forced to resign as minister due to accusations of nepotism, was approved for the role by a razor-thin parliamentary majority.

And, in 2026, Macron will likely have the power to nominate two more key figures at national institutions as the current governor of the Bank of France and the vice-president of France’s supreme administrative court, the Conseil d’État, are both expected to step down .

These roles do not come with career-long tenure but nonetheless give Macron an opportunity to influence France’s political and economic landscape long after his presidential term ends.

Since his resignation, the outgoing governor of the Bank of France, François Villeroy de Galhau, has stressed the need for the nation’s central bank to retain its political independence .

So, will the president appoint yet more political loyalists?

“It would be very unusual for a president to appoint a completely neutral figure,” says Paul Smith, head of the department of Modern Languages at the University of Nottingham, UK.

There is also the fact that – despite being nearly ten years into his presidency – Macron is still something of a political newcomer. The presidency is the first office he has held.

“There are no Macronist veterans. He doesn't have a big reserve into which he can dig,” Paul Smith adds.

Within that reserve, some of Macron’s former heavyweights, including ex-prime ministers Edouard Philippe and Gabriel Attal , are now busy preparing their own presidential bids.

As such, appointing two loyalists to key institutional roles is “not shocking, but maybe quite cynical”, says Andrew W M Smith.

De Montchalin in particular could turn out to be a good choice. She has received praise from parliamentarians – including opposition figures – for the skills, experience and constructive approach she is expected to bring to her role.

“Nobody doubts her capacity as an economist,” says Paul Smith.

But were Macron to add a third or even fourth loyalist to the tally, “that might raise a real question mark around ideas of independence”, Andrew W M Smith says.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:59:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b6224cdc-0826-11f1-8808-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25342417333837.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE immigrant crackdown in Minnesota to end, Trump’s border czar announces</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260212-ice-immigrant-crackdown-in-minnesota-to-end-trump-s-border-czar-announces</link><description>The Trump administration is ending the immigration crackdown in Minnesota that led to thousands of arrests, violent protests and the fatal shootings of two US citizens over the past two months, border czar Tom Homan said Thursday.

The operation called the Department of Homeland Security’s “largest immigration enforcement operation ever” has been a flashpoint in the debate over President Donald Trump ’s mass deportation efforts, flaring up after Renee Good and Alex Pretti were killed by federal officers in Minneapolis.

The US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operation focused on the Minneapolis-St. Paul area resulted in more than 4,000 arrests, Homan said, calling it a success.

“The surge is leaving Minnesota safer,” he said. “I’ll say it again, it’s less of a sanctuary state for criminals.”

The announcement marks a significant retreat from an operation that has become a major distraction for the Trump administration and has been more volatile than prior crackdowns in Chicago and Los Angeles.

But Trump’s border czar pledged that immigration enforcement won’t end when the Minnesota operation is over.

“President Trump made a promise of mass deportation and that’s what this country is going to get,” Homan said.

Democratic Governor Tim Walz said Tuesday that he expected Operation Metro Surge , which started in December, to end in “days, not weeks and months”, based on his conversations with senior Trump administration officials.

While the Trump administration has called those arrested in Minnesota “dangerous criminal illegal aliens”, many people with no criminal records, including children and US citizens, have also been detained.

Homan announced last week that 700 federal officers would leave Minnesota immediately, but that still left more than 2,000 on Minnesota’s streets. At the time, he cited an “increase in unprecedented collaboration” resulting in the need for fewer federal officers in Minnesota, including help from jails that hold deportable inmates.

Homan said Thursday that the drawdown began this week and will continue next week. He said he plans to stay in Minnesota to oversee the drawdown.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said Tuesday he had a “positive meeting” with Homan a day earlier and discussed the potential for a further drawdown of federal officers.

Homan took over the Minnesota operation in late January after the second fatal shooting by federal immigration agents and amid growing political backlash and questions about how the operation was being run.

“We’re very much in a trust but verify mode,” Walz said Tuesday, adding that he expected to hear more from the administration “in the next day or so” about the future of what he said has been an “occupation” and a “retribution campaign” against the state.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 16:59:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2794fa8c-0826-11f1-b32f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26009516189134.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French police arrest two Louvre museum employees over ‘large-scale’ ticket fraud</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260212-french-police-arrest-2-louvre-museum-employees-over-large-scale-ticket-fraud</link><description>French police have dismantled a “large-scale” ticket fraud network at the Louvre in Paris , the museum said Thursday, while a source following the case said two staff had been arrested.

The operation took place on Tuesday following “a report from the Louvre museum”, a spokeswoman for the world-famous institution said.

“Based on the information available to the museum, we suspect the existence of a network organising large-scale fraud,” she added.

She said the world’s most visited museum was facing “a rise and diversification in ticketing fraud” and has, in response, implemented a “structured” anti-fraud plan in cooperation with its staff and the police.

According to a source following the case, the suspected fraud scheme was launched in the summer of 2024.

French daily Le Parisien said nine people were arrested, including two museum employees and two tour guides. The Chinese community was believed to be particularly targeted by the scam, the newspaper said.

Louvre bosses have been under huge pressure after four thieves carried out a brazen robbery in October, making off with jewellery worth an estimated €85 million.

Authorities have arrested all four alleged members of the heist crew but have not found the stolen jewels.

In recent months trade unions have launched several days of strikes at the Louvre , pressing for more recruitment, more pay and better maintenance of the vast former royal palace.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 19:32:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/72cb3906-083c-11f1-9a08-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26013472848547.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump believes US is creating conditions for ‘good deal’ with Iran, Netanyahu says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260212-trump-believes-us-creating-conditions-for-good-deal-iran-netanyahu</link><description>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that US President Donald Trump believed he was creating the conditions for a “good deal” with Iran , though the Israeli leader remained skeptical about the quality of any such agreement.

Netanyahu had travelled to Washington for his seventh meeting with Trump since the US president returned to power, and had sought to push for a harder line in nuclear talks with Iran .

“The president believes that the Iranians have already learned who they are dealing with,” Netanyahu said in Washington before departing for Israel , according to a video statement from his office.

“He believes that the conditions he is creating, combined with the fact that they surely understand they made a mistake last time when they didn’t reach an agreement, may create the conditions for achieving a good deal,” he added.

“I will not hide from you that I expressed general skepticism regarding the quality of any agreement with Iran.”

Any deal “must include the elements that are very important from our perspective”, Netanyahu continued, listing Iran’s ballistic missile programme and its support for militant groups such as the Palestinian movement Hamas , Yemen’s Houthi rebels and Hezbollah in Lebanon .

“It’s not just the nuclear issue,” he said.

On Wednesday, Trump had told Netanyahu at the White House that talks with Iran must continue , rebuffing the Israeli leader’s push for a tougher stance.

Trump said his preference was that a deal be reached, but added: “If it cannot, we will just have to see what the outcome will be.”

The US president has repeatedly hinted at potential US military action against Iran following its deadly crackdown on protests last month, even as Washington and Tehran restarted talks last week with a meeting in Oman .

The last round of talks between the two foes was cut short by Israel’s 12-day war with Iran in June , which the US briefly joined with strikes on nuclear facilities.

So far, Iran has rejected expanding the new talks beyond the issue of its nuclear programme, though Washington also wants Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and its support for regional militant groups to be on the table.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:33:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/50520db6-0853-11f1-9c23-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-11T110047Z-1011191967-RC2YAHA8U5NH-RTRMADP-3-USA-ISRAEL-TAKEAWAYS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela opposition rally calls on post-Maduro govt to grant full freedoms</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260212-venezuela-opposition-rally-calls-on-post-maduro-govt-to-grant-full-freedoms</link><description>Thousands of Venezuelans demonstrated on Thursday to demand the release of all remaining political prisoners and full freedoms a month after the overthrow of autocratic leader Nicolas Maduro .

"We are not afraid," the demonstrators chanted at the first major opposition rally since Maduro's capture by US forces, creating scenes that would have been unthinkable during his repressive rule.

Elsewhere in Caracas, thousands of people attended a counter-demonstration in support of the post-Maduro government allowed to remain in place by US President Donald Trump , who asserts that he in effect controls Venezuela and its oil wealth.

The opposition demonstration called by student organisations came as lawmakers prepared to debate a bill granting amnesty to all political prisoners for alleged offences over 27 years of socialist rule.

MPs voted to postpone the debate, however, after failing to reach agreement on at least one of the articles, AFP reported.

Referring to the slow release of prisoners over the past five weeks, the demonstrators chanted: "Not one or two, but all."

"Amnesty now!" read a banner hanging at the entrance to the Central University of Venezuela, where the demonstrators gathered.

"We spend a lot of time underground, silent in the face of all the repression Venezuela experienced... but today we are rising up and uniting to put forward demands for the country," Dannalice Anza, a 26-year-old geography student, said.

"VENEZUELA WILL BE FREE! Long live our students!," exiled opposition leader Maria Corina Machado wrote on X, alongside a video of a Caracas street thronged with demonstrators, some of whom waved Venezuelan flags.

The administration of Maduro's successor, Delcy Rodriguez , organised a counter-demonstration, which attracted thousands of pro-Maduro demonstrators on Venezuela Youth Day.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 21:33:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7d681562-083e-11f1-a562-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/a299e42ef36588a3eafebd346ea6acd9535b90eb.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration revokes scientific finding supporting US greenhouse gas rules</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260212-trump-epa-revokes-scientific-finding-underpinned-us-fight-climate-change</link><description>The Trump administration on Thursday revoked a scientific finding that long has been the central basis for US action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and fight climate change, the most aggressive move by the Republican president to roll back climate regulations.

The rule finalised by the Environmental Protection Agency rescinds a 2009 government declaration known as the endangerment finding that determined that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases threaten public health and welfare.

The endangerment finding by the Obama administration is the legal underpinning of nearly all climate regulations under the Clean Air Act for motor vehicles, power plants and other pollution sources that are heating the planet.

President Donald Trump called the move “the single largest deregulatory action in American history, by far” while EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the endangerment finding “the Holy Grail of federal regulatory overreach.”

Trump called the endangerment finding “one of the greatest scams in history,” adding that it “had no basis in fact” or law. “On the contrary, over the generations, fossil fuels have saved millions of lives and lifted billions of people out of poverty all over the world,” Trump said at a White House ceremony.

Legal challenges are certain for an action that repeals all greenhouse gas emissions standards for cars and trucks, and could unleash a broader undoing of climate regulations on stationary sources such as power plants and oil and gas facilities, experts say. Overturning the finding will “raise more havoc” than other actions by the Trump administration to roll back dozens of environmental rules, said Ann Carlson, an environmental law professor at the UCLA School of Law.

Environmental groups described the move as the single biggest attack in US history against federal authority to address climate change. Evidence backing up the endangerment finding has only grown stronger in the 17 years since it was approved, they said.

The EPA also said it will propose a two-year delay to a Biden-era rule restricting greenhouse gas emissions by cars and light trucks. And the agency will end tax credits for automakers who install automatic start-stop ignition systems in their vehicles. The device is intended to reduce emissions, but Zeldin said “everyone hates” it.

Zeldin, a former Republican congressman who was tapped by Trump to lead EPA last year, has criticized his predecessors in Democratic administrations, saying that in the name of tackling climate change, they were “willing to bankrupt the country.”

The endangerment finding “led to trillions of dollars in regulations that strangled entire sectors of the United States economy, including the American auto industry,” Zeldin said. “The Obama and Biden administrations used it to steamroll into existence a left-wing wish list of costly climate policies, electric vehicle mandates and other requirements thatassaulted consumer choice and affordability.”

The endangerment finding and the regulations based on it “didn’t just regulate emissions, it regulated and targeted the American dream. And now the endangerment finding is hereby eliminated,” Zeldin said.

The Supreme Court ruled in a 2007 case that planet-warming greenhouse gases, caused by the burning of oil and other fossil fuels, are air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

Since the high court’s decision, in a case known as Massachusetts v. EPA, courts have uniformly rejected legal challenges to the endangerment finding, including a 2023 decision by the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.

The endangerment finding is widely considered the legal foundation that underpins a series of regulations intended to protect against threats made increasingly severe by climate change. That includes deadly floods, extreme heat waves, catastrophic wildfires and other natural disasters in the United States and around the world.

Gina McCarthy, a former EPA administrator who served as White House climate adviser in the Biden administration, called the Trump administration's actions reckless. "This EPAwould rather spend its time in court working for the fossil fuel industry than protecting usfrom pollution and the escalating impacts of climate change,” she said.

EPA has a clear scientific and legal obligation to regulate greenhouse gases, McCarthy said, adding that the health and environmental hazards of climate change have "become impossible to ignore.”

Dr. Lisa Patel, a pediatrician and executive director of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health, said Trump's action “prioritizes the profits of big oil and gas companies and polluters over clean air and water” and children's health.

“As a result of this repeal, I’m going to see more sick kids come into the Emergency Department having asthma attacks and more babies born prematurely,” she said in a statement. “My colleagues will see more heart attacks and cancer in their patients.”

David Doniger, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said Trump and Zeldin are trying to use repeal of the finding as a “kill shot’’ that would allow the administration to make nearly all climate regulations invalid. The repeal could erase current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from cars, factories, power plants and other sources and could prevent future administrations from proposing rules to address global warming.

The EPA action follows an executive order from Trump that directed the agency to submit a report on “the legality and continuing applicability” of the endangerment finding. Conservatives and some congressional Republicans have long sought to undo what they consider overly restrictive and economically damaging rules to limit greenhouse gases that cause global warming.

Withdrawing the endangerment finding “is the most important step taken by the Trump administration so far to return to energy and economic sanity,” said Myron Ebell, a conservative activist who has questioned the science behind climate change.

Zeldin and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have moved to drastically scale back limits on tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks. Rules imposed under Democratic President Joe Biden were intended to encourage US automakers to build and sell more electric vehicles. The transportation sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US.

The Trump administration announced a proposal in December to weaken vehicle mileage rules for the auto industry, loosening regulatory pressure on automakers to control pollution from gasoline-powered cars and trucks. The EPA said its two-year delay to a Biden-era rule on greenhouse gas emissions by cars and light trucks will give the agency time to develop a plan that better reflects the reality of slower EV sales, while promoting consumer choice and lowering prices.

The mileage plan would significantly reduce requirements that set rules on how far new vehicles need to travel on a gallon of gasoline. Trump said the rule change will lower the price of new cars and increase Americans’ access to the full range of gasoline vehicles they need and can afford.

Environmental groups said the plan would keep polluting, gas-burning cars and trucks on US roads for years to come, threatening the health of millions of Americans, particularly children and the elderly.</description><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 22:33:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4bda41be-084d-11f1-87a8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/495f479d722a766830cee0059469cf39e2bb7f90.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian, UK finance groups freeze new DP World deals over CEO’s Epstein emails</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260213-canadian-uk-finance-groups-freeze-dp-world-deals-ceo-epstein-emails</link><description>Financial groups in Canada and the United Kingdom said they've paused future ventures with the company DP World after newly released emails showed a yearslong friendship between the company's CEO, Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, and Jeffrey Epstein.

The emails — some referencing porn, sexual massages and escorts — surfaced in the cache of Epstein-related documents recently released by the US Department of Justice. DP World is a logistics giant that runs the Jebel Ali port in Dubai and operates terminals in other ports around the world.

Sulayem, its chairman and CEO, made headlines this week when US officials appeared to associate him with an email in which Epstein wrote, “I loved the torture video.”

In response to the released emails, British International Investment, the UK's development finance agency, said they “will not be making any new investments with DP World until the required actions have been taken by the company.” One of Canada's largest pension funds, La Caisse, gave a similar statement.

Epstein killed himself in jail in 2019 after he was charged with sex trafficking. The emails do not appear to implicate Sulayem in Epstein’s alleged crimes. DP World has not responded to multiple requests for comment.

In 2009, Epstein wrote in an email, “where are you? are you ok , I loved the torture video."

The recipient, whose email was redacted, replied, “I am in china I will be in the US 2nd week of may.”

On Monday, Republican Rep. Thomas Massie posted a picture of the redacted emails on X, saying “A Sultan seems to have sent this” and that the Justice Department should “make this public.”

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche responded to Massie's post that “the Sultan’s name is available unredacted in the files" and cited another document that names “Sultan Bin Sulayem.”

La Caisse said in an statement that it's pausing new “capital deployment” with DP World. “We have made it clear to the company that we expect it to shed light on the situation and take the necessary actions."

British International Investment said through a spokesperson that they "are shocked by the allegations emerging in the Epstein files regarding Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem."

Neither organisation is an investor in DP World, but they both have invested alongside the company in port projects around the world.

The topics range widely, including President Donald Trump , sex and theology.

In one email from 2013, Epstein wrote to Sulayem that “you are one of my most trusted friends in very sense of the word, you have never let me down."

In response, Sulayem said, “Thank you my friend I am off the sample a fresh 100% female Russian at my yacht.”

That same year, Sulayem sent Epstein an email showing a menu for a massage business which included sexual offerings. Two years later, Sulayem texted Epstein a link to a porn site, and, in 2017, Epstein sent Sulayem a link to an escort website.

Epstein e-mailed with Sulayem about Steve Bannon, the Trump acolyte, in 2018, saying “you will like him." In another exchange, Sulayem asked Epstein about an event where it appeared Trump would be in attendance.

“Do you think it will be possible to shake hand with trump,” Sulayem asked.

Epstein replied: “Call to discuss.”

He's chairman and CEO of logistics giant DP World, which has long been a pillar of Dubai's economy.

The company runs the city's sprawling Jebel Ali port and operates cargo terminals in ports around the globe.

Sulayem previously had a larger role as chairman of the Dubai World conglomerate, which at the time included the property developer Nakheel. That company was behind the creation of manmade islands in the shape of palm trees and a map of the world that helped cement Dubai’s status as an up-and-coming global city.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/95986da4-087e-11f1-bf82-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP18119566684616.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh Nationalist Party poised for decisive win in landmark parliamentary elections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260213-bangladesh-nationalist-party-poised-for-decisive-win-in-landmark-parliamentary-elections</link><description>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) led by Tarique Rahman is heading for a thumping win in the first elections held since a deadly 2024 uprising, Bangladeshi TV stations projected Friday.

Senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi, in a party statement, claimed a "sweeping victory", without giving figures, calling for followers to give thanks in prayer on Friday rather than celebrate on the streets.

"There will be no victory rally despite the BNP's sweeping victory," the statement said. "We will hold special prayers at mosques after Jumma (Friday) prayers across the country."

At 5:30 am (2330 GMT Thursday), broadcasters projected that the BNP had pushed well past the 150-seat threshold to secure a clear majority in parliament.

Jamuna and Somoy television channels reported that the BNP had secured 197 seats.

The Islamist-led coalition headed by Jamaat-e-Islami had won 63 seats, the stations projected, a huge leap from its past results but far short of the outright win it had campaigned for.

The results are not official and counting continues for a total of the 299 constituencies of 300 in which voting took place.

A further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.

The BNP's Rahman, 60, now poised to become the next prime minister, was bullish in the run-up to the vote.

He told AFP two days before polling he was "confident" that his party -- crushed during the 15 years of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina's autocratic rule -- would regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.

BNP election committee spokesman Mahdi Amin told reporters the party was on track to win at least two-thirds of seats.

"Buoyed by strong public support, the BNP will secure a two-thirds majority and form the government," Amin told reporters, adding that Rahman had won "both seats" he had run in.

Party workers spent the whole night in front of the BNP offices.

"We will join the nation-building effort led by Tarique Rahman," Md Fazlur Rahman, 45, told AFP.

"Over the last 17 years, we have suffered a lot, faced multiple politically motivated cases and lost a factory I owned."

The Election Commission has not released final results, suggesting it will have those ready by late Friday morning.

Heavy deployments of security forces are posted countrywide, and UN experts warned ahead of the voting of "growing intolerance, threats and attacks" and a "tsunami of disinformation".

Political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600 during campaigning, police records show.

But polling day was largely peaceful, according to the Election Commission, which reported only "a few minor disruptions".

Interim leader Muhammad Yunus, who will step down once the new government takes power, has urged all sides to stay calm.

"We may have differences of opinion, but we must remain united in the greater national interest," he said.

The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led Bangladesh since Hasina's rule ended with her ouster in August 2024.

His administration barred her Awami League party from contesting the polls.

Yunus, after casting his vote, said that the country had "ended the nightmare and begun a new dream".

Hasina, 78, sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India, where she called the vote an "illegal and unconstitutional election".

Yunus has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a "completely broken" system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.

Voters also took part in a referendum on the charter and whether to endorse its proposals for prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.

Television projections suggested the electorate had backed the charter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:32:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dab1a83e-080f-11f1-b09c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26043448902797.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU leaders back major economic overhaul to counter pressure from US, China and Russia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260213-eu-leaders-major-economic-overhaul-counter-pressure-us-china-russia</link><description>European Union leaders broadly agreed Thursday on a plan to restructure the 27-nation bloc’s economy to make it more competitive as they face antagonism from US President Donald Trump, strong-arm tactics from China and hybrid threats blamed on Russia.

Meeting in a Belgian castle, the EU leaders agreed an “action plan” with a strict timeline for the economic restructuring, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “The pressure and the sense of urgency is enormous, and that can move mountains,” she said.

The plan, to be presented formally in March, would include measures to coordinate upgrading energy grids, deepen financial integration and loosen merger regulations to allow European firms to grow to better compete globally, she said.

“We need European champions,” von der Leyen said.

European Council President António Costa described the meeting as a “real game changer” as leaders threw their weight behind plans to further integrate and simplify the bloc's financial systems.

The meeting had started with an image of unity between the two traditional power centers of the EU after each had publicly staked out different strategic positions. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz arrived together, crossing a drawbridge side by side into the 16th-century Alden Biesen castle.

“We share this sense of urgency that Europe must take action,” Macron said while standing on a blue welcome carpet next to his German counterpart.

“We want to make this European Union faster, we want to make it better, and above all we want to ensure that we have competitive industry in Europe," Merz said.

Merz and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni lead a wing of the bloc calling for deregulation, rebooting Europe's relationship with Washington and forging trade deals like the recent one struck with the Mercosur nations of South America.

The EU "cannot continue to hyperregulate," said Meloni. “There's no time to lose.”

France instead is leading a push for “strategic autonomy ” — meaning a bloc less dependent on Washington.

Macron argues that EU countries should buy exclusively from European producers as the continent pursues greater military spending as a response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. Merz and Meloni say purchases should be from both foreign and European firms.

In comments to reporters as he arrived, Macron said he was urging his partners to protect “sectors that are particularly under threat” like cleantech, chemicals, steel, the car industry and defense.

“There is also an increased pressure on us, with competition — sometimes unfair competition — that is very intense, with very strong pressure from China, tariffs imposed on us by the Americans with threats of coercive practices," Macron said.

EU leaders will also debate new financial instruments to protect the bloc in a global trading system rocked by Trump's blitzkrieg of tariffs and China's restricting of critical mineral exports.

Macron is renewing his call for the EU to be able to borrow money, which he described as “Eurobonds for the future" that would provide an opportunity “to challenge the hegemony of the dollar.”

Most leaders are calling for action along the lines of the economic stimulus strategy called for by Mario Draghi, former head of the European Central Bank. The 2024 plan includes cutting regulations, making infrastructure investments and establishing trade ties with more countries.

Both Draghi and Enrico Letta, a former Italian Prime Minister, beseeched leaders assembled in the castle to drastically restructure and integrate the bloc's economy.

“We have way too many barriers that prevent money and capital from moving from one country to another, way too many obstacles to simplification,” said Roberta Metsola, president of the European Parliament.

“No more words, but more action," said Metsola, who like Merz and von der Leyen is a leading figure in the European People’s Party, which is the largest bloc in the European Parliament and claims 13 heads of EU states as members.

Citizens across the bloc are hungry for a stronger EU and a more unified, stronger and ambitious leadership amid military threats, economic pressures and climate instability, according to an official EU poll, Eurobarometer.

“There has never been a better time for European leaders, national political leaders, to actually leverage on these European citizens’ demand for greater European action,” said Alberto Alemanno, a professor of EU law at the HEC Paris business school.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 02:32:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c47edf38-e0a9-11f0-8039-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T160040Z-1034825363-RC2VIIA1D9FS-RTRMADP-3-EU-ENVIRONMENT-PLASTICS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela postpones vote on amnesty bill to protect political dissidents</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260213-venezuela-amnesty-bill-postponed</link><description>Venezuelan lawmakers on Thursday postponed the adoption of a landmark amnesty bill designed to end the use of courts to crack down on dissent after failing to reach an agreement on how to apply it.

Thousands of opposition supporters poured into the streets of Caracas to demand the release of all remaining political prisoners before debate on the bill began.

The amnesty is expected to cover all charges brought against dissidents who opposed the rule of ousted leader Nicolas Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez over the past 27 years.

Members of the National Assembly backed the bill on a first reading last week and had been expected to adopt it on Thursday after a second reading.

But it hit a snag, with pro-government and opposition lawmakers clashing over an article requiring would-be beneficiaries to appear in court to request the amnesty.

Opposition member Nora Bracho said that the requirement was "completely unnecessary" and said the amnesty should apply automatically to all the crimes covered by the law.

Pro-government lawmaker Iris Varela, however, argued it was important for beneficiaries to "acknowledge crimes they have committed" before having the cases against them closed.

Lawmakers agreed to continue the debate on February 19.

The bill is the centerpiece of the reforms undertaken by acting President Delcy Rodriguez since Maduro's capture by US special forces in a deadly January 3 raid on Caracas.

It aims to turn the page on nearly three decades of state repression.

In an NBC News interview aired Thursday she went further, saying she was "absolutely" committed to holding free and fair elections.

"We will have elections in this country fair and free of course," she said, adding that the time frame would be decided as part of a future "political dialogue."

Rodriguez took Maduro's place with the consent of US President Donald Trump, on condition she toe his line.

The United States has taken over control of Venezuela's oil sales, with Trump vowing a share for Washington in the profits.

On Thursday, Rodriguez toured oil facilities with visiting US Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who has pushed for a "dramatic" increase in Venezuela's oil output.

The Trump administration has also pressured Rodriguez to release political prisoners.

The amnesty under debate would potentially see hundreds of activists still behind bars walk free.

More than 400 political prisoners have been released since December but over 600 remain in detention, according to rights group Foro Penal.

The relatives of some inmates chained themselves to the Zona 7 detention center in Caracas on Thursday to demand their freedom.

As the post-Maduro transition takes hold, the fear instilled by the state is beginning to dissipate.

Thousands of opposition demonstrators reclaimed the streets of Caracas on Thursday.

"We are not afraid," they chanted, in their biggest show of force in years.

"We spend a lot of time underground, silent in the face of all the repression Venezuela experienced... but today we are rising up and uniting to put forward demands for the country," Dannalice Anza, a 26-year-old geography student, told AFP.

The ruling socialist party organised a counter-demonstration that attracted thousands of pro-Maduro youths.

The amnesty bill covers charges of "treason," "terrorism" and spreading "hate" that were used to lock up dissidents.

Venezuela's attorney general Tarek William Saab told AFP that it should apply to opposition members and "chavistas," as supporters of Chavez and Maduro are known, alike.

That included Maduro himself, he said.

The amnesty also lifts bans on several opposition members, including Nobel Peace laureate Maria Corina Machado, on running for office.

Machado, a figure of hate for Chavistas, who is living in exile in the United States, has said she wants to return home soon.

Asked by NBC about Machado's eventual return, Rodriguez said ensuring her safety was "not something that is up to me."

She added that Machado would "have to answer to Venezuela" about her support for US sanctions and military action in the country.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 04:53:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ca0844fa-0889-11f1-b602-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26043830149988.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea warns of ‘terrible response’ over South Korean drone flights</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260213-north-korea-warns-of-terrible-response-over-south-korean-drone-flights</link><description>North Korea on Friday threatened a "terrible response" if it detects any more drones buzzing across the border from the South.

South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has sought to repair ties with North Korea since taking office last year, criticising his predecessor for allegedly sending drones to scatter propaganda over Pyongyang.

But North Korea claims it shot down a surveillance drone just last month, an incident which threatens to blight Lee's efforts to patch things up.

Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, warned of severe repercussions if the drones did not stop.

"I give advance warning that reoccurrence of such provocation as violating the inalienable sovereignty of the DPRK will surely provoke a terrible response," Kim said in a statement carried by Pyongyang's official Korea Central News Agency.

"We don't care who the very manipulator of the drone infiltration into the airspace of the DPRK is and whether it is an individual or a civilian organisation," she added, using the acronym for North Korea's official name.

Seoul initially denied any official involvement in the January drone incursion, with officials suggesting it was the work of civilians.

But a joint military-police task force announced earlier this week it was investigating three active-duty soldiers and one spy agency staffer in an effort to "thoroughly establish the truth".

Seoul's unification minister Chung Dong-young expressed "deep regret" earlier this week.

Any government involvement in the January drone incursion would run counter to Lee's efforts to lower the temperature with Pyongyang.

Chung has previously suggested the drone may have been the work of government staffers still loyal to former hardline leader Yoon Suk Yeol.

Kim Yo Jong said that Chung's conciliatory remarks were "quite sensible behaviour".

The statement by Kim Yo Jong suggests that Pyongyang is "closely monitoring the latest developments in the South Korean side", Yang Moo-jin, former president of the University of North Korean Studies, told AFP.

The North Korean military downed a drone carrying "surveillance equipment" in early January, according to a statement published by the state-run KCNA.

Photos showed the wreckage of a winged craft scattered across the ground next to a collection of grey and blue components that allegedly included cameras.

The drone had stored footage of "important targets" including border areas, a military spokesman said at the time.

South Korea's disgraced ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol was accused of using unmanned drones to scatter propaganda leaflets over North Korea in 2024.

Lee has vowed to mend ties with North Korea by stamping out such provocations, and has even suggested a rare apology may be warranted.

A UN Security Council committee recently approved exemptions allowing fresh flows of food and medicine into North Korea.

Analysts said this could kickstart efforts to lure Pyongyang into nuclear negotiations with US President Donald Trump.

North Korea is preparing to hold a landmark party congress at the end of February.

The political showcase -- typically held just once every five years -- will lay out the nation's foreign policy, war planning and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 04:53:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/77237f78-fbe8-11f0-bf52-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2c84dbc130e920a26daf0358e542f48706ebb0e8.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Rubio says he will have chance to meet Ukraine’s Zelensky at Munich security forum</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260213-live-rubio-says-he-will-have-chance-to-meet-ukraine-s-zelensky-at-munich-security-forum</link><description>A Russian ​drone attack killed one person and wounded six others at one of the ports ​in ‌Ukraine's Odesa region on the ⁠Black Sea, Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba ‌said on Friday.

"Russia launched massive strikes ⁠on port and railway infrastructure," he wrote on Telegram,

Infrastructure of a business, ​fertiliser warehouses and vehicles, including ‌freight wagons, were damaged, Kuleba said, adding the attack sparked a fire.

Kuleba did ‌not name the port. Facilities at the three ​Black Sea ports around the city of Odesa have been frequent targets, and the ​region also houses the Danube ​River ports.

US ​Secretary ​of State Marco Rubio said ‌he ⁠would ‌have a chance to ⁠meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky ​at ‌this week's Munich Security Conference.

Rubio, who is leading a large US delegation this week to the annual defence and security forum this week, made the ​comment to reporters before leaving Washington.

Russia pounded Ukraine ​with drones and ballistic missiles overnight on Thursday, further battering

its energy system and leaving tens of thousands in the capital Kyiv and the cities of Dnipro and Odesa without heat, power and water, officials said.

Russia has intensified its winter campaign of strikes on Ukraine's power grid, plunging ​major cities into ‌long periods of cold and darkness in freezing temperatures.

In Kyiv alone, around 3,500 apartment buildings were ⁠without heating on Thursday after the latest attack knocked out supplies to nearly 2,600 high-rises, on top of the 1,100 already affected by previous strikes, said Mayor Vitali Klitschko.

French President Emmanuel Macron said he does not expect to speak with his Russian counterpart President Vladimir Putin in the coming days, insisting that European nations first need to agree on what they want from Moscow.

Britain and its allies have pledged some €30 billion in military aid for Ukraine, British defence ​minister John ​Healey told a press conference after a meeting of ‌the Ukraine Defence Contact Group.

Norway announced it was buying a "large volume" of French glide bombs as part of a bilateral agreement to support Ukraine militarily against Russia's invasion.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 07:11:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b8eaedf0-088c-11f1-926f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26043830930295.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: French astronaut Sophie Adenot set for launch to International Space Station</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260213-live-french-astronaut-sophie-adenot-set-for-launch-to-international-space-station-iss</link><description>The pre-dawn launch at Cape Canaveral was delayed by two days over adverse weather forecasts across the US East Coast. It will bring the orbiting space station back to full staff after a month of operating with a skeleton crew .

Crew-12 is composed of Americans Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, along with Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev and France's Sophie Adenot , who will become the second Frenchwoman to travel into space after pioneer Claudie Haigneré.

The crew of four have now boarded the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.

Still two hours to go, at least, before the Falcon 9 rocket lifts them into space.

Once the astronauts finally arrive, they will be one of the last crews to live aboard the orbiting laboratory, which is roughly the size of a football pitch.

Continuously inhabited for the last quarter century, the ageing ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth's orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030.

The premature departure of Crew-11 has left the space station with just three remaining staff members: Russians Sergey Kud-Sverchkov and Sergei Mikayev, as well as NASA astronaut Chris Williams.

The four-member crew have waved to friends and family, and made their way to the launch complex at Cape Canaveral.

Adenot, 43, will become only the second French woman to fly to space, following in the footsteps of Claudie Haigneré, who spent time on the Mir space station.

Adenot was 14 when she saw Haigneré's mission blast off.

"It was a revelation," the helicopter pilot told a recent briefing. "At that moment, I told myself: one day, that will be me."

Adenot began her professional career at Airbus before joining the French Air Force at the age of 23. She made history in 2019 by becoming France's first woman helicopter test pilot.

She was chosen as one of just five candidates from a pool of 22,500 applicants for the European Space Agency's astronaut selection programme.

The launch has been delayed by two days over adverse weather forecasts across the US East Coast, including high winds that could have complicated any potential emergency manoeuvres.

The US space agency is now targeting a pre-dawn launch for the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, with a window opening at 5:15am local time. That’s 11:15am Paris time (1015 GMT).

Adenot and her fellow travellers will replace Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned in the first medical evacuation in the space station's history.

The ISS , a scientific laboratory orbiting 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three.

NASA has declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the mission short.

A SpaceX capsule will soon be ferrying four astronauts to the International Space Station, including France's Sophie Adenot.

The delayed launch will bring the orbiting station back to full staff after a month of operating with a skeleton crew following a medical evacuation.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 08:03:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eeb30f60-0820-11f1-8139-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26042627835788.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One person dead and hundreds of thousands without power after Storm Nils lashes France</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260213-one-person-dead-and-hundreds-of-thousands-without-power-after-storm-nils-lashes-france</link><description>Around 450,000 households in southern France were without power on Friday, operator Enedis said, a day after a storm tore through the region, ripping up trees and flooding roads.

High winds and hard rain brought chaos across southern France, northern Spain and parts of Portugal on Thursday, forcing cancellations of flights, trains and ferries and disruption on roads.

French officials said a truck driver was killed when a tree smashed through his windscreen, while dozens were injured in weather-related incidents in Spain and a viaduct in Portugal partially collapsed because of flooding.

French forecasters said the storm, named Nils, was "unusually strong" and France's electricity distributor said it had mobilised around 3,000 as it battled to reconnect households to the grid.

"Enedis has restored service to 50 percent of the 900,000 customers who were without electricity," it wrote around 6am (0500 GMT).

"Flooding complicates repairs because the fields are waterlogged and some roads are blocked," Enedis crisis director Herve Champenois said during a press briefing on Thursday.

Storm Nils comes on the heels of three other episodes of extreme weather which caused severe flooding, claimed several lives and forced the evacuation of thousands of people in Spain and Portugal.

Residents across the south of France were shocked at the storm's ferocity.

"During the night, you could hear tiles lifting, rubbish bins rolling down the street – it was crazy," said Eugenie Ferrier, 32, from the village of Roaillan near Bordeaux in the southwest.

Forecasters said the storm had moved eastwards away from French territory during Thursday, though some areas were still on alert for flooding.

Scientists say the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events is due to climate change linked to rising greenhouse gas emissions.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 08:03:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fc247482-08a6-11f1-b3fd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/81909fdafbc2760ba2552fe9effe7c2b1975d208.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan seizes Chinese fishing boat and arrests captain</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260213-japan-seizes-chinese-fishing-boat-and-arrests-captain</link><description>Japan seized a Chinese fishing boat and arrested its skipper, authorities said Friday, an incident that could worsen an already tense relationship between the Asian giants.

The episode on Thursday off southern Japan came three months after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested that Japan would intervene militarily if Beijing sought to take Taiwan by force.

Takaichi said Monday that under her leadership Japan – which hosts some 60,000 US military personnel – would bolster its defences and "steadfastly protect" its territory .

China swiftly reacted to the seizure, the Japanese fisheries' agency first since 2022 of a Chinese fishing boat, by urging Japan to protect the rights of Chinese crew.

"It is hoped Japan strictly respects the China-Japan fisheries agreement, fairly enforces the law and safeguards the safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese crew members," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian told a news conference on Friday.

Japan's fisheries agency said the vessel's captain was ordered to stop for an inspection, but the boat "failed to comply and fled".

"Consequently, the vessel's captain was arrested on the same day," the agency said in a statement.

The boat was inside Japan's exclusive economic zone 166 kilometres south-southwest of Meshima island in the Goto archipelago, Japan's statement said – not a disputed area.

The captain was named as Chinese national Zheng Nianli, 47. The status of the other 10 people on board the vessel, named the Qiong Dong Yu, was unclear.

"To prevent illegal fishing operations by foreign vessels, we will continue to take firm action and engage in enforcement activities," chief government spokesman Minoru Kihara said.

China has a number of territorial tussles with Japan, and there have been repeated incidents around the Senkaku Islands, known as the Diaoyu in China.

The 2010 arrest of another Chinese fishing boat captain off those islands in the East China Sea became a major diplomatic incident.

Japan and China have close economic ties but Takaichi's comments about Taiwan have sent relations spiralling downwards again.

China has long insisted that Taiwan, occupied for decades by Japan until 1945, is its territory and has not ruled out force to achieve "reunification".

Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te told AFP in an interview this week that other countries – including Japan – would be China's next targets should Beijing seize the democratically governed island.

"The next countries under threat would be Japan, the Philippines , and others in the Indo-Pacific region, with repercussions eventually reaching the Americas and Europe," Lai said.

After Takaichi's comments, Beijing summoned Tokyo's ambassador, warned Chinese citizens against visiting Japan and conducted joint air drills with Russia.

In December, J-15 jets from China's Liaoning aircraft carrier twice locked radar on Japanese aircraft in international waters near Okinawa, according to Japan.

China also tightened controls on exports to Japan for items with potential military uses, fuelling worries that Beijing may choke supplies of vital rare-earth minerals.

Japan's last two pandas were even returned to China last month.

Takaichi, 64, was seen as a China hawk before becoming Japan's first woman prime minister in October.

She won a landslide victory in snap elections on Sunday, putting her in a strong position for the next four years to stamp her mark on Japanese domestic and foreign policy.

Takaichi said that she was "open to various dialogues with China".

But China's foreign ministry said "genuine dialogue should be built on respect for one another".

"Proclaiming dialogue with one's mouth while engaging in confrontation – no one will accept this kind of dialogue," foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said Tuesday.

"If Japan truly wants to develop a strategic and mutually beneficial relationship with China, it's very easy and clear: withdraw Takaichi's erroneous remarks about Taiwan," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 10:07:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e0ca5f46-088b-11f1-87a6-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/7110c67fbaafdd90637cad1dbff007b41fe145f0.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's decision to ban Palestine Action as terrorist group was unlawful, court rules</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260213-uk-s-decision-to-ban-palestine-action-as-terrorist-group-was-unlawful-court-rules</link><description>Britain’s High Court has ruled that the government’s decision to outlaw the protest group Palestine Action as a terrorist organisation was unlawful.

The group ⁠was proscribed in July after having increasingly targeted Israel-linked defence companies in ‌Britain with non-violent "direct action", often blocking entrances or spraying red ⁠paint.

Judges Victoria Sharp, Jonathan Swift and Karen Steyn said “the nature and scale of Palestine Action’s activities” did not meet the "level, scale and persistence" that would justify proscription.

They said, though, that the ban will remain in place while the government considers whether to appeal.

British ​interior minister Shabana ​Mahmood said on Friday she intended to ​appeal the ruling.

"I am disappointed ‌by the court's ​decision and disagree with the notion that banning ​this terrorist ​organisation is disproportionate," ​Mahmood said in ​a statement. "I intend to fight this judgment in the ⁠Court of Appeal."

Last year the UK government declared the pro-Palestinian group a terrorist organisation alongside the likes of al Qaeda and Hamas , making membership in or support for Palestine Action a crime punishable by up to 14 years in prison.

Since then, more than 2,000 people, some in their 80s, have been arrested for holding signs saying, “I support Palestine Action.”

The government banned Palestine Action after activists broke into a Royal Air Force base in June to protest British military support for Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza. The activists sprayed red paint into the engines of two tanker planes and caused further damage with crowbars.

Palestine Action has carried out direct action protests at military and industrial sites in the UK since it formed in 2020, including breaking into facilities owned by Israeli weapons manufacturer Elbit Systems UK. Officials say the group’s actions have caused millions of pounds in damage and affected national security.

Supporters of Palestine Action and civil liberties groups say the arrests for peaceful protest ride roughshod over free speech and the right to protest.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 11:08:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6666f75a-08c7-11f1-93d2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25328528982116.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron calls for 'mandatory electoral bans' for people guilty of anti-Semitic or racist acts</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260213-macron-calls-for-mandatory-electoral-bans-for-people-guilty-of-anti-semitic-or-racist-acts</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron Friday denounced what he described as an "anti-Semitic hydra" that had crept into "every crack" of society as he commemorated Ilan Halimi , a French Jewish man tortured to death in 2006 .

In a crime that horrified France two decades ago, Halimi was kidnapped by a gang of around 20 young people in January 2006 and tortured in a low-income housing estate in the Paris suburb of Bagneux. Found more than three weeks later after the kidnappers had failed to extort a ransom payment from his family, the 23-year-old died on the way to hospital.

Prosecutors at the time described the 28-year-old gang leader Youssouf Fofana as a "perverted megalomaniac" who instructed accomplices to target Jews for ransom kidnappings "because they are loaded with dough".

"In 20 years, and despite the resolute efforts of our police officers, gendarmes, judges, teachers and elected officials, the anti-Semitic hydra has kept advancing," Macron said.

"Constantly assuming new faces, it has insinuated itself into the heart of our societies, into every crevice, too often accompanied by that same pact of cowardice: to keep silent, to refuse to see."

Speaking at the presidential palace, Macron decried what he called "Islamist anti-Semitism which was behind the pogrom of October 7", referring to the attack against Israel on October 7, 2023 led by Palestinian militant group Hamas .

The term "pogrom" refers to violent attacks on Jews because of their religion.

He also attacked what he described as "far-left antisemitism", saying it "rivals that of the far right ", and "anti-Semitism that uses the mask of anti-Zionism to advance quietly".

Macron also said he wanted "mandatory electoral bans" for officials guilty of "anti-Semitic, racist, and discriminatory acts and remarks".

"All too often, the sentences handed down against the perpetrators of anti-Semitic offenses and crimes seem derisory," he said.

"Government and parliament will work to strengthen the penalties for anti-Semitic and racist acts," he added.

France is home to western Europe's largest Jewish population, at around half a million people, as well as a significant Muslim community sensitive to the plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza and occupied Palestinian territories.

Members of France's Jewish community have said the number of anti-Semitic acts has surged following the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023.

Israel's military campaign in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip has since killed more than 72,000 people, health authorities say, most of them believed to be women and children.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 13:00:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2bfd4a0a-08d7-11f1-8ad5-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-13T120152Z-260647907-RC2ZKJAMVBLM-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-ANTISEMITISM.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A born astronaut': France's Sophie Adenot makes history with flight to space</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/science/20260213-a-born-astronaut-france-s-sophie-adenot-makes-history-with-flight-to-space</link><description>When she was growing up, Sophie Adenot plastered her childhood bedroom with posters of rockets launching from Cape Canaveral.

On Friday, she blasted off from that very launchpad, fulfilling her childhood dream and becoming just the second French woman to fly to space.

Adenot is one of four astronauts now heading towards the International Space Station to replace a crew that was evacuated last month because of an unidentified medical issue.

For the next eight months, the 43-year-old helicopter test pilot will conduct scientific experiments on the football field-sized station 400 kilometres above Earth.

Adenot has been dreaming of this moment since 1996, when she watched on television as France's first female astronaut Claudie Haigneré blasted off towards the Mir space station.

"I was 14 years old and it was a revelation," Adenot recently told a press conference.

"At that moment, I told myself: one day, that will be me."

Haigneré told AFP that Adenot is both her "heir" and a "pioneer" in her own right.

"Sophie is a born astronaut," Haignere added.

After two days of delays, Adenot, NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway as well as Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev launched on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral on Friday.

They are scheduled to arrive at the ISS on Saturday, where they will relieve a skeleton crew of three astronauts.

As a teenager growing up in central France, Adenot cut space photos out of magazines and stuck them above her desk.

They were a source of motivation when she was studying maths, "which seemed so far removed from the space adventure I dreamt of," Adenot recently told a podcast.

She would go on to study at prestigious universities including MIT, and work at European aerospace giant Airbus as a helicopter cockpit designer.

Adenot credits her grandfather, a mechanic in France's air force, for giving her a love of "taking things apart and fixing them".

As a helicopter pilot, she completed two tours in Afghanistan, specialising in search and rescue missions.

Adenot then became France's first female helicopter test pilot in 2018.

"I love adventure, the unknown, facing improbable situations and seeing how we overcome them – whether as a team or alone," she said.

But while logging 3,000 flight hours and 120 combat missions, Adenot never stopped dreaming of space.

She first applied to be a European Space Agency astronaut in 2008 when she was just 25 – but was rejected.

However in 2022 she was selected out of 22,000 candidates, and embarked on three years of intense training to get ready for Friday's launch.

It has been a "tsunami" that has completely changed her life, the mother of a teenager has said.

Adenot will be busy on board the orbiting scientific lab, participating in more than 200 experiments.

Research will include microgravity's effect on the human body, including measuring how her time in orbit impacts her memory.

She will also test a system that uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to allow astronauts to carry out their own medical ultrasounds.

But it will not be all work.

French chef Anne-Sophie Pic, who has 10 Michelin stars, has prepared a menu for Adenot that includes lobster bisque and foie gras.

She has also recorded the sounds of birds singing, footsteps crunching on snow and flowing streams to remind her of life back on that blue planet she can see out of the window.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 13:00:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c3088096-08d1-11f1-b2b8-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/c6fceb29daa8976102dace21b036bff9f3f6567a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'I'll rip your head off': Gang's grip over gold mines sows terror in Peru's La Pampa</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260213-peru-gang-guardianes-trocha-controls-gold-mines-spreads-terror-la-pampa</link><description>This article was written by Forbidden Stories journalist Emmanuel Colombié in partnership with the nature conservation news website Mongabay Latam.

The once-lush forest is now little more than a wasteland. For 15 years, illegal miners have been setting up camp in La Pampa, in southeastern Peru , in the department of Madre de Dios.

Previously covered in tropical jungle, the area surrounding the Interoceanic Highway has become a living hell . Every day, men tear up the ground and pollute the waterways.

“Birds don’t like the mine. They’ve all left,” said Diego Torres,* a farmer with a front-row seat to the gold fever that has seized his region. For the past two years, orange mud has covered his plot, along with fuel canisters and scraps of wood and metal. Torres’ dogs wallow in patches of oil-stained land. Here and there, miners have left huge metal pipes abandoned among dying palm trees.

Upon arriving at Torres’ farm, the roar of dredgers and gold-extraction machinery is immediately audible. Visible between the dead foliage, the looters are hard at work. Near a washing ramp, designed to trap gold particles on a mat, several men stand guard – over Torres’ own land.

Torres says as soon as they arrived, he reported the looters to the Specialised Environmental Prosecutor’s Offices of Peru, also called FEMA. Police visited him in March 2024, but the miners were not there that day, apparently tipped off in advance. A few days later, they were back to work with total impunity, under the protection of armed men, less than a kilometre from an active military base.

Determined to defend his land, Torres has already confronted the illegal miners on his property. He says he is not afraid of them. However, Torres is reluctant to discuss Guardianes de la Trocha, the criminal group that controls gold-extraction activities in La Pampa. “Through intermediaries, they told me not to oppose the miners, not to say anything or to leave, otherwise they could eliminate me … But where could I go? I have nowhere else to go,” he said.

Keep quiet or face death threats: independent journalist Manuel Calloquispe deals with the same dilemma. For more than a decade, he has been one of the only local reporters documenting and denouncing the activities of illegal gold miners in the region. He has paid a steep price. Calloquispe has been beaten and had his equipment stolen, and he has lost count of the threats and intimidation he has received – even from right outside his home.

In 2022, Calloquispe’s family had to leave Puerto Maldonado, the capital of Madre de Dios. With danger growing, in January 2025, the journalist decided to join Forbidden Stories’ SafeBox Network to protect sensitive documents: the product of years of investigations.

In early 2025, Calloquispe was investigating Edison Fernandez Perez, alias Chili, one of the two leaders of Guardianes de la Trocha. In an investigation published on the Inforegion website, he revealed the seizure of numerous weapons and shed light on the gang’s internal struggles.

On August 28, 2025, a few days before releasing his article, Calloquispe received a chilling phone call. On the other end, he recognised Alver Carranza Fernandez, Chili’s lieutenant. The warning was unambiguous: “I’m going to rip your head off … Who will speak when you’re gone? You’ve already been identified. We’re going to kill your son, your brother. We know where you are, we know where your family is.”

Shaken by the call, Calloquispe says he had to stop publishing and left the city to go into hiding for the fourth time since 2011. With his consent, in October 2025, Forbidden Stories and publication partner Mongabay Latam decided to travel to Madre de Dios to continue his work.

Watch more Lords of Gold: the gangs’ grip on Peru’s mines

Calloquispe has tirelessly documented and denounced the activities of Guardianes de la Trocha, which has spread terror in La Pampa for nearly 15 years. Madre de Dios is Peru’s least populated department – but one saturated with gold. The country’s Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Institute estimates that it now accounts for 11% of national production.

As the main artisanal mining area in Peru, Madre de Dios is home to widespread illegal gold mining, which has exploded there since the Interoceanic Highway opened in 2011, according to the Centre for Amazonian Scientific Innovation. The center notes that deforestation is directly linked to gold mining and has increased by 425% since the new paved road made the region more accessible.

Logging and agricultural operations, primary forests, private property: In this region, nothing can withstand the gold rush and its immense damage. By mid-2025, 97.5% of the 139,169 hectares of forest that illegal mining has destroyed in Peru were in Madre de Dios, according to the Monitoring of the Andes Amazon Program, or MAAP.

La Pampa lies in the province of Tambopata, home to a national nature reserve popular with tourists and boasting some of the richest biodiversity in Latin America.

Since 2011, Guardianes de la Trocha has ruled La Pampa with an iron fist, controlling most illegal gold production there. At first, the gang consisted of a handful of men providing security for artisanal mines. Their power grew as mining expanded on both sides of the Interoceanic Highway, until they were able to impose their own law.

“Starting in 2013, Guardianes de la Trocha set up tolls, managed mine security and began killing. In 2015, there was a second wave of violence: no one could enter La Pampa without their authorisation,” said Rodrigo*, a La Pampa resident whose name has been changed as a security precaution. The gang killed one of his relatives for opposing its invasion of his family’s forestry concession.

Meeting Rodrigo means passing through a heavily armored door protecting the entrance to his property. The site is a veritable bunker, with barbed wire surrounding each of the farmhouses. A witness to the gang’s rise, Rodrigo’s own life has come under threat.

“In 2017, a line was crossed: extortion increased, they started calling themselves ‘Security,’ and they brought in their own machines to extract gold. During the pandemic, they took over all extraction sites, and starting in 2022, they began to show themselves openly in public,” Rodrigo said. “After the murder, we thought about leaving, but my parents didn’t want to, so we decided to stay and confront them.”

Unfortunately, Rodrigo’s family is not the only one this climate of violence has affected. Having cross-referenced official information, police sources and his own work, journalist Calloquispe estimates that at least 400 people may have been murdered or gone missing since 2014. “There are students, transport workers and taxi drivers who went into La Pampa and never came out,” he said.

In 2025, mining was Peru’s main source of foreign income, according to the Ministry of Energy and Mines. The High Commissioner for the Fight against Illegal Mining, Rodolfo García Esquerre, states that in 2024, “Peru exported around 180 tonnes of gold, but of that amount, at least 80 were of unknown origin,” citing the Peruvian Institute of Economics (IPE). This think tank considers that 44% of the illegal gold extracted in South America comes from Peru and that, over the past two decades, “the volume of illegal gold exports has increased eight-fold and, by the end of 2025, will reach that of legal gold.”

“In 2024, this amount was almost six times higher than what was generated by the illegal drug trafficking economy, which amounted to around 1.2 billion dollars,” García Esquerre adds.

Boosted by soaring gold prices, these organisations have built up arsenals over the years to protect their increasingly lucrative business.

With this weaponry, Guardianes de la Trocha sows fear throughout La Pampa. “Since June 2025, it’s gone crazy. You’d need a tank here to fight back, because there are between 40 and 60 people armed with machine guns, submachine guns and grenades,” Rodrigo said. He revealed his own gear: a rifle, a pistol and even a drone, which he intends to use to protect his family in the event of another invasion.

Watch more Forests worth more alive than dead

Police echo the same concern, as described by Commander Carazas, the imposing head of the Criminal Investigation Division in Madre de Dios. Forbidden Stories met him in his small office in Puerto Maldonado, cluttered with stacks of files. “Brayan has military-grade, heavy-caliber equipment and Uzi machine guns,” he said, in reference to one of Guardianes de la Trocha’s current leaders. “We don’t have enough people to fight that.”

On surveillance footage journalist Calloquispe obtained, Chili and several dozen men move around La Pampa heavily armed, equipped with bulletproof vests and night-vision goggles. Some of them wear police uniforms. One clip shows the daylight execution of Ana Denisse García Solsol on Jan. 10, 2025. In the streets of the village of Virgen de la Candelaria, this trade unionist – who was responsible for allocating municipal land – is shot dead by armed men in the back of pickup trucks. The killers disappear to cries of “Viva el Chili.”

This well-equipped private army, ready to kill, is therefore fully capable of protecting illegal mining activities. To guard extraction sites, “they hire retired police officers as security agents,” Carazas said.

Although illegal mining is a punishable offense in Peru, the purchase of small quantities of gold is poorly controlled. As a result, impunity reigns, fueling the informal economy. Once extracted from the mines, clandestine gold is easily resold in “acopiadoras", authorised collection shops where anyone can sell nuggets in exchange for a simple receipt.

Opening one of these shops requires going through a series of government-imposed procedures. The law mandates that individual gold purchases over $10,000 and cumulative purchases of up to $50,000 per month be declared. Below those thresholds, gold is virtually untraceable. Each individual encountered during reporting attested to this difficulty. In a lawless area like La Pampa, the subject is extremely sensitive and dangerous.

Over the years, Calloquispe has tried to investigate the origins and destinations of illegally mined gold. According to the journalist, before the coronavirus pandemic, “Guardianes de la Trocha extorted shops already established in the area in exchange for their security services. Then from 2024, they gradually took control of the existing shops by placing family members and friends there, and by creating their own collection centres.”

Rodrigo confirms this takeover of the gold collection process. “Security sees everything. They even have surveillance cameras in front of wherever they buy gold,” he said.

What happens to the precious nuggets next? Guardianes de la Trocha may have entered into agreements with gold export companies, according to Calloquispe’s observations and information. These companies reportedly finance the shops at a rate of one Peruvian sol (around 0.25 euros) per gram of gold collected.

The accumulated gold is then allegedly transported overland in convoys protected by company personnel, gang members and sometimes even the local police, towards the regions of Puno and Arequipa or into neighbouring countries to be smelted and reintroduced into the legal circuit.

According to Cesar Ipenza, a lawyer specialising in environmental issues, illegal gold mined in La Pampa takes several routes. The main one leads to neighboring Bolivia , where the metal is exported as Bolivian gold. Other channels pass through the Peruvian department of Cusco before reaching the capital, Lima. “It wouldn’t be surprising if the gold went through Brazil ,” Ipenza said. “I’ve taken that road, and checks are almost non-existent.”

Calloquispe estimates that the amount of gold extracted in La Pampa “could exceed 40 tons per year", the equivalent of $6.55 billion calculated from the price of gold on January 26, 2026.

Faced with vast gold volumes, an opaque supply chain and rampant corruption, the state appears powerless. The rapid spread of illegal gold mines has also benefited from weak regulation, despite the Ministry of Energy and Mines establishing the Comprehensive Mining Formalisation Registry, or REINFO, in 2016. Originally, the system was meant to enable artisanal operations to legalise their activities by committing to comply with environmental standards within a limited period, without ceasing to operate.

But the system has proved deeply flawed: Deadlines for meeting environmental criteria, initially set for 2020, have been extended until December 2026. The registry can also provide cover for gangs that simply appropriate the forms of duly registered miners.

“In practice, there is no oversight mechanism,” said Ipenza. “And what often happens is that the REINFO is simply rented out.” According to the lawyer, people who illegally rent or buy REINFO forms transport and sell gold as if it came from concessions they genuinely operate.

As of January 26, 2026, of the 31,628 miners registered with REINFO across Peru, only 23,809 are reportedly valid. In other words, nearly a quarter of them appear to be operating without any oversight. In Madre de Dios, that proportion rises to ¾ of the miners. In the province of Tambopata, where La Pampa is located, 1,021 of the 1,489 concessions registered benefit from this legal gray area and operate with free rein. They do so under the governance of authorities that seem to have neither the resources nor the capabilities needed to stop them.

Nevertheless, the Peruvian government launched the high-profile Operation Mercury in 2019 to “totally eradicate” La Pampa’s illegal mines, according to the defence minister at the time. Some 25,000 miners were expelled from the area, and MAAP indicates deforestation fell by 92% that same year.

Shortly after these expulsions, the government sought to implement a “restoration plan” to promote new activities in La Pampa and, above all, extend the fight against illegal gold mining to the entire department of Madre de Dios and the regions of Cusco and Puno.

However, due to a lack of resources and political will, it was unsuccessful, and the miners who had been expelled not only retained control of new mining areas but also returned en masse to La Pampa. By 2023, the number of mining infrastructures had jumped by 400% compared to 2021, according to MAAP.

Smaller-scale, less publicised interventions coordinated by police and prosecutors to seize or destroy illegal miners’ equipment also tend to prove ineffective. Well-informed miners often hide their machines in waterways and leave the area before police arrive. “They just have to wait a few days and retrieve them from the bottom of the water. We don’t have the means to bring them to the surface,” explained a representative of FEMA, which is responsible for these operations.

Forbidden Stories and Mongabay Latam met with this representative in Puerto Maldonado. Fearing for her life, she chose to remain anonymous and took numerous precautions before the meeting, which happened in a discreet location. “My family doesn’t live with me here; it’s too dangerous,” she said, before sharing a video that showed miners fleeing as the FEMA team arrived.

Worse still, these operations are sometimes nothing more than staged interventions designed to boost official statistics and feed corruption. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a local official, well-informed about government action against illegal mining, elaborated.

“I was told that during an intervention, three machines out of 10 are destroyed,” he said. “Why? What’s the theory that always circulates? That they only destroy the ones they don’t pay for. Then they give false information about the operations. … Police information differs from FEMA’s, and the law doesn’t allow operations without FEMA present.”

“Gold brings in more money than drug trafficking here.”

A senior official at the Madre de Dios Prosecutor’s Office, speaking anonymously

In response to Forbidden Stories’ questions, the FEMA representative agreed. “We have very few convictions,” he said, on the topic of illegal mining. “I would say that it doesn’t even reach 5% of cases. We need new legal measures. We need to hit these miners financially with operational bans, pretrial detention and sanctions. The problem is that there’s populist rhetoric and so much money at stake that the current situation benefits everyone. Those who denounce it are seen as enemies of the people.”

Following requests for comment, Frank Almanza Altamirano, the prosecutor in charge of national coordination for FEMA, said that in 2025 in Madre de Dios, six people were placed in pretrial detention and 84 convictions were handed down for various offences related to illegal gold mining. He added that 193 operations to shut down clandestine mines had been co-ordinated in the department. But these figures cannot hide the unbridled corruption in La Pampa or the inertia of authorities, who constantly pass the buck from one department to another.

When he met with Forbidden Stories and Mongabay Latam in Puerto Maldonado, a senior official at the Madre de Dios Prosecutor’s Office, who requested anonymity, admitted his powerlessness and openly denounced the endemic corruption in his department. “I don’t work with the local police because they’re corrupt; I try to work with Lima. We need undercover personnel who are fresh and focused,” he said.

In this official’s view, every authority responsible for fighting illegal mining is corrupt. “It’s like a giant pizza. Everyone takes their slice: the police, the justice system, the navy, the army, the SUNAT … and there’s a lot to go around. Gold brings in more money than drug trafficking here,” he said.

The senior official also deplores the lack of coordination between agencies. “There are two or three cases here linked to Guardianes de la Trocha, but you have to check with the Organised Crime Prosecutor. His office is right next to mine, but I don’t know him; we’ve never spoken,” he said.

Calloquispe is all too familiar with the authorities’ shortcomings. “You can’t trust anyone,” he said. A few days after receiving threats from Fernandez, Chili’s lieutenant, he filed a complaint. The police, who were supposed to patrol around his home, allegedly leaked photos of his house to the local press, putting him in serious danger.

Rodrigo went a step further in his assessment of the authorities. “Illegal mining is run by the police. Everyone turns a blind eye. It’s the Prosecutor’s Office and the police who make the most money. And as soon as someone speaks out, they’re eliminated. It’s hard to live here,” he said. The army and police have four bases in the La Pampa area.

“The military and police bases are corrupt,” said a former state official specialising in forest conservation policies in the region, speaking anonymously. “There are hundreds of troops deployed, but they’re nowhere to be seen. They patrol, but they don’t intervene.”

“When I drive through La Pampa, I go 100 kph and don’t stop, because people recognise me,” said Carazas, the police commander from Madre de Dios. In the world of gold, the kingpins make the rules. And Guardianes de la Trocha are diversifing their activities. Now, “to launder their money, they are building hotels, synthetic football fields and private schools,” Carazas said.

Calloquispe recently discovered that Chili, himself a fugitive sentenced to 15 years in prison, had allegedly put a price of 30,000 sols (just over 7,500 euros) on his head. Calloquispe says his editors don’t want to publish his findings anymore for fear of suffering heavy reprisals themselves. He no longer goes out in Puerto Maldonado without his bulletproof vest.

The Ministry of the Interior, the army, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines did not respond to Forbidden Stories’ and Mongabay Latam’s requests for comment.

This week, the Basque Coast Hospital Centre (CHCB) in Bayonne was the latest to appeal to the public to help fund urgent needs and purchase medicine, medical devices and vaccines through what it calls "citizen loans".

Under the scheme, people lend money to public hospitals that later reimburse them, with interest.

The model has emerged in France over the past few years, with several hospitals and nursing homes inviting people to invest in their healthcare facilities.

The CHCB hopes to raise €1.5 million, the largest sum ever targeted by a French medical facility in such an operation.

Supporters see the loans as an ingenious way to reconnect hospitals with the people they serve.

But critics say such loans are a symptom of a healthcare system under severe strain , with hospitals forced to pass the hat around the community.

The loan "offers citizens the opportunity to participate directly in financing its cash flow needs related to essential healthcare purchases: medicine, medical devices, vaccines, and sampling equipment", the Basque Coast hospital said.

The hospital, which has several sites, notably in the towns of Bayonne and Saint-Jean-de-Luz, said it had received institutional funding but the payments were delayed, and it needed to fund its regular purchases.

A person can invest as little as €1 and will be reimbursed "at the end of 12 months" in a single payment, with interest set at 3.1 percent, a rate that exceeds that of France's popular Livret A savings account.

The operation is being carried out via the start-up Villyz, a government-approved platform.

The Basque Coast hospital praises what it calls a "virtuous" financing model that "diversifies" its funding sources and lets people invest their savings in a product that is "useful, transparent and local".

But it comes against a backdrop of tight finances. In 2024, the CHCB recorded a deficit of €21 million on a budget of around €400 million.

Across France, hospitals' accounts are in the red: the system's overall deficit reached an estimated €2.7 billion to €2.9 billion in 2024, according to official data.

Villyz began offering the scheme to hospitals last year, claiming to be the only platform doing so.

It collects only "application fees that depend on the amount raised", typically amounting to several thousand euros, said its president, Arthur Moraglia.

Through the scheme, a hospital in the northeastern town of Haguenau raised €100,000 to purchase new windows, and a hospital in Evreux in the northwest raised the same amount to add beds.

Two nursing homes in southeastern France have funded improvements, and another in the central town of Bourges plans to do so soon.

The Limoges University Hospital, which wants to open a women's health centre dedicated to victims of domestic violence, with a total budget of €2.5 million, hopes to borrow one million from the public.

Some hospitals had already turned to more traditional fundraising, including Paris's Georges Pompidou Hospital, which sought donations to buy a scanner, and the Nantes University Hospital.

Critics including the Force Ouvriere union have denounced what they call the government's austerity policies undermining public hospitals nationwide.

"Whereas France once prided itself on having the best healthcare system in the world, today public hospitals are forced to hold out their hand to survive," the union said last year.

"Citizen loans, appeals for donations, corporate sponsorship, or any other 'raffle' scheme – this is now what part of the funding for our public hospitals boils down to."

Jean‑Paul Domin, an economist at the University of Reims Champagne-Ardenne, said the trend, emerging over the past three or four years, was symptomatic of a system in crisis.

"Hospitals need cash," he said, and they are scrambling to find it.

Nicolas Sirven, an economist at the EHESP school of public health, said the loan scheme proved that people were willing to pay to fund the hospital system – even though the political class was reluctant to push for more social security contributions or taxes.

Compared with their overall budgets, the amounts hospitals seek are "marginal", Sirven said.

But "should it be up to hospitals to manage the savings of the French?"</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 17:23:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/da72bfb0-08e7-11f1-abcc-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/85549c1c16492cc22a8e6d78b5aa62e92a45c8ca.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Arundhati Roy boycotts Berlin fest premier of her revamped 1980s cult classic – the film shows why</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260213-arundhati-roy-boycotts-berlin-fest-premier-of-her-revamped-1980s-cult-classic-the-film-shows-why</link><description>Late one night in 1989, Indian audiences watching the national TV station were captivated when a film, the likes of which they had never seen, suddenly appeared on their screens.

The main actress in the film, "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones", had an impish face dominated by expressive, kohl-lined eyes, and she carried herself with an insouciance that was thrilling. She was also the screenwriter of the peculiarly titled film, the maverick responsible for dialogues featuring a mix of Hindi and English (or “Hinglish”), the patois of millions of educated urban Indians that was never deemed worthy of cinematographic attention.

“Arundhati Roy”, read the credits, an unknown name across the country back then. But her writing, as discerning viewers could tell, was electrifying.

The film is based on Roy’s student days at New Delhi’s School of Planning and Architecture. And while it’s fiction, there’s little doubt that Radha is a young Roy, displaying all the creativity, sharpness and courage that has marked her work as a writer and activist.

Eight years after the film's TV broadcast, Roy's novel, "The God of Small Things", won the Booker Prize . In addition to her writing, her fearless activism, run-ins with India’s Supreme Court, headline-grabbing jailing , and an array of awards made Arundhati Roy an international household name. Her latest memoir, "Mother Mary Comes To Me", hit bestseller charts in several countries and has been widely hailed by critics.

But the first film Roy ever wrote simply disappeared from the public eye. "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones" won two National Film Awards when it was released in 1989, but there were no cinema screenings. In cinephile circles, it was assumed that the original 16mm film had gotten lost. That never diminished the movie’s popularity, instead helping propel it to cult film status. In the pre-internet era, video cassette (VHS) recordings of the original TV broadcast began to circulate. They were copied, borrowed, watched and rewatched until their degrading resolution made viewing virtually impossible.

The low-budget film had a scruffy, grainy quality which suited the story about student life at a Delhi architecture school in the 1960s. But before YouTube appeared and copies of the film were posted online, watching "In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones" required dedication.

Now, 37 years after its TV release, "Annie" – as it’s fondly known in cinema circles – has been restored and is having its world premiere at the 2026 Berlin Film Festival under the Berlinale Classics section on Monday, February 16.

Roy was supposed to attend the premier. But on Friday, the Indian author and peace activist suddenly announced that she will not be attending the Berlinale due to the festival jury’s comments regarding the war in Gaza .

On Thursday, Berlin Film Festival jury president Wim Wenders was asked about Germany 's support for Israel despite accusations of genocide in Gaza . "We have to stay out of politics," the celebrated German director replied.

In her statement , Roy noted that, “What has happened in Gaza, what continues to happen, is a genocide of the Palestinian people by the State of Israel. It is supported and funded by the governments of the United States and Germany, as well as several other countries in Europe,” she said. “If the greatest filmmakers and artists of our time cannot stand up and say so, they should know that history will judge them. I am shocked and disgusted.”

Roy has never shied away from taking positions, criticising governments, institutions and individuals when they fail to stand up for human rights .

Traces of her unflinching courage are visible on screen in the first film she wrote and starred in 27 years ago.

Directed by Pradip Krishen, Roy’s longtime partner, the film tells the story of Anand “Annie” Grover – a hopelessly idealistic student at a state architecture institute who keeps on failing his final academic year.

Roy plays Radha, a non-conformist student thumbing her nose at societal norms requiring Indian women to be chaste, helpless and polite. She’s not afraid to take on authority, letting professors know exactly what she thinks of them and the commercial business of architecture. When the school’s principal, Yamdoot,  dismisses her final project idea as, “This year’s bleeding-heart thesis” that is of no interest to the jury, she cheekily asks him if it’s because her thesis “questions the basis of their existence? Or your existence?” She also steals his cigarettes – and enjoys them.

In her memoir, "Mother Mary Comes To Me", Roy devotes an entire chapter to the film, which marked her debut as a writer. “We called it 'In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones'. In Delhi University slang, ‘giving it those ones’ meant ‘doing one’s usual shit’,” she writes. “It was never meant to be anything more than fun, fringe cinema. But when it finally showed on Doordarshan [India’s national TV channel], it got an audience of millions, which would otherwise have been impossible for a film like 'Annie'.”

"Annie" captures the zeitgeist of its time – the impact of which is felt to this day, particularly in a generation and segment of the Indian population that continues to criticise Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s Hindu nationalist policies. Roy is a vocal critic of the Modi administration’s assaults on human rights, free speech and secular principles.

In its form and content, "Annie" has all the makings of a cult film classic. “The film is honest in intent and execution, unafraid to poke fun at pretentiousness and authority, filled with lovable and relatable characters,” said Nandini Ramnath, a film journalist at Scroll India. “'Annie' was also quite pathbreaking in using the Indian English idiom. Here were students who looked and sounded like the film's viewers. They didn't sound like leftovers of British colonial rule. They didn't sound like they were parodying the language. Roy simply put into dialogue what she was hearing. Plus, she had and continues to have a great sense of humour, which courses through the film.”

The film restoration chapter began a few years ago, when Shivendra Singh Dungarpur, founder-director of the Film Heritage Fund, a Mumbai-based NGO, heard that "Annie"’s director Krishen wanted to donate his film material. Following his years as a filmmaker, Krishen turned his attention in the 1990s to ecology and is now a leading Indian naturalist and environmentalist.

When Dungarpur flew to New Delhi to meet Krishen, he was shown a treasure trove of film history. “All these boxes were lying with all that material,” he told FRANCE 24 in a phone interview from the Berlin Film Festival days before the premier. “We started going through the scripts, photographs, notebooks, all the documentations, clapboards… and the original script of 'Annie' – not the one Arundhati wrote, which she has, but Pradip’s original script,” he noted.

While the low-budget film was shot in 16mm, Dungarpur was given a 35mm copy of the original. “When I went back, I started seeing the film on the rewinding table, and those images, the film, everything just kept coming back to me. The print didn't look that great, and I said, what about the negative?” he recounted.

When Dungarpur called Krishen, he was informed that the 16mm negative was sitting in the National Film Archive of India , and no one had any idea about its state. The Film Heritage Fund got the negative out of the archive and watched it with trepidation. “It was damaged a bit, the colours had faded, there were scratches, the sound was a mono sound. We knew that there was a lot of work on the restoration, a lot of tedious work, and I then decided that I must restore this film,” said Dungarpur.

A filmmaker himself, Dungarpur understood the cultural value of the project when he got down to the restoration work. It took a year and a half to complete, including work done at Italy’s L’Immagine Ritrovata laboratory in Bologna. “We had to do colour corrections, the subtitles had to be done because the subtitles have to be correct, and it was just one thing after the other,” he explained.

The effort was worth it, according to Ramnath. “What is nice about the restored 'Annie ' is how it captures the original's graininess, the seedy interiors of the college hostel, the general cheerful chaos of the student dorms while also being sharper and brighter,” she noted.

For Dungarpur, it was a labour of love. “Whenever you restore any film, the first thing you want is that people see it,” he said. “You want the younger generation to see it, to discover it.”

The generation of "Annie " fans who watched the original 1989 broadcast have long acknowledged that the film is a record of a more tolerant time in India. They once believed it was a niche film, set in a specific context for a specific audience. But as cultural borders blur and the world enters a more divisive era, perhaps "Annie " has one of those for everyone.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 19:23:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f7fee904-08fc-11f1-9d3a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/main-57.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says second aircraft carrier ‘leaving very shortly’ for Middle East</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260213-trump-says-second-aircraft-carrier-leaving-very-shortly-for-middle-east</link><description>US President Donald Trump said Friday a second aircraft carrier group would be heading to the Middle East soon, upping the military threat against Iran amid negotiations over its nuclear programme.

The attacker targeted an officer securing the ceremony for relighting the eternal flame honoring unknown soldiers at the Napoleon-era landmark, according to a Paris police official. Another officer shot the attacker, who was hospitalised, the official said.

No bystanders or police officers were injured in the incident, the official told The Associated Press.

The French counterterrorism prosecutor’s office said it is investigating the case and sent an investigator to the scene.

The Arc de Triomphe is one of Paris’s most famous sites, and sits atop the busy Champs-Élysées avenue.

Speaking at the Munich Security Conference , ⁠President Emmanuel Macron dismissed accusations that Europe was decaying and defended its push to tackle disinformation and the excesses of social media ‌that were harming Western democracies.

“This is the right time for audacity. This ⁠is the right time for a strong Europe,” Macron said. “Europe has to learn to become a geopolitical power. It was not part of our DNA.”

“Everyone should take their cue from us, instead of criticising us,” he said.

Macron, who ​is set to enter his final year in office, said Europe would ‌still face an aggressive Russia even if there were a deal on the Ukraine war and that it could not cave into Russian demands or allow a short-term accord that would not resolve ‌core issues.

“The Europeans must start this work with their own thinking and their own interests. So my proposal today is ​to launch a series of consultations on this important issue, which we have started to flesh out with our British and German colleagues, but in the broader European consultation with all ​the colleagues here, with a lot of capacities, a lot of strategic thinking,” Macron said.

Macron, ​who is scheduled to deliver a speech later this month on ​how he sees the role of France’s nuclear deterrent within Europe, said he had started those consultations.

“We have to reshuffle and ​reorganise our architecture of security in Europe. Because the past architecture of security was totally designed and framed during Cold War times. So it’s no longer adapted,” he said.

“We have to rearticulate nuclear deterrence in this approach. And this is why we are conceiving, and in a ⁠few weeks’ time I will detail that, but we engaged a strategic dialogue, obviously with Chancellor Merz, but with ⁠a few European ​leaders, in order to see how we can articulate our national doctrine, which is guaranteed and controlled by the Constitution,” he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 13 Feb 2026 22:34:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d3fbe026-0923-11f1-ac9c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26044624693556.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New conspiracy theories hold that Jeffrey Epstein is alive and well</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260213-conspiracy-theories-jeffrey-epstein-still-alive</link><description>The publication of the Epstein files by the US Department of Justice on January 30 has shone a light on the troubling links between the financier convicted of sex crimes and a number of well-known political figures and business leaders. The release of these documents has also sparked conspiracy theories that Jeffrey Epstein is still alive. Despite the fact that Epstein was discovered dead in his cell in a New York correctional centre on August 10, 2019, some social media users are sharing what they say is proof of life. Turns out, however, there is no basis to this “proof”.

“Israel faked his death,” claimed a social media user on February 5 in a post on X that has since garnered more than six million views. The post features what he claims is a photo of Epstein, alive, sporting white hair and a shaggy beard and walking the streets of Tel Aviv in Israel.

However, the image is entirely fake: it was generated by artificial intelligence (AI). If you run the image through a reverse image search (click here to check out our handy guide), it leads you to the original version of the image posted on the Reddit forum “hardaiimages”, which shares AI-generated images.

The AI-generated image on Reddit features the people’s full bodies, while the X image is cropped at the waistline. This crop was likely made to cut out the indication that the image was generated by artificial intelligence.

If you look closely, there is a diamond shape on the bottom-right corner of the original image posted on Reddit: it’s the logo of Nano Banana, Google’s artificial image generator which is integrated into Gemini, Google’s AI chatbot.

Google Lens also indicates that the image posted on Reddit was “created with Google’s AI”. Images generated by Nano Banana also have an invisible watermark that can be read by SynthID, the tool for detecting AI-generated content in Google Lens.

Social media users also took to X on February 7, 2026 to share another image purported to show Epstein, garnering more than 2.4 million views. In it, Epstein has long hair and a shaggy beard and is wearing a black hoodie. Behind him, you can see a car with red taillights.

Journalist Henk van Ess reported that the image was based on a real photo that had been doctored using AI.

If you run this image through Tineye, a tool for carrying out reverse image searches, then you’ll find the original photo was published on May 27, 2020 – after Epstein’s death – by British tabloid The Sun . The image was taken from a Netflix documentary released in 2020.  The car with the red taillights that appears in the image on X also appears in this image, and Epstein is wearing the same clothes in both images.

In the original photo, Epstein is clean-shaven with short hair. The image that circulated on X was doctored, probably using AI, to make his hair and beard long.

Social media users took to X on February 5 to share an even more incongruous so-called "proof of life" for Epstein. They claimed that the financier was playing the video game Fortnite in August 2025, six years after the announcement of his death. A post featuring this claim garnered more than 7.8 million views on X.

As proof, these social media users shared a screengrab of a Fortnite user with the handle “littlestjeffl1”. They argue the profile is based in Israel , pointing to the presence of an Israeli flag on the avatar.

However, there is no basis to this claim. It does appear that, at one time, Epstein did use the handle “littlestjeffl1” (you can see this on the US Department of Justice website if you search the keywords “littlestjeffl1”). However, the documents posted by the department indicate that he used this handle for his YouTube account. There is no mention of a Fortnite account with the handle littlestjeffl1 in the Epstein files.

A Fortnite official took to X to say that the account littlestjeffl1 did not belong to Jeffrey Epstein. An existing account owner changed his name to this handle:

“A few days ago, an existing Fortnite account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube.”

The Fortnite official added that there was no sign of the email addresses mentioned in the Epstein files in Epic, the platform that supports the Fortnite game.

“Since the public document releases [of the Epstein files], people have created Fortnite accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names,” reads the X post from Fortnite.

Trump's military moves and tough talk comes even as Washington and Tehran seek to revive diplomacy over Tehran's long-running nuclear dispute with the West.

Asource briefed on the matter told Reuters that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will hold negotiations with Iran on Tuesday in Geneva, with representatives from Oman acting as mediators. The source said Witkoff and Kushner will also meet officials from Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday in Geneva in the US drive to bring an end to the war in Ukraine.

Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it "seems like that would be the best thing that could happen." He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said "there are people."

"For 47 years, they've been talking and talking and talking," Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. "In the meantime, we've lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We've been going on for a long time."

Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country's ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran's nuclear facilities in strikes last year.

When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the "dust." He added: "If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left."

US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks.

The Gerald R. Ford, the United States' newest and the world's largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year.

Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it ... if we need it, we'll have it ready."

One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East.

The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June.

With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military's arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance.

In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering "illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere."

The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November.

While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity.

Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships.

Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East.

The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system.

The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation.

The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 07:10:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/55192f10-0901-11f1-be55-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26044183806849.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Rubio to address Munich conference as European leaders call for US reset</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260214-live-rubio-address-munich-security-conference-european-leaders-call-reset-ties-usa-zelensky</link><description>British leader Keir Starmer is expected to describe Europe as "a sleeping giant" that must rely less on the US for its defence when he addresses the Munich gathering later today.

Starmer's office said the UK prime minister will argue that the continent must shift from overdependence on the United States towards a more European NATO.

"I'm talking about a vision of European security and greater European autonomy that does not herald US withdrawal but answers the call for more burden sharing in full and remakes the ties that have served us so well," Starmer is expected to say.

Washington's top diplomat is set to address the Munich conference at 9am local time (GMT+1).

You can watch the full speech live on FRANCE 24.

In his opening address on Friday, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called for the United States and Europe to "repair and revive trans-Atlantic trust together", warning that even the US isn't powerful enough to go it alone in an world whose old order has withered.

Merz called for a "new trans-Atlantic partnership", acknowledging that "a divide, a deep rift" has opened up across the Atlantic.

The German host said that the post-World War II world order, "as imperfect as it was at its best times, no longer exists" today.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is set to address European leaders in Munich as they try to step up their autonomy in defence while salvaging transatlantic ties badly strained under President Donald Trump.

His highly anticipated speech comes a day after German Chancellor Friedrich Merz urged "a new transatlantic partnership" and French President Emmanuel Macron called for "a strong Europe" on the first day of the annual security gathering.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 07:10:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/439efc9a-096c-11f1-ab28-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-13T150824Z-770436195-RC22LJAAD6S6-RTRMADP-3-SECURITY-MUNICH-RUBIO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's Tarique Rahman poised to become PM as Islamists concede defeat</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260214-bangladesh-s-tarique-rahman-poised-to-become-pm-as-islamists-concede-defeat</link><description>Bangladesh 's largest Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami said Saturday it had accepted the "overall outcome" of the election won by the rival nationalist party , despite earlier having alleged problems with the vote count.

The move clears the way for Tarique Rahman, the once exiled leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to become prime minister.

Election Commission figures showed Rahman's BNP had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina .

The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in Britain, far from Dhaka's political storms.

Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh's most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday.

His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus , who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman "would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development".

The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.

Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would "seek redress" from the commission, with his party alleging "inconsistencies and fabrications".

But a day later, he conceded defeat.

"In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people," the Jamaat leader said in a statement.

"We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law."

Hasina's Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an "illegal and unconstitutional election".

The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a "historic victory", while neighbouring India praised Rahman's "decisive win", a notable shift after deeply strained ties.

China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.

International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been "credible".

The International Republican Institute noted that while "election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile".

Jamaat's Rahman said his party "will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account".

Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told AFP that the vote had been a success.

"It was by far the best election," he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres.

"People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it," he said Saturday. "If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court."

The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.

Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.

Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his Islamist party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina.

"With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics," he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation."

Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a "completely broken" system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.

Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.

Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced "daunting challenges", including "boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process".</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 07:54:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/26e8b538-0970-11f1-8468-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/9ea4124217477de5ecc984f85e5e7522a1bcbdee.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Writing for survival: Gaza author dares to hope against the odds</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260214-writing-for-survival-gaza-author-dares-to-hope-against-the-odds</link><description>It started out small, very small, in a vacant lot next to her house in Al-Zawayda, a once sleepy, agricultural town not far from Deir al-Balah in central Gaza. That’s where Palestinian author Safaa Al-Nabaheen decided to hold a workshop for children to help them build stories, dream, and let their imaginations soar above the death and destruction around them.

In early 2024, just months after Israel launched its latest war following the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack , Gaza’s population was already on the move. The Israeli army had started issuing evacuation orders, sparking a process that would displace 1.9 million out of Gaza’s 2.2 million population by the end of the year.

Towns and cities in central and southern Gaza were starting to flood with refugees from the north, the death toll was rising and as despair spiralled with every bombardment, Nabaheen came up with an idea.

“As a writer and novelist, I could offer training workshops for children and adolescents on the art of short-story writing, teaching them how to channel their inner worlds through narrative,” said the 31-year-old Palestinian author.

But when she started to put her plan into action, she had a revelation. “In my first session with them, I discovered that some of them had aged 20 years,” she recounted. “When I asked a child about his childhood or his dreams, his only answer was that his concern today was filling water containers, gathering firewood for his mother to cook whatever food was left, and praying it wouldn’t rain so their tents wouldn't drown.”

Not one to give up, Nabaheen persevered with her programme – and gradually, the kids started to respond. “It was a very simple beginning; our gatherings cost nothing more than my voice, some ideas for entertainment, and inventing new games for them. It was a very small tent at the edge of the land, where children sat on mats with a mountain of hope in their hearts,” she explained.

More than a year later, Nabaheen is confronting her own “mountain”, but it’s of despair, not hope. On October 13, 2025, President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire at a summit in Egypt attended by leaders from around 30 countries. Against a banner proclaiming, “Peace in the Middle East”, the US president signed “ The Trump Declaration for Enduring Peace and Prosperity ” and called it “a tremendous day for peace in the Middle East”.

Last month, US special envoy Steve Witkoff announced the start of the second phase of the ceasefire deal. But while emergency supplies have kept famine at bay in Gaza, the death toll from Israeli fire keeps mounting. Earlier this week, the Gaza health ministry said 586 Palestinians were killed since the start of the ceasefire, bringing the war’s cumulative toll to more than 72,000.

For Nabaheen, the ceasefire has changed nothing. “It is a lie. In reality, the war has not stopped. It has only stopped in the media to quiet public opinion,” she maintained. “The [Israeli] strikes continue. We are living in an unprecedented state of chaos. There has been a slight breakthrough regarding food and water, but the general situation remains dire.”

Israel still does not allow foreign journalists independent access into Gaza. Communication with the outside world remains a challenge with frequent internet cuts. FRANCE 24’s interviews with Nabaheen were conducted via emails, messages and calls. During one interview on a messaging app, a massive blast went off seemingly close to her bedroom. Nabaheen flinched momentarily, looked toward the window and insisted on continuing.

The drive to get her story – and herself – out of Gaza keeps her going these days. But with every mountain of hardship, river of loss and valley of despair, the journey just keeps getting harder. From bombardments to bureaucracy, the challenges have at times seemed insurmountable. Through it all, she has kept working – and writing for survival.

From a “simple” start in early 2024, Nabaheen’s workshops, which she called The Creative Refuge Project, began to grow, attracting more children as Gaza’s schools remained close.

“In the beginning, the sessions focused on psychological support and recreation. Then, I began integrating them into the world of dreams – teaching them how to express everything they feel through writing. I started implementing small activities, such as performing a radio news broadcast, a short theatrical play, reading folk stories that inspire expression, or forming a choir for our old Palestinian songs. I then started announcing my small camp via Facebook,” she said.

As the project grew, Nabaheen started looking for sponsors and applying for international funding. She was managing the project alone and needed help, which was difficult to secure since the war was at its peak.

Then tragedy struck her family.

Her brother, Mohammed, was killed on July 13, 2024, in an Israeli drone strike while collecting wood outdoors.

“Losing my brother was not easy,” said Nabaheen, using an understatement to keep her emotions in check. “I tried to keep myself busy at the time, doing my university studies despite the impossible circumstances, via the internet – which was rarely available.”

After halting The Creative Refuge Project for six months following Mohammed’s death, things started picking up again. The Goethe-Institut, a German NGO, had expressed interest in funding her little programme, and Nabaheen was busy doing the paperwork to make it happen.

By September 2024, the carnage in Gaza was unfolding at a ferocious pace, with the death toll surging past 40,000 . Daily headlines noted Israeli attacks in Khan Younis, Gaza City, Rafah, Deir al-Balah, Mawasi, Jabaliya … names of cities, towns and camps that would become familiar to international audiences.

But the outside world back then was still unaware of the extent of Israel’s use of quadcopters and drones to spy and kill in every corner of the besieged enclave. Gazans though did not have that luxury.

On September 15, 2024, the horror came home from the sea for Nabaheen.

That night, her second brother, Saeb, had gone fishing. A father of three young children, Saeb had ignored the family’s warning that “the sea is dangerous”.

The UN would confirm their prognosis the next year, when a report noted that Israel’s “systematic” attacks had killed 200 civilian fishers as of December 2024. They were targeted “generally without warning, while fishing using paddling boats posing no discernible threats” to the Israeli Naval Forces, the UN concluded .

Despite the family’s pleas, Saeb took to “the dangerous sea” in a desperate bid to provide for his kids as the economic situation deteriorated, prices soared and food stocks plummeted.

While he was fishing, an Israeli quadcopter spotted and pursued Saeb, explained his sister. “It chased him in the water, and as he tried to swim away, it fired bullets everywhere into his body. He tried to flee,” she said, adding that the quadcopter continued to follow Saeb as he ran to the shore and then headed towards a main street. “People were shouting to him that his death was inevitable and to recite the Shahada [the Islamic creed], as they saw his blood gushing from every part of him. Then, another aircraft pursued him and targeted his head with a projectile. He fell to the ground, stained with the sand of the sea … he once told me, "I am a son of the sea; if I leave it, I die,”… yet the sea did not care for him,” she said sadly.

The day Saeb died also happened to be the day that Nabaheen signed a contract with the Goethe-Institut for her workshop project – and it was during her university final exams.

“Despite the impossible situation, I was determined to complete both my studies and my project simultaneously. Five days later, I went to work at the camp. I built a large tent decorated with the most beautiful colours and pictures. With the funding, I had some resources, so I prepared a warm tent that embraced them all,” she recounted.

There were 50 children, aged eight to 15, in the project. With her new funding, Nabaheen enlarged the programmes, adding theatre rehearsals and stagings. “In truth, I was suffering from the pangs of loss as one suffers labour pains … I had no choice but to immerse myself in them and my studies,” she confessed.

The project lasted three months, with meetings three days a week. On the final day, “we all collapsed in tears,” she said. “There I was, falling apart and weeping just like them. The project used to occupy me completely.”

By that time, most of the kids in her workshop started returning to their homes in northern Gaza. Without projects to plan, organise and occupy her days, Nabaheen once again turned to writing.

Her first novel in Arabic was published in 2021 and received an award in Lebanon before the war. She took up writing again, working on her second novel, “The Mystery of the Forgotten Girl”, also in Arabic, with a mission: to “intentionally” avoid writing about the war “because I wasn't ready to face the bitter reality”.

She has since written her third novel, “Disowned”, which was published in Egypt and recently showcased at the Cairo International Book Fair. A collection of poems, “When Ash Blossoms”, followed, and she has finished her fourth novel, “Letters Not Yet Delivered”.

Writing has long been a coping mechanism and resilience booster for Nabaheen. The difficulty, for the young Palestinian writer though, are the forces beyond her control.

For the past few months, Nabaheen has been trying to leave Gaza to pursue a life of the mind, free of the terrors of everyday life in the besieged enclave. But the process has trapped her in a cycle of hope followed by crashing bureaucratic despair.

An Italian university forwarded her application for a writer’s residency to a foundation. But then she received no response. An international fund for artists and cultural actors at risk supported her “incredibly”. But during the final selection, “they rejected me the moment they realised I was from Gaza,” Nabaheen recounted.

She managed to get a conditional admission into a UK university for the next semester, but the conditions included funding and tests, which in turn require a visa. A writing fellowship at a US university came through, once again with help from a few US-based writers. But the process is going nowhere since the US government does not evacuate Palestinians.

On February 2, the Rafah crossing partially opened under the US-brokered ceasefire deal to chaotic scenes. Around 20,000 Gazans need urgent medical treatment abroad, but on the first day, Israel allowed just five patients to leave. Earlier this week, Ali Shaath, head of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, which is charged with overseeing day-to-day affairs in Gaza, told Egyptian media that the situation at Rafah was starting to improve.

While emergency medical patients struggle to make it out, Gazans who have admission into Western schools and institutions, are painfully aware that they are not on the priority list. As deadlines for the next semester loom, they are watching seats and scholarships slip away.

For Nabaheen, it’s been a heartbreaking process. “I cannot find the words to describe the scale of injustice and frustration I am enduring,” she said helplessly. After spending years working with Gaza’s children to help them dream of a future beyond the pressing worries of survival, her own lessons are proving to be a challenge.

But she is not one to give up. “I’m not losing hope. I will never lose hope, actually,” she said. “I knows that there are so many people stuck in so many difficult places like Gaza. I’ll keep going on. Writing is my way to go forward.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 09:31:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cbacdb28-07fc-11f1-8fb4-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-834U8HD.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Budget standoff over immigration shuts down US Department of Homeland Security</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260214-standoff-over-immigration-shuts-down-us-department-of-homeland-security-minneapolis-ice</link><description>The Department of Homeland Security entered a partial shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fight over funding the agency overseeing much of President Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown .

Thousands of government workers, from airport security agents to disaster relief officials, will either be furloughed or forced to work without pay until funding is agreed upon by Congress.

At the center of the budget dispute is the department's Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), whose agents killed two US citizens amid sweeping raids and mass protests in Minneapolis .

Democrats oppose any new funding for DHS until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.

In particular, they have demanded curtailed patrols, a ban on ICE agents wearing face masks during operations and the requirement that they obtain a judicial warrant to enter private property.

"Donald Trump and Republicans have decided that they have zero interest in getting ICE under control," House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday.

"Dramatic changes are needed," Jeffries told a news conference. "Absent that, Republicans have decided to shut down parts of the federal government."

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt put the blame on the opposition, telling Fox News that "Democrats are barreling our government towards another shutdown for political and partisan reasons."

But while DHS faces a shutdown, ICE itself will remain operational, under funds approved in last year's government spending bill.

Senator John Fetterman pushed against his fellow Democrats, saying: "This shutdown literally has zero impact on ICE."

The primary impact would land on other agencies, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which oversees emergency response to natural disasters.

The Transportation Security Administration, which runs airport safety, warned on X that a prolonged shutdown could result in longer wait times and cancelled flights.

The shutdown would be the third of Trump's second term, including a record 43-day government closure last October and November.

The government just reopened from a smaller, four-day partial shutdown earlier this month, also over DHS funding.

Even if all 53 Republican senators vote to fund DHS, Senate rules require support from 60 of the body's 100 members to advance the budget bill, meaning several Democrats would need to get on board.

In response to the Democrats' demands, the White House said it was ready to negotiate over immigration enforcement policy.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune called it "an extremely serious offer", but warned Democrats are "never going to get their full wish list".

Some concessions were made during the previous shutdown amid Democratic pressure and national outcry after federal agents shot and killed Renée Good, a mother of three, and Alex Pretti, a nurse who worked with military veterans, in Minneapolis last month.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said federal agents in the city would wear body cameras "effective immediately" in a move that would be later "expanded nationwide".

The Senate went into recess for a week starting Thursday, but senators could be called back to Washington in case of a rapid leap in negotiations.

For the moment, however, talks between the White House and Democrats appear to be at a standstill.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 10:27:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/609d2f14-0986-11f1-ad99-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26044712126046.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US doesn't want to separate from Europe 'but revitalise' alliance, Rubio tells allies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260214-us-doesn-t-want-to-separate-from-europe-but-revitalise-alliance-rubio-tells-allies</link><description>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio sought to reassure a nervous Europe on Saturday, saying that Washington wanted to "revitalise" the transatlantic alliance so that a strong Europe could help the US on its mission of global "renewal".

Speaking at a security conference in Munich after months of turmoil in US-European relations sparked by US President Donald Trump 's vows to seize Greenland and his often derisive remarks about Washington's allies, Washington's top diplomat struck a markedly soothing tone.

"We do not seek to separate, but to revitalise an old friendship and renew the greatest civilisation in human history," Rubio said. "What we want is a reinvigorated alliance."

"We want Europe to be strong," Rubio said, adding that the continent and the US "belong together".

The United States will be "driven by a vision of a future as proud, as sovereign, and as vital as our civilisation's past", he said.

"It is our hope to do this together with you, our friends here in Europe," he said.

He echoed Trump administration's oft-stated assertion that immigration was a threat, saying that "mass migration" was "a crisis which is transforming and destabilising societies all across the West".

"We want allies who are proud of their culture and of their heritage, who understand that we are heirs to the same great and noble civilisation and together with us are willing and able to defend it."

"Acting together in this way, we will not just help recover a sane foreign policy... It will restore to us a clear sense of ourselves. It will restore a place in the world, and in so doing, it will rebuke and deter the forces of civilisational erasure that today menace both America and Europe alike."

Rubio's speech marked a sharp contrast to that of US Vice President JD Vance a year ago, when he used the same stage to attack European policies on immigration and free speech, shocking European allies.

Aside from immigration, Rubio otherwise largely avoided the MAGA flashpoint and culture war issues that German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Friday, had deepened a "rift" between US and Europe.

US-Europe ties were further strained by the new US National Security Strategy, which launched an unprecedented attack against Europeans, charging that the continent was threatened with "civilisational decline".

Ties plunged further last month when Trump stepped up threats to annex Greenland, an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark, forcing European nations to stand firm in protest.

European leaders at the Munich Security Conference have pledged to shoulder more of the burden of shared NATO defences, saying this was essential for Europe to counter a hostile Russia.

European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen told the gathering on Saturday that "Europe needs to step up and has to take on its responsibility" for its security and called for closer ties with Britain, saying "10 years on from Brexit our futures are as bound as ever".

British leader Keir Starmer said "We must build our hard power, because that is the currency of the age."

"We must be able to deter aggression and, yes, if necessary, we must be ready to fight," he said calling for a building of "a shared industrial base across Europe which can turbocharge our defence production".

On Friday NATO chief Mark Rutte said that "a strong Europe in a strong NATO means that the transatlantic bond will be stronger than ever" and French President Emmanuel Macron said that "this is the right time for a strong Europe", that would be "building its own architecture of security".

The high-powered Munich meeting of government leaders, diplomats, defence and intelligence chiefs comes shortly before Russia's full-scale war on Ukraine is set to enter its fifth gruelling year.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky , who has been in Munich since Friday and meeting multiple allies, was expected to address the meeting on Saturday. No Russian officials have been invited.

At the White House on Friday, Trump urged him to "get moving" to end the war. "Russia wants to make a deal... He has to move," the US leader said.

But Rubio said that "We don't know if the Russians are serious about ending the war."

Macron said a new framework was needed to deal with "an aggressive Russia" once the fighting in Ukraine ends.

And Merz said that "If it makes sense to talk, we are willing to talk," but charged that "Russia is not yet willing to talk seriously".

Rubio was on Sunday due to travel to Slovakia and Hungary, European countries run by nationalist leaders endorsed by Trump.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 11:23:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2755f6c6-0983-11f1-9686-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/9b7468cdd49798020a329c7bac1f8647133575b0.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'All records broken' as Storm Nils leaves swaths of southwest France underwater</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260214-all-records-broken-storm-nils-leaves-swathes-southwest-france-under-water-floods</link><description>The flood alert system in France has been working at a record pace as relentless rain over the past month has saturated soils, the head of the agency told AFP on Saturday.

"For 30 days we have been in continuous orange or red alert somewhere on the national territory," Lucie Chadourne-Facon, director of Vigicrues, told AFP, referring to the two highest alert levels.

"That is 81 departments in alert simultaneously for 154 rivers, so we have exceeded all our records," she said.

Chadourne-Facon said soil moisture had also reached a record since data collection began in 1959.

"We are facing a generalised flood situation across the entire country because all the soils are saturated everywhere" and have "lost their infiltration capacity", she said.

"As a result, today rivers are extremely sensitive to the slightest precipitation, the slightest rainfall that hits the country, and they react very quickly," she added.</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 12:49:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0b89681c-0977-11f1-8a24-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-97DT7NQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia fatally poisoned Putin critic Navalny with 'rare toxin', European states say in joint statement</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260214-russia-fatally-poisoned-putin-critic-navalny-with-rare-toxin-european-states-say-in-joint-statement</link><description>Britain and ​allies France, Germany, Sweden ​and the Netherlands are convinced that late Kremlin critic Alexei ​Navalny ‌was poisoned ⁠with a lethal toxin in a ‌penal colony two years ⁠ago, they said in a joint statement on ​Saturday.

The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the office told AFP.

As part of that initiative, they will be reopening their files on the late Jean-Luc Brunel, a former French modelling agency executive.

The aim is "to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework", said prosecutors.

Brunel, who had links with Epstein, was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors.

Epstein died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial for trafficking children , in what the US authorities ruled was a suicide .

The death of the young man -- identified only as Quentin -- has intensified tensions between France 's far-right and hard-left who are both eyeing 2027 presidential elections .

He had been in hospitalised in Lyon on Thursday after being attacked while providing what his supporters said was security for a protest against an appearance by hard-left MEP Rima Hassan at the Lyon branch of the Sciences Po university .

The office of the Lyon prosecutor on Saturday told AFP he had died of his wounds. An investigation has been opened into suspected aggravated manslaughter, it added.

Macron said on X that Quentin had been the victim of "an unprecedented outburst of violence.

"Hatred that kills has no place in our country. I call for calm, restraint and respect," he added.

According to the Nemesis collective, which is close to the far-right, Quentin was part of the security team responsible for ensuring the safety of its activists.

They were demonstrating against the conference by Hassan, who is known for her outspoken criticism of Israel .

The family's lawyer said in a statement that Quentin appeared to have been ambushed by "organised and trained individuals, vastly superior in number and armed, some with their faces masked".

Prosecutors have yet to give details on the circumstances of his death.

Nemesis accused members of a local anti-fascist association that was banned by the government in June of being behind the killing.

Three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen , who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, said on X that the "barbarians responsible for this lynching" should be brought to justice.

With Quentin's death sparking a wave of alarm across the political spectrum, concern also spread to the hard-left party of Hassan, France Unbowed (LFI).

"What I have feared for years in Lyon is continuing," said LFI French parliament MP Raphael Arnault.

"I offer my condolences to the family of this young man and I hope that the truth will be uncovered about this tragedy," he added.

Le Pen's far-right National Rally (RN) is the biggest single party by seats in the French lower house while the LFI is the biggest left-wing faction.

In the wake of the incident, Interior Minister Laurent Nunez urged authorities to "increase vigilance around political gatherings, as well as around campaign offices".</description><pubDate>Sat, 14 Feb 2026 21:48:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ccebf6e2-090d-11f1-a93c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-34WP7YT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's Sophie Adenot and crew arrive at International Space Station</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/science/20260215-french-astronaut-sophie-adenot-and-crew-arrive-at-international-space-station</link><description>Four astronauts docked at the International Space Station on Saturday for a months-long research mission , replacing a crew forced to return to Earth early over a medical issue.

The US space agency's Crew-12 arrived at the orbiting laboratory after a journey of about 34 hours that started with blastoff from Cape Canaveral, Florida aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.

"We have bridged the legacy of humankind's continuous presence in space spanning more than 25 years at this very site," American astronaut Jessica Meir said after docking at the ISS.

"As we look back at Earth from these windows, we are reminded that cooperation is not just possible, it is essential. Up here, there are no borders and hope is universal."

Other members of Crew-12 are American Jack Hathaway, French astronaut Sophie Adenot and Russian cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev.

The foursome are replacing Crew-11, which returned to Earth in January a month earlier than planned in the first medical evacuation in the space station's history.

The ISS, which orbits 250 miles (400 kilometers) above Earth, has since been staffed by a skeleton crew of three.

NASA declined to disclose any details about the health issue that cut the previous mission short.

Crew-12 will be one of the last crews to live aboard the football field-sized space station.

Continuously inhabited for the last quarter-century, the aging ISS is scheduled to be pushed into Earth's orbit before crashing into an isolated spot in the Pacific Ocean in 2030.

During their eight months on the outpost, the astronauts will conduct many experiments, including research into the effects of microgravity on their bodies.

Meir, who previously worked as a marine biologist studying animals in extreme environments, will serve as the crew's commander.

Adenot has become the second French woman to fly into space, following in the footsteps of Claudie Haignere, who spent time on the Mir space station.

Among other research, she will test a system that uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to allow astronauts to carry out their own medical ultrasounds.

"I am proud to bring France and Europe along on this incredible adventure that transcends borders," Adenot said.

"Count on me to share every step with you and bring a sparkle to the eyes of the French people."

The ISS, once a symbol of warming post-Cold War relations, has been a rare area of continued cooperation between the West and Russia since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.

However, the space station has not entirely avoided the tensions back on Earth.

In November, Russian cosmonaut Oleg Artemyev -- who had long been planned to be a member of Crew-12 -- was suddenly taken off the mission.

Reports from independent media in Russia suggested he had been photographing and sending classified information with his phone while training at a SpaceX facility. Russian space agency Roscosmos merely said he had been transferred to a different job.

His replacement, Fedyaev, has already spent some time on the ISS as part of Crew-6 in 2023.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 06:55:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/45b44170-0a34-11f1-a3aa-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26046051006890.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia says Ukrainian drones struck Black Sea port, Rubio to visit eastern Europe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260215-live-russia-says-ukrainian-drones-struck-black-sea-port-rubio-visits-hungary-slovakia</link><description>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due in Slovakia for the start of a two-day trip aimed at bolstering ties with eastern European leaders that have warm ties with the Trump administration.

Rubio will use the trip, which includes a visit to Hungary on Monday, to discuss energy cooperation and bilateral issues, including NATO commitments, the State Department said in an announcement last week.

Both countries' conservative leaders are often at odds with other European Union members, and have resisted pressure to quit Russian oil.

"These are countries that are very strong with us, very cooperative with the United States, work very closely with us, and it's a good opportunity to go see them and two countries I've never been in," Rubio told reporters before departing for Europe.

Russia's Taman port was damaged in a Ukrainian drone attack, the regional governor has said.

Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said a fire was sparked by the attack. There was no immediate report of casualties.

A strategic Black Sea hub, Taman port has been a frequent target of Ukrainian drone attacks.

Five European countries, including Britain, France and Germany, said Saturday that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed by a "rare toxin" from a dart frog and that the Russian state was the prime suspect.

Navalny, a staunch critic of President Vladimir Putin, died in a Russian prison on February 16, 2024, while serving a 19-year sentence.

"The UK, Sweden, France, Germany and The Netherlands are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin," the countries said in a joint statement released at the Munich Security Conference.

A Ukrainian drone attack damaged Russia's Taman port, sparking a fire at the strategic Black Sea hub, the governor of Krasnodar region has said.

The reported attack comes as US Secretary of State Marco Rubio begins a two-day trip to Slovakia and Hungary, whose conservative leaders have warm ties with President Donald Trump – but have resisted pressure to quit Russian oil.

In a wide-ranging podcast interview with left-wing political commentator Brian Tyler Cohen released Saturday, Obama also compared the actions of agents enforcing the president's immigration crackdown in Minnesota to dictatorships.

The video, shared on Trump's Truth Social account on February 5, sparked censure across the US political spectrum, with the White House initially rejecting "fake outrage" only to then blame the post on an error by a staff member and taking it down.

Near the end of a one-minute-long video promoting conspiracies about Trump's 2020 election loss to Joe Biden , the Obamas – the first Black president and first lady in US history – were shown with their faces on the bodies of monkeys for about one second.

"The discourse has devolved into a level of cruelty that we haven't seen before...Just days ago, Donald Trump put a picture of you, your face on an ape's body," Cohen said in the interview.

"And so again, we've seen the devolution of the discourse. How do we come back from a place that we have fallen into?"

Without naming Trump, Obama responded by saying the majority of Americans "find this behavior deeply troubling."

"There's this sort of clown show that's happening in social media and on television, and what is true is that there doesn't seem to be any shame about this among people who used to feel like you had to have some sort of decorum and a sense of propriety and respect for the office, right? That's been lost."

Obama predicted such messaging will hurt Trump's Republicans in midterm elections, that "ultimately, the answer is going to come from the American people."

Trump has told reporters he stood by the thrust of the video's claims about election fraud, but that he had not seen the offensive clip at the end.

Turning to Trump's policies, Obama criticized his immigration crackdown in Minnesota and blasted the conduct of agents during the controversial weeks-long operation that was brought to an end this week.

Obama called the behavior of federal officers, which included two fatal shootings that sparked mounting pressure on Trump's mass crackdown, as the sort that "in the past we've seen in authoritarian countries and we've seen in dictatorships."

Thousands of federal agents – including those with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) – carried out weeks of sweeping raids and arrests in what the Trump administration claims were targeted missions against criminals.

"The rogue behavior of agents of the federal government is deeply concerning and dangerous," Obama said.

But he added he had found hope in communities pushing back against the operations.

"Not just randomly, but in a systematic, organized way, citizens saying, 'this is not the America we believe in,' and we're going to fight back, and we're going to push back with the truth and with cameras and with peaceful protests," he said.

"That kind of heroic, sustained behavior in subzero weather by ordinary people is what should give us hope.

"As long as we have folks doing that, I feel like we're going to get through this."

The aggressive immigration operation in Minnesota had triggered large protests and nationwide outrage.

The Department of Homeland Security was subject to a partial government shutdown Saturday as US lawmakers fought over funding the agency overseeing much of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Democrats are opposing any new DHS funding until major changes are implemented over how ICE conducts its operations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 07:38:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6c49217e-0a3a-11f1-8d03-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96FU9CR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris mayoral hopeful Dati takes campaign inspiration from New York’s Mamdani</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260215-paris-mayoral-hopeful-dati-takes-campaign-inspiration-from-new-york-mamdani</link><description>A glance at Rachida Dati ’s social media profiles shows the long-term Les Républicains (LR) politician and current culture minister getting to grips with the gritty side of the city of light.

In one video she appears early in the morning with rubbish collectors, in another with drug addicts in a city centre tunnel, and in yet another with homeless people near the Pompidou Centre, a modern art museum.

The clips highlight what Dati sees as the failings of current Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo , criticising the city’s lack of cleanliness, the neighbourhoods where social issues persist and Hidalgo’s sweeping environmental changes, which have changed the aesthetic of the French capital.

It appears the message is hitting home – Dati’s TikTok videos are amassing millions of views.

“It's extremely effective. Wherever we go, people talk to us about it,” Agnès Évren, an LR senator from Paris told AFP, adding that she thought the clips were a way to “convey a political message” to audiences who are not exposed to traditional media.

Dati, who will be tried on corruption charges in September, has said she hopes the videos will show an elected official who is connected to the city’s inhabitants and wants to solve problems.

“My campaign is about reminding Parisians that a mayor is there to look after them and respond to their concerns,” she says in one video, promising to continue “reaching out to Parisians” if she is elected.

On the campaign trail, she has almost entirely shunned mainstream media and refused to debate with the other mayoral candidates – a stark departure from the more traditional campaign she ran in the 2020 mayoral race.

The strategy of placing social media and the city’s inhabitants at the heart of her communications is reminiscent of New York mayor Zohran Mamdani ’s wildly successful election campaign that saw him take office in early November – but will it work for Dati?

Known for her sharp tongue and reputation as the most feared woman in Paris , Dati does not have Mamdani’s easy social media presence nor, perhaps, his galvanising message.

Mamdani was a political outsider and a democratic socialist who ran a campaign centred on affordability in a city where the soaring cost of living crisis has left inhabitants struggling to keep up.

“Mamdani really spoke to the needs of working New Yorkers,” said FRANCE 24’s New York correspondent Jessica Le Masurier, commenting on the “joyful” scenes on the night of his election victory .

Centre-right Dati is already a powerful political player who served as justice minister under former president Nicolas Sarkozy and is France’s current culture minister. Her plan for Paris is a right-leaning focus on cleanliness, security and mobility, but her messaging has been contradictory.

To display this content from TikTok, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

She wants to both strengthen the city’s cleaning teams and privatise waste collection, end rules to create more social housing yet provide it “for those who work and need it”, and relax rent controls while keeping the working and middle classes in the capital.

Dati’s economic plan aspires to balance the indebted city’s books by lowering the cost of parking, which she says will also fund an expansive wish list.

This includes plans to double the number of municipal police officers, overhaul extracurricular activities for children, renovate 10,000 social housing units each year, create drug addiction treatment centres, make the metro fully accessible for disabled people and renovate the Place de la République, the banks of the Seine and municipal swimming pools.

When Dati presented her mayoral plans on February 10 – her only campaign event to which the media has been invited – she said it had been “inspired by meetings with citizens”.

She then handed over the microphone to let Paris inhabitants speak for themselves about the issues that impact their daily lives. One resident spoke about cleanliness, a resident of the 9th arrondissement (district) shared her views on the greening of public spaces, and another spoke about the drug addiction problem in the 19th arrondissement .

Dati said the issues were “linked to the culture of excuse-making in Paris”, notably among politicians on the left.

“Why do we make videos? Because we are showing the reality of Paris,” she added.

Meanwhile one of Dati’s main rivals, leftist candidate and a former deputy mayor under Hidalgo, Emmanuel Grégoire, has accused Dati of “pure theatre” and “raw demagoguery” for using videos that exploit human misery.

Aside from his social media campaign, Mamdani energised voters with a hopeful message. He has said his election success was down to his team of tens of thousands of volunteers who pounded the pavements and knocked on doors around New York.

Dati has not galvanised a comparable support base, but she is extending her reach beyond the voters in traditionally wealthy right-wing areas. She has stepped up filming in the typically working-class, left-wing 11th, 18th, 19th and 20th arrondissements .

Canvassing in these neighbourhoods may pay off – voting reforms for this year’s municipal elections mean that voters will be able to cast ballots directly for their preferred mayoral candidate.

“Until now, right-wing votes in so-called left-wing districts didn't count. But with the reform of the voting system, every vote will count,” said Pierre Liscia, the LR candidate standing for mayor of the 19th arrondissement.

“Rachida Dati is right to campaign in eastern Paris, where many voters feel abandoned by the left,” he added.

Dati is expected to resign from her government role in the coming days to focus entirely on her mayoral campaign.

“My programme can be implemented immediately. I will keep my promises, and Parisians will see this within the first 100 days,” she said on Tuesday.

The first round of voting in France’s municipal elections will take place on March 15 with a run-off vote on March 22.

The addition of a second ballot is a change implemented in 2026 in Paris, Lyon and Marseille . In Paris, voters will vote twice at both votes to select their arrondissement's councillors and members of the Paris Council (members of which select the mayor).

"Contrary to what some may say, 'woke, decadent Europe' is not facing civilizational erasure," Kallas said on the last day of the Munich Security Conference .

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday reassured allies by saying Washington and Europe " belong together " – but insisted the continent must defend against mass immigration to protect its "civilization".

"The message that we heard is that America and Europe are intertwined, have been in the past and will be in the future. I think this is important," Kallas said.

But she added: "It is also clear that we don't see eye to eye on all the issues, and this will remain the case."

Officials in the Trump era have repeatedly extended their own heightened fears of immigration to Europe, often borrowing language from " replacement theory ", the brainchild of a French novelist that has become a rallying cry for the global far right .

In a National Security Strategy document published on December 5, the US administration notably warned against European "migration policies that are transforming the continent and creating strife". "Should present trends continue, the continent will be unrecognizable in 20 years or less," the document predicted.

Europeans "were shocked to read that they were engaged in 'civilizational erasure'," French daily Le Monde wrote at the time.

The US document went on to warn that "censorship of free speech and suppression of political opposition" was taking place in Europe – despite European nations occupying all top 15 spots of the 2025 global Press Freedom Index from Reporters Without Borders while the US fell to a historic low at 57th place.

Kallas went on to say that Russia must be forced to make concessions in talks to end the Ukraine war.

"Let's be clear-eyed about Russia. Russia is no superpower," Kallas said, insisting the country was "broken".

"The greatest threat Russia presents right now is that it gains more at the negotiation table than it has achieved on the battlefield."

The annual security gathering in Munich has seen European officials insist the continent must take the lead on its defense in the face of an aggressive Russia and doubts over the reliability of the United States as President Donald Trump upends ties .

"There is an urgent need to reclaim European agency," Kallas said.

She said European defense "starts in Ukraine" and will depend on how the war ends. The EU top diplomat called for the size of Russia's military to be capped, said Moscow must pay for the damage it has caused and must be held accountable for war crimes.

France's Minister for European Affairs Benjamin Haddad backed up the calls for Europe to pay less attention to what the US says and focus on bolstering its own capabilities.

"I think the worst lesson we could draw from this weekend is to say, well, I can cling to some love words that I heard in part of his speech and push the snooze button," Haddad said of Rubio's address.

Instead, he said Europe should "focus on what we can control, focus on our rearmament, on the support for Ukraine and the threat that Russia poses to all of our democracies".</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 12:51:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/434a33a0-0a6a-11f1-9ced-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Rubio-Kallas2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio heads to Slovakia and Hungary to bolster ties with pro-Trump leaders</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260215-rubio-heads-slovakia-hungary-to-bolster-ties-pro-trump-leaders-eastern-europe</link><description>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio began a two-day trip to eastern Europe on Sunday to bolster ties with Slovakia and Hungary, whose conservative leaders, often at odds with other EU countries, have warm ties with President Donald Trump .

Rubio will use the trip to discuss energy cooperation ​and bilateral issues, including ‌NATO commitments, the State Department said in an announcement last week.

"These are countries that are very ⁠strong with us, very cooperative with the United States, work very closely with us," Rubio told reporters before departing for Europe on Thursday.

Rubio, who in his dual role also serves as Trump’s ‌national security adviser, met Slovak President Peter Pellegrini on Sunday on his arrival in Bratislava, the first visit by ⁠a US secretary of state in seven years, and discussed energy and defence .

"An important topic of the talks was ... defence cooperation and the fulfilment of commitments arising from NATO summits," Pellegrini's office said in a statement.

Rubio later met Slovak Prime Minister ​Robert Fico, who visited Trump in Florida last month. The US diplomat's trip follows his attendance at the ‌Munich Security Conference over the last few days.

On Monday, Rubio is expected to meet Hungarian leader Viktor Orban , who is trailing in most polls ahead of an election in April when he could be voted out of power.

"President (Trump) said he's very supportive of him, ‌and so are we," Rubio said ahead of his trip. "But obviously we were going to do that visit as a bilateral visit."

Orban, one of Trump's closest allies in Europe , is considered by many ​on the American hard-right as a model for the US president's tough policies on immigration and support for families and Christian conservatism. Budapest has repeatedly hosted Conservative Political Action Conference events, which bring together conservative activists and leaders, with another due in March.

Both Fico and Orban have clashed with EU institutions over probes into backsliding on democratic rules.

They have also maintained ties ​with Moscow , criticised and at times delayed the imposition of EU sanctions on Russia and opposed sending ​military aid to Ukraine.

Even as other European Union countries have secured alternative energy supplies after Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022, including by buying US natural gas, Slovakia and Hungary have continued to buy ​Russian gas and oil , a practice the US has criticised.

Rubio said this would be discussed during his brief tour, but did not give any details.

Fico, who has described the European Union as an institution that is in "deep crisis", has showered Trump with praise saying he would bring peace back to Europe.

But Fico criticised the US capture of Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro in early January.

Hungary and Slovakia have also so far diverged ⁠from Trump's request for all NATO members to significantly increase their military spending to 5 percent of GDP, and have raised defence spending to NATO's minimum threshold of 2 percent, a ⁠lower level than some ​other NATO members.

On nuclear cooperation, Slovakia signed an agreement with the US last month and Fico has said US-based Westinghouse was likely to build a new nuclear power plant.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 14:27:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5eec9186-0a72-11f1-a691-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26046481597454.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli strikes kill at least 12, Gaza civil defence agency says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260215-gaza-s-civil-defense-agency-says-israeli-airstrikes-killed-12</link><description>Despite a US-brokered truce that entered its second phase last month, violence has continued in the Palestinian territory , with Israel and Hamas blaming each other for violating the agreement.

The civil defence agency, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, said one strike hit a tent of displaced people in northern Gaza and another targeted an area in the south.

Five people were killed and several injured when an air strike targeted a tent sheltering displaced people in Jabalia in the north, the agency said in a statement.

Five more were killed and several injured in a separate early morning strike in the southern city of Khan Younis, the agency said, adding that one more was killed in Israeli shelling in Gaza City.

It also said Israeli gunfire killed one person in Beit Lahia in north Gaza.

The Al-Shifa and Nasser hospitals confirmed receiving at least seven bodies.

"Israel doesn't understand ceasefires or truces," said Osama Abu Askar, who lost his nephew in the Jabalia attack.

He said the people were killed as they slept.

"We've been living under a truce for months, and they've still targeted us. Israel operates on this principle – saying one thing and doing another," Askar told AFP.

Dozens of relatives and mourners gathered at Nasser Hospital, where the bodies of some of those killed were laid out in white shrouds.

Men and women prayed before the funeral, facing the corpses in the hospital compound.

A military official said Israel attacked in response to Hamas violations of the ceasefire.

"The violation included an identification of several armed terrorists who took cover under debris east of the yellow line and adjacent to IDF troops, likely after exiting underground infrastructure in the area," the official said.

"Crossing the yellow line in the vicinity of IDF troops, while armed, is an explicit ceasefire violation, and demonstrates how Hamas systematically violates the ceasefire agreement with intent to harm the troops."

Under the terms of the ceasefire , which took effect on October 10, Israeli troops withdrew to behind a so-called "Yellow Line", although they still control more than half of the Palestinian territory.

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem in a statement on Sunday accused the Israeli military of violating the ceasefire.

"Targeting of displaced people in their tents is a serious violation of the ceasefire agreement," Qassem said.

Gaza's health ministry, which operates under Hamas authorities, says at least 601 people have been killed since the truce began.

Israel says at least four of its soldiers have been killed in the same period.

Media restrictions and limited access to Gaza have prevented AFP and other news organisations from independently verifying casualty figures or freely covering the fighting.

International medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), meanwhile, said it had suspended its "non-critical" work at Nasser Hospital after staff reported seeing gunmen there and weapons being moved.

"We don't know who these armed men are or if they belong to any group," MSF told AFP.

During the war, the Israeli military accused Hamas of using hospitals as command centres to attack its forces.

"The obvious question is: where was MSF until now?" COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body for Palestinian civilian affairs, wrote on X.

"If MSF now acknowledges Hamas's deep presence in a hospital they work in, why has it repeatedly refused basic transparency – such as submitting staff lists – to ensure its organisation has not been infiltrated by Hamas operatives?"

Israel has said it will terminate all MSF activities in Gaza and the occupied West Bank from March 1 after the charity did not provide names of its Palestinian staff.

MSF says it did not do so because Israel failed to give assurances the staff would be safe.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 16:31:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5eec1418-0a7c-11f1-a4dc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/7fb92eeb1dfab41be9cb862f159047f724fdee1d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian Foreign Minister heads to Geneva for renewed talks with US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260215-iranian-foreign-minister-heads-to-geneva-for-renewed-talks-with-us</link><description>Iran 's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi headed to Switzerland on Sunday for the second round of renewed talks with the US later this week, his ministry said.

Araghchi "left Tehran for Geneva late Sunday heading a diplomatic and technical delegation to conduct the second round of nuclear talks and hold a number of diplomatic consultations," the ministry said in a statement.

"Indirect Iran-US nuclear talks will be held on Tuesday with the mediation and good offices of Oman ."

During his visit to Geneva, Araghchi is expected to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, and other international officials, the foreign ministry statement said.

Tehran and Washington restarted negotiations in Muscat on February 6, months after previous talks collapsed when Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran last June that started a 12-day war.

Considerable uncertainty surrounds the fate of Iran's stockpile of more than 400 kilogrammes of 60 percent enriched uranium that was last seen by nuclear watchdog inspectors in June.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal between the two must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran's ability to enrich more.

"There should be no enrichment capability ... dismantle the equipment and the infrastructure that allows you to enrich in the first place," he said during a speech in Jerusalem .

Meanwhile, Iran's deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the Islamic republic's economy.

"If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement," said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.

The latest talks came with Washington having threatened Tehran with military action and deployed an aircraft carrier group to the region following Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests last month.

On February 6, Araghchi led the Iranian delegation in indirect nuclear talks with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US President Donald Trump 's influential son-in-law Jared Kushner in Muscat.

Switzerland has played a key role in diplomatic relations between Iran and the US for decades.

It has represented US interests in Iran since Washington broke off relations with Tehran after the 1980 hostage crisis, a year after the Iranian revolution.

Iranian deputy foreign minister for economic diplomacy Hamid Ghanbari said Tehran was seeking a deal with the United States that would generate economic benefits for both countries, particularly in sectors such as aviation , mining and oil and gas, the Fars news agency reported.

"For the agreement to be viable, it is essential that the United States also be able to benefit from it in areas with strong and rapid economic return potential," he was quoted as saying.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 20:53:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a7442d58-fdbc-11f0-8dec-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-94G969E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US forces board oil tanker in Indian Ocean that fled Caribbean blockade</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260215-us-forces-board-oil-tanker-in-indian-ocean-that-fled-caribbean-blockade</link><description>US forces boarded an oil tanker in the Indian Ocean that violated US President Donald Trump's blockade of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean and fled the region, the Pentagon said Sunday.

The Panamanian-flagged Veronica III "tried to defy President Trump's quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean , closed the distance, and shut it down," the Pentagon said on X.

The post included a video of US forces boarding a helicopter and then boarding the tanker ship.

The Pentagon intercepted the Aquila II in similar fashion about a week ago.

In December, Trump ordered a "blockade" of sanctioned oil vessels heading to and from Venezuela . At least nine ships have been seized thus far.

But those ships seized in recent months make up only a tiny fraction of the total number of sanctioned "shadow fleet" vessels operating worldwide to evade sanctions , which a senior US Coast Guard officer said number up to 800.

The Veronica III left Venezuela on January 3 – the same day that US special forces captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a raid – carrying around 1.9 million barrels of oil, TankersTrackers.com said.

The ship is listed under US sanctions relating to Iran , according to the website of the US Treasury's Office of Foreign Asset Control.

"The Department of War will deny illicit actors and their proxies freedom of movement in the maritime domain," the Pentagon said on X.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 21:48:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d4adb1b8-0ab6-11f1-bf39-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-15T142412Z-1822294860-RC2DMJAY4EAM-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-VESSEL.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli strike in eastern Lebanon kills four, targets Islamic Jihad</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260215-lebanon-dead-strike-israel-palestinian-group</link><description>Lebanon said an Israeli strike on Sunday near the Syrian border in the country's east killed four people, as Israel said it had targeted operatives from Palestinian militant group Islamic Jihad .

Despite a November 2024 truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon, usually saying it is targeting the Iran-backed group but occasionally also targeting its Palestinian ally Hamas .

It appeared to be the first strike Israel has claimed in Lebanon against Islamic Jihad, which is also allied with Hezbollah, since the truce.

An Israeli drone "targeted a car on the Lebanese-Syrian border", the state-run National News Agency said, adding that "four bodies" were inside the vehicle.

Lebanon's health ministry confirmed the toll in a statement.

The Israeli military in a statement said it "struck Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in the Majdal Anjar area".

Fighters from Islamic Jihad were among those killed in Lebanon during hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, which erupted in October 2023 over the Gaza war.

The Palestinian group and Hamas both claimed some attacks and infiltration attempts from Lebanon during the hostilities.

More than 370 people have been killed by Israeli fire in Lebanon since the ceasefire, according to an AFP tally of health ministry reports.

In line with the 2024 truce, the Lebanese army announced in January that it had completed the first phase of a government plan to disarm Hezbollah, covering the area near the Israeli border.

As part of the Lebanese government's push to disarm non-state groups, some Palestinian factions in Lebanon handed over weapons in several refugee camps last year to the Lebanese authorities.

Hamas and its Islamic Jihad ally have not announced plans to disarm in Lebanon.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 22:52:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c817865a-f6f1-11f0-895c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/295310cf78f91bcbdbfc7436e8c98ec4691cc4f1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>FBI says DNA from glove may link suspect to Nancy Guthrie abduction</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260215-fbi-dna-recovered-glove-nancy-guthrie-home</link><description>Investigators have obtained a DNA sample from a discarded glove that was found near Nancy Guthrie's Arizona home and appears to match the pair worn by a masked prowler seen in video footage caught by her doorbell camera before she was abducted two weeks ago , the FBI said on Sunday.

The ​preliminary findings from ‌a private crime laboratory in Florida were received by the FBI on Saturday and were awaiting "quality control ⁠and official confirmation" on Sunday before investigators run the results through a national database of known DNA profiles, the FBI said in a statement.

The process typically takes 24 hours from when the Federal Bureau of ‌Investigation receives a DNA sample.

The glove was one of roughly 16 collected by investigators in recent days in ⁠a search zone within two miles of the Tucson-area residence of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie, the mother of US television journalist Savannah Guthrie.

Most of the gloves collected by investigators for examination turned out to have been dropped on the ground by searchers in the ​vicinity, the FBI said.

But the one with a DNA profile recovered from it is "different and appears to ‌match the gloves" worn by the man in a ski mask seen trying to disable Guthrie's door camera in the early morning hours shortly before she was abducted, according to the FBI statement.

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said on Friday that he was certain that the man in the video, who was ‌also wearing a gun in a holster and an over-stuffed backpack, was the primary suspect investigators were looking for to solve the high-profile case.

Nancy Guthrie was last seen on January 31 when family dropped ​her off at her home near Tucson after she had dined with them, and relatives reported her missing the following day, authorities have said.

Nanos has said the elder Guthrie was extremely limited in her physical mobility and could not have left her home unassisted, leading investigators to ​conclude early on that she had been taken against her will.

At least two purported ransom notes have surfaced since she vanished, both of them ​delivered initially to news media outlets.

Traces of blood found on her front porch were confirmed by DNA ​tests to have come from Guthrie, officials said last week.

Law enforcement and family members have described her as being in frail health and in need of daily medication to survive. She also had a ​pacemaker.

The sheriff said on Friday that DNA from people other than Guthrie or those known to have been in close contact with her had also been collected from her property, but there has been no official word on any further findings from those samples.

Savannah Guthrie, co-anchor of the popular NBC News morning show "Today," has posted several video messages with her brother Camron Guthrie and sister Annie Guthrie pleading for their mother's return and appealing for ⁠the public's help in solving the case. In one video, they expressed a willingness to meet ransom demands.

Nanos told Reuters on Friday that no proof of life has surfaced since ⁠the abduction but he was ​quick to add: "There's not been any proof of death either."

The presumed kidnapping has drawn intense media attention as well as expressions of sympathy and support from President Donald Trump.</description><pubDate>Sun, 15 Feb 2026 23:27:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f420aed6-06bc-11f1-85bd-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-10T190532Z-1364420265-RC27JJAYX6GK-RTRMADP-3-USA-CRIME-GUTHRIE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Accused Bondi beach killer appears in Sydney court for first hearing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260216-accused-bondi-beach-killer-appears-sydney-court-first-hearing</link><description>Accused Bondi Beach killer Naveed Akram appeared in a Sydney court via video link Monday, in his first public hearing.

Akram and his father Sajid allegedly attacked a Jewish Hanukkah celebration in December in the nation's worst mass shooting in nearly three decades.

Akram has been charged with terrorism and 15 counts of murder. Sajid was shot and killed by police during the attack.

He appeared for about five minutes via video link from prison, according to a statement from the court and local media.

Akram wore a green jumper during the hearing, which dealt mostly with technical matters such as suppressing the identification of some victims, local media said.

He reportedly spoke only one word -- "yeah" -- when asked by the judge whether he had heard a discussion about the extension of suppression orders.

Speaking outside the court, Akram's lawyer Ben Archbold said his client was being held in "very onerous conditions", ABC said.

He also said it was too early to say whether Akram would plead guilty.

Among the victims of December's attack were an 87-year-old Holocaust survivor, a couple who confronted one of the gunmen, and a 10-year-old girl, Matilda, who was described at her funeral as a "ray of sunshine".</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 02:10:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7c7368ee-dd93-11f0-aefb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-16T094528Z-624111986-RC2LHIAQWE68-RTRMADP-3-AUSTRALIA-CRIME-FLORAL-TRIBUTES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Leaders gather for New Delhi AI summit as warnings grow over societal risks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260216-india-hosts-ai-summit</link><description>A global artificial intelligence summit kicks off in New Delhi on Monday with big issues on the agenda, from job disruption to child safety, but some attendees warn the broad focus could diminish the chance of concrete commitments from world leaders.

While frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits and share prices for many technology companies, anxiety is growing over the risks that it poses to society and the environment.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Monday afternoon inaugurate the five-day AI Impact Summit, which aims to declare a "shared roadmap for global AI governance and collaboration".

"This occasion is further proof that our country is progressing rapidly in the field of science and technology," and it "shows the capability of our country's youth", he said in an X post on Monday.

It is the fourth annual gathering addressing the problems and opportunities posed by AI, after previous international meetings in Paris, Seoul and Britain's wartime code-breaking hub Bletchley.

Touted as the biggest edition yet, the Indian government is expecting 250,000 visitors from across the sector, including 20 national leaders and 45 ministerial-level delegations.

Also in attendance will be tech CEOs including Sam Altman of OpenAI and Google's Sundar Pichai, although unforeseen circumstances have reportedly led Jensen Huang, head of US chip titan Nvidia, to cancel his planned appearance.

Modi will seek to "strengthen global partnerships and define India's leadership in the AI decade ahead" in talks with the likes of France's Emmanuel Macron and Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, organisers say.

But whether they will take meaningful steps to hold AI giants accountable is in doubt, Amba Kak, co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, told AFP.

Industry commitments made at previous events "have largely been narrow 'self regulatory' frameworks that position AI companies to continue to grade their own homework", said Kak, a former AI advisor to the US Federal Trade Commission who is taking part in the summit.

The Bletchley gathering, held in 2023 -- a year after ChatGPT stunned the world -- was called the AI Safety Summit.

The meetings' names have changed as they have grown in size and scope, and at last year's AI Action Summit in Paris , dozens of nations signed a statement calling for efforts to flank AI tech with regulation to make it "open" and "ethical".

But the United States did not sign, with Vice President JD Vance warning that "excessive regulation... could kill a transformative sector just as it's taking off".

The Delhi summit has the loose themes of "people, progress, planet" -- dubbed three "sutras".

Even so, AI safety remains a priority, including the dangers of misinformation such as deepfakes.

Last month saw a global backlash over Elon Musk's Grok AI tool because it allowed users to produce sexualised pictures of real people, including children, using simple text prompts.

"Child safety and digital harms are also moving up the agenda, particularly as generative AI lowers the barrier to harmful content," AI Asia Pacific Institute director Kelly Forbes told AFP.

"There is real scope for change" although it might not happen fast enough, said Forbes, whose organisation is researching how Australia and other countries are requiring platforms to confront the issue.

Organisers highlight this year's AI summit as the first to be hosted by a developing country.

"The summit will shape a shared vision for AI that truly serves the many, not just the few," India's IT ministry has said.

Last year India leapt to third place -- overtaking South Korea and Japan -- in an annual global ranking of AI competitiveness calculated by Stanford University researchers.

But despite plans for large-scale infrastructure and grand ambitions for innovation, experts say the country still has a long way to go before it can rival the United States and China.

Neither Donald Trump nor Xi Jinping will attend the summit, but both countries are sending high-level tech policy officials.

Seth Hays, author of the Asia AI Policy Monitor newsletter, said talk at the summit would likely centre around "ensuring that governments put up some guardrails, but don't throttle AI development".

"There may be some announcements for more state investment in AI, but it may not move the needle much -- as India needs partnerships to integrate on the international scene for AI," Hays told AFP.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 04:37:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/06f40a2a-0ad8-11f1-800f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/e287c804a2a12ae936f42fc353b9d741e1b351a6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘Ola Lula’: Rio Carnival ode to Brazil’s president sparks political storm</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260215-rio-carnival-parades-kick-off-with-divisive-ode-to-lula-in-election-year</link><description>A colossal metallic robot depicting Brazil 's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva towered over Rio de Janeiro 's famed Sambadrome avenue on Sunday night, in a Carnival parade that has drawn fire for its tribute to a sitting president in an election year.

Samba school Academicos de Niteroi kicked off three days of dazzling parades with the homage to Lula, tracing his life as a boy growing up in poverty in the arid northeast, to a metalworker, union leader and then president.

The opposition has slammed the parade as veiled early campaigning ahead of October polls in which the 80-year-old Lula is seeking a fourth term.

Lula and his wife Rosangela "Janja" da Silva watched the parade from one of the many VIP boxes lining the avenue.

There were striking workers, dancers draped in giant lightbulbs to represent access to electricity and those depicting the poor getting benefits in what was also an ode to a raft of leftist concerns.

The crowd seated along the 700-meter avenue sang along to the theme song chosen by Academicos de Niteroi, which included the catchy refrain often used by the president's supporters: "Ole, ole, ole, ola; Lula, Lula!"

Luena Holliday, 51, an events organiser, said she was a fan of the veteran leftist, but she was torn about the choice of theme.

"I find it confusing. I support Lula ... but we're in a very divided moment in the country, and I don't know how appropriate it is to associate Carnival with Lula," she told AFP.

The parades of the city's top 12 samba schools – a ferocious competition featuring massive, animated floats, thundering drum sections and scantily-clad samba queens – are the showpiece of Rio's Carnival.

Behind the pomp and glitter, each school chooses an annual theme, often linked to Afro-Brazilian heritage, social or political commentary, mythology or environmental issues.

The parade – the first to honor a serving president – made no mention of the election, but did not shy away from politics.

The theme song declares "no amnesty" – the leftist chant against efforts to free former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro from a 27-year jail term he is serving for plotting a failed coup.

And one of the floats depicted a giant Bozo the Clown in prison stripes behind bars, with a massive ankle bracelet, a clear reference to Bolsonaro, who has often been nicknamed "Bozo" by his critics.

Bolsonaro was moved from house arrest to prison before the official start of his sentence after trying to remove his ankle monitoring bracelet with a soldering iron.

"Bozo in Jail? That's where he is supposed to be," a glitter-covered Nelia Macedo, 44, told AFP, praising a parade which "exceeded all expectations."

Marcia Alves, 59, a retired businesswoman, who admits she is not a supporter of Lula, said "you shouldn't mix Carnival with politics. It's for everyone to have fun, everyone has their own opinion."

Bolsonaro has anointed his eldest son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, as his political heir and presidential candidate.

Shortly before the start of the parade, Flavio published an AI-generated video of a parade mocking Lula "the thief," showing him behind bars in reference to his 2018 jailing on a corruption charge that was later annulled.

Brazil's electoral court, the TSE, on Thursday unanimously rejected requests filed by two opposition parties to stop Academicos from parading Sunday.

The court said it could not block a parade before it happened, but warned it could still investigate after the show.

On Friday, the presidency warned officials attending carnival events not to make "statements that could be characterized as early electoral propaganda."

"We did not come here to campaign," said Leonel Querino, one of the directors of Academicos de Niteroi.

"We came here to celebrate the story of a worker in Brazil."</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 07:36:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5872a218-0af0-11f1-92b0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/65b36f3ec6f994c330fe9237d62c6b7afb701caa.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel approves West Bank land registration, Palestinians slam ‘de-facto annexation’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260216-israel-approves-west-bank-land-registration-palestinians-slam-de-facto-annexation</link><description>Israel 's cabinet on Sunday approved further measures ​to tighten Israel's control over the occupied West Bank and make it easier for settlers to buy land, a move Palestinians called a "de-facto annexation".

The West Bank is among the territories that ​Palestinians seek for ‌a future independent state. Much of it is under Israeli military ⁠control, with limited Palestinian self-rule in some areas run by the Western-backed Palestinian Authority .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , who is ‌facing an election later this year, deems the establishment of any Palestinian state a ⁠security threat.

His ruling coalition, which has a large voter base in the settlements, includes many members who want Israel to annex the West Bank, land captured ​in the 1967 Middle East war to which Israel cites biblical and ‌historical ties.

Ministers voted in favour of beginning a process of land registration for the first time since 1967, a week after approving another series of measures in the West Bank that drew international ‌condemnation.

"We are continuing the revolution of settlement and strengthening our hold across all parts of our land," said far-right Finance Minister ​Bezalel Smotrich.

Defence Minister Israel Katz said land registration was a vital security measure while the cabinet said in a statement it was an "appropriate response to illegal land registration processes promoted by ​the Palestinian Authority".

The foreign ministry said the measure would promote transparency and help resolve ​land disputes.

But Egypt, Qatar and Jordan criticised the move as illegal under international law.

In a statement, the Egyptian government called it a "dangerous escalation aimed at consolidating Israeli control over the occupied Palestinian territories".

Qatar's foreign ministry condemned the "decision to convert West Bank lands into so-called 'state property'," saying it would "deprive the Palestinian people of their rights".

The Palestinian presidency condemned the step, saying it constitutes "a ​de-facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory and a declaration of the commencement of annexation plans aimed at entrenching the occupation through illegal settlement ​activity."

Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now said the measure could lead to dispossession of Palestinians from up to half of the West Bank.

According to public broadcaster Kan, land registration will be reopened in the West Bank for the first time since 1967 – when Israel captured the territory in the Middle East war.

The Israeli media reported that the process will take place only in Area C, which constitutes some 60 percent of West Bank territory and is under Israeli security and administrative control.

US President Donald Trump has ruled out Israeli annexation of the West Bank but his administration has not sought to curb Israel's accelerated settlement building.

The United ⁠Nations' highest court said in a non-binding advisory opinion in 2024 that Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there ⁠are illegal and ​should be ended as soon as possible. Israel disputes this view.

Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, more than 500,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and outposts, deemed illegal under international law.

Around three million Palestinians live in the territory.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 08:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/043ce396-0b0b-11f1-83a4-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26019479168184.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio meets Orban as Trump ally lags in polls ahead of Hungary elections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260216-rubio-meets-orban-as-trump-ally-lags-in-polls-ahead-of-hungary-elections</link><description>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has arrived in Hungary for talks with Prime Minister Viktor Orban Monday, ahead of elections where the nationalist leader faces a significant challenge from the opposition.

Rubio's visit is the final stage of a whirlwind trip to Europe that also saw him address the Munich Security Conference and visit another right-wing ally, Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico.

US President Donald Trump has made no secret of his high regard for Orban, saying in a social media post on Friday that the prime minister had produced "phenomenal" results in Hungary.

In a speech on Saturday, Orban insisted he would keep up his fight against "pseudo-civil organisations, bought journalists, judges, politicians" – a tirade not unlike those favoured by Trump.

He also took aim at the "oppressive machinery of Brussels", another jibe at the European Union 's leadership, with whom he has long been at loggerheads on a host of issues.

Orban is in the firing line of the EU's leadership for what they say is his silencing of critical voices in the judiciary, academia, the media and civil society. They also accuse him of going after minorities.

Adding to tension with the EU is the close relationship he has maintained with Russia's President Vladimir Putin – another thing he has in common with Trump.

Rubio's visit comes ahead of Hungary's parliamentary election on April 12, which has seen opposition leader Peter Magyar emerge as the biggest threat to Orban since he returned to power in 2010.

Magyar's Tisza party has been running ahead of Orban's Fidesz in opinion polls for many months.

At an election rally Sunday, Magyar accused Orban of corruption, cracking down on civil liberties and being a "puppet" of foreign powers.

"It is time to call corruption by its name: theft," Magyar told hundreds of supporters at the rally, accusing the prime minister's supporters of diverting billions of dollars.

He said his party would guarantee "total transparency in contracts involving public funds" and "recover" all the money Hungary "has been deprived of over 16 years".

Magyar also accused Orban of spying on opponents and promised to bolster civil liberties.

"If they can search through my private life, then they can rummage through everyone's," said Magyar, who said he would propose "a country where everyone can live in peace".

Opposition and rights groups regularly accuse Orban of silencing critical voices in the judiciary, academia and media, as well as cutting the rights of minority groups.

Rubio arrived in Budapest on Sunday evening, and was due to hold talks with Orban on Monday morning before flying back to Washington.

The decision to visit Fico and Orban, two nationalist leaders close to both Trump and Putin -- and out of step with the EU consensus – sends a clear diplomatic message.

In his speech on Saturday to the Munich Security Conference, Rubio called on Europe to join Trump in his fight to defend Western civilisation from the threat of mass immigration .

But he tried, too, to reassure European leaders over the US position on NATO , and on Greenland – with mixed success.

But if his main message was that Europe should get behind the vision of the US president, in Bratislava on Sunday he stressed: "We're not asking Europe to be a vassal of the United States.

"We want to be your partner. We want to work with Europe. We want to work with our allies."

Orban is one of several leaders to have announced he will travel to Washington next week for the inaugural meeting of Trump's controversial "Board of Peace" – which critics see as an instrument designed to undermine the UN Security Council.

Orban became a hero to many Trump supporters for his hostility to migration during the Syrian refugee crisis a decade ago. He has made several visits to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

And energy will be on the agenda in Monday's talks, just as it was in Slovakia.

When Orban visited the White House in 2025, Trump granted Hungary an exemption from sanctions imposed on Russian oil and gas imports over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 10:51:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5629b508-0b1f-11f1-a1fa-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-97PB7KP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French police raid Paris's Arab World Institute in Epstein-linked probe into Jack Lang</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260216-french-police-raid-paris-s-arab-world-institute-in-epstein-linked-probe-into-jack-lang</link><description>French police conducted raids at various locations, including the Arab World Institute (IMA) in Paris, on Monday as part of the investigation into the institution's former head Jack Lang for his alleged financial ties to Jeffrey Epstein , Pascal Prache, head of the national financial prosecutor's office, said in a statement.

Lang, a former French culture minister under ​socialist president François Mitterrand , resigned earlier this month from ​the organisation which he ​had led since 2013.

The Arab World Institute is a ​Paris-based cultural and research institution under the supervision of France's foreign ministry that promotes understanding of the Arab world .

Lang, who corresponded ⁠with Epstein from 2012 and 2019, has denied the ⁠accusations ​against him.

The raids came after French prosecutors opened ‌a preliminary investigation ​into alleged tax fraud against Lang and his ​daughter following the ​release of documents ​by the US ​Department of Justice.

The Paris prosecutor's office on Saturday announced that it was setting up a special team of magistrates to analyse evidence that could implicate French nationals in the crimes of the convicted sex offender Epstein.

With Epstein's known circle now extending to prominent French figures after the release of documents by the US authorities, the prosecutor's office said it would also thoroughly re-examine the case of a former French modelling agency executive, Jean-Luc Brunel, a close associate of the American financier who died in custody in 2022.

The new team will work closely with prosecutors from the national financial crimes unit and police with a view to opening investigations into any suspected crimes involving French nationals, the Paris prosecutor's office told AFP.

The aim is "to be able to extract any piece that could be usefully reused in a new investigative framework", it said.

Brunel was found dead in his cell in a Paris prison in 2022 after having been charged with raping minors. The case against him was dropped in 2023 in the wake of his death, with no other person charged.

Prosecutors said an investigation had shown Brunel was "a close friend of Jeffrey Epstein" who had offered modelling jobs to young girls from poor backgrounds.

Brunel had engaged in sexual acts with underage girls in the United States, the US Virgin Islands, Paris and the south of France, they said.

Ten women had made accusations against Brunel, several describing how they had been led to drink alcohol and had been subjected to forced sexual penetration, according to the prosecutor's office.

Several French public figures feature in the latest US Department of Justice release of material from the Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.

The prosecutor's office said it had been asked to look into three new specific cases involving a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.

At the request of the French foreign ministry it was looking into the reported appearance of senior diplomat Fabrice Aidan in the cache of Epstein-related documents published by the US authorities.

"An investigation is underway to gather various pieces of evidence that could substantiate this report," the prosecutor's office stated.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 11:40:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c9ff8f2c-0b27-11f1-b4c7-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-96JC4NQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Ukraine names ex-minister Galushchenko suspect in laundering probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260216-live-ukraine-names-ex-minister-galushchenko-suspect-laundering-probe</link><description>Hungarian ​Prime ​Minister Victor Orban said ​that ‌he ⁠assured ‌US Secretary of State Marco ⁠Rubio that his ​country still ‌backs US peace efforts ‌in Ukraine ​and that Budapest was still open ​to ​hosting a peace ​summit.

The ​Kremlin said ​that what it called "the main issues" ​would ‌be ⁠discussed in peace ‌talks on Ukraine due ⁠to be held in Geneva ​this week, including ‌territory.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ‌that Putin aide Vladimir ​Medinsky, military intelligence chief Igor Kostyukov, and special ​envoy Kirill ​Dmitriev would ​take part in ​the talks between Russia, Ukraine and the United States.

⁠Russia's ​defence ministry said ​on Monday that it had downed ​345 ‌Ukrainian ⁠drones in ‌the past 24 hours ⁠and taken control of two ​settlements, state ‌media reported.

The state RIA news ‌agency said ​Russian forces had taken control of the settlements ​of Pokrovka ​and ​Minkivka in eastern Ukraine.

Ukraine's former energy minister German Galushchenko has been formally named as a suspect in a high-profile money laundering probe, investigators said.

The announcement comes one day after Galushchenko was detained by law enforcement attempting to leave Ukraine, and is the latest development in a corruption scandal in the energy sector that rocked the government last year.

"The former Energy Minister (2021-2025) has been exposed for money laundering and participation in a criminal organisation," the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) said in a statement.

The statement did not name Galushchenko, but he served as the country's energy minister between 2021 and 2025.

Galushchenko was accused in November of taking part in a $100-million kickback scheme from contractors building fortifications to defend energy infrastructure against Russian attacks.

Investigators now allege they found approximately $12 million in bank accounts linked to Galushchenko's family.

⁠Local ​authorities ​in Russia's Krasnodar region said ​⁠that ‌a fire at ⁠the Black Sea port of ​Taman, ‌which handles oil ‌products, grain, ​coal and commodities, had been extinguished.

The ​port was ​damaged ​by a ​Ukrainian drone attack on Sunday.

Quentin Deranque, 23, died of his wounds after being attacked Thursday on the sidelines of a far-right protest against a left-wing politician speaking at a university in the city of Lyon .

The incident has fuelled tension between France's far right and hard left ahead of municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race.

The investigation is still ongoing, but the government has already blamed rhetoric from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party for fuelling the violence that led to his death.

The far right has blamed the killing on la Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth group co-founded by an LFI lawmaker before he was elected to parliament.

The group – which was dissolved in June – denied any links to the "tragic events".

Lyon's prosecutor was to reveal the findings of his investigation on Monday afternoon.

Government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon accused the LFI Monday of having "encouraged a climate of violence for years".

"There is therefore – in light of the political climate and the climate of violence – a moral responsibility on the part of LFI" for the attack on Thursday, she told television broadcaster BFMTV.

Raphael Glucksmann, a centre left member of European parliament, also lambasted the hard left party.

"It's unthinkable that, on the left, we would continue to harbour the slightest doubt about a possible electoral alliance with LFI," he told the RTL broadcaster.

The left, including LFI, allied against the far right after President Emmanuel Macron took a gamble by calling for snap parliamentary elections in 2024 .

But Macron lost even more of his majority, and the anti-immigration National Rally (RN ) became the biggest party in the lower house.

According to a source close to the probe into the Lyon killing, there was "a pitched battle between members of the far left and the far right".

A video broadcast by TF1 television of the alleged attack shows a dozen people hitting three others lying on the ground, two of whom manage to escape.

A witness said "people were hitting each other with iron bars".

LFI's veteran leader Jean-Luc Melenchon , a three-time presidential candidate widely expected to run again next year, has denied his party were to blame.

On the far right, Marine Le Pen , who is still hoping to stand in 2027 despite a graft conviction, condemned the "barbarians responsible for this lynching".

Opinion polls put the far right in the lead for the presidency in 2027, when Macron will have to step down after the maximum two consecutive terms in office.

Le Pen has said she will decide whether to run after an appeal court ruling in July, when she could hand over to her lieutenant Jordan Bardella .

A poll of 1,000 people published on Sunday placed Bardella as the preferred candidate in the 2027 vote, ahead of Le Pen in second place.

Centrist ex-prime minister Edouard Philippe, a candidate, and Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin were in joint third place.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 15:09:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10c3bcac-0b2e-11f1-84bd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/ca8d2cafa6fdbf9180e4ca38cda4cda8c4f4a2c9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's interim leader Yunus resigns, handing power to elected government</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260216-bangladesh-interim-leader-yunus-resigns-handing-power-to-elected-government</link><description>Bangladesh 's interim leader Muhammad Yunus stepped down on Monday in a farewell broadcast to the nation before handing over to an elected government.

"Today, the interim government is stepping down," the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner said.

"But let the practice of democracy , freedom of speech, and fundamental rights that has begun not be halted."

Yunus returned from self-imposed exile in August 2024, days after the iron-fisted government of Sheikh Hasina was overthrown by a student-led uprising and she fled by helicopter to India .

"That was the day of great liberation," he said. "What a day of joy it was! Bangladeshis across the world shed tears of happiness. The youth of our country freed it from the grip of a demon."

He has led Bangladesh as its "chief adviser" since, and now hands over power after congratulating the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader Tarique Rahman on a "landslide victory" in elections last week.

"The people, voters, political parties, and stakeholder institutions linked to the election have set a commendable example," Yunus said.

"This election has set a benchmark for future elections."

Rahman, 60, chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country's most powerful political dynasties, will lead the South Asian nation of 170 million.

Bangladeshi voters endorsed sweeping democratic reforms in a national referendum, a key pillar of Yunus's post-uprising transition agenda, on the same day as the elections.

The lengthy document, known as the "July Charter" after the month when the uprising that toppled Hasina began, proposes term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.

"We did not start from zero – we started from a deficit," he said.

"Sweeping away the ruins, we rebuilt institutions and set the course for reforms."

The referendum noted that approval would make the charter "binding on the parties that win" the election, obliging them to endorse it.

However, several parties raised questions before the vote, and the reforms will still require ratification by the new parliament.

The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.

Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman conceded on Saturday, saying his Islamist party would "serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition".

Newly elected lawmakers are expected to be sworn in on Tuesday, after which Tarique Rahman is set to become Bangladesh's next prime minister.

Police records show that political clashes during the campaign period killed five people and injured more than 600.

However, despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has responded to the results with relative calm.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 17:10:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b06755b8-0b54-11f1-a49d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26043181249529.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says US has developed 'more realistic' stance on nuclear issue ahead of Geneva talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260216-iran-says-us-has-developed-more-realistic-stance-on-nuclear-issue-ahead-of-geneva-talks</link><description>Iran said on Monday that the United States's position on Iran's nuclear programme "has moved towards a more realistic one", a day ahead of a second round of US-Iranian talks in Geneva.

Tehran's foreign minister arrived in Geneva for the new round of indirect negotiations with the US, as the Revolutionary Guards began military drills in the Strait of Hormuz , a vital shipping lane for oil and gas.

The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman , after US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.

A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.

"A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one," said foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei, the official IRNA news agency reported.

According to Tehran, talks mediated by Oman will be held on Tuesday in Switzerland .

Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed including Iran's ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.

The war games being conducted by the Guards, the ideological arm of the military, aim to prepare it for "potential security and military threats" in the strait, Iranian state TV said.

Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic waterway through which about 20 percent of global oil passes, as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday "we're hopeful there's a deal".

"The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things."

Meanwhile, Iran's top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, wrote on X that he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, "for deep technical discussion".

Grossi later confirmed the meeting on X, calling the conversation with Araghchi "in-depth" ahead of Tuesday's "important negotiations".

Araghchi is also set to hold talks with his Swiss and Omani counterparts as well as other international officials, Iran's foreign ministry said.

"I am in Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal. What is not on the table: submission before threats," Araghchi added on X.

Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner , the White House confirmed on Sunday.

The latest talks follow repeated threats from Trump of military action against Tehran, first over Iran's deadly crackdown on anti-government protests, and then more recently over the country's nuclear programme.

The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.

On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the "best thing that could happen", as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.

His remarks came before demonstrations outside Iran against its clerical authorities swept a number of cities including in the US over the weekend.

Iranians inside the country have also defied the deadly crackdown on protests last month and continued to shout slogans against the authorities from their windows.

Iran's deputy foreign minister told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifts sanctions that have crippled the country's economy.

"If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement," said Majid Takht-Ravanchi.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday that any deal must involve the removal of all enriched uranium from Iran as well as Tehran's ability to enrich more.

The whereabouts of Iran's stockpile of around 400 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to 60 percent remains unknown, with inspectors having last seen it in June.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 17:11:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/031fb9ee-0b37-11f1-bdc9-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/d0f93d2375017c269b822fdd85b65c5ef794deb5.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Robert Duvall, Oscar-winning star of 'The Godfather', 'Apocalypse Now' dies age 95</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260216-robert-duvall-oscar-winning-star-of-the-godfather-apocalypse-now-dies-age-95</link><description>Robert Duvall, who played the smooth mafia lawyer in "The Godfather" and stole the show with his depiction of a surfing-crazed colonel in "Apocalypse Now", died on Sunday at the age of 95, his wife Luciana Duvall confirmed Monday.

"Yesterday we said goodbye to my beloved husband, cherished friend, and one of the greatest actors of our time. Bob passed away peacefully at home," she wrote.

Blunt-talking, prolific and glitz-averse, Duvall won an Oscar for best actor and was nominated six other times. Over his six decades-long career, he shone in both lead and supporting roles, and eventually became a director.

"To the world, he was an Academy Award-winning actor, a director, a storyteller. To me, he was simply everything," Luciana Duvall said. "His passion for his craft was matched only by his deep love for characters, a great meal, and holding court."

To display this content from Facebook, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

Duvall won his Academy Award in 1983 for playing a washed-up country singer in "Tender Mercies".

But his most memorable characters also included the soft-spoken, loyal mob consigliere Tom Hagen in the first two installments of "The Godfather" and the maniacal Lieutenant Colonel William Kilgore in Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Vietnam War epic "Apocalypse Now".

The latter, which earned Duvall an Oscar nomination and made him a bona fide star after years playing lesser roles, sees him utter what is now one of cinema's most famous lines.

"I love the smell of napalm in the morning," his war-loving character – bare chested, cocky and sporting a big black cowboy hat – muses as low-flying US warplanes bomb a beachfront tree line where he wants to go surfing.

That character was originally created to be even more over the top – his name was at first supposed to be Colonel Carnage – but Duvall had it toned down, demonstrating his meticulous approach to acting.

"I did my homework," Duvall told veteran talk show host Larry King in 2015. "I did my research."

Duvall was sort of a late bloomer in Hollywood – he was already 31 when he delivered his breakout performance as the mysterious recluse Boo Radley in the 1962 film adaptation of Harper Lee's novel "To Kill a Mockingbird".

He would go on to play myriad roles – a bullying corporate executive in "Network" (1976), a Marine officer who treats his family like soldiers in "The Great Santini" (1979), and then his star turn in "Tender Mercies."

Duvall often said his favorite role, however, was one he played in a 1989 TV mini-series – the grizzled, wise-cracking Texas Ranger-turned-cowboy Augustus McCrae in "Lonesome Dove", based on the novel by Larry McMurtry.

Film critic Elaine Mancini once described Duvall as "the most technically proficient, the most versatile, and the most convincing actor on the screen in the United States".</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 19:09:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d4bd0e8-0b63-11f1-9ff9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-Was8898974.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>’Ready to govern’ Hungary: Former ally Magyar challenges Orban with Europe gun</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260216-ready-govern-former-ally-magyar-challenges-hungary-orban-with-europe-gun</link><description>Forty-four-year-old Peter Magyar burst onto Hungary’s political scene in February, 2024 , after having broken ranks with Orban ’s Fidesz party over a child sex abuse pardon scandal that led to the resignation of his ex-wife, then justice minister Judit Varga, and then president Katalin Novak.

Magyar, who up until then had been part of Orban’s inner circle, accused the government of walking free from responsibility after letting Varga and Novak take the blame. “I don’t want to be part of a system where the real culprits hide behind women’s skirts,” he said. Shortly afterward he launched his own centre-right party, Tisza (Respect and Freedom), and vowed to crack down on corruption and bring Hungary closer to Europe.

“Step by step, brick by brick, we are taking back our homeland and building a new country, a sovereign, modern, European Hungary,” Magyar said shortly after founding his party.

Just a few months later, Tisza stunned Hungary’s political establishment by securing almost 30 percent of the votes in the European parliamentary elections – cementing Magyar’s role as Orban’s most serious challenger yet.

As both contenders launched their campaigns over the weekend, Magyar’s Tisza already held a comfortable 10-point lead over Orban’s Fidesz – and has done so over the past year, according to a combined poll by Politico .

“Tisza stands ready to govern,” Magyar said at his launch event.

Aside from the Fidesz “family values” brand taking a serious hit with the 2024 pardon scandal – prompting some of the party’s conservative members to defect to Tisza – Orban has been unable to to get Hungary’s bleeding economy back on track. In 2023, a presidential pardon had been secretly granted to the deputy director of a children’s home convicted of covering up a case of child sex abuse.

In the wake of Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine – which pushed the country’s energy prices to the skies – Orban also introduced new income rebates, which in 2023 resulted in the worst inflationary surge in Europe, at a staggering 25 percent.

Although the worst of the financial crisis has since subsided, a Eurobarometer survey cited by Reuters last autumn showed that rising prices, inflation and cost of living still top Hungarians’ main concerns.

The state of the country’s economy has also been weighed down by the fact that the European Union has blocked some €20 billion in funds over corruption and the rule of law concerns .

The economy is in other words a sore point for Orban, and Magyar has taken every opoortunity to point that out.

The real battleground in the April ballot will be the two candidates' opposing views on the EU.

While Orban last week declared that the real danger to Hungary is the EU , Magyar has gone the other way: “Hungary will once again be a full-fledged member of the European Union,” he told a Budapest rally last year, touting the EU as the answer to Hungary’s prayers, especially if it releases the withheld EU funds.

On Saturday, Orban told supporters that “Brussels … [is] a source of imminent danger”, adding that the April ballot is therefore a choice between “war and peace”, and that Fidesz, with its anti-EU stance, therefore is the only “safe choice”.

Orban's anti-establishment and nationalist views has won him support from US President Donald Trump , and on Monday US Secretary of State Marco Rubio paid him a symbolic visit, telling him " your success is our success ".

Orban hopes his ties with Trump wil help him collect the votes needed to prolong his reign.

If he wins the elections, he has promised to "clear away" the "oppressive machinery of Brussels" in his country.

Under Orban, Hungary has remained Russia’s closest EU ally throughout the war, routinely blocking any European sanction packages against what has remained – despite pleas from Europe – its main gas supplier.

He has equally tried to stonewall any military or financial aid to Ukraine. And at the end of last year, he even went as far as to say it was “ unclear who attacked whom ”.

Although Magyar has described Moscow as “the aggressor” in the conflict, and last year told the Financial Times he would push for an immediate ceasefire along with Hungary’s EU allies if he comes to power, he has also said he would not reverse Hungary’s current policy of non-support for Kyiv nor totally sever Budapest’s ties with Russia. He staunchly opposes fast-track EU accession for Ukraine.

"On Ukraine, Tisza’s manifesto is notably thin," an analyst note from the Brussels-based think-tank European Policy Center warned, adding that "EU leaders should not assume that a Magyar government would mark a clean break with Orban-era policies."</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 19:53:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/55b26c3e-0b5e-11f1-bca3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26046546129816.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine makes fastest battlefield gain in 2.5 years</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260216-ukraine-makes-fastest-battlefield-gain-in-2-5-years</link><description>Ukraine recaptured 201 square kilometres (78 square miles) from Russia between Wednesday and Sunday last week, taking advantage of a Starlink shutdown for Russian forces , according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War (ISW).

The recaptured area is almost equivalent to the Russian gains for the entire month of December and is the most land retaken by Kyiv 's forces in such a short period since a June 2023 counter-offensive.

"These Ukrainian counterattacks are likely leveraging the recent block on Russian forces' access to Starlink, which Russian milbloggers (military bloggers) have claimed is causing communications and command and control issues on the battlefield," the ISW, which collaborates with the Critical Threats Project, another US think-tank, stated.

On February 5, military observers noted disruption of the Starlink antennas used by Moscow on the front lines, following announcements by Elon Musk of "measures" to end the Kremlin 's use of this technology.

Kyiv claimed that Russian drones were using them, in particular, to circumvent electronic jamming systems and strike their targets with precision.

Without the use of Starlink, Russian forces only advanced on February 9, with Kyiv gaining ground on the other days.

The recaptured land is concentrated mainly around 80 kilometres east of the city of Zaporizhzhia, in an area where Russian troops have made significant progress since the summer of 2025.

Moscow controlled 19.5 percent of Ukrainian territory, either fully or partially, in mid-February, compared with 18.6 percent a year earlier.

Approximately 7 percent – Crimea and part of the Donbas – was already under Russian control before the invasion launched in February 2022.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 21:29:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5afbbe0e-0b6b-11f1-b954-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-338W773.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron visits India to deepen defence ties and AI cooperation</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260216-macron-visits-india-defence-ai</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron begins a three-day visit to India on Tuesday, with talks focused on artificial intelligence cooperation and a potential multibillion-dollar Dassault Rafale fighter jet deal.

France is seeking to expand its military partnership with New Delhi, with discussions expected on a potential contract for 114 additional French fighter jets.

Macron and his wife Brigitte arrived around midnight on Monday in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, for his fourth visit to India since taking office in 2017.

He is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi later on Tuesday.

Macron will then travel to New Delhi for an artificial intelligence summit on Wednesday and Thursday.

The visit follows New Delhi’s confirmation last week that it intends to place a major order for Rafale jets, as well as the signing of a landmark free trade agreement between India and the European Union in January.

New Delhi has sought over the past decade to reduce its dependence on Russia , its traditional main supplier of military equipment, turning to other countries while also pushing for more domestic production.

An Indian defence ministry statement last week said the proposed purchase of Rafale jets had been cleared – with “the majority” of them to be manufactured in India.

The statement did not specify the exact number of jets New Delhi would purchase, but a New Delhi defence ministry source said that 114 was likely.

Christophe Jaffrelot, an India specialist at Sciences Po Center for International Studies in Paris, described the potential EUR30 billion ($35 billion) deal for 114 Rafales as the “contract of the century” and a potential “crowning achievement” for bilateral ties.

If finalised, the jets would add to the 36 Rafales India purchased for its air force in 2016 and 26 it has ordered for its navy.

Negotiations over the additional aircraft still need to be concluded with manufacturer Dassault Aviation , but the French presidency has voiced optimism that what it calls a “historic” agreement could be reached.

Modi and Macron will also inaugurate on Tuesday India’s first helicopter final assembly line via videoconference from Mumbai, a joint venture between India’s Tata Group and Airbus.

The facility in Vemagal, in the southern state of Karnataka near the tech hub of Bengaluru, will manufacture the Airbus H125, the company’s best-selling single-engine helicopter.

France has emerged as one of India’s most important defence and economic partners in the last decade.

“Through this visit, we seek to further strengthen cooperation” with India, and to “diversify” France’s economic and trade partnerships, Macron’s office said.

India, the world’s most populous country with 1.4 billion people, is on track to become the fourth-largest economy globally.

This week’s talks are also expected to address global economic uncertainty triggered by tariff policies under US President Donald Trump , as well as China ’s influence in the region.

Modi’s office said discussions would focus on “cementing the strategic partnership and further diversifying it into new and emerging areas”.

Bilateral trade between France and India, driven largely by defence and aerospace – India’s commercial fleet includes a substantial number of Airbus aircraft – stands at around EUR15 billion ($18 billion) annually.

French foreign direct investment in India totals nearly €13 billion ($15 billion).

The two leaders will also be keen to nurture close personal ties.

“There is apparently a good chemistry, a good personal rapport,” Jaffrelot said.

One sensitive issue remains Ukraine: India has not condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion and has continued buying oil from Moscow.

US President Donald Trump has said India had committed to halting the purchases, though that has not been formally confirmed by New Delhi.

“If the Indians stop buying Russian oil, they won’t be blamed for abstaining at the UN ,” Jaffrelot added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 16 Feb 2026 22:59:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d335de6-e923-11ef-adeb-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25042429818417.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump warns Iran of consequences ahead of Geneva nuclear talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260217-trump-warns-iran-of-consequences-ahead-of-geneva-nuclear-talks</link><description>President Donald Trump warned Iran of potential consequences should it fail to strike a deal with the United States , as negotiators prepare for the latest round of talks in Geneva on Tuesday.

Mediated by Oman, the recently resumed discussions are aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, with Tehran expressing cautious optimism at Washington’s “more realistic” position on its nuclear programme .

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene militarily against Iran, first over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month and more recently over its nuclear programme.

“I don’t think they want the consequences of not making a deal,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One ahead of the talks.

A previous attempt at diplomacy collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran in June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.

“A cautious assessment is that, from the discussions that have taken place in Muscat to date, at least what we have been told is that the US position on the Iranian nuclear issue has moved towards a more realistic one,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said Monday, according to the official IRNA news agency.

According to Tehran, Tuesday’s talks in Switzerland will also be mediated by Oman .

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi met with his Omani counterpart Badr Albusaidi in Geneva on Monday to discuss his country’s position “regarding nuclear issues and sanctions relief”.

He also stressed Tehran’s “seriousness in using result-oriented diplomacy to secure the legitimate interests and rights of the Iranian people” and preserve peace in the region, according to a ministry statement.

Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for other topics to be discussed, including its ballistic missiles and support for armed groups in the region.

Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps , the ideological arm of the military, began a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz to prepare for “potential security and military threats”, Iranian state TV said.

Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a strategic route for oil and liquefied natural gas , as both sides ramp up pressure with talks set to resume.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday: “We’re hopeful there’s a deal. The president always prefers peaceful outcomes and negotiated outcomes to things.”

Araghchi, meanwhile, said on X that he too had come to “Geneva with real ideas to achieve a fair and equitable deal”, but added there would be no “submission before threats”.

The foreign minister also said he was meeting in Geneva with the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, “for deep technical discussion”.

The West fears the programme is aimed at making a bomb, which Tehran denies.

Washington has dispatched Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, the White House confirmed on Sunday.

On Friday, Trump said a change of government in Iran would be the “best thing that could happen”, as he sent a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East to ratchet up military pressure.

The first carrier dispatched to the region, the USS Abraham Lincoln, was positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, new satellite images showed.

Iran’s deputy foreign minister Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBC that Tehran would consider compromises on its uranium stockpile if Washington lifted sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy.

“If we see the sincerity on their (American) part, I am sure we will be on a road to have an agreement,” he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:30:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fb9b0f04-09cc-11f1-ae7f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-14T165745Z-1226189647-RC2SLJA48AJT-RTRMADP-3-SECURITY-MUNICH-IRAN-PROTEST.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump urges Ukraine to strike Russia deal 'fast' before Geneva talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260217-trump-urges-ukraine-to-strike-russia-deal-fast-before-geneva-talks</link><description>For the talks in Geneva, the Kremlin has reinstated nationalist hawk and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as its lead negotiator.

“This time, we plan to discuss a broader set of issues, focusing on key ones related to the territories and other demands,” a spokesperson for Vladimir Putin told reporters, explaining the personnel change.

“Ukraine better come to the table, fast,” US President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One while en route to Washington.

“Even on the eve of the trilateral meetings in Geneva, the Russian army has no orders other than to continue striking Ukraine. This speaks volumes about how Russia regards the partners’ diplomatic efforts,” Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky posted on social media Monday.

“Only with sufficient pressure on Russia and clear security guarantees for Ukraine can this war realistically be brought to an end,” he added.

US President Donald Trump said Monday that “Ukraine better come to the table, fast,” when it comes to reaching a peace deal with Russia.

Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner will meet with former Russian culture minister Vladimir Medinsky and Rustem Umerov, the head of Ukraine’s National Security Council, on Tuesday in Geneva.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio affirmed that Trump was "deeply committed" to the success of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, one of Europe's biggest critics of Ukraine and a Russian ally.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 04:30:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/57df1caa-0857-11f1-8b1d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26043688432782.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘Get the files out’: Hillary Clinton slams Trump's Epstein cover-up</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260217-get-the-files-out-hillary-clinton-slams-trump-s-epstein-cover-up</link><description>Former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton has accused President Donald Trump of orchestrating a "cover-up" over files related to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , according to an interview with the BBC published Monday.

"Get the files out. They are slow-walking it," Clinton, who is due to testify before a Congressional committee on the issue, told the British broadcaster in an interview in Berlin.

The Justice Department last month released the latest cache of so-called Epstein files – more than three million documents, photos and videos related to its investigation into sex criminal Epstein, who died from what was determined to be suicide while in custody in 2019.

Clinton's husband, former president Bill Clinton , features regularly in the files, but no evidence has come to light implicating either Clinton in criminal activity.

The couple has been ordered to give closed-door depositions before the House Oversight Committee, which is probing the deceased financier's connections to powerful figures and how information about his crimes was handled.

"We will show up but we think it would be better to have it in public," Hillary Clinton told the BBC.

"I just want it to be fair," she said. "I want everybody treated the same way."

The former secretary of state said she and her husband "have nothing to hide. We have called for the full release of these files repeatedly."

The Department of Justice has said it has no more files to release, though lawmakers have criticised it for not publishing internal government memos, notes and emails on Epstein.

Clinton said the Republicans probing her are trying to deflect attention away from Trump, whose name is also mentioned in the files many times.

"Look at this shiny object. We're going to have the Clintons, even Hillary Clinton, who never met the guy," she said.

Trump denies any wrongdoing. Mere mention in the files is not proof of having committed a crime.

Former president Clinton has acknowledged flying on Epstein's plane in the early 2000s for Clinton Foundation-related humanitarian work, but said he never visited Epstein's private island.

Hillary Clinton, who ran against Trump for president in 2016, has said she had no meaningful interactions with Epstein, never flew on his plane and never visited his island.

In the interview with the BBC, she said she had met Ghislaine Maxwell , an Epstein associate who was convicted of conspiring with him to sexually abuse minors, "on a few occasions".

Responding to Clinton's comment that the congressional testimony was a bid to create a distraction, Trump denied it, telling reporters Monday evening he had been "totally exonerated".

Hillary Clinton will appear for her deposition on February 26, while Bill Clinton will appear on February 27.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 08:49:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e059a9d2-0bd7-11f1-9d27-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26047440059853.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US civil rights activist and African American icon Jesse Jackson dies aged 84</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260217-us-civil-rights-activist-and-african-american-figure-jesse-jackson-dies-aged-84</link><description>Jesse Jackson, who died Tuesday aged 84, had a three-pronged career of civil rights , liberal missions and political activism, and his two White House bids in the 1980s helped lay the groundwork for the election of America's first Black president two decades later.

Jackson's family announced his death, hailing "his unwavering belief in justice, equality, and love uplifted millions".

As a close associate of Martin Luther King Jr in the 1960s, a dynamic Black orator and a successful mediator in international disputes, the longtime Baptist minister expanded the space for African Americans on the national stage for more than six decades.

Jackson was present for many consequential moments in the long battle for racial justice in the United States.

He was with King in Memphis in 1968 when the civil rights leader was slain; openly wept in the crowd as Barack Obama celebrated his 2008 presidential election; and stood with George Floyd 's family in 2021 after a court convicted an ex-police officer of the unarmed Black man's murder.

"My constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised," Jackson told the 1984 Democratic National Convention.

He rose to prominence in the 1960s as a leader in King's Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

He launched two social justice and activism organisations: Operation PUSH in 1971, and the National Rainbow Coalition a dozen years later. The two groups merged in 1996.

It was Jackson's presidential runs – and one 1988 speech – that caught many Americans' attention and ensured that African American issues became fundamental to the Democratic Party platform.

His debut White House campaign supported a massive jobs expansion, ending the nation's "war on drugs" and its mandatory minimum sentences for drug users, and improving equality for women and minorities.

Jackson finished third in the 1984 Democratic primaries – behind former vice president Walter Mondale and runner-up Gary Hart – making him the most successful Black presidential candidate until Obama.

Mondale was trounced by Ronald Reagan in that year's general election.

Four years later, Jackson was back on the convention stage after coming in second to nominee Michael Dukakis, urging Americans to find "common ground".

"That's the challenge of our party tonight. Left wing, right wing ... It takes two wings to fly," he said, in a cadence reminiscent of King's.

Jackson attacked what he called the "reverse Robin Hood" of a Reagan presidency that bestowed riches on the wealthy while leaving poor Americans struggling.

"It gets dark sometimes, but the morning comes. Don't you surrender," he said as the crowd roared.

While his electric speech raised Jackson's profile, the nation's gradual tilt to the right deprived him of major political influence in later years.

And though his accomplishments were pioneering, his work was also tarnished by controversy.

In 1984, he described New York as "Hymietown", using a pejorative term for Jews.

One of Jackson's sons, former US congressman Jesse Jackson Jr, served prison time after pleading guilty in 2013 to taking some $750,000 in campaign money for his personal use.

Jackson's personal story began with hardship.

He was born Jesse Louis Burns on October 8, 1941, in Greenville, South Carolina, to an unwed teen mother and a former professional boxer.

He later adopted the last name of his stepfather Charles Jackson.

"I was not born with a silver spoon in my mouth. I had a shovel programmed for my hands," he once said.

He excelled in his segregated high school and earned a football scholarship to the University of Illinois, but later transferred to the predominantly Black Agricultural and Technical College of North Carolina, where he received a degree in sociology.

In 1960, he participated in his first sit-in, in Greenville, and then joined the Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches in 1965, where he caught King's attention.

Jackson later emerged as a mediator and envoy on several notable international fronts.

He became a prominent advocate for ending apartheid in South Africa, and in the 1990s served as presidential special envoy for Africa for Bill Clinton.

Missions to free US prisoners took him to Syria, Iraq and Serbia.

But he ruffled some feathers in 2005 when he met in Venezuela with Hugo Chavez, and then spoke at the strongman's funeral in 2013.

Jackson announced in 2017 that he was battling Parkinson's disease, and he began curtailing his public engagements.

But he stood with George Floyd's family at their April 2021 press conference when a Minneapolis jury convicted Floyd's killer.

The verdict brought "relief, but not a time for celebration", Jackson told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

“[We] are confident that Alexei Navalny was poisoned with a lethal toxin,” they said in a statement issued on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference in Germany.

“Russia claimed that Navalny died of natural causes. But given the toxicity of epibatidine and reported symptoms, poisoning was highly likely the cause," they said.

Navalny was one of Russian President Vladimir Putin ’s staunchest critics and was serving a 19-year sentence in an Arctic prison colony when he died. “Meaning Russia had the means, motive and opportunity ‌to administer this poison to him,” they added.

Russia flatly rejected the allegations.

"Naturally, we do not accept such accusations. We disagree with them. We consider them biased and not based on anything. And we strongly reject them," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

The five countries said their finding was “conclusive”, and came after having carried out extensive “analyses of samples” from his body.

Russia has been accused of using poison when targeting its enemies before.

The nerve agent novichok was used in the attempted assassination of Navalny in 2020 , and former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury 2018. A woman in Salisbury died after accidentally coming into contact with a perfume bottle that had been contaminated with the nerve agent.

Russia has also been accused of the fatal poisoning of Russian defector and former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006. Litvinenko died after having used a tea set contaminated with the radioactive chemical element polonium-210.

The independent Russian media outlet Meduza said Navalny’s symptoms matched with “what is known about epibatidine’s effects”.

Toxicology expert Jill Johnson told BBC Russian that epibatidine is "200 times more potent than morphine". Among the symptoms, she said, are "muscle twitching and paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure and finally death".

But why go through the trouble of using such a rare type of poison which is naturally found only in dart frogs native to South America?

“With Navalny in Russian custody, there was no need to use such an exotic poison,” Luca Trenta, an associate professor in International Relations at Swansea University. “They could have used anything."

One of the reasons, experts say, might have been its effectiveness.

Alistair Hay, a toxicologist at the University of Leeds, said that when it comes to nerve agents like novichok , death can be prevented if the person gets proper medical care quickly enough. “I don't know how you treat a patient with epibatidine. I haven’t seen anything out there.”

To date, there is only one documented case of a person having survived epibatidine poisoning: a lab worker who was allegedly exposed to it in 2010. Hay said that the person’s own account of his survival – apparently thanks to the use of antihistamines – raises “quite a lot of questions”, however.

Hay explained that epibatidine is also very difficult to detect because only very small doses are needed to make it lethal – “so it's harder to find traces" of it.

When analysts do not know the specific substance they are looking for, detection becomes even harder. And since epibatidine has not been associated with any other known poisoning cases previously, it would not be the first toxin that analysts test for.

It is also a poison that is fairly easy to administer.”The known routes are ingestion and through the skin,” Hay said. “It would be equally effective, I'm sure, by inhalation as well."

Kevin Riehle, an expert in intelligence and security studies at Brunel University London, said that all of the above-mentioned reasons still do not explain why Russia would use such a rare and exotic poison on someone who was already behind bars and in very poor health.

“The only thing that could possibly be the reason, and this is rather quite villainous, is that they were testing it," he said. "They were trying to see how this thing was going to work on somebody, and he was going to die anyway.”

Hay said the toxin has been known to scientists for decades, and they been able to reproduce it in their laboratories. It was initially researched for its painkilling capabilities because it can block nerve transmission, but those ideas were ultimately abandoned because the risks of getting the dose wrong were too high.

"Developing this kind of weapon is not difficult," Trenta said.

Mark Galeotti, a Russia security expert and director of the London-based think tank Mayak Intelligence, said that for Russia, the alleged poisoning would also have been a way of reminding the world that "they have had a laboratory working on poisons for decades”, and that it is capable of producing “new and more interesting and more complex toxins and venoms".

Galeotti said the Russians may have had dual motives in opting for such an unusual poison as epibatidine. “On the one hand they're happy for people to think that Navalny was poisoned because that sends out a warning,” showing not only what the Kremlin is capable of, but the lengths to which it is swilling to go.

“But on the other hand, by using something more exotic, maybe they hoped the details would never actually come to light.”

In addition, Trenta said the poison would likely have been used to kill two birds with one stone: to avenge an enemy while setting a memorable example. “These types of weapons in particular have to do with a certain element of theatre. So they want to appear grandiose, and [contain] a certain element of signalling. There is a communicative element here."

The activities ushered in the Year of the Horse, one of 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac, succeeding the Year of the Snake.

Thousands of people in Beijing jammed into the former Temple of Earth to buy snacks, toys and trinkets from stalls. Sun Jing, who brought her parents to the capital for the holiday, said the atmosphere was as lively as in her childhood.

"I haven’t felt such a strong sense of Lunar New Year festivity in a very, very long time,” she said.

Crowds descended on popular temples to burn incense and pray for happiness and success in the coming year. The Lunar New Year is the most important annual holiday in China and some other East Asian nations and is celebrated outside the region, too.

As every year, China celebrated the Lunar New Year with a TV show and once again the humanoid robots were a central part of the performance Monday night.

One of the highlights of the CCTV Spring Festival gala was a martial arts performance by children and robots. For several minutes, humanoids from Unitree Robotics showed different sequences and even brandished swords.

The performance showed China’s push to develop more advanced robots powered by improved AI capabilities.

Viewers applauded the robots, with one saying they give good guidance and direction for young people. One man, though, said that while China's advances in robotics are great, they detracted from his experience.

“It lacks a bit of the New Year atmosphere,” Li Bo said. "It’s not as enjoyable as when I was little watching the gala.”

Incense smoke wafted into the air at a temple in Hong Kong where people line up every year to make wishes for the new year at midnight.

Holding up a cluster of incense sticks, many bowed their heads several times before planting the sticks in containers placed in front of a temple hall.

Entertainers in Vietnam sang at an outdoor countdown event before multiple fireworks shows at several cities in the Southeast Asian nation, where the festival is called Tet.

Light shows lit up bridges and skyscrapers as the fireworks went off and crowds clapped in rhythm to live pop music performances.

People sampled Chinese cuisine from stalls and strolled along snowy streets decorated with red lanterns and dragons as two weeks of events got underway Monday at various venues in the Russian capital.

The third annual Lunar New Year celebration comes at time of warming relations between China and Russia – ties that have frustrated many European governments because of the war in Ukraine.

The solemn peal of a temple bell rang out 108 times – an auspicious number – as people flocked to the Baoan Temple in Taipei on Tuesday morning.

They lit incense sticks, bowed their heads and left offerings of colorful flower bouquets on outdoor tables on the temple grounds in Taiwan 's capital city.

Thousands of Argentines gathered in Buenos Aires’s Chinatown to celebrate the Lunar New Year and enjoyed dragon and lion dances on the main stage, alongside martial arts demonstrations.

The Chinese immigrant community is among Argentina's most dynamic, accounting for more than 180,000 people in the South American country.

Sebastien G., 50, went on trial after two colleagues in 2023 discovered a hard drive in the common area for the right-wing Les Republicans party containing more than 1,800 images, mostly sexual in nature, according to the judge during the trial last month.

The images included the buttocks and cleavage of clothed women, taken in public places such as the street or Senate, as well as images of an ex-girlfriend photographed naked at the defendant's home.

He was reported to Senate authorities the following year and fired after more than two decades in his post.

"I never wanted to hurt anyone," he said in court in January, claiming he had never shared the images. He said he had felt the "need to collect the beauty of women".

The man has been banned from the Senate, and ordered to receive psychological and psychiatric help.

Quentin Deranque, 23, died after sustaining a severe brain injury when he was attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest against a left-wing politician speaking at a university in Lyon.

A source following the case said an assistant of a member of parliament from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party was among those detained.

The incident on Thursday last week has fueled tension between the far right and hard left ahead of municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet of winning.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 19:49:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4b3d74b8-0c2d-11f1-bcf1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-97VL4NQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is Vladimir Medinsky, the nationalist historian leading Russia’s peace talks delegation?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260217-who-is-vladimir-medinsky-the-nationalist-historian-leading-russia-s-peace-talks-delegation</link><description>Vladimir Medinsky made his own soldiers when he was a boy. Growing up in the 1970s in the city of Smila, a railway junction in Ukraine’s Cherkasy oblast on the uplands of the Dnieper River, Medinsky would cut toy soldiers out of paper, paint on their uniforms with fastidious hands and fix them to thick cardboard backing.

“We drew a big map showing mountains, rivers, valleys, and cities and organised ‘toy battles’ on it,” Medinsky – then serving as President Vladimir Putin ’s minister of culture – told Russian news agency TASS in 2016. “We fought a state against a state, an army against an army.”

Medinsky is no longer playing. After being absent from the past two rounds of negotiations in Abu Dhabi , the 55-year-old presidential aide is back at the head of Moscow’s delegation to the US-brokered talks in Geneva on ending the war in Ukraine on Tuesday and Wednesday.

It is a role he first held in the days and weeks following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, when delegations from Kyiv and Moscow met first in Belarus and then on the banks of the Bosporus in Istanbul to hammer out a ceasefire and eventual peace . Nearly four years of war has followed the talks’ ultimate failure.

Medinsky’s presence in Geneva has raised hackles in some quarters. Negotiators from the Ukrainian side have accused Medinsky in the past of using the talks to launch into long lectures unspooling his Russian nationalist reading of his country's historic relationship with Ukraine.

After peace talks first resumed in Istanbul last May, Medinsky was quick to cast his mind back to another war of attrition waged in the far reaches of the world.

“We don’t want war, but we are ready to fight for a year, two, three – however long it takes,” he reportedly said during the talks . “We fought Sweden for 21 years. How long are you ready to fight?”

“My understanding is that whenever he is heading the delegation, it’s a sign that Russia wants to present the more political-ideological line and talk about global positioning of power, and how we can make sure that Russia is respected on the international arena and the civilisational choices and political and ideological values that Russia stands for are accepted and respected,” said Maria Falina, an assistant professor at Utrecht University’s department of history and art history specialising in modern and contemporary Eastern Europe.

“And when the delegation is headed by somebody from the military or secret services, then it is a more technical discussion about territory, land, peace guarantees, security, et cetera. So I think it really is about the what kind of message the Kremlin wants to send, and what they expect from each new round of the talks – and a lot has to do with what's happening on the front line.”

Born to a retired colonel who served in both the Warsaw Pact’s invasion of Czechoslovakia and the doomed Soviet occupation of Afghanistan , Medinsky’s own application to a Moscow military academy was turned down due to his poor eyesight.

Turning instead towards journalism, which he studied at the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations, Medinsky maintained a keen interest in Russian history – and military history in particular.

A model student and member of the Communist Party’s Komsomol youth organisation, he nonetheless joined the ranks of the demonstrators who flocked to defend Moscow’s White House in August 1991, where Russian Federation president Boris Yeltsin was sheltering from an abortive putsch launched by hardliners in the military. A few months later, the Soviet Union collapsed.

Medinsky graduated the following year. Along with a few friends from university, he launched a PR firm that soon found a strong client base in financial institutions and the tobacco lobby.

Although he launched his own political career following Putin’s rise to power in 1999, Medinsky became better-known for a three-volume series, “Myths About Russia”. These widely read books aimed to debunk what Medinsky said were negative stereotypes about Russia, its people and its history – many of which he said had been spread over the centuries by foreign powers eternally hostile to the Russian nation.

He continued his studies, earning a doctorate in medieval history based on a thesis accusing Western historians of systemic bias towards Russia. A group of academics have accused Medinsky of plagiarising his thesis .

“For Medinsky and for others promoting – we can call it Putin's vision of politics in Russia, but it's not just his, it's a collective enterprise – Russia is existing in very strong opposition to the collective West,” Falina said. “And this collective West is the embodiment of post-Second World War liberal democratic values. Russia presents an alternative, and it is a civilisational and ideological alternative to this ... liberal world order and liberal political values. And Medinsky is a spokesperson for this ideological package.”

Medinsky’s shock appointment to minister of culture in 2012 made it clear that his crusade had found high favour. Once named to Putin’s cabinet, Falina said, the new minister wasted little time in mobilising the full power of the Russian state behind his revisionist project.

“As minister for culture, Medinsky was promoting cultural productions in film, in theatre, exhibitions, anything – you name it –  that supported his understanding of Russian patriotism,” she said. “Of supporting the idea of the great Russian state, be it in the Middle Ages, Early Modern period, Imperial Russia, Soviet Union – it doesn't really matter, as long as it is a strong Russian state which is both strong and somehow culturally, nationally Russian.”

Underlying these efforts, Falina said, was a growing will in the Kremlin to rework Russia’s tangled history of revolution, reaction and war into a simpler story that would place the country at the heart of world affairs.

“They're trying to use history to create social cohesion,” she said. “And of course, they're not the only ones who are doing this – history has been used like this by many countries – but the key difference is that in some societies, history is being used for peace and reconciliation processes ... where you foster a historical dialogue, and then you overcome a divisive past and create social coherence. But what they're trying to do is impose a single narrative of the past, and through that, brush over any potentially divisive elements.”

Throughout his term as culture minister, Medinsky continued to serve as the head of the state-backed Russian Military Historical Society, organising summer camps for Russian teens instructing them in the glory of the country’s past military triumphs.

When the Russian State Archive released a declassified military investigation calling into question the existence of the much-mythologised “Panfilov's Twenty-Eight Guardsmen” – a group of soldiers who in 1941 reportedly laid down their lives to bring an entire German tank division to a halt at the height of what Russia calls the “Great Patriotic War” – Medinsky campaigned for the archive head’s resignation. He soon got it. Even if the story wasn't true, he said, the myth was “a sacred legend that no one should touch”. A feature-length blockbuster would soon follow.

Nowhere is Medinsky’s role in these increasingly bitter history wars clearer than when Moscow in 2023 rolled out a new history textbook to every high schooler in the country – as well as parts of Ukraine under Russian military occupation .

Partly written by Medinsky, the book has been criticised for a deeply revisionist account of Russia’s trials, triumphs and tribulations across the 20th century, praising Joseph Stalin’s leadership and portraying the war against Ukraine as a continuation of Moscow’s fight against Nazi Germany and its collaborators.

“There were multiple attempts to create a single history textbook that all schools in all the country would use,” Falina said. “It was highly criticised. They abandoned the attempt and restarted it several times – which happens in large bureaucracies – and with every new iteration it became more and more patriotic, more and more conservative, less and less critical of any excesses of [the] Russian or Soviet or pre-Imperial past. And Medinsky there played a critical role.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 21:36:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bd596296-0c1e-11f1-9964-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25308568243308.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>First day of Ukraine-Russia peace talks in Geneva ends with no breakthroughs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260217-first-day-of-ukraine-russia-peace-talks-in-geneva-ends-with-no-breakthroughs</link><description>Ukrainian and Russian negotiators concluded the first of two days of US-mediated peace talks in Geneva on Tuesday, though neither side signalled they were any closer to ending Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II .

Negotiations will resume on Wednesday.

The United States has been pushing for an end to the nearly four-year war, but has failed to broker a compromise between Moscow and Kyiv on the key issue of territory.

Two previous rounds of negotiation between the two sides in Abu Dhabi failed to yield a breakthrough.

The latest talks "were very tense", said a source close to the Russian delegation.

"They lasted six hours. They have now concluded," the source added, speaking on condition of anonymity.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address he was ready "to move quickly towards a worthy agreement to end the war", but questioned whether Russia was serious about peace.

"What do they want?" he added, accusing them of prioritising missile strikes over "real diplomacy".

Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

The ensuing conflict has resulted in a tidal wave of destruction that has left entire cities in ruins, tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians dead and forced millions of people to flee their homes.

Zelensky has repeatedly said his country is being asked to make disproportionate compromises compared to Russia.

US President Donald Trump on Monday put pressure on Ukraine to make a deal, saying they "better come to the table, fast".

Russia occupies around one-fifth of Ukraine – including the Crimean peninsula it seized in 2014 – and areas that Moscow-backed separatists had taken prior to the 2022 invasion.

It is pushing for full control of Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region as part of any deal, and has threatened to take it by force if talks fail.

But Kyiv has rejected this deeply unpopular demand, which would be politically and militarily fraught, and signalled it will not sign a deal without security guarantees that deter Russia from invading again.

Russia has been slowly capturing territory across the sprawling front line for months.

But its war-time economic worries are mounting, with growth stagnating and a ballooning budget deficit as oil revenues – choked by sanctions – drop to a five-year low.

Ukrainian forces recently made their fastest gains in two-and-a-half years , recapturing 201 square kilometres (78 square miles) last week, according to an AFP analysis of data from the Institute for the Study of War.

That total includes areas Kyiv and military analysts say are controlled by Russia (72 square kilometres), as well as those claimed by Moscow's army (129 square kilometres).

The counterattacks likely leveraged the disruption of Russian forces' access to Starlink, the ISW said, after the satellite internet firm's boss, Elon Musk , announced "measures" to end Russia's use of the technology.

For the talks in Geneva, the Kremlin reinstated nationalist hawk and former culture minister Vladimir Medinsky as its lead negotiator.

Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov was leading Kyiv's side.

Hopes for a breakthrough are low.

Even before the talks were underway, Ukraine accused Russia of undermining peace efforts by launching 29 missiles and 396 drones in a series of attacks overnight that authorities said killed at least four people, wounded others and cut power to tens of thousands in southern Ukraine.

"The extent to which Russia disregards peace efforts: a massive missile and drone strike against Ukraine right before the next round of talks in Geneva," Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga wrote on social media.

A Russian drone strike killed three staff of a power plant in the frontline town of Sloviansk in eastern Ukraine, according to energy minister Denys Shmygal.

Another person was killed in the northeastern Sumy region, local officials said.

Russia meanwhile accused Ukraine of launching more than 150 drones overnight, mainly over southern regions and the Crimean peninsula – occupied by the Kremlin in 2014.

An oil depot in southern Russia caught fire, according to officials.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists to expect no major news from the first day of talks.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 22:31:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82d681de-0c47-11f1-a33d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-17T132533Z-625600867-RC2ONJAEWWLS-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-TALKS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dozens of filmmakers slam Berlin Film Festival's ‘silence’ on Gaza in open letter</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260217-filmmakers-condemn-berlin-film-festival-silence-gaza</link><description>More than 80 film industry figures including Oscar-winning actors Javier Bardem and Tilda Swinton issued a statement on Tuesday slamming the Berlin Film Festival' s "silence" on Gaza.

The signatories to the open letter, sent to AFP, said they were "appalled" by the festival's "institutional silence" and "dismayed" at its "involvement in censoring artists who oppose Israel's ongoing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza".

Their statement came after the Berlinale's jury president, German director Wim Wenders, answered a question on Gaza last week by saying: "We cannot really enter the field of politics."

Prominent directors who signed Tuesday's letter, coordinated by the Film Workers for Palestine collective, include British filmmaker Mike Leigh and the American Adam McKay.

The signatories include many artists who have presented work at the Berlin Film Festival. Swinton was herself last year awarded its prestigious Honorary Golden Bear award.

They said they "fervently disagree" with Wenders's comments, arguing that filmmaking and politics cannot be separated.

"Just as the festival has made clear statements in the past about atrocities carried out against people in Iran and Ukraine, we call on the Berlinale to fulfil its moral duty and clearly state its opposition to Israel's genocide ," the letter adds.

The signatories took exception not only to the Berlinale's stance on Gaza, but also "the German state's key role in enabling" Israel's actions.

The festival has been hit by controversy over Gaza several times in recent years.

When asked about Germany's support for Israel at a press conference on Thursday, Wenders said filmmakers had "to stay out of politics".

"We have to do the work of people, not the work of politicians," he said.

Fellow jury member Ewa Puszczynska said it was a "little bit unfair" to expect the jury to take a direct stance on the issue.

Their comments had already sparked a backlash. Award-winning Indian novelist Arundhati Roy cancelled a planned appearance at the festival, saying she was "shocked and disgusted" at the jury members' comments.

On Saturday, the Berlinale put out a statement defending Wenders from the "media storm", indicating that his remarks had been taken out of context.

Festival director Tricia Tuttle said that artists "are free to exercise their right of free speech in whatever way they choose" and should not "be expected to speak on every political issue raised to them unless they want to".

In 2024, the festival's documentary award went to "No Other Land", which follows the dispossession of Palestinian communities in the Israeli- occupied West Bank .

German government officials criticised "one-sided" remarks about Gaza by the directors of that film and others at that year's awards ceremony.

The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people, according to an AFP tally based on official Israeli figures.

Israel's retaliation has left at least 71,000 people dead in Gaza, according to the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory, whose figures the United Nations considers reliable.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 23:29:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/399a0c14-0631-11f1-a348-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/74d786f5f9d426b3da8b0142eb45ad7a0f581de8.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin, women, favours: DOJ files reveal Jeffrey Epstein’s efforts to build Russian ties</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260217-putin-women-doj-files-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-build-russian-ties</link><description>Convicted US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein sought to build ties with Russia's political elite and appeared desperate to secure a meeting with President Vladimir Putin , files released by the US Department of Justice show.

The documents also reveal more details on the extent to which Epstein, who was facing charges of alleged sex trafficking when he killed himself in a New York jail, travelled to Russia, and had a network of scouts searching for young Russian women.

The mere mention of someone's name in the Epstein files does not in itself imply any wrongdoing by that person.

Here's what we know about Epstein's links to Russia from the files:

"Lets try to set a putin meeting," Epstein wrote in a January 2014 email to Thorbjorn Jagland, former Norwegian prime minister and then secretary general of the Council of Europe.

He repeated the request to Jagland in 2015 and 2018.

In a 2013 email to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, Epsteinsaid: "Putin asked that i meet him in st petersburg the same time as his economic conference I told him no."

The files suggest Epstein wanted to pitch a digital currency project to Putin.

AFP found no evidence in the files that the meeting ever took place.

Following the release of documents, Poland said it would probe Epstein's alleged links to Russian secret services.

Asked whether Epstein was a Russian agent, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "I'm tempted to make a lot of jokes about that version, but let's not waste our time."

The documents indicate Epstein may have travelled to Russia several times.

A Russian business visa was issued to the disgraced financier in June 2018, when Moscow was hosting the football World Cup. Travel itineraries show he had plans to watch Morocco-Iran in Saint Petersburg and Uruguay-France in Nizhny Novgorod.

The DOJ release also includes a 2011 Russian visa application.

The files also show older photos of Epstein posing in front of the luxury Hyatt hotel in central Moscow, and an undated image of his jailed associate Ghislaine Maxwell appearing to stand between two Russian soldiers.

Flight data shows numerous trips booked for Epstein and Russian women on his behalf. Many of the women were proposed to Epsteinby scouts and modelling agencies inside Russia, who often emphasised the women were young and blonde.

"She has a perfect body and 100% blond," one woman with a Russian name wrote to Epstein in February 2010.

Months earlier the same person had promised in a separate email to "find a 'flower'" during a trip to Russia, which appeared to be financed by Epstein.

Various emails show Epstein and his network exploited the desire of some young women to leave Russia and their precarious immigration status when they were in the United States.

One of the most prominent Russians in the files is Sergei Belyakov -- a former deputy economy minister, graduate of the FSB security service's academy and who was on the organising committee of Russia's flagship economic forum in Saint Petersburg.

Emails show Belyakov repeatedly asking Epstein for help attracting high-profile US guests to the forum, years after Epstein's 2008 conviction for procuring sex from a minor.

"i will be all the help i can. who is your dream att=ndees? peter thiel? nathan myrhvold. ? reid hoffman.?" Epstein wrote to Belyakov.

Epstein also asked Belyakov to gather information on a woman, who he said was "attempting to blackmail a group of powerful businessman in New York".

"Tomorrow I'm meeting with a guy who knows her/about her. if you have any details about case you have mentioned it could help," Belyakov said in reply.

"I do not know many people like you, who can open new horizons and prospects," the Russian wrote to Epstein in May 2014 after an apparent meeting.

Another influential figure in the files is veteran Russian diplomat Vitali Churkin, Moscow 's ambassador to the UN from 2006 until his death in 2017.

The documents suggest Epstein and Churkin met several times in 2016-2017. In August 2016, Epstein invited Churkin to a lunch with former Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and businessman Tom Barrack, now the US ambassador to Turkey.

The files also indicate Epstein helped arrange an internship for Churkin's son, Maxim, at a New York investment fund in late 2016.

"Max is doing better. He just needed to understand American biz habits," Epstein wrote in a message to the Russian diplomat, who replied: "U r a great teacher!"

Epstein was also angling for an introduction to Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.

"you might suggest to putin, that lavrov , can get insight on talking to me. vitaly churkin used to . but he died," Epstein wrote to Jagland in 2018.

Sergei Belyakov and Maxim Churkin did not respond to AFP's requests for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 17 Feb 2026 23:55:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/83eecc5c-0c2e-11f1-b1a4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26002778729381-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Peru Congress ousts interim President amid corruption probe weeks before elections</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260218-peru-congress-ousts-interim-president-corruption-probe-elections</link><description>Peru ’s Congress on Tuesday voted to remove interim President José Jerí from office as he faces corruption allegations, triggering a fresh wave of political instability just weeks before the nation’s April presidential and congressional elections.

Jerí is under a preliminary investigation into corruption and influence peddling, stemming from a series of undisclosed meetings with two Chinese executives.

With 75 votes in favor, 24 against and 3 abstentions, Peru’s legislature voted to remove Jerí from the position he had assumed on Oct. 10 when predecessor Dina Boluarte was dismissed as a crime wave gripped the country.

Jerí’s removal from office is the latest chapter in a prolonged political crisis in a country that has seen seven presidents since 2016, and is about to hold a general election amid widespread public outcry over the surge in violent crime.

Lawmakers will choose a new president from among their members to govern until July 28, when the interim leader will hand over the office to the winner of the April 12 presidential election. Jerí will return to his position as a legislator until July 28, when the new Congress also takes office.

A vote on the interim leader will take place on Wednesday, after lawmakers register their candidates.

The accusations against Jerí stemmed from a leaked report regarding a clandestine December meeting with two Chinese executives. One attendee holds active government contracts, while the other is currently under investigation for alleged involvement in an illegal logging operation.

Jerí has denied wrongdoing. He said he met the executives to organize a Peruvian-Chinese festivity, but his opponents have accused him of corruption.

Despite a revolving door of presidents, Peru’s economy has remained stable. The Andean nation had a public debt to gross domestic product ratio of 32% in 2024, one of the lowest in Latin America, and the government has welcomed foreign investment in areas like mining and infrastructure.

As Peru heads into this year’s general election, Rafael Lopez Aliaga, a conservative businessman and former mayor of Lima is leading a crowded field that also includes Keiko Fujimori, a well known former legislator whose father was Peru’s president in the 1990s. If none of the candidates gets 50% of the vote there will be a runoff in June between the top two contenders.

Lawmakers in Peru have gained increasing leverage over the nation's executive branch over the past decade, using corruption investigations to remove presidents who have struggled to build congressional majorities.

A clause in Peru's constitution that allows presidents to be removed if they are found “morally incapable” of leading the country has been broadly interpreted by legislators and has been used several times to vote presidents out of office.

Boluarte, Jerí's predecessor, lasted almost three years in office and survived violent protests in which police killed dozens of protesters. But she eventually was removed on moral incapacity grounds, with lawmakers citing the high crime rate and corruption scandals.

Pedro Castillo, a leftist union leaders who won the 2021 presidential election, was voted out of office by legislators in late 2022 after he tried to dissolve congress in order to skirt anti-corruption proceedings. Last year Castillo was sentenced to 11 years in prison for trying to overthrow the nation's institutions.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 02:13:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7d0e3d38-0c05-11f1-ad98-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/f558c1232a425add90f3292c388f59dfe390c262.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>LIVE: Ukraine war talks to resume in Geneva with no sign of breakthrough</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260218-live-ukraine-war-talks-to-resume-in-geneva-with-no-sign-of-breakthrough</link><description>US envoy Steve Witkoff said Wednesday that talks between Ukraine and Russia had "brought about meaningful progress" in the Washington-led drive to end the war in Ukraine, as both sides were set to begin a second day of negotiations in Geneva.

"President Trump's success in bringing both sides of this war together has brought about meaningful progress, and we are proud to work under his leadership to stop the killing in this terrible conflict. Both parties agreed to update their respective leaders and continue working towards a deal," he wrote on X.

Ukrainian and Russian negotiators were to resume a second round of US-mediated peace talks in Geneva on Wednesday, though neither side signalled they were any closer to ending Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II.

The latest talks "were very tense", a source close to the Russian delegation told AFP.

"They lasted six hours. They have now concluded," the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his evening address he was ready "to move quickly towards a worthy agreement to end the war", but questioned whether Russia was serious about peace.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 04:32:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4fe6418a-0c04-11f1-968a-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-17T130245Z-1495451879-RC2ONJAHGV4O-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-TALKS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 80 states at UN condemn Israel’s plans to expand in occupied West Bank</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260218-80-states-un-condemn-israel-expand-occupied-west-bank</link><description>The UN missions for 85 member states issued a joint statement Tuesday condemning Israel's encroaching control of the West Bank , which critics say amounts to de facto annexation of the Palestinian territory.

"We strongly condemn unilateral Israeli decisions and measures aimed at expanding Israel's unlawful presence in the West Bank," the statement reads. "Such decisions are contrary to Israel's obligations under international law and must be immediately reversed."

"We underline in this regard our strong opposition to any form of annexation."

Last week, Israel 's security cabinet approved a series of measures backed by far-right ministers to tighten control over areas of the West Bank administered by the Palestinian Authority under the Oslo accords, in place since the 1990s.

On Sunday, Israel's government also approved a process to register land in the West Bank as "state property" in a move that drew further international condemnation.

"We reiterate our rejection of all measures aimed at altering the demographic composition, character and status of the Palestinian Territory occupied since 1967, including East Jerusalem," the statement continued.

"Such measures violate international law, undermine the ongoing efforts for peace and stability in the region, run counter to the Comprehensive Plan, and jeopardise the prospect of reaching a peace agreement ending the conflict."

The statement was issued behalf of 85 member nations, including Saudia Arabia, China and Russia, as well as the international organisations of the European Union , League of Arab States and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Monday called on Israel to reverse its land registration policy, calling it "destabilising" and "unlawful."

Excluding Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem, more than 500,000 Israelis live in West Bank settlements and outposts, which are illegal under international law.

Around three million Palestinians live in the territory, which Israel has occupied since 1967.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 04:32:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/325474be-0c6f-11f1-9ee8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26048494878365.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron adviser to head Arab World Institute in Paris after ex-minister quits over Epstein links</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260218-macron-adviser-legendre-head-arab-world-institute-paris-after-lang-quits-over-epstein-links</link><description>An adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron was named on Tuesday as head of the Arab World Institute in Paris, after its previous boss stepped down over his links to Jeffrey Epstein .

Anne-Claire Legendre, 46, will replace veteran ex-culture minister Jack Lang who resigned earlier this month over his and his family's exchanges with child sex offender Epstein.

Her appointment comes a day after French police raided the Paris cultural centre as part of investigations into Lang's alleged financial ties to Epstein.

Lang, 86, is the most high-profile public figure in France caught up in the latest bundle of Epstein's private messages released by the US Justice Department.

He has denied wrongdoing and mentions in the files do not imply wrongdoing.

An investigation by the Mediapart website concluded Lang solicited money from Epstein, while his film producer daughter co-owned a company with him in a tax haven and appeared in Epstein's will.

They are now the targets of a criminal investigation into potential money laundering and tax evasion.

Legendre has served as Macron's diplomatic adviser for North Africa and the Middle East since 2023.

Quentin Deranque, 23, died after sustaining a severe brain injury when he was attacked by at least six people last week on the sidelines of a far-right protest against a left-wing politician speaking at a university in the southeastern city of Lyon .

The incident has fuelled tension between France's far right and hard left ahead of municipal elections in March and the 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet of winning the top job.

The latest man detained, suspected of having a direct link to the violence, and his partner, suspected of having helped him evade justice, were taken into custody as part of the investigation for "intentional homicide", said Thierry Dran, the prosecutor for the southeastern city of Lyon.

Six of the other detainees are suspected of having participated in the beating and three of aiding them, a source following the case said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

An assistant to Raphaël Arnault, a member of parliament from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, was among the first four detained, the source said.

Arnault said he was firing the assistant.

An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis, which claims to fight violence against Western women, said Deranque had been at the protest in Lyon to protect its members.

Nemesis has blamed the killing on La Jeune Garde (Young Guard), an anti-fascist youth group co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.

La Jeune Garde – which was dissolved in June – has denied any links to the "tragic events", while Arnault has called the killing horrific.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 10:44:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0fcf6fd8-0cb1-11f1-ad0f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-97QD7FH.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'I wanted my story to help others': Gisèle Pelicot memoir launches in 22 languages</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260218-hymn-life-gisele-pelicot-memoir-launches-22-languages-mass-rape-trial</link><description>Gisèle Pelicot ’s memoir was released on Tuesday in 22 languages worldwide, sharing details of the horror she went through and sending a powerful message of hope and support to victims of sexual abuse.

“I wanted my story to help others,” Pelicot told French national channel France 5 last week ahead of the release of her book, “A Hymn to Life, Shame has to Change Sides.”

Pelicot recounted her story of survival in the book and in her first series of interviews since the landmark 2024 trial that turned her into a global icon against sexual violence and imprisoned her husband, who drugged her so other men could assault her.

“Today I’m doing better, and this book allowed me to engage in self-reflection, to take stock of my life,” she said. “I had to try to rebuild myself on this field of ruins. Today I am a woman standing strong.”

Pelicot said her book is meant to deliver “a message of hope to all the women who are going through a very complicated period in their lives.”

The shocking case – and Pelicot’s decision to waive her anonymity and speak publicly – prompted a reckoning over rape culture in France and beyond, as her dignity and strength impressed many across the world.

Gymnastic superstar and Olympic gold medalist Simone Biles, herself a survivor of sexual abuse, paid tribute to Pelicot in a message broadcast by the BBC.

“Gisèle has demonstrated to the world that it’s not for victims of sexual abuse to feel shame – it’s the perpetrators,” Biles said. “By waiving her anonymity and refusing to feel shame, Gisèle paves the way for other victims to come forward.”

At the “Des Femmes” (“Women’s”) bookstore in Paris, several readers were eager to buy Pelicot’s book on the day of its release.

“I want to read it,” said Cécile Megueulle, who admires Pelicot. “But I tell myself that reading it will be … actually a little scary. The fact of not being in her shoes but being able to see the other side of the mirror, how she experienced it and how she managed – I don’t know if we can say that – to get through it.”

Selma Memic, a lawyer from Geneva, Switzerland, said: “The case was known as the ‘Pelicot case’ … and now we’re going to hear about ‘Gisèle’. So, that’s maybe what I’m looking for. Who is Gisèle? What are her feelings? How does she look back at it (the trial)?”

In December 2024, Pelicot’s ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, and 50 other men were convicted of sexually assaulting her between 2011 and 2020 while she was under chemical submission. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, while the other defendants received sentences ranging from three to 15 years.

An appeals court later increased the sentence handed to Husamettin Dogan, a construction worker who was the only defendant who challenged his conviction.

Dominique Pelicot, whom Gisèle Pelicot had been married to for nearly 50 years, acknowledged that for years he mixed sedatives into her food and drink so he could rape her and invite other men to do the same.

The unprecedented trial exposed how online pornography, chat rooms and distorted notions of consent can fuel sexual violence.

France passed a law last October that defines rape and other sexual assault as any non-consensual sexual act in the wake of the Pelicot case, joining many other European nations that have similar consent-based laws, including neighbouring Germany, Belgium and Spain. Until then, rape under French law was defined as penetration or oral sex using “violence, coercion, threat or surprise.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 14:27:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e6d0de8-0cca-11f1-ae36-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-17T094627Z-52876467-RC2LNJAV7C6I-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-JUSTICE-PELICOT-BOOK.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man missing in Loire River as record rains lash France</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260218-man-missing-loire-river-record-rains-lash-france</link><description>A man has gone missing in the Loire River in the flood hit west of France , an official said, as the country on Wednesday marked a record-breaking streak of 35 consecutive days of rain.

National weather service Meteo-France said the country was experiencing its longest series of rainy days since measurements began in 1959, breaking the 2023 record.

Four departments in western France were placed under red alert over the risk of flooding, with officials expecting the situation to worsen with the arrival of Storm Pedro, which is poised to batter swathes of western Europe .

The mayor of Bordeaux , Pierre Hurmic, activated the southwestern city's emergency plan, the first time since record floods in 1999.

In the western town of Chalonnes-sur-Loire, which is located on the left bank of the Loire, a man went missing on Tuesday evening after his canoe capsized, said senior official Francois Pesneau.

"We are deploying resources, but there is objectively very little chance of finding this person," he said, citing strong currents and cold water.

Nine departments were placed on orange alert.

In the town of Saintes, in Charentes-Maritime department, several central streets were flooded on Wednesday, as was the Arch of Germanicus, a historic monument which marked the entrance to the town in Roman times, AFP journalists saw.

In total, around 50 streets and 900 homes have been flooded, according to local officials, who are preparing for weather conditions to worsen.

"The flood peak is not expected before Saturday or Sunday," said mayor Bruno Drapron.

The new rainfall expected on Wednesday and Thursday could "fuel the current floods ", said Lucie Chadourne-Facon, director of flood alert service Vigicrues.

The affected regions will see drier weather from Friday, she told reporters, adding however that "the end of the rain does not mean the end of the flooding".

"A return to normal conditions will then occur very gradually," added Chadourne-Facon.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 15:26:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2aa67928-0ca2-11f1-a7d9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-97WA79E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Palestinian delegate to France Leïla Shahid dies age 76</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260218-former-palestinian-delegate-to-france-le%C3%AFla-shahid-dies-age-76</link><description>Leïla Shahid had become emblematic of the Palestinian cause, much like of former PLO leader Yasser Arafat .

French Muslims confused and frustrated over rival Ramadan dates</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260218-france-islam-muslims-confusion-rival-ramadan-dates-february-18-19-mosque-cfcm-lunar-moon-crescent</link><description>This year’s Ramadan , the near month-long Islamic ritual of performing a daily fast from dawn to dusk, had not even begun before a dispute broke out between France’s main Islamic bodies over its official start date.

While the Grande Mosquée de Paris – a century-old Islamic institution in France – declared that the fasting period would begin on February 18, France’s official Muslim council, the Conseil Français du Culte Musulman (CFCM), countered with another date: February 19.

Social media immediately blew up with comments from confused worshippers in France, which is home to some 6 million Muslims .

“Is it tomorrow or not?” one worried user asked on X after seeing the conflicting statements, while another urged France’s Islamic institutions to come together and agree on one single date. “Or I’ll go out and check the moon myself!”

The French Maghreb-focused media platform Mediaterranee.com said the rival dates were likely to disrupt families whose members usually come together to break the first fast together. “Families find themselves divided between those who begin the fast a day earlier and those who wait until the next day,” it said.

Although it is not uncommon for countries to pick different dates for Ramadan – some follow the strict visibility tradition, while others rely on scientific calculations, or a mix of the two – it is unusual for different dates to be set for the same country.

The Grande Mosquée said it came to its February 18 conclusion after “combining scientific calculations and lunar observations”. Its start date will therefore coincide with that of Saudi Arabia – the birthplace of Prophet Mohammed – and countries like the United Arab Emirates , Qatar , Oman , most Gulf states and Libya .

The CFCM, on the other hand, used strict astronomical criteria, meaning it set the date for a day later, along with Algeria , Belgium , Jordan , Turkey , Pakistan , Indonesia , Australia and some other countries.

A third institution, the French Muslim Theological Council (CTMF), further muddied the waters by adding a new argument to the mix: visibility conditions had been met in French Polynesia before sunrise on Wednesday morning, declaring it the reason for which February 18 should be considered Ramadan's official start date.

But although the date clash between the Grande Mosquée and the CFCM may boil down to different methodologies, the disagreement also reflects a long-standing rivalry between France’s key Islamic institutions.

The Grande Mosquée is France’s oldest mosque, inaugurated in 1926 to honour the fallen Muslim soldiers who fought for France in World War I , and was long the Islamic institution in France. Over the past few years it has also hosted an imam training centre.

The CFCM was founded in 2003 on the initiative of then interior minister Nicolas Sarkozy . It was meant to serve as the state’s only interlocutor on issues related to Muslim worship in France, and make sure the country's 1905 law on secularism was respected. But infighting between its main branches – the Morocco-linked National Federation of Muslims of France (FNMF), the Muslim Brotherhood-aligned Union of Islamic Organisations of France (UOIF), and the Algeria-backed Grande Mosquée de Paris – quickly weakened the body.

This confusion is likely to recur at the end of Ramadan, when the date of Eid al-Fitr is set 30 days after its official beginning.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 17:51:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8e154346-0cb5-11f1-a907-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-97QP69F.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris prosecutor makes public appeal for Epstein victims in France to come forward</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260218-paris-prosecutor-makes-public-appeal-for-epstein-victims-in-france-to-come-forward</link><description>The Paris prosecutor Wednesday called on potential victims of US sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to come forward, as magistrates investigate possible offences committed in France or involving French victims or perpetrators.

The call to file complaints and give evidence follows the latest cache of millions of files released last month by the US Justice Department from the investigation into Epstein, who died in prison in 2019.

"We already want to stand alongside these victims," Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told broadcaster Franceinfo. "If they wish, we will receive all the statements they would like to make, either in the form of complaints or testimony."

The Paris prosecutor's office has jurisdiction when a perpetrator is French, even if acts were committed abroad, or when the victims are French, Beccuau said.

If evidence submitted is beyond the Paris office's jurisdiction, investigators "would forward everything" to the applicable authorities, she added.

Several French public figures feature in the latest Epstein files, though being mentioned there does not in itself mean any offence has been committed.

Prosecutors have said they are probing a French diplomat, a modelling agent and a musician.

The prosecutor's office announced Saturday that magistrates had been tasked to examine possible offences involving French nationals, "notably of a sexual or financial nature".

And influential former minister Jack Lang was forced to resign as head of a top cultural body, the Arab World Institute, over alleged financial ties with Epstein.

The office of the national financial prosecutor has opened a preliminary investigation for "aggravated tax fraud and money laundering " against Lang and his daughter Caroline.

Epstein had extensive ties with France.

He owned a vast apartment on a west Paris street favoured by the rich and famous – Avenue Foch – and was a frequent visitor to the French capital before his death.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 18:55:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0ebc60b2-b809-11f0-aea1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/1dd841033ed5bfcf5154ad01119dc0acfd9c6af6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A very MAGA agenda': Is Trump’s Board of Peace meant to replace the United Nations?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260218-very-maga-agenda-trump-board-of-peace-meant-to-replace-the-united-nations</link><description>Dozens of world leaders will meet in Washington on Thursday for the inaugural meeting of US President Donald Trump ’s Board of Peace . First set up to oversee the Israel-Hamas ceasefire in Gaza and eventual rebuilding of the devastated Palestinian territory, the board’s founding charter – signed at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos in January – instead outlines a sweeping mandate to pursue peace , stability and “dependable and lawful governance” across the world.

A mission, its preamble makes clear, that calls for “the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed”.

Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that some nations have suggested that the board’s chairman – Trump himself – means to use it to sideline the beleaguered United Nations in favour of his own multilateral body made of a hand-picked membership under a hand-picked executive.

More than two dozen countries have reportedly signed its founding charter, which offers permanent membership to states willing to pay $1 billion into its coffers.

The board’s logo was revealed at the charter’s signing: a globe, wreathed in gold, angled to place North America at the centre of the world.

If the board is intended to be a rival to the UN, its founding comes at a bad time. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned in February that the world body was facing “imminent financial collapse” as a result of unpaid member dues and funding cuts.

That includes nearly $4 billion still owed by the US – more than 95 percent of the arrears owed to the UN’s regular budget, officials said. US officials maintain Washington is preparing to start paying its arrears in the coming weeks.

On the eve of the inaugural meeting, FRANCE 24 spoke with Alanna O’Malley, the chair of global governance and wealth and history department head at Rotterdam’s Erasmus University specialising in the United Nations, decolonisation and the Global South.

FRANCE 24: It’s hard not to remark upon the fact that the expanding role of Trump’s Board of Peace comes at a time when the UN is saying it is facing chronic funding difficulties, in particular because of unpaid dues from the US. To what extent are we seeing a desire from the Trump administration to shift Washington’s resources, both in time and money, away from the UN and towards a new multilateral body under permanent US leadership?

Of course the more time that’s put into creating an alternative institution such as the Board of Peace, that’s energy that the US – both in terms of financing but also in terms of manpower, intellectual input, commitment to multilateralism in terms of maintaining relationships and lobbying and building alliances – that’s all energy that’s then not put into the UN. So in many respects, it does present a fundamental challenge to the functionality of the UN, or the functionality of US power at the UN, because of its divergence from that institution.

But the UN has been in a declining position globally for quite a long time, especially in the last five years. And that has to do with this wider context in which the institution seems unwilling or unable to respond in a timely manner to major crises of international relations – including most recently, of course, the Russian aggression against Ukraine and the crisis in Gaza.

And as that happened, the reputation of the UN gets lower and lower and states feel less obliged to meet their mandatory contributions, because the value of those changes as the value of the UN decreases. In this respect the UN is in a very difficult position financially because a lot of members just simply haven't paid their dues. And then of course, this puts a strain on the organisation … and it actually reduces the efficacy of the UN. It's an exacerbatory effect.

Watch more Will Trump's 'Board of Peace' in Gaza really rival the UN?

But I wouldn't read necessarily the Board of Peace as a response to the crisis of the UN. The genesis of this new proposed institution is quite different – this is very much about the MAGA agenda in foreign policy. This is very much about American power in the world. This is about a wider response of the United States to the aggression of Russia in terms of its outlook in the world, but also to the increasing political might of China .

You see a lot of discussions now that point to a revival of 19th-century ideas about spheres of influence, and certainly Russia and China very much see the world like this. So I think this institution is the expression of America's turn towards thinking about spheres of influence. And we see this kind of hemispheric rhetoric coming a lot out of the Trump administration right now.

The other thing, of course, is that this institution was proposed as part of a peace settlement for Gaza, which was approved by the UN Security Council . But at that time, it seemed that it would be limited to the Gaza crisis, not that it would be expanded into a new institution designed to deal with other crises. This is an effort for the US to embed institutionally their global power, but in an institution that serves their purposes more directly.

A third reason is much more about Trump's ego. The terms of his engagement under this institution would be that he would be chairman for life, and that he would have essentially a veto over all major decisions of the institution. This is a way for him to guarantee a position of what he sees as supremacy in global affairs – even after he is out of office in the US. It's very much an ego project for him. On that basis, of course, it really undercuts any actual value such an institution might have.

What room, if any, does that leave for any kind of reformist push to revitalise the UN and restore a sense of legitimacy or relevance? Or are we going to see a broader sidestepping of the UN in favour of this turn towards spheres of influence?

You have to remember that the UN's popularity and power has waxed and waned over time. This is not the first moment of crisis in 81 years, and it won't be the last – depending on how long the UN will survive. There are 193 members of the UN, 192 without the US, and many of those other countries, including major European states such as France , such as the UK , such as Germany and major Global South actors such as South Africa , India , Brazil , Indonesia , remain extremely committed to the UN and remain vested in preserving its values and preserving its principles and institutions and systems.

What happens when major global powers turn away from institutions oftentimes is that it creates much more room for manoeuvre and a power vacuum within those structures. What is imperative now is that those especially more powerful states are really forthright about their commitment to UN reform.

And that's the step that we haven't seen. You've seen a lot of defence of the UN in response to this initiative, and you've seen also a lot of those countries are not going to be members of the Board of Peace. And some have been downright critical of the creation of another institution that might detract from commitment to the UN. And you see this resurgence around the world in the value of multilateralism and commitment to multilateralism, because there seems to be a major shift in the global order.

And at the centre of that, what we haven't seen is those countries make the next step and actually commit themselves to reform of the UN. Now, there is this campaign that's ongoing, the Article 109 campaign – article 109 of the UN charter stipulates that a conference for revision of the charter, to think about reform, should actually be held every 10 years under the UN's own constitution. That's never happened since 1945.

What reforms would you want to see coming out of that conference, should it take place?

I'd like to see a lot more power vested in the General Assembly [than in the Security Council]. In recent years, especially in the last ten years, we've seen a lot more activity and dynamism from the General Assembly, which, to be fair, historically has always been the most dynamic form of the UN and in fact, the most interesting politically.

The General Assembly is really the most accurate barometre for the temperature of the international community on any issue. That came out really clearly over Gaza, where you had those massive votes in support of resolutions on the Gaza crisis and condemning Israel 's military action.

But in a more a direct way you also saw the way that the General Assembly recently can reflect new political trends. One of those was the turn away of many Global South countries from European appeals to support resolutions on Ukraine, because that reflects a wider schism in the North-South relationship. There's been a lot of recourse to try to think about doing more at the General Assembly, because the Security Council is essentially deadlocked.

And that's really the elephant in the room on any discussion on UN reform. Because the next article of the charter under 109, the third premise, is that any reform of the UN charter has to be agreed by all of the permanent five members of the Security Council.

So the question is, how do you get a reform proposal across the line and keep the "P-5" happy? You've got to think about reforming the institution in a way that doesn't dilute their power. And one of the big issues is representation on the Security Council.

Given that dynamism, to what extent can we read the Trump administration’s efforts to set up the Board of Peace as a response to Global South countries’ increasing efforts to advance their own interests through the UN?

It's important to understand that Global South countries have had a majority vote in the General Assembly since 1960. They've been using the institution to advance their interests against significant pushback by the West for most of the UN's history.

And that's something that's not often featured in histories of the UN and multilateralism, in our understandings of the institution – it’s often depicted solely as a Western instrument, whereas actually it has been the epicentre for contestations of the liberal world order rather than the execution of liberal internationalist policies.

This is the context in which Global South agency has to be viewed. And that means that the Global South activity around multilateralism and around the UN right now is the continuity of much longer patterns of interaction with the institution.

The US in particular has been frustrated by their efforts to shape the agenda on various questions over time, also because it dilutes their own influence to a certain extent – because, of course, power politics are always at play in all institutions, not just in the UN. So it may be a response to increased Global South agency.

But to a large extent the US is still a major global partner and has a different regional relationships with Latin American states and then again with Asian and Southeast Asian and African states. So I'm not sure that their agency is such a surprise to the US. The only question that the US is really fundamentally squeezed on at the UN is Israel, everything to do with Israel – and that's where the US has used its veto most often at the Security Council.

It's more likely that the Board of Peace is being created for these other reasons – as a way to institutionalise US power under Donald Trump, rather than institutionalise the position of the US in the world. It's a very MAGA agenda.

In some of the footage, a white trail appears behind the planes, which is likely indicative of chemicals being sprayed. Moreover, farmers in several villages in the Quneitra governorate say that Israeli planes sprayed chemical substances on their land on January 25, 27 and 30, 2026. These operations took place all along the Alpha line , which marks the border between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights .

Syria’s Ministry of Agriculture reported on February 11 that tests carried out in Quneitra didn’t show acute levels of toxicity, but did not specify what chemicals had been sprayed on the land.

Israeli TV channel i24News reported on February 2 that the Israeli army was spraying herbicides on farmland "in areas near the Syrian and Lebanese borders so as to kill vegetation that terrorists could hide in”. The Israeli army did not respond to the questions that our team put to them.

An accord signed in 1974 between Tel Aviv and Damascus established a demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan region which would be monitored by the United Nations. However, after the regime of former Syrian president Bashar al-Assad fell on December 8, 2024, the Israeli army built eleven military bases inside this zone or within Syrian territory. One of these bases is located on Mount Hermon, a key strategic location that offers the possibility to surveil the entire region. Residents of this rural region – especially those living near the villages of Kodna and Al-Razaniyeh, both located in Quneitra – have reported that the Israeli army has been carrying out these chemical spraying operations as well as forest clearing.

Abu Salah (whose name has been changed to protect his anonymity) is a farmer who lives in Al-Razaniyeh in Quneitra.

"On January 27, 2026, planes flew over our land and started to spray. We didn’t know what they were spraying, but we saw it fall onto our fields. Ten days after the planes flew over, everything was yellow and then everything died. I lost 75 hectares of wheat; my whole harvest disappeared.

We borrowed money to grow these crops because the previous years were bad due to the lack of rain. This year, the rain was good, so we thought it would be an offset year. Now, we’ve lost the harvest, and we have even more debts. People want their money. I don’t know what to do.

The Israeli occupation forces want this area to become a zone without life, not just a zone without weapons. They want to force us to leave.  But it is our land and we won’t leave it.

Since the Syrian regime fell on December 8, 2024, we’ve been subjected to repeated incursions, gunshots, arrests. I had already lost sheep after my herd was shot at. Now, they are killing our land by spraying it with toxic substances. And on the other side, we don’t see our government doing anything about it. Between the two of them, we are really lost."

Our team contacted Quneitra’s director of agriculture, Jamal Mohammad Ali, who said that Israeli planes sprayed “the entire area along the border, from the north to the south”. Ali said that technical teams were dispatched to the affected areas to take samples . The results have not yet been made public, but Ali told our team that they found “general herbicides, diuron and 2,4-DB”.

Ali told our team that the crops that were sprayed turned yellow, then dried up completely and died. In some plots, the effects continue to spread. Local authorities estimate that around 400 hectares of grain and 4,000 hectares of pasture land – vital for grazing livestock – were affected. All of this threatens the livelihoods and even survival of local farmers.

The Israeli army also carried out spraying operations near the village of Kodna. Using satellite images posted on X by the online investigative account Samir , we compared the evolution of the zone targeted since 2022. In the images, which were captured using infrared, the red areas indicate thick vegetation. It’s clear that by 2026, there was a lot less vegetation.

Our team spoke to He Yin, a satellite image specialist at Kent State University, who analysed these images:

"The clearest conclusion is that the vegetation cover around Kodna became notably less ‘healthy’ beginning in early 2025 and remained degraded into early 2026.

In the early-February images from 2022–2024, the fields around the marked location are consistently bright red, indicating relatively vigorous vegetation cover. In contrast, the 2025–2026 images show the same area as more muted and brownish with a weaker red signal, consistent with reduced vegetation vigour and/or cover (for instance, more bare soil, senescent vegetation, or a sparser canopy)."

Hassan (whose name has been changed for this article) grew crops in the affected zone.

"I lost 80 hectares of land. Everything I planted turned yellow. Even the olive trees started to lose their leaves. Both my land and my uncle’s land were affected – an area of more than 2,000 hectares that was planted with pines and almond trees. When the Israeli army entered after the fall of the Syrian regime, they cut down all the trees. The whole forest was razed.

That’s why, on the maps, you see a big empty area. Then, they sprayed it all. These violations happened in front of my eyes and I couldn’t do anything. It’s the law of the strongest against the weakest.”

Hassan also documented the razing of trees in the forest of Kodna, located to the west of his village.

Israeli authorities have not made any public statements about their aims, making it impossible to establish with certainty their strategy.

In Lebanon, local officials have interpreted similar incidents as part of a broader security context tied to tensions with Hezbollah. This border region is frequently the site of Israeli military operations targeting the Shiite group. Two ministries reported that tests revealed the use of a high concentration of herbicides that posed both health and environmental risks.

Reports of similar spraying activity have also come from the West Bank . Farmers in the Masafer Yatta region, south of Hebron, reported that settlers sprayed chemicals on their crops in early February 2026.

Hussein Shanaran’s fields were attacked by settlers:

"In early February 2026, settlers sprayed our land with chemicals using hand pumps. A week later, on the night of February 6, 2026, I heard drones. They sprayed the crops again, but this time from the air.

They sprayed an area of about 450 hectares. I lost 20 hectares of wheat and barley. The land belonged to me and my cousins – we grow these crops on it to feed our animals. Now, I’ve lost everything. Every year, I harvested around three tons of wheat, as well as hay. I lost around $5,000 and the land is poisoned. My olive trees and vineyards have also been damaged.”

He says that he filed a complaint.

"We filed a complaint against the settlers. The Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture came to take samples and promised compensation. We live surrounded by settler outposts. We spend our nights guarding our homes. Our situation is very difficult.”

The two sides recently resumed indirect talks, mediated by Oman , after Trump repeatedly threatened military action against Iran over a deadly crackdown on protesters last month.

A previous attempt at negotiations collapsed when Israel launched surprise strikes on Iran last June, beginning a 12-day war that Washington briefly joined to bomb Iranian nuclear sites.

"Iran would be very wise to make a deal with President Trump and with his administration," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters.

On Wednesday, Trump again suggested the United States might strike Iran in a post on his Truth Social site, with a US military build-up underway in the Middle East.

He warned Britain against giving up sovereignty over the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, saying that the archipelago's Diego Garcia airbase might be needed were Iran not to agree a deal, "in order to eradicate a potential attack by a highly unstable and dangerous regime".

Earlier on Wednesday, Tehran's top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, said Iran was "drafting" a framework for future talks with the US.

Iran and the US held a second round of Oman-mediated negotiations on Tuesday in Geneva .

Araghchi said then that Tehran had agreed with Washington on "guiding principles", but US Vice President JD Vance said Iran had not yet acknowledged all of Washington's red lines.

Speaking on Wednesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian insisted "We do not want war" but suggested Tehran could not give in to US demands.

"From the day I took office, I have believed that war must be set aside. But if they are going to try to impose their will on us, humiliate us and demand that we bow our heads at any cost, should we accept that?"

Earlier on Wednesday, Araghchi held a phone call with Rafael Grossi, the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency.

In the call, the Iranian foreign minister "stressed the Islamic Republic of Iran's focus on drafting an initial and coherent framework to advance future talks", according to a statement from his ministry.

Tehran has suspended some co-operation with the IAEA and restricted the watchdog's inspectors from accessing sites bombed by Israel and the United States, accusing the UN body of bias and of failing to condemn the strikes.

Meanwhile, US Energy Secretary Chris Wright warned that Washington would deter Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons "one way or the other".

"They've been very clear about what they would do with nuclear weapons. It's entirely unacceptable," Wright told reporters in Paris on the sidelines of meetings of the International Energy Agency.

The Omani-mediated talks were aimed at averting the possibility of US military action, while Tehran is demanding the lifting of US sanctions that are crippling its economy.

Iran has insisted that the discussions be limited to the nuclear issue, though Washington has previously pushed for Tehran's ballistic missile programme and support for armed groups in the region to be on the table.

While talks have resumed, the US has also been building up its military forces near Iran.

Washington has ordered a second aircraft carrier to the region, with the first, the USS Abraham Lincoln and its nearly 80 aircraft, positioned about 700 kilometres (435 miles) from the Iranian coast as of Sunday, satellite images showed.

Iran has sought to display its own military might, with its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps beginning a series of war games on Monday in the Strait of Hormuz.

Iranian politicians have repeatedly threatened to block the strait, a major global conduit for oil and gas .

On Tuesday state TV reported that Tehran would close parts of the waterway for safety measures during the drills.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 22:33:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4afec40c-0d04-11f1-8077-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/39e7ead2248ebaf4b57a80376154a4c7148f01c8.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carnival parade honouring Lula finishes last amid political backlash</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260218-carnival-parade-honouring-lula-finishes-last-amid-political-backlash</link><description>A Carnival parade honouring Brazil 's president on Wednesday came dead last in Rio de Janeiro's fierce annual competition, as a political backlash grew over elements of the show that mocked conservatives.

The samba school Acadêmicos de Niterói, from a city neighbouring Rio, was relegated to the second division of the competition, which works like a football league.

Each year, the top 12 samba schools pick a theme which thousands of performers bring to life with towering floats, thundering drum sections and scantily clad samba queens, in the showpiece of Rio's Carnival.

Acadêmicos's choice to honour the life of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva angered the opposition even before it took place, as images mocking former far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro appeared in technical rehearsals.

Political critics denounced the show – the first to honour a sitting president – as early campaigning ahead of October elections in which Lula, 80, is seeking a fourth term.

Meanwhile, judges – who score everything from the storytelling to costumes, floats and choreography – were unimpressed with Acadêmicos's first showing among the elite schools.

Much of the parade depicted Lula's life in poverty in the arid north-east, his time as a shoeshine boy, metalworker and union leader, while paying tribute to his social welfare policies.

It also portrayed Bolsonaro, who is serving a 27-year sentence for a failed coup attempt, as Bozo the Clown behind bars.

One aspect particularly enraged the right: performers dressed as a traditional family preserved in a tin can, in a segment entitled "preserved neoconservatives".

This led to a flurry of social media posts of people publishing a picture of their own family in a tin can and slamming what they saw as an attack on Christian values.

The former president's son and political heir, Flávio Bolsonaro, posted an image of the parade celebrating the samba school's relegation.

"Those who attack the family do not deserve applause," he said.

Flávio Bolsonaro has vowed to appeal a decision by the electoral court, which last week rejected requests by two opposition parties to block the parade.

The court had warned it could still investigate after the show.

Pro-Bolsonaro lawmaker Nikolas Ferreira said Wednesday he would file a complaint with Rio's prosecutor's office about a parade that "went beyond the limits of political criticism and entered the dangerous territory of religious prejudice."

Samba school Viradouro won its fourth title in this year's parade with a show honouring Mestre Cica, the legendary leader of its percussion section.</description><pubDate>Wed, 18 Feb 2026 23:56:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f07f6cb6-0b0f-11f1-8d19-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26047108375056.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top US commander makes surprise visit to Venezuela after Maduro’s capture</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260219-top-us-commander-makes-surprise-visit-to-venezuela-after-maduro-capture</link><description>The top commander overseeing US forces in Latin America, General Francis Donovan, and senior Pentagon official Joseph Humire made a surprise visit to Venezuela on Wednesday for security talks, US officials said.

The trip is the first by a US military delegation since US forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in an audacious raid last month and whisked him to New York to face drug‑trafficking charges. The visit was first reported by Reuters.

Venezuela’s government said the US military delegation met interim president Delcy Rodríguez , defence minister Vladimir Padrino and interior minister Diosdado Cabello. The two sides agreed to work together to combat drug-trafficking, terrorism and migration, it added.

Both Padrino and Cabello face indictments related to drug trafficking in the United States.

The US military ’s visit follows a trip last week by US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright to Caracas.

Together, the two trips highlight President Donald Trump’s efforts to use military might and energy policy to push Venezuela to carry out sweeping reforms.

Washington has said it will manage Venezuela’s oil business indefinitely and maintains a robust naval presence in the Caribbean, where the US military is blowing up suspected drug boats and working with the Coast Guard to seize Venezuela‑linked oil tankers.

Venezuela’s government emphasised diplomacy as the preferred path for ties with Washington, which wants to see Caracas in the short term cut ties with US adversaries and open itself to US businesses. Venezuela sits on the world’s largest crude oil reserves.

“The meeting reaffirms that diplomacy should be the mechanism for resolving differences and addressing issues of bilateral and regional interests,” Venezuela’s Communications Minister Miguel Angel Perez said in a post on X.

The US military’s Southern Command said Donovan and Humire were joined in the talks by Laura Dogu, the new US envoy to the South American country.

“Discussions focused on the security environment, steps to ensure the implementation of President Donald Trump ’s three‑phase plan – particularly the stabilisation of Venezuela – and the importance of shared security across the Western Hemisphere,” Southern Command said in a post on X.

Dogu, in a separate post by the US embassy, called it a historic day in the effort to “advance the objective of a Venezuela aligned with the United States .”

Visits to Caracas by high‑ranking US officials were virtually nonexistent for many years, as the bilateral relationship with former President Hugo Chávez and then Maduro was severely strained.

For Donovan, it was his inaugural trip to Latin America as the head of Southern Command, a post he assumed on 5 February. Before that, he helped lead the US military’s special operations around the world as the No. 2 at Special Operations Command.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 02:24:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7f94f9b8-0cee-11f1-9678-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/4bd6cc96bbfd7d5399517cfccdf675d5d085cec7.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zuckerberg defends Meta policies on children at landmark social media harm trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260219-zuckerberg-defends-meta-policies-on-children-at-landmark-social-media-harm-trial</link><description>Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday repeatedly said during a landmark trial over youth social media addiction that the Facebook and Instagram operator does not allow children under 13 on its platforms, despite being confronted with evidence suggesting they were a key demographic.

Mark Lanier, a lawyer for the woman suing Instagram and Google’s YouTube for harming her mental health when she was a child, pressed Zuckerberg over his statement to Congress in 2024 that users under 13 are not allowed on the platform. Lanier confronted Zuckerberg with internal Meta documents.

The case involves a California woman who started using Instagram and YouTube as a child. She alleges the companies sought to profit by hooking children on their services despite knowing social media could harm their mental health. She alleges the apps fuelled her depression and suicidal thoughts and is seeking to hold the companies liable.

Meta and Google have denied the allegations and pointed to their work to add features that keep users safe.

“If we want to win big with teens, we must bring them in as tweens,” read one internal Instagram presentation from 2018.

“And yet you say that we would never do that,” said Lanier.

Zuckerberg replied that Lanier was “mischaracterising what I am saying”. The CEO said Meta has “had different conversations over time to try to build different versions of services that kids can safely use”. For example, he said Meta discussed creating a version of Instagram for children under 13, but ultimately never did.

Meta faces potential damages at the jury trial in Los Angeles, part of a wave of litigation against social media companies in the US, where cases are beginning to go to trial amid a broader global backlash over the platforms’ effect on young users.

Meta’s rivals Snap Inc. and TikTok settled with the plaintiff before the trial kicked off last week.

In one email, Nick Clegg, who was Meta’s vice-president of global affairs, told Zuckerberg and other top executives, “we have age limits which are unenforced (unenforceable?)” and noted different policies for Instagram versus Facebook make it “difficult to claim we are doing all we can”.

Zuckerberg responded by saying that it is hard for app developers to verify user age and that the responsibility should be on the makers of mobile devices. Teens on Instagram are estimated to make up less than 1% of revenue, he testified.

Zuckerberg also faced questions about his statement to Congress in 2021 that he did not give Instagram teams the goal of maximising time spent on the app.

Lanier showed jurors emails from 2014 and 2015 in which Zuckerberg laid out aims to increase time spent on the app by double-digit percentage points. Zuckerberg said that while Meta previously had goals related to the amount of time users spent on the app, it has since changed its approach.

“If you are trying to say my testimony was not accurate, I strongly disagree with that,” Zuckerberg said.

Jurors were shown a document from 2022 listing “milestones” for Instagram in the coming years, including incrementally increasing the time that users spend on the app daily from 40 minutes in 2023 to 46 minutes in 2026.

The milestones are not “goals”, Zuckerberg said, but a “gut check” for senior management about how the company is doing.

In response to questioning by Meta’s lawyer, Paul Schmidt, Zuckerberg said that Meta bases employee goals for its products on giving users a good experience.

“If we do that well, people find the services more valuable and one side effect is they will use the services more,” he said.

The appearance was the billionaire Facebook founder’s first time testifying in court on Instagram’s effect on the mental health of young users.

Matthew Bergman, a lawyer representing other parents who claim social media caused their children’s deaths, told reporters outside the courthouse that the parents, several of whom have been attending the trial, hope the cost of the litigation will force change in the industry.

“We know that simply because we have achieved this milestone, justice has been done,” he said of Zuckerberg’s testimony and the trial.

The lawsuit serves as a test case for similar claims in a larger group of cases against Meta, Alphabet Inc.’s Google , Snap and TikTok . Families, school districts and states have filed thousands of lawsuits in the US accusing the companies of fuelling a youth mental health crisis.

A verdict against the companies in the Los Angeles case could erode Big Tech’s longstanding legal defence against claims of user harm. For many years, US law has shielded internet companies from liability for content decisions. But the ongoing cases focus on the way companies designed and operated the platforms.

Over the years, investigative reporting has unearthed internal Meta documents showing the company was aware of potential mental health harm. Meta researchers found that some teens reported that Instagram regularly made them feel bad about their bodies, and that these people saw significantly more “eating disorder adjacent content” than those who did not, Reuters reported in October.

Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, testified last week that he was unaware of a recent Meta study showing no link between parental supervision and teens’ attentiveness to their own social media use. Teens with difficult life circumstances more often said they used Instagram habitually or unintentionally, according to the document shown at trial.

Meta’s lawyer told jurors at the trial that the woman’s health records show her issues stem from a troubled childhood, and that social media was a creative outlet for her.

Other leaders in attendance include some eager for US attention, such as Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who has courted Trump for support in his country’s conflict with India.

But major historic allies of the United States are not participating, including France and Canada.

Japan, usually among the most stalwart US allies, has not decided whether to join the board and will send an envoy handling Gaza.

Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told AFP that the “Board of Peace” should compel Israel to “stop its violations in Gaza” and to lift its long siege of the territory.

The Board of Peace meeting will look at how to launch the International Stabilisation Force that will ensure security in Gaza.

A key player will be Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country, which has said it is ready to send up to 8,000 troops to Gaza if the force is confirmed.

Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto will take part in the inaugural meeting in Gaza, after joining the launch event at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.

“Israel’s recent illegal decisions to expand its control over the West Bank are gravely disturbing,” Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said at the UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday.

“Annexation is a breach of the UN Charter and of the most fundamental rules of international law,” Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour said. “It is a breach of President Trump’s plan and constitutes an existential threat to ongoing peace efforts.”

At the “Board of Peace” meeting, Trump is expected to detail pledges of more than $5 billion for Gaza, where the vast majority of buildings lie in rubble and the property-mogul-turned-president has improbably suggested developing resorts.

Welcome to our liveblog on the inaugural meeting of US President Donald Trump’s “Board of Peace”.

World leaders prepared to head to Washington on Thursday to discuss the future of the Palestinian territories at the first gathering of US President Donald Trump's Board of Peace .

The UN Security Council held a high-level meeting Wednesday on the Gaza ceasefire deal and Israel's efforts to expand control in the West Bank.

A top UN official warned Wednesday that steps by Israel to tighten control of areas of the West Bank administered by the Palestinian Authority amount to “ de facto annexation .”

On Wednesday Mike Waltz, the US ambassador to the UN, appeared to criticise countries that had not yet signed on to the Board of Peace, saying that unlike the Security Council, the board is “not talking, it is doing".</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 04:31:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cac68b8c-0ce3-11f1-b47b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26022425692818.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jon-Un unveils nuclear-capable rocket system</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260219-north-korea-kim-jon-un-unveils-nuclear-capable-rocket-system</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has unveiled a battery of large nuclear-capable rocket launchers ahead of a key congress of the nation’s ruling party, state media reported on Thursday.

Kim is expected to outline the next phase of North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme when he opens a rare congress of the ruling Workers' Party in the coming days.

The 600 mm multiple-launch rocket system took centre stage as preparations intensified for the once-in-five-years gathering, widely regarded as North Korea’s most important political event.

“When this weapon is used, no force would be able to expect God’s protection,” Kim said, according to the Korean Central News Agency.

“It is really a wonderful and attractive weapon.”

Photos released by state media showed dozens of launch vehicles parked in neat rows on the plaza of Pyongyang ’s House of Culture, which will host the congress.

The weapon was “appropriate for a special attack, that is, for accomplishing a strategic mission,” Kim said at a ceremony on Wednesday, using a common euphemism for nuclear weapons .

He added that the weapons system — which was presented to the congress as a gift from munitions workers — would deter unnamed enemies.

“There is no need to further explain its destructive power and military value,” Kim said.

“This is because it can reduce the aimed target to ashes through surprise and simultaneous attack by focusing its destructive energy.”

The launch system could fire rockets with an estimated range of 400 kilometres (250 miles), covering all of South Korea, said analyst Hong Min of the Korea Institute for National Unification.

Political showcase

“Its primary purpose is to neutralise the combined air power of South Korea and the United States ,” he told AFP.

“If equipped with tactical nuclear warheads, a single battery firing four to five rounds could devastate an entire airbase.”

South Korea ’s capital, Seoul , is less than 50 kilometres (30 miles) from the border at its nearest point.

Analysts believe North Korea would use its vast artillery arsenal to launch saturation strikes on the South should fighting break out.

Kim ordered the expansion and modernisation of missile production in the months leading up to the Workers’ Party congress.

Pyongyang has also significantly stepped up missile testing.

Analysts say this drive is aimed at improving precision-strike capabilities, challenging the United States, and testing weapons before exporting them to Russia.

Pyongyang has said it will hold a landmark congress of the ruling Workers’ Party on an unspecified date in late February.

State media in recent days has carried reports of delegates arriving for the gathering, fuelling speculation it could start at any time.

The political showcase is expected to outline North Korea’s foreign policy, war planning, and nuclear ambitions for the next five years.

Kim said in late January that the gathering would detail “next-stage plans” for developing North Korea’s nuclear forces.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 04:31:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/95e16ccc-e9d7-11f0-8497-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26004800112489.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>🔴 South Korean court sentences ex-president Yoon to life in prison for 2024 insurrection</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260219-south-korea-s-ex-president-yoon-found-guilty-of-leading-insurrection-in-martial-law-case</link><description>A South Korean court found ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol guilty of insurrection on Thursday, saying his martial law declaration in December 2024 was a deliberate plot to "paralyse" the National Assembly.

"As to defendant Yoon Suk Yeol, the crime of insurrection leadership is established," presiding judge Ji Gwi-yeon told Seoul Central District Court.

The court sentenced the disgraced former leader to life imprisonment.

Yoon abruptly declared martial law in a televised address in December 2024, saying drastic measures were needed to root out "anti-state forces".

The 65-year-old hardline conservative was later impeached, arrested and charged with a litany of crimes ranging from insurrection to obstruction of justice.

Prosecutors had sought the harshest penalty on the insurrection charges, urging the Seoul Central District Court to put Yoon on death row during hearings in January.

South Korea has an unofficial moratorium on capital punishment – the last prisoners were executed in 1997 – with a death sentence effectively banishing Yoon to life behind bars.

Long seen as a shining light of stable democracy in Asia, Yoon's failed bid to seize power stirred unpleasant memories of the military coups that jolted the nation between 1960 and 1980.

Yoon has been held in solitary confinement while fighting multiple criminal trials.

He has consistently denied wrongdoing, arguing he acted to "safeguard freedom" and restore constitutional order against what he called an opposition-led "legislative dictatorship".

Prosecutors accused him of leading an "insurrection" driven by a "lust for power aimed at dictatorship and long-term rule".

Under South Korean law, only two sentences are fit for insurrection: life imprisonment or death.

Yoon has already been sentenced to five years in prison on lesser charges, while a host of senior officials also face hefty prison terms.

Yoon broke into late-night TV on December 3, 2024, to deliver a shock address to the nation.

Pointing to vague threats of North Korean influence and dangerous "anti-state forces", he declared the suspension of civilian government and the start of military rule.

Martial law was lifted six hours later after lawmakers raced to the assembly building to hold an emergency vote.

Staffers barricaded the doors with office furniture to keep armed troops at bay.

The declaration triggered flash protests, sent the stock market into panic and caught key military allies such as the United States off guard.

Yoon's wife Kim Keon Hee was sentenced to 20 months' jail earlier in January on unrelated charges stemming from bribes she took while first lady.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 07:11:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b8cd5a1c-0d30-11f1-90be-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/de2530f8e9f975b7248692fb90a6ca1be147a917.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron tells India AI summit Europe is determined to 'shape rules' with allies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260219-macron-tells-india-ai-summit-europe-determined-shape-rules-with-allies</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron told a global artificial intelligence summit in India on Thursday he was determined to ensure safe oversight of the fast-evolving technology.

The European Union has led the way for global regulation with its Artificial Intelligence Act , which was adopted in 2024 and is coming into force in phases.

"We are determined to continue to shape the rules of the game... with our allies such as India," Macron said in New Delhi .

"Europe is not blindly focused on regulation – Europe is a space for innovation and investment, but it is a safe space."

At last year's AI summit in Paris, US Vice President JD Vance had warned against "excessive regulation" that "could kill a transformative sector".

Under EU laws, regulators can ban AI systems deemed to pose "unacceptable risks" to society, such as identifying people in real time using cameras in public spaces.

Macron, speaking at the AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, said France was "doubling the number of AI scientists and engineers trained", with new startups in the sector creating "dozens of thousands" of jobs.

Last month, French lawmakers passed a bill that would ban social media use for under-15s, which awaits a Senate vote before becoming law, following a similar ban enacted by Australia in December.

"One of our G7 priorities will be, as well, children's protection against AI and digital abuse," Macron said Thursday.

"There is no reason our children should be exposed online to what is legally forbidden in the real world," he said.

France is "committed here in this journey" with several European countries, Macron said, adding that he knows India "will join this club".

"Protecting our children is not regulation, as well. It is civilization," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 07:11:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/304dc462-0d5b-11f1-a260-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-984W8Z9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court sentences ex-president Yoon to life in prison in martial law case</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260219-south-korea-s-ex-president-yoon-found-guilty-of-leading-insurrection-in-martial-law-case</link><description>A South Korean court found ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol guilty of insurrection on Thursday, saying his martial law declaration in December 2024 was a deliberate plot to "paralyse" the National Assembly.

The couple were arrested in January 2025 while travelling through the country on an around-the-world motorcycle journey and have consistently denied Tehran's spying claims.

"My parents have now been sentenced to 10 years following a trial that lasted just three hours and in which they were not allowed to present any defence," their son Joe Bennett said in a statement, adding relatives were "deeply concerned".

British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper on Thursday condemned the couple's sentencing as "completely appalling and totally unjustifiable".

"We will pursue this case relentlessly with the Iranian government until we see Craig and Lindsay Foreman safely returned to the UK and reunited with their family," Cooper said in a statement.

The couple were first detained as they passed through Kerman, in central Iran, while on a round-the-world motorbike trip.

Tehran has insisted they are spies, with Iran's judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir last year alleged that the Foremans entered Iran "posing as tourists" and gathered information before their arrest.

Lindsay Foreman is currently being held in the women's section of Evin Prison in Tehran while Craig is in its political wing.

The prison has long been criticised by international human rights organisations for its dire conditions and treatment of prisoners.

Their family have raised concerns about conditions , including cramped cells and lack of food, as well as a lack of legal representation and urged the British government to secure their freedom.

Bennett has said the couple were "caught in the middle" of geopolitical tensions between Tehran and other Western countries, most notably the United States, as well as "very difficult" UK-Iran relations.

He and other relatives have been campaigning publicly on the case ever since their arrests.

They marked the one-year anniversary of the detentions by handing in a petition to Downing Street signed by tens of thousands of people urging the British government to do more to free them.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 09:10:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5dafd8d0-0d67-11f1-89f2-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-98667WE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US buildup of warships and fighter jets sets stage for potential war with Iran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260219-us-buildup-warships-fighter-jets-armada-sets-stage-potential-war-with-iran</link><description>The massive US military buildup in the Middle East, including warships, fighter jets and refuelling aircraft, lays the foundation for a potentially sustained campaign against Iran – should President Donald Trump give the order.

Trump – who ordered strikes on Iran last year – has repeatedly threatened Tehran with further military action if ongoing talks do not reach a replacement for the nuclear deal the US president tore up in 2018, during his first term in office.

CNN and CBS reported Wednesday that the US military will be ready to launch strikes against Iran as early as this weekend, though Trump has reportedly not made a final decision yet.

The presence of "so much firepower ... in the region creates a momentum of its own", said Susan Ziadeh, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"Sometimes that momentum is a little hard to just put the brakes on and say, that's it, we're not doing anything," Ziadeh said during a panel discussion Wednesday.

Washington currently has 13 warships in the Middle East: one aircraft carrier – the USS Abraham Lincoln – nine destroyers and three littoral combat ships, with more on the way, according to a US official.

The USS Gerald R. Ford – the world's largest aircraft carrier – is currently in the Atlantic Ocean en route from the Caribbean to the Middle East, after being ordered there by Trump earlier this month. It is accompanied by three destroyers.

It is rare for there to be two US aircraft carriers – which carry dozens of warplanes and are crewed by thousands of sailors – in the Middle East.

The United States had two of the massive warships in the region in June last year when it targeted three Iranian nuclear sites during Israel's 12-day campaign of strikes on Iran.

The United States has also sent a large fleet of aircraft to the Middle East, according to open-source intelligence accounts on X and flight-tracking website Flightradar24.

These include F-22 Raptor stealth fighter jets, F-15 and F-16 warplanes and the KC-135 aerial refuelling aircraft that are needed to sustain their operations.

On Wednesday, Flightradar24 showed multiple KC-135s flying near or in the Middle East, as well as E3 Sentry airborne warning and control aircraft and cargo planes operating in the region.

Trump ordered the Lincoln to the Middle East as Iran cracked down on protests that were initially driven by economic grievances, but which turned into a mass movement against the Islamic republic.

The clerical leadership that took power after the 1979 Islamic revolution responded to the demonstrations with deadly force and has held onto power, with many opponents of the system looking to outside intervention as the most likely driver of change.

Trump had repeatedly warned Iran that if it killed protesters, the United States would intervene militarily, and also encouraged Iranians to take over state institutions, saying "help is on the way".

He pulled back from ordering strikes last month, saying Tehran had halted more than 800 executions under pressure from Washington, but has since renewed threats against Iran.

US and Iranian officials held talks in Geneva on Tuesday aimed at averting US military intervention, with Iran saying afterward that they had agreed on "guiding principles" for a deal.

But White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that while there was "a little bit of progress made", the two sides are "still very far apart on some issues".

Leavitt also told journalists there are "many reasons and arguments that one could make for a strike against Iran," adding: "Iran would be very wise to make a deal."</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 10:10:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/803f1a6a-0d75-11f1-86f4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-15T190352Z-942558804-RC27GJAK8KAS-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-CRISIS-USA-CARRIER.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police arrest Andrew ⁠Mountbatten-Windsor on suspicion of misconduct in public office</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260219-uk-police-arrest-andrew-mountbatten-windsor-on-suspicion-of-misconduct-in-public-office</link><description>Britain's ex-prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor , King Charles' younger brother, has been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office.

UK police confirmed on Thursday that a man in his sixties had been arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office, adding that they would not be naming the man "as per national guidance".

Local media said six unmarked police cars and around eight plain clothed officers arrived at Wood Farm on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, eastern England, where the king's brother – who turned 66 on Thursday – now lives.

BBC TV reported earlier that the suspicions of misconduct involved allegations Mountbatten-Windsor sent confidential government documents to Jeffrey Epstein .

Thames Valley Police said earlier this month officers were considering allegations that the disgraced former prince had passed documents to the late sex offender, according to files recently released by the US government.

"Following a thorough assessment, we have now opened an investigation into this allegation of misconduct in public office,’’ the police said in a statement on Thursday.

"We understand the significant public interest in this case, and we will provide updates at the appropriate time," the statement added.

Mountbatten-Windsor, the second son of the late Queen Elizabeth, has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein, and said he regrets their friendship but has not responded to requests for comment since the latest release of documents.

There was no immediate comment ​from Buckingham Palace.

The former prince was stripped of his titles last year after one of Epstein's victims alleged she had been trafficked to have sex with him.

Charles has voiced "concern" over his brother's actions and last week issued an unprecedented statement noting Buckingham Palace was "ready to support" the police in their inquiries.

Official guidance stipulates trade envoys have a duty of confidentiality over sensitive, commercial or political information related to their official visits, the BBC has said.

Mountbatten-Windsor, whose ties to Epstein have caused a spectacular years-long fall from grace , served as a British trade envoy for a decade from 2001.

At least nine separate UK police forces have confirmed they are assessing reports which appear to link the former prince to Epstein.

It comes as high-profile figures, including former UK prime minister Gordon Brown , have urged police to probe dozens of flights dating back decades arriving at UK airports and tied to Epstein.

Writing in the New Statesman magazine last week, Brown said he had been "told privately that the investigations related to the former Prince Andrew did not properly check vital evidence of flights".

"I have asked the police to look at this as part of the new inquiry," he stated, adding it appeared "the authorities never knew what was happening".

London's Metropolitan police has also launched an investigation into the relationship between the UK's former ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson , and the disgraced financier.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 11:12:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ac53ad0a-0d7f-11f1-8ac1-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/Andrew-arrested.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A historic downfall for the UK's former prince Andrew</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260219-a-historic-downfall-for-the-uk-s-former-prince-andrew</link><description>Thames Valley Police said it was "assessing" allegations that the former prince sent trade reports to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in 2010.

UK police arrested Andrew on suspicion of misconduct at his new home in Sandringham in Norfolk. It came after a fresh cache of documents published earlier this month by the US Justice Department appeared to show that Andrew sent Epstein potentially confidential documents during his time as a UK trade envoy.

In a November 2010 email sent while he was trade envoy, Andrew appeared to share with Epstein reports on Vietnam, Hong Kong, Shenzhen and Singapore following an official visit to Asia.

He also reportedly sent the American financier details of the trip – on which he was accompanied by Epstein's business associates – along with investment opportunities months later.

At least nine separate UK police forces have confirmed they were assessing reports which appear to link the former prince to Epstein.

Mountbatten-Windsor had already been stripped of all of his titles last year by his brother King Charles III and ousted from his home on the Windsor estate to a remote corner of rural England.

The man who once swanned around the world in private jets, staying at luxury hotels and palaces, was in custody and likely to spend his 66th birthday on Thursday inside a police cell.

Andrew was already deeply unpopular with the British public, with an October YouGov poll finding that 91 percent had a negative opinion of him. Dubbed "Randy Andy" by the British tabloids, he once led a gilded life as the favourite son of the late Queen Elizabeth II .

But shocking revelations about his relationship with Epstein and the illegal actions he allegedly participated in have likely sullied his reputation beyond repair.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that Andrew should testify to the US Congress about his ties to Epstein.

Born on February 19, 1960, at Buckingham Palace, in his younger years the British public adored the handsome prince and helicopter pilot who fought in the 1982 Falklands War against Argentina .

He was seen as fun and comfortable around people, unlike his stuffier older brother Charles.

But as his excesses went unchecked and times and attitudes changed, the public grew tired of his behaviour and then increasingly angry.

The re-emergence of allegations that he had had sex with Virginia Giuffre, a trafficking victim of Epstein, on three separate occasions, including twice when she was just 17, reignited public outrage. He settled with Giuffre for an unspecified sum .

The scandal has only snowballed since then. The latest release in January of the "Epstein files" included a picture of Andrew leaning over a woman lying on the floor.

Andrew has been a persistent source of embarrassment for the monarchy.

A devastating 2019 television interview in which he defended his friendship with Epstein, and failed to express any sympathy for his victims, further humiliated the family.

He also faced ridicule after countering a claim that he had been "profusely sweating" during an alleged encounter with Giuffre, saying he could not sweat because of a medical condition.

Andrew was stripped of his military and His Royal Highness (HRH) titles in 2022 and shuffled off into retirement after being sued by Giuffre and paying her a multi-million pound settlement, even though he did not admit any fault.

Giuffre, a US and Australian citizen, was found dead at her farm in Western Australia in April last year in what was ruled a suicide.

Internationally, Andrew was once best known for his 1986 wedding to the fun-loving Sarah Ferguson, known as Fergie.

Bubbly, friendly Sarah had been considered an ideal match for Andrew, who had a reputation as a "playboy prince".

The couple have two daughters, Beatrice and Eugenie.

But by 1992 the pair had split amicably, contributing to what the late queen Elizabeth II called her " annus horribilis ". They finalised their divorce in 1996.

Andrew left the Royal Navy in 2001, after 22 years of service as a helicopter pilot, and became a special government trade envoy until 2011, earning a new nickname – "Air Miles Andy" – as he jetted around the world at the taxpayers' expense.

Questions also piled up about his judgement after links to various dictators emerged, and he faced repeated criticism of being brash, arrogant and rude.

King Charles finally moved into action in October, stripping his brother of his royal titles and ousting him from his home on the Windsor estate.

Ferguson, whose reputation has also been tarnished by revelations from the Epstein files, was also stripped of her title of duchess and left to seek a new home on her own.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 13:38:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2df4d25a-0d88-11f1-875c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/ca072042c39ef7ecde8c70d3f41ffd68407ae823.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Never-before-seen photos of Nazi executions in Greece surface on eBay</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260219-unseen-photos-nazi-executions-greek-resistance-fighters-wwii-ebay</link><description>They look straight into the camera as they walk in a row, two by two, with their heads held high. They appear to be singing – even though they are walking straight to their deaths.

The 12 yellowed black-and-white photos turned up on the online auction website eBay on February 14, and depict the Nazi massacre of Greek communist fighters in the Athenian suburb of Kaisariani, on May 1, 1944.

“The photographs shocked me,” Polymeris Voglis, a professor in social history at the University of Thessaly in Greece , said. “Although the execution of 200 resistance fighters is a well-known historical event, until now there has been no photographic evidence of it.”

“Some of the photographs show the faces of the men, reflecting their determination as they walk proudly towards the firing squad,” he added.

The discovery of the photos have sparked strong reaction in Greece, with virtually all media outlets reporting on their discovery on the auction website. The sale was organised by Tim de Craen, a Belgian collector who runs a commercial platform focused on WWII documents and coins. Some of the photographs had received bids worth more than $2,000 before he took them down after facing public anger. “I fully understand that these photographs are of a particularly sensitive historical nature,” he told Greek newspaper I Kathimerini .

The massacre in Kaisariani was one of the worst atrocities the Nazis committed in Greece during the war.

Spyridon Tsoutsoumpis, a specialist in the Greek resistance movement at the University of Manchester, said the executions were carried out to avenge an April 27, 1944, attack by the Greek People’s Liberation Army (ELAS) on a German convoy escorting Wehrmacht Lieutenant General Franz Krech. Krech died in the attack, along with several of the people accompanying him.

“The Wehrmacht responded with mass reprisals,” Tsoutsoumpis said, noting some 200 Greek Communist Party members and resistance fighters became their first target. “Many of these men had been arrested by the dictatorial regime of Ioannis Metaxas, which came to power in 1936, and had remained imprisoned since the pre-war period. They were handed over to the Axis authorities after Greece’s capitulation. Others were arrested later during the occupation.”

The massacre is still deeply inscribed in Greece’s collective memory today. “There are many songs, poems, engravings, and books about this historical event,” Tsoutsoumpis said. In 2017 there was also a film made about it. “For the Greek left, the Kaisariani shooting range is a “lieu de mémoire”: it is not a coincidence that when the left took power in 2015, the very first day in his office as prime minister, Alexis Tsipras visited the Kaisariani shooting range to pay tribute to those who were executed by the Germans.”

As far as historians are aware, the newly discovered photographs are the only images depicting the historic massacre.

“There are a few photographs of German reprisals in Greece, and even fewer photographs of executions,” Voglis said, referring to the depiction of the German execution of civilians on the island of Crete in June, 1941, as “the exception”.

“Until now,” he said, “we knew what happened [in Kaisariani only] through narratives”.

The images also confirm the myths surrounding the executions: “The political prisoners marched to the firing squad proud and defiant,” he said.

Tsoutsoumpis said they constitute an important discovery. “They provide a rare view of those at the receiving end of Nazi violence. They are also significant because of their lack of staging and their immediacy.”

They also help restore the victims’ dignities. “While we often know the names and motivations of the perpetrators, those who suffered at their hands remain anonymous. These photos restore agency, individuality, and dignity to the victims of fascist violence,” he said. “They convey an image of defiance and deep humanity, showing that even in their final moments they retained their courage. They help us better understand the mindset, motivations, and ideals of those who laid down their lives in the struggle against fascism.”

According to the English-language news site Greek Reporter , the Communist Party of Greece (KKE) has, with the help of local researchers, begun to identify the men on the pictures. Two of them have already been identified: political activist Thrasyvoulos Kalafatakis, and trade union leader Dimitris Papadopoulos.

According to Greek authorities, the photographs were almost certainly taken by Gunther Heysing, a journalist working for Adolph Hitler’s propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. Some Greek media have also speculated they could have been taken by Hermann Heller, a German lieutenant who was stationed in Greece at the time.

Guillaume Pollack, a French historian specialised in the resistance movement at the Paris-1 Panthéon-Sorbonne University, said that regardless of who stood behind the camera, the photos have clearly been taken “from the executioner’s point of view”.

“Photographs of arrests and executions are generally taken by the repressive forces. They’re carefully composed and haven’t been taken on the fly. The framing is deliberate. They may have been taken by a soldier as a war trophy, or to be able to show their superiors that they had done a good job, or by photographers attached to the German companies who accompanied the troops wherever they went.”

Although these types of photos are extremely rare, this is not the first time Nazi execution photos have been found several decades after they were taken and been made public.

In France, there have been several cases, including the execution of fisherman Émile Masson in Amiens on November 12, 1940, who had been caught sabotaging telephone lines. The photo was taken by a German witness and developed by a local photographer who made a duplicate that he handed to the French resistance movement. The photo was then sent to London, and was spread around the world.

Other photos were discovered when France was liberated in 1945. One of them is a picture of four French Nazi collaborators who stand by the corpses of the 18 resistance fighters and paratroopers of the French Free forces they killed in the July 12, 1944, Kérihuel massacre in the village of Plumelec in Brittany. The picture was taken by a German soldier and was handed over to French authorities by a British soldier.

In 2009, famed Nazi hunter Serge Klarsfeld identified photographs depicting the February 21, 1944, execution of French resistance fighters on the Mont-Valérien, the main execution site in France by the German army during WWII, near Paris. The photos had been taken in secret by a German soldier, Clemens Ruther, who kept them out of view for some 40 years. Shortly before his death, he confided his secret to a friend who convinced him to give them to the Franz Stock Committee for Germany, a memorial foundation for the Catholic Priest who ministered to French Resistance prisoners before their execution.

Tsoutsoumpis said that these types of images were widely circulated among Wehrmacht veterans after the war. “It is likely that they ended up on eBay through someone with access to these networks, perhaps a descendant of a veteran or a collector. However, we cannot know this with certainty.”

Pollack is convinced that more will resurface with time.

“There are plenty of things lying around in attics. German soldiers sent photos home to their families, even of themselves executing a Jew or a resistance fighter. It can be hard to make this kind of discovery about your grandfather, but you don’t have to sell it on eBay,” he said, and lamented the “morbid fascination” with such photos.

“People need to understand that they have to report them to institutions so that they can be preserved.”

Greece, for example, has sent experts to Belgium to examine the Kaisariani massacre photos and to meet with the collector who tried to sell them.

“The photos must be acquired by the Greek State, provided they are authentic. In that case, they constitute unique documents, inextricably linked to a specific tragic event in Greek history and thus part of the cultural heritage of the Greek people,” government spokesman Pavlos Marinakis said Monday.

Pollack said the discovery of the photographs will not only serve as evidence of the crime committed, but also to give the victims some justice. “They wanted to erase these men from humanity. Every time we put a name to a face, it thwarts that project a little bit.”

The paramilitary Rapid Support Forces – which are at war with the Sudanese military – carried out mass killings and other atrocities in the city of El-Fasher after an 18-month siege during which they imposed conditions “calculated to bring about the physical destruction" of non-Arab communities, in particular the Zaghawa and the Fur communities, the independent fact-finding mission on Sudan reported.

U.N. officials say several thousand civilians were killed in the RSF takeover of el-Fasher, the Sudanese army’s only remaining stronghold in the Darfur. Only 40% of the city’s 260,000 residents managed to flee the onslaught alive, thousands of whom were wounded, the officials said. The fate of the rest remains unknown.

Sudan plunged into conflict in mid-April 2023, when long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital of Khartoum and spread to other regions, including Darfur. So far, the war has killed more than 40,000 people, according to UN figures, but aid groups say that's an undercount and the true number could be many times higher.

The RSF overran El-Fasher on Oct. 26 and rampaged through the city in an offensive marked by widespread atrocities that included mass killings and summary executions, sexual violence, torture , and abductions for ransom, according to the UN Human Rights Office.

They killed more than 6,000 people between Oct. 25 and Oct. 27 in the city, the office said. Ahead of the attack, the paramilitary forces ran riot in the Abu Shouk displacement camp, just outside of the city, and killed at least 300 people in two days, it said.

The RSF did not respond to an e-mailed request for comment. The group's commander, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Dagalo , has previously acknowledged abuses by his fighters, but disputed the scale of atrocities.

An international convention known colloquially as the “Genocide Convention” – adopted in 1948, three years after the end of World War II and the Holocaust – sets out five criteria to assess whether genocide has taken place.

They are: killing members of a group; causing its members serious bodily or mental harm; imposing measures aimed to prevent births in the group; deliberately inflicting conditions calculated to bring about the “physical destruction” of the group; and forcibly transferring its children to another group.

The fact-finding team, which doesn't have final say on the matter, said it found at least three of those five were met in the actions of the RSF. Under the convention, a genocide determination could be made even if only one of the five were met.

The RSF acts in El-Fasher included killing members of a protected ethnic group; causing serious bodily and mental harm; and deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the group’s physical destruction in whole or in part – all core elements of the crime of genocide under international law, according to the fact-finding team.

The report cited a systematic pattern of ethnically targeted killings, sexual violence and destruction and public statements explicitly calling for the elimination of non-Arab communities.

Team chair Mohamed Chande Othman, a former chief justice of Tanzania , said the RSF operation were not “random excesses of war” but pointed to a planned and organised operation that bore the characteristics of genocide.

El-Fasher's residents were "physically exhausted, malnourished, and in part unable to flee, leaving them defenseless against the extreme violence that followed", the team's report said. “Thousands of persons, particularly the Zaghawa, were killed, raped or disappeared during three days of absolute horror.”

The fact-finding mission pointed to mass killings, widespread rape, sexual violence, torture and cruel treatment, arbitrary detention , extortion, and enforced disappearances during RSF's takeover of El-Fasher in October.

The report documented cases of survivors quoting its fighters as saying things like: “Is there anyone Zaghawa among you? If we find Zaghawa, we will kill them all” and “We want to eliminate anything black from Darfur.”

The report pointed to “selective targeting” of Zaghawa and Fur women and girls, “while women perceived as Arab were often spared".

British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called the report's findings “truly horrific” and said she would take it to the UN Security Council to “ensure that the voices of women of Sudan who have endured so much are heard by the world".

“Today’s report describes the most unimaginable and chilling horrors,” she said. “The world is still failing the people of Sudan. When the stories started to emerge about the horrors of El-Fasher it should have been a turning point, but the violence is continuing.”

The fact-finding team was created in 2023 by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, the UN's leading human rights body, which has 47 member countries drawn from membership in the world body.

The team called for accountability for perpetrators and warned that protection of civilians is needed “more than ever” because the conflict is expanding to other regions in Sudan.

Over the course of the conflict, the warring parties were accused of violating international law. But most of the atrocities were blamed on the RSF: The Biden administration, in one of its last decisions, said the paramilitary force committed genocide in Darfur.

UN experts and rights groups says the RSF has had the backing of the United Arab Emirates over the course of the war, allegations that the UAE denies.

The RSF grew out of the Janjaweed militias, notorious for atrocities they committed in the early 2000s in a ruthless campaign in Darfur that killed some 300,000 people and drove 2.7 million from their homes.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 16:53:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0f7819c4-d33e-11f0-af4a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25338425104951.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French prosecutor seeks homicide charges in killing of far-right activist Quentin Deranque</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260219-french-prosecutor-seeks-homicide-charges-in-killing-of-far-right-activist-quentin-deranque</link><description>A French prosecutor on Thursday sought homicide charges against seven suspects in the fatal beating of a far-right activist that has fuelled political anger beyond France 's borders, prompting President Emmanuel Macron to tell Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni to keep out of French affairs.

Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a far-right protest in Lyon on February 12. Most of the 11 suspects who had been detained are from far-left movements.

Prosecutor Thierry Dran told a press conference he had requested "intentional homicide" charges against seven men and recommended they remain in custody to avoid any "disturbance to public order".

The killing has fuelled political tensions ahead of municipal elections in March and France's 2027 presidential race, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet at winning the top job.

On Wednesday, Italy's far-right leader Meloni said the killing of Deranque was "a wound for all of Europe".

Macron said there was no place in France "for movements that adopt and legitimise violence" and called on all political parties to "clean up" their act.

"Nothing can justify violent action – neither on one side nor the other, and not even in a head-to-head confrontation that is deadly for the republic."

Macron also suggested that everyone must "stay in their own lane", after Meloni lamented "a climate of ideological hatred".

"I'm always struck by the fact that people who are nationalists – who don't want anyone bothering them at home – are always the first to comment on what's happening elsewhere," Macron said, while on a visit to New Delhi.

Italy's foreign minister hit back saying the killing of the French activist "is a serious matter that concerns us all".

Antonio Tajani said on X there had been similar incidents in Italy's history, and that condemning such violence aims "to ensure that we do not return to a terrible past".

He said "there have been many Quentins in Italy, some during the darkest periods of the Republic".

Macron is "closely monitoring" events, a member of his team said Thursday. "We must avoid any spiral of violence."

Eleven people – eight men and three women – were taken into custody over the killing.

Lyon prosecutor Dran said that of the seven men who could be charged with homicide, two have refused to speak while in custody.

Others have acknowledged being at the scene and "some admit to having struck blows", but he added, they all dispute having had any homicidal intent.

Four suspects have been released, but more are being sought, Dran said.

Among those originally detained are two parliamentary assistants to Raphael Arnault, a member of parliament from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party, as well as a former intern.

A lawyer for Deranque's parents said they called "for calm and restraint".

"The family condemns any call for violence. Any form of political violence," Fabien Rajon told broadcaster RTL.

In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron's supporters and the left, including the hard-left, joined forces in an effort to bar the far-right from power.

But following Deranque's killing some high-profile politicians sought to distance themselves from the hard-left, ruling out any possible futue alliance.

Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin called on Arnault to "draw the consequences" if the judiciary "finds serious and consistent evidence concerning him or the aides he hired".

LFI party coordinator Manuel Bompard said that Arnault would "certainly not" be suspended or excluded from the LFI group in the National Assembly lower house.

An anti-immigration collective called Nemesis has blamed the killing of the activist on an anti-fascist youth group called La Jeune Garde (Young Guard) co-founded by Arnault before he was elected to parliament.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 17:50:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/44582296-0c4c-11f1-8e47-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-17T191857Z-1656756551-RC2DMJALO8OL-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-BEATING-CRIME.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No, this video does not prove Israel used a thermobaric bomb in Gaza</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260219-video-israel-thermobaric-bomb-gaza-debunked</link><description>A spectacular shockwave followed by a massive plume of black smoke. A video viewed more than 8 million times on X reportedly reveals Israel 's use of "thermobaric and pressure bombs" in Gaza . The post was shared by China Pulse, a pro-Beijing account which was recently flagged for spreading disinformation .

"These bombs, which burn at a temperature of 3,500 degrees Celsius, are capable of killing thousands in seconds, leaving no trace," the post reads.

The FRANCE 24 Observers team had already worked on this video in November 2025 . At the time, online users were claiming that the video was showing the explosion of a "miniature nuclear bomb" in Gaza.

Our team spoke with several experts and found that the footage actually shows a controlled ground-level explosion using conventional explosives to destroy a tunnel dug by Hamas .

As for the recent allegations, Trevor Ball, a conflict researcher with the online investigative site Bellingcat, said on X that "there's nothing that indicates this is thermobaric".

Gilles Denglos, an explosives expert accredited by the French courts, told our team that the video likely shows a conventional explosive device. "Social media users are talking nonsense. A thermobaric bomb is designed to detonate above the ground, not on it." Denglos said the video shows the explosion of "a significant charge on the ground".

Another weapons expert who spoke to our team on the condition of anonymity also said that the spectacular shockwave visible in the video was the result of a "completely conventional" explosion:

"This phenomenon is a ‘Wilson cloud’: a condensation cloud that can occur when the shockwave from an explosion passes through humid air. This effect occurs regardless of the specific type of explosive used."

The expert further explained: "Thermobaric bombs are weapons whose lethality stems from the combined impact of heat and overpressure [Editor’s note: the bomb’s heat and the resulting shockwave]. This distinguishes them from munitions whose lethality relies on flying metallic fragments, such as conventional high-explosive shells or defensive grenades."

These allegations against Israel come in the wake of an Al Jazeera investigation published on February 10, which claims the Israeli forces deployed “thermal” and "thermobaric" weapons in Gaza. According to the report, the intensity of the strikes "made thousands of Palestinians evaporate".

The investigation indicates that the Civil Defence agency in Gaza, which operates as a rescue force under Hamas authorities, has documented 2,842 Palestinians who have "evaporated" since the war began.

However, the Israeli military's alleged use of thermobaric bombs in Gaza remains a subject of debate.

According to the fact-checking outlet Snopes , which reviewed Al Jazeera’s investigation, it is currently impossible to independently verify the use of such weapons based on the information available at this stage.

We spoke to Michael Shurkin, programme director at the US consulting firm 14 North Strategies, who said the specific model of thermobaric weapons that could be available to the Israeli military for its bombing operations remains unknown. "There is no evidence that the Israeli army has used thermobaric weapons in Gaza. They may have, or they may not have; Al Jazeera provides no concrete proof," Shurkin told us.

In this investigation, Al Jazeera identifies several types of bombs used by the Israeli army: MK-84 900kg bombs, BLU-109 bunker busters, and GBU-39 glide bombs. According to official military specifications, none of these models currently in the Israeli arsenal are equipped with thermobaric explosives, Trevor Ball indicated on X .

"The aerial bombs mentioned in the Al Jazeera article are all loaded with aluminised explosives – compositions where the addition of aluminium enhances the blast effect by raising the temperature of the resulting combustion gases. However, the use of aluminium is extremely common in explosive devices for artillery, aerial bombs, and naval munitions," noted the weapons expert.

Due to their sheer power, these bombs are indeed capable of disintegrating bodies. However, this is a "common effect" of aerial bombs and not exclusive to thermobaric weapons, the expert said. Nevertheless, Amnesty International has denounced the Israeli military's use of MK-84 bombs in "deliberate" or "indiscriminate" strikes on residential areas and civilian infrastructure in Gaza as a violation of international law .

According to figures released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health and accepted by the Israeli army , 72,045 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as of January 29.

The Ninth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea "opened with great ceremony in Pyongyang " on Thursday, the Korean Central News Agency said.

The congress is the ruling party's top gathering, a grand political set-piece that reinforces the regime's authority and can serve as a platform for announcements of policy shifts or elite personnel changes.

Since the 2021 event, North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear arsenal, repeatedly test-launching intercontinental ballistic missiles in defiance of bans ordered by the UN Security Council.

Pyongyang has also developed deep ties with Moscow during its war in Ukraine, with North Korean soldiers sent to fight alongside Russian forces.

In 2024, the two countries signed a treaty including a mutual defence clause.

Pyongyang's leader Kim Jong Un touted a newly built street of flats for families of soldiers killed supporting Russia's war against Ukraine, state media reported Monday.

Observers have been scouring satellite imagery for any signs of the vast military parades that have marked previous gatherings.

Any parade will be closely watched for signs of a shift in North Korea's military bearing.

Pyongyang has used previous processions to show off its newest and most potent weapons, a rare source of insight into the strength of its armed forces.

At the previous congress five years ago, Kim declared that the United States was his nation's "biggest enemy".

There is keen interest in whether he might soften this stance, or double down.

US President Donald Trump stepped up his courtship of Kim during a tour of Asia last year, saying he was "100 percent" open to a meeting.

He even bucked decades of US policy by conceding that North Korea was "sort of a nuclear power".

But Kim has so far refused to take the bait.

Kim appeared alongside China's Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin at a grand military parade in Beijing last year -- a striking display of his powerful friends and elevated status in global politics.

North Korea's economy has for years languished under heavy Western sanctions on everything from oil to seafood, measures that aim to choke off funding for its nuclear weapons programme.

Late last month, Kim oversaw the test launch of missiles from a multiple rocket launcher and said that "next-stage plans for further bolstering up the country's nuclear war deterrent" would be clarified at the upcoming party congress.

Kim was accompanied at the test by his daughter Ju Ae, believed to be his likely successor.

Close attention will be paid to whether Ju Ae will be given any official party titles at this year's congress.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:56:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2a29d514-0de5-11f1-bc47-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-19T221117Z-1945670672-RC29PJAYB5XI-RTRMADP-3-NORTHKOREA-POLITICS-CONGRESS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump sets Iran nuclear deal deadline, Tehran threatens retaliation against US bases</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260219-trump-iran-nuclear-deal-deadline-tehran-threatens-retaliation-us-bases</link><description>President Donald Trump warned Iran on Thursday it must make a deal over its nuclear program or "really bad things" will happen, and set a deadline of 10 to 15 days, drawing a threat from Tehran to retaliate against US bases in the region if attacked.

Amid a massive US military buildup in the Middle East that has fueled fears of a wider war, Trump said negotiations with Iran to end the tense standoff were ​going well but demanded that Tehran ‌reach a "meaningful" agreement.

"Otherwise bad things happen," Trump, who has repeatedly threatened to attack Iran, told the first meeting of his Board of Peace in Washington.

Trump spoke of the ⁠US airstrikes carried out in June , saying Iran's nuclear potential had been "decimated," adding "we may have to take it a step further or we may not."

"You’ll be finding out over the next probably 10 days," he said. Asked later to elaborate, he told reporters aboard Air Force One: "I would think that would be ‌enough time, 10, 15 days, pretty much maximum.”

But he declined to be specific, except to warn again of "really bad things" and insist that Iran would have ⁠to make a deal one way or another.

In a letter to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres , Tehran said it would not start any war but that "in the event that it is subjected to military aggression, Iran will respond decisively and proportionately" in its exercise of the right of self-defense.

"All bases, facilities, and assets of the hostile force in the region would constitute legitimate targets," the letter said. "The ​United States would bear full and direct responsibility for any unpredictable and uncontrolled consequences."

Trump's threats to bomb Iran, with the two sides far apart in talks ‌on Tehran's nuclear program, have pushed up oil prices, and a Russian corvette warship on Thursday joined planned Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, a vital sea route for global energy.

Iranian and US negotiators met on Tuesday and Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said they had agreed on "guiding principles." White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday, however, that the two sides remained apart on some issues.

Trump said "good talks are being had," and a senior US official said ‌Iran would make a written proposal on how to address US concerns.

Trump called on Tehran to join the US on the "path to peace."

"They can't have a nuclear weapon, it's very simple," he said. "You can't have peace in the Middle East if they have a nuclear weapon."

Iran has resisted making major concessions on ​its nuclear program, though insisting it is for peaceful purposes.

The US and Israel in the past have accused Tehran of trying to develop a nuclear bomb.

Trump's latest saber-rattling came as he talked himself up as a man of peace in a long, meandering speech while hosting world leaders at the launch of his Board of Peace.

He proposed the body in September when he announced his plan to end ​Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza.

He later expanded the board's remit to tackle conflicts worldwide, prompting many key Western allies to stay away.

Earlier on Thursday, Russia warned against an "unprecedentedescalation of tension" around Iran on Thursday ​and urged restraint amid the US military buildup in the region, which a senior American official said should be complete by mid-March.

Trump has ​sent aircraft carriers, warships and jets to the region , raising the prospect of another attack on the Islamic Republic. The United States and Israel bombed Iran's nuclear facilities and some military sites last June.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to discuss Iran on February 28, the senior ​US official said.

Washington wants Iran to entirely give up uranium enrichment, a process used to create fuel for atomic power plants but that can also provide material for a warhead.

The US and ally Israel also want Iran to give up long-range ballistic missiles, stop supporting groups around the Middle East and stop using force to quell internal protests.

Iran says it refuses to discuss issues beyond the atomic file, calling efforts to limit its missile arsenal a red line.

Satellite pictures have tracked both Iranian work to repair and fortify sites since last summer, showing work at both nuclear and missile sites, as well as preparations at US bases across the Middle East over the ⁠past month.

Iran's joint exercise with Russia came days into an extended series of Iranian naval drills in the Gulf of Oman, with Iranian state television showing special forces units deployed on helicopters and ships.

In a sign of growing concern over the increased tensions, Poland on ⁠Thursday became the latest European country to ​urge its citizens to leave Iran, with Prime Minister Donald Tusk saying Poles may only have hours to evacuate.

Trump began threatening strikes on Iran again in January as Iranian authorities crushed widespread protests with deadly violence that left thousands dead across the country.</description><pubDate>Thu, 19 Feb 2026 23:56:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/419273bc-0d88-11f1-ae3c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-15T191334Z-2131885363-RC27GJAF9QQI-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-CRISIS-USA-CARRIER.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Global leaders to present joint approach to AI at India summit close</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260220-global-leaders-joint-approach-ai-india-summit</link><description>Dozens of world leaders and ministers are expected to deliver on Friday a shared view of how to handle artificial intelligence , wrapping up a five-day summit focused on the technology.

Frenzied demand for generative AI has turbocharged profits for companies, while also fuelling fears about the impact on society and the planet.

Altman, CEO of the company behind ChatGPT, has called for oversight in the past but said last year that taking too tight an approach could hold the United States back in the AI race.

"Centralisation of this technology, in one company or country, could lead to ruin," the 40-year-old said on Thursday.

"This is not to suggest that we won't need any regulation or safeguards. We obviously do, urgently, like we have for other powerful technologies."

India's AI Impact Summit is the fourth annual gathering to discuss the risks and opportunities posed by rapidly advancing computing power.

It is the largest yet and the first in a developing country, with India taking the opportunity to push its ambitions to catch up with the United States and China.

India expects more than $200 billion in investments over the next two years, and US tech titans unveiled new deals and infrastructure projects this week.

Many say stronger action is needed to combat emerging issues, such as job disruption, online abuse and the electricity demands of data centres.

But the broad focus of the New Delhi event, and vague promises made at the previous summits in France, South Korea and Britain, could make concrete commitments unlikely.

Even so, "governance of powerful technologies typically begins with shared language: what risks matter, what thresholds are unacceptable", said Niki Iliadis, director of global AI governance at The Future Society.

"It's true that AI companies are influential, but they are not sovereign," she told AFP.

Discussions at the Delhi summit, attended by tens of thousands from across the AI industry, including top tech CEOs, have covered big topics from child protections to job losses and the need for more equal access to AI tools worldwide.

"We are entering an era where humans and intelligence systems co-create, co-work and co-evolve," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday.

"We must resolve that AI is used for the global common good."

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called on tech tycoons to support a $3 billion global fund to boost AI skills and make computing power more affordable.

"The future of AI cannot be decided by a handful of countries -- or left to the whims of a few billionaires," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 02:22:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/590d52a2-0dfe-11f1-ac41-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/36abf432494e942cb570df4a4f19d300e724c1f8.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela approves amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260220-venezuela-approves-amnesty-law-free-hundreds-political-prisoners</link><description>Venezuela 's National Assembly on Thursday unanimously approved a long-awaited amnesty law that could free hundreds of political prisoners jailed for being government detractors.

But the law excludes those who have been prosecuted or convicted of promoting military action against the country -- which could include opposition leaders like Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado , who has been accused by the ruling party of calling for international intervention like the one that ousted former president Nicolas Maduro.

The bill now goes before interim president Delcy Rodriguez, who pushed for the legislation under pressure from Washington, after she rose to power following Maduro's capture during a US military raid on January 3.

The law is meant to apply retroactively to 1999 -- including the coup against previous leader Hugo Chavez, the 2002 oil strike, and the 2024 riots against Maduro's disputed reelection -- giving hope to families that loved ones will finally come home.

Some fear, however, the law could be used by the government to pardon its own and selectively deny freedom to real prisoners of conscience.

Article 9 of the bill lists those excluded from amnesty as "persons who are being prosecuted or may be convicted for promoting, instigating, soliciting, invoking, favoring, facilitating, financing or participating in armed actions or the use of force against the people, sovereignty, and territorial integrity" of Venezuela "by foreign states, corporations or individuals."

Venezuela's National Assembly had delayed several sittings meant to pass the amnesty bill.

"The scope of the law must be restricted to victims of human rights violations and expressly exclude those accused of serious human rights violations and crimes against humanity, including state, paramilitary and non-state actors," UN human rights experts said in a statement from Geneva Thursday.

Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Venezuelans have been jailed in recent years over plots, real or imagined, to overthrow the government of Rodriguez's predecessor and former boss Maduro, who was in the end toppled in the deadly US military raid.

Family members have reported torture, maltreatment and untreated health problems among the inmates.

The NGO Foro Penal says about 450 prisoners have been released since Maduro's ouster, but more than 600 others remain behind bars.

Family members have been clamoring for their release for weeks, holding vigils outside prisons.

One small group, in the capital Caracas, staged a nearly weeklong hunger strike which ended Thursday.

"The National Assembly has the opportunity to show whether there truly is a genuine will for national reconciliation," Foro Penal director Gonzalo Himiob wrote on X Thursday ahead of the vote.

On Wednesday, the chief of the US military command responsible for strikes on alleged drug smuggling boats off South America held talks in Caracas with Rodriguez and top ministers Vladimir Padrino (defense) and Diosdado Cabello (interior).

All three were staunch Maduro backers who for years echoed his "anti-imperialist" rhetoric.

Rodriguez's interim government has been governing with US President Donald Trump's consent, provided she grants access to Venezuela's vast oil resources.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 02:22:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2e525b08-0849-11f1-89fb-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26043693083641.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Argentina's striking workers clash with police over Milei labor reforms</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260220-argentina-striking-workers-police-milei-labor-reforms</link><description>Shops and supermarkets closed, flights were canceled and garbage piled up Thursday as Argentine workers staged their fourth general strike of President Javier Milei 's term, some clashing with police.

The few buses running in Buenos Aires were nowhere near full, although car traffic was unusually heavy as many workers observed the 24-hour strike against a contentious labor reform.

Dozens of flights were canceled and train stations were left deserted with only a handful of buses running, AFP observed.

On roads leading into the capital, small groups of protesters blocked traffic.

Later in the day, several thousand demonstrators gathered outside parliament, where a few dozen participants engaged in running battles with police, throwing bottles and stones.

Officers replied with tear gas, water cannons and rubber bullets to clear the area.

Police were observed making about a dozen arrests.

The CGT labor federation said more workers adhered to the walkout call than during any of the previous three strikes.

"It has levels of compliance like never before under this government," union leader Jorge Sola told Radio con Vos, claiming that "90 percent of activity had stopped."

The contested reforms pushed by budget-slashing Milei, an ideological ally of US President Donald Trump, would make it easier to hire and fire workers in a country where job security is already hard to come by.

It would also reduce severance pay, limit the right to strike, increase work hours and restrict holiday provisions.

The measure was approved by the senate last week and is meant to come before the chamber of deputies Thursday.

If approved, it will go back to the Senate for a final green light.

"I want to work because I am afraid of losing my job but I cannot get there. I will have to walk," Nora Benitez, a 46-year-old home caregiver, said ahead of a five kilometer (three mile) trek to her job along streets reeking of uncollected garbage.

The labor action comes as Argentina's economy is showing signs of a downturn in manufacturing, with more than 21,000 companies having shuttered in two years under Milei.

He had come to power after wielding a chainsaw at rallies during the 2023 election campaign to symbolize the deep cuts he planned to make to public spending.

Unions say some 300,000 jobs have been lost since Milei's austerity measures began.

Most recently, Fate -- Argentina's main tire factory -- on Wednesday announced the closure of its plant in Buenos Aires, prompting some 900 job cuts.

The last general strike in Argentina was on April 10, 2025, but adherence was uneven as workers in the public transport system did not join.

Last week, thousands of people demonstrated in Buenos Aires as senators debated the reform bill, and clashes with police resulted in about 30 arrests.

On Tuesday, the government issued an unusual statement warning reporters about the "risk" of covering protests, and announced it would establish an "exclusive zone" from which the media can work.

"In the event of acts of violence, our forces will act," a statement from the security ministry said.

Almost 40 percent of Argentine workers lack formal employment contracts, and unions say the new measures will make matters worse.

But the government argues they will in fact reduce under-the-table employment and create new jobs by lowering the tax burden on employers.

Milei, in office since December 2023, has achieved at least one of his macroeconomic goals: bringing annual inflation down from 150 percent to 32 percent in two years.

But it is a success that has come at the cost of massive public sector job cuts and a drop in disposable income that has sapped consumption and economic activity.

Milei will follow Thursday's events at home from Washington, where he attended the first meeting of Trump's "Board of Peace," which has drawn criticism as an attempt to rival the United Nations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 02:22:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1805fffa-0df1-11f1-8ff7-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-19T221650Z-1279702143-RC24PJA9XFC6-RTRMADP-3-ARGENTINA-POLITICS-LABOR-REFORM.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Grey's Anatomy' star Eric Dane dies at 53 after ALS battle</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260220-eric-dane-grey-s-anatomy-star-dies-at-53-after-als-battle</link><description>Eric Dane, the celebrated actor best known for his roles on “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Euphoria” and who later in life became advocate for ALS awareness, died Thursday. He was 53.

His representatives said Dane died from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known also as Lou Gehrig’s disease, less than a year after he announced his diagnosis.

“He spent his final days surrounded by dear friends, his devoted wife, and his two beautiful daughters, Billie and Georgia, who were the center of his world,” said a statement that requested privacy for his family. “Throughout his journey with ALS, Eric became a passionate advocate for awareness and research, determined to make a difference for others facing the same fight. He will be deeply missed, and lovingly remembered always. Eric adored his fans and is forever grateful for the outpouring of love and support he’s received.”

Dane was born on November 9, 1972 and raised in California. His father, a Navy man, died of a gunshot wound when he was 7. After high school, he moved to Los Angeles to purse acting, landing guest roles on shows like “Saved by the Bell,” “Married...With Children,” “Charmed” and “X-Men: the Last Stand," and one season of the short-lived medical drama “Gideon's Crossing.”

His big break arrived in the mid-2000s, when he was cast as Dr. Mark Sloan, a.k.a. McSteamy, on the ABC medical drama “Grey’s Anatomy,” a role he would play from 2006 until 2012 and reprise in 2021. In 2019, he did a complete 180 and became Cal Jacobs, a troubled married man, in HBO's provocative drama, “Euphoria,” a role he continued in up until his death.

Dane also starred as Tom Chandler, the captain of a US Navy destroyer at sea after a global catastrophe wiped out most of the world’s population, in the TNT drama “The Last Ship.” In 2017, production was halted as Dane battled depression.

In April 2025, Dane announced he had been diagnosed with ALS, a progressive disease that attacks nerve cells controlling muscles throughout the body.

ALS gradually destroys the nerve cells and connections needed to walk, talk, speak and breathe. Most patients die within three to five years of a diagnosis.

Dane became an advocate for ALS awareness, speaking a news conference in Washington on health insurance prior authorisation. “Some of you may know me from TV shows, such as “Grey's Anatomy,” which I play a doctor. But I am here today to speak briefly as a patient battling ALS," he said in June 2025. In September of that year, the ALS Network named Dane the recipient of their advocate of the year award, recognizing his commitment to raising awareness and support for people living with ALS.

A memoir by Dane is scheduled to be published in 2026. “Book of Days: A Memoir in Moments” will be released by Maria Shriver’s The Open Field, a Penguin Random House imprint. According to Open Field, Dane will look back upon key moments in his life, from his first day at work on “Grey’s Anatomy” to the births of his two daughters and learning that he has ALS.

“I want to capture the moments that shaped me — the beautiful days, the hard ones, the ones I never took for granted — so that if nothing else, people who read it will remember what it means to live with heart," Dane said in a statement around the book's announcement. "If sharing this helps someone find meaning in their own days, then my story is worth telling.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 04:26:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5c4a4120-0e06-11f1-81a0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26051089335678.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran warns US bases, assets 'legitimate targets' if it attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260220-live-iran-warns-us-bases-assets-legitimate-targets-if-it-attacks</link><description>President Donald Trump has given Iran 10 to 15 days to make a “meaningful” nuclear deal. But Barbara Slavin from the Washington DC-based Stimson Center says a breakthrough in the latest talks, which began in Oman on February 6, is unlikely since the US terms are “completely unacceptable” to Iran.

“The Iranians could postpone or have a moratorium on uranium enrichment for a few years,” said Slavin. “But they will not give up what they consider to be their right to enrich uranium on their own soil. That's something that they have always refused to do.”

Responding to a report that Trump is weighing an initial strike on Iran, Slavin says the US goal in Iran remains unclear. “The United States is not going to be able to bring regime change from the air. It's not going to be able to destroy all of Iran's missile facilities or its relationship with proxies. I'm very worried that groups like the Houthis will begin to attack shipping in the Red Sea again,” she said. “We will see other responses from other Iran-backed groups and this could rapidly escalate. Trump doesn't like long wars, so I hope he knows what he is doing.”

Iran on Thursday warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be "legitimate targets" if the United States follows through on its military threats and attacks.

Amir Saeid Iravani, the Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, made the remarks in a letter to UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and the president of the Security Council that was seen by AFP.

President Donald Trump has deployed warships, fighter jets and other military hardware to the Middle East as he seeks to block Iran from building a nuclear bomb, something Tehran says it is not pursuing.

The letter cited a social media post by Trump on Wednesday, where he said the United States may need to use UK military bases, including one on an Indian Ocean island, "should Iran decide not to make a deal."

"Such a belligerent statement by the President of the United States...signals a real risk of military aggression, the consequences of which would be catastrophic for the region and would constitute a grave threat to international peace and security," Iravani wrote in the letter.

US President Donald Trump said Thursday he believes 10 to 15 days is “enough time” for Iran to reach a deal. But the talks have been deadlocked for years, and Iran has refused to discuss wider US and Israeli demands that it scale back its missile program and sever ties to armed groups.

Iran has agreed to draw up a written proposal to address US concerns raised during this week’s indirect nuclear talks in Geneva, according to a senior US official who was not authorised to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 06:57:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d2132c36-0e02-11f1-8ad5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/683f2e39dcacc8b6666b3bda3377c7e2cbcb5fa3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heads roll in Europe over Epstein files while US justice declines to act</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260220-former-prince-andrew-s-arrest-sparks-calls-for-justice-in-epstein-case-in-us</link><description>The arrest of former prince Andrew has underlined the striking contrast between Europe , where high-profile, powerful people are being held to account over their links to Jeffrey Epstein , and the United States, where the fallout has been limited.

Only one person has been arrested or convicted in the United States in connection with the activities of the late sex offender – Ghislaine Maxwell , Epstein's ex-girlfriend and accomplice.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being found guilty in 2021 of providing minor girls to the wealthy financier, who died in a New York jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking.

Epstein cultivated a global network of powerful politicians, business executives, academics and celebrities – many of whom have been tainted by their association with him.

A number of prominent Americans – from former president Bill Clinton to Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates – have had their reputations damaged by their friendships with Epstein, but no one other than Maxwell has faced legal consequences.

And a top US Justice Department official suggested recently that no prosecutions may be forthcoming.

"In July the Department of Justice said that we had reviewed the quote Epstein files and there was nothing in there that allowed us to prosecute anybody," Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche told CNN.

"And that's where we remain for what we've seen and what we've released from the Epstein files," said Blanche, who is also President Donald Trump 's former personal attorney.

That explanation has not satisfied a number of US lawmakers, both Republicans and Democrats, who accuse the Trump Justice Department of dragging its feet.

"The UK has officially done more to prosecute Epstein predators than our own government. Shameful," Representative Nancy Mace, a Republican from South Carolina, said on X.

"A nation that allows the powerful to escape justice is not a nation of laws," Mace said. "It is a nation of exceptions. And the exceptions always seem to apply to the same people."

Another Republican lawmaker, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, welcomed Andrew's arrest but said "now we need justice in the United States".

"It's time for @AGPamBondi and @FBIDirectorKash to act!" Massie said on X, referring to Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel .

Senator Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat, blamed the lack of accountability in the United States squarely on Trump, who was once a close friend of Epstein and moved in the same social circles in Florida and New York.

"Countries across the world are holding their Epstein class accountable," Gallego said on X. "It isn't happening in America because we have a pedo protector in the Oval Office running a government coverup for him and his friends."

Trump fought for months to prevent release of the Epstein files but eventually signed the law passed by Congress requiring their publication. The 79-year-old Republican's name appears in the files repeatedly but he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.

Trump's right-wing base has long been obsessed with the Epstein saga, and the belief the financier oversaw a sex trafficking ring for the world's elite.

Trump was asked Thursday if any Epstein associates in the United States will "wind up in handcuffs".

The president sidestepped the question, reiterating his claim that he personally has been "totally exonerated". He called Andrew's arrest a "very sad thing".

A Reuters/Ipsos poll published this week found a majority of Americans – 53 percent – say the Epstein files have "lowered their trust in the country's political and business leaders".

Sixty-nine percent told pollsters the Epstein files "show that powerful people in the US are rarely held accountable for their actions".

While there have been no prosecutions beyond Maxwell, several prominent Americans have resigned from high-profile positions after the files revealed they maintained relations with Epstein after his 2008 conviction for sex offenses.

Former US treasury secretary Larry Summers resigned from the board of the OpenAI foundation, and billionaire Thomas Pritzker left the executive chairmanship of Hyatt hotels.

"Based on the tremendous interest shown, I will be directing the Secretary of War, and other relevant Departments and Agencies, to begin the process of identifying and releasing Government files related to alien and extraterrestrial life, unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP), and unidentified flying objects (UFOs)," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.

While he did not specify whether classified documents would be released to the public, Trump added that the files should include "any and all other information connected to these highly complex, but extremely interesting and important, matters".

Earlier in the day the Republican president claimed that one of his Democratic predecessors, Barack Obama , had revealed "classified" information in his recent viral podcast remarks about the existence of extraterrestrial life.

"They're real, but I haven't seen them and they're not being kept in... Area 51," Obama told host Brian Tyler Cohen, referring to the top-secret US military facility in Nevada at the heart of many UFO conspiracy theories.

"There's no underground facility. Unless, there's this enormous conspiracy and they hid it from the president of the United States."

Asked on Thursday about the comments, Trump told reporters that Obama "gave classified information, he is not supposed to be doing that".

The president did not specify what part of Obama's remarks were classified, but claimed "he made a big mistake".

For his own beliefs about aliens, Trump, 79, said "I don't know if they are real or not."

No evidence has been produced of intelligent life beyond Earth.

Interest in UFOs and UAP has been renewed in recent years as the US government probed numerous reports of seemingly supernatural aircraft, amid worries that adversaries could be testing highly advanced technologies.

In March 2024, the Pentagon released a report saying it had no proof that UAP were alien technology, with many suspicious sightings turning out to be merely weather balloons, spy planes, satellites and other normal activity.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 09:41:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/280f72d6-0e3d-11f1-9ab3-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/UFO-files.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US ‘totally’ rejects global AI governance, White House adviser tells India summit</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260220-us-totally-rejects-global-ai-governance-white-house-adviser-tells-india-summit</link><description>White House technology adviser Michael Kratsios said Friday that the United States "totally" rejects global governance of artificial intelligence .

Kratsios, head of the country's delegation to a major AI summit in New Delhi, made the comments ahead of an expected leaders' statement setting out a shared vision on how to handle the divisive technology.

"As the Trump Administration has now said many times: We totally reject global governance of AI," he said at the summit, which draws to a close on Friday.

"AI adoption cannot lead to a brighter future if it is subject to bureaucracies and centralised control."

On Friday morning, UN chief Antonio Guterres had said that a new expert panel convened by the global body aimed to "make human control a technical reality".

The advisory group – aiming to be to AI what the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is to global warming – was created in August, and its 40 members have now been confirmed, Guterres said.

The AI Impact Summit is the fourth annual international gathering focused on the risks and opportunities presented by advanced computing power.

At last year's edition in Paris, US Vice President JD Vance warned against "excessive regulation" that "could kill a transformative sector".

In New Delhi, Kratsios said that "international discussion of AI has evolved, as this summit itself attests", noting the change of the meeting's name from "AI Safety" to "AI Impact".

"This is clearly a positive development," but "too many international forums, such as the UN's Global Dialogue on AI Governance, maintain a general atmosphere of fear", he said.

"We must replace that fear with hope," Kratsios added, saying that AI has the potential to "advance human flourishing and drive unprecedented prosperity".

He argued that "ideological, risk-focused obsessions, such as climate or equity, become excuses for bureaucratic management and centralisation".

"In the name of safety, they increase the danger that these tools will be used for tyrannical control."

"Focusing AI policy on safety and speculative risks... inhibits a competitive ecosystem, entrenches incumbents, and isolates developing countries from full participation in the AI economy," Kratsios said.

His comments came a day after French President Emmanuel Macron told the AI Impact Summit that said he was determined to ensure safe oversight of the fast-evolving technology.

The European Union has led the way for global regulation with its Artificial Intelligence Act , which was adopted in 2024 and is coming into force in phases.

"We are determined to continue to shape the rules of the game ... with our allies such as India," Macron said in New Delhi .

"Europe is not blindly focused on regulation – Europe is a space for innovation and investment, but it is a safe space," Macron said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 10:37:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1ad293ca-0e40-11f1-bd6d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26048246725422.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: US Supreme Court strikes down Trump's sweeping 'reciprocal' tariffs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260220-us-supreme-court-strikes-down-trump-s-sweeping-tariffs-upending-cornerstone-of-economic-agenda</link><description>Britain expects ​its privileged trading position ​with the United States to continue after a US ​Supreme ‌Court ⁠ruling struck down President ‌Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, the ⁠government said on Friday.

"The UK enjoys the ​lowest reciprocal ‌tariffs globally, and under any scenario we expect ‌our privileged trading position with ​the US to continue", a British government spokesperson ​said in a statement.

"We ​will work with ​the (US) Administration to understand how ​the ruling will affect tariffs for the UK and the ⁠rest of the world."

The EU said Friday that it was studying the US Supreme Court ruling that found President Donald Trump exceeded his authority in imposing a swath of tariffs that upended global trade.

"We take note of the ruling... and are analysing it carefully," EU trade spokesman Olof Gill said.

"We remain in close contact with the US Administration as we seek clarity on the steps they intend to take in response to this ruling," he added. "Businesses on both sides of the Atlantic depend on stability and predictability in the trading relationship".

The tariffs decision doesn't stop Trump from imposing duties under other laws. While those have more limitations on the speed and severity of Trump's actions, top administration officials have said they expect to keep the tariff framework in place under other authorities.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to levy tariffs. But the Trump administration argued that a 1977 law allowing the president to regulate importation during emergencies also allows him to set tariffs. Other presidents have used the law dozens of times, often to impose sanctions, but Trump was the first president to invoke it for import taxes.

The Supreme Court struck down President Donald Trump's far-reaching global tariffs on Friday, handing him a significant loss on an issue crucial to his economic agenda.

The 6-3 decision centres on tariffs imposed under an emergency powers law, including the sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs he levied on nearly every other country.

Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries after being attacked by at least six people on the sidelines of a protest against a politician from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party in the southeastern city of Lyon last week.

His death has fomented tensions ahead of municipal elections next month and presidential polls next year, in which the far-right National Rally (RN) party is seen as having its best chance yet at winning the top job.

President Emmanuel Macron – who is serving his last year in office – has said there was no place in France "for movements that adopt and legitimise violence", and urged the far right and hard left to clean up their act.

Deranque's supporters have called for a march in his memory on Saturday in Lyon .

The leftist mayor of Lyon asked the state to ban it, but Interior Minister Laurent Nunez declined to do so.

Nunez said he had planned an "extremely large police deployment" with reinforcements from outside the city to ensure security.

The rally is expected to be attended by 2,000 to 3,000 people, and likely to see counter-protesters from the hard left.

"I can only ban a demonstration when there are major risks of public disorder and I am not in a position to contain them," he told the RTL broadcaster.

"My role is to strike a balance between maintaining public order and freedom of expression."

Jordan Bardella , the president of anti-immigration RN, has urged party members not to go.

"We ask you, except in very specific and strictly supervised local situations ... not to attend these gatherings nor to associate the National Rally with them," he wrote in a message sent to party officials and seen by AFP.

LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard backed the mayor's call for a ban, warning on X it would be a "fascist demonstration" that "over 1,000 neo-Nazis from all over Europe " were expected to attend.

Two people, aged 20 and 25, have been charged with intentional homicide in relation to Deranque's fatal beating, according to the Lyon prosecutor and their lawyers.

A third suspect has been charged with complicity in the killing.

Jacques-Elie Favrot, a 25-year-old former parliamentary assistant to LFI lawmaker Raphael Arnault, has admitted to having been present at the scene but denied delivering the blows that killed Deranque, his attorney said.

Favrot said "it was absolutely not an ambush, but a clash with a group of far-right activists", he added.

Italy 's hard-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Wednesday said the killing of Deranque was "a wound for all of Europe".

Reacting to her comments, Macron said everyone should "stay in their own lane", but Meloni later said that Macron had misinterpreted her comments.

Opinion polls put the far right in the lead for the French presidency in 2027, when Macron will have to step down after the maximum two consecutive terms in office.

In snap parliamentary polls in 2024, Macron's supporters and the left, including the hard left, had allied against the far right.

After the Lyon killing, several voices on the more moderate left have rejected another such alliance with LFI.

Socialist party official Pierre Jouvet on Friday however said its politicians could in rare cases ally with LFI candidates in the second round of municipal elections next month if they reject "political violence".

Former French prime minister Dominique de Villepin late Thursday warned against what he described as France's " Charlie Kirk moment", referring to an ultraconservative activist who was shot and killed in September in the United States.

"It's a moment aimed at delegitimising part of the political spectrum and casting the triumphant far right as a victim," the moderate right-winger wrote on X.

"Let's stay vigilant. Let's not concede ground to the far right."</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 16:54:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ee81b968-0e62-11f1-b43b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/f107c3506cbcdca019a87402c78bc77efe224bb6.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France repatriates stolen colonial-era 'talking drum' to Ivory Coast</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260220-france-repatriates-stolen-colonial-era-talking-drum-to-ivory-coast</link><description>France on Friday handed over a "talking drum" looted by colonial troops from Ivory Coast in 1916 in the latest repatriation of stolen artefacts.

The Djidji Ayokwe drum, more than three metres (10 feet) long and weighing 430 kilos (950 pounds) was used by the Ebrie tribe to transmit messages.

It is one of hundreds of objects France is preparing to send back to Africa , with the efforts set to be accelerated by the passing of a new law to authorise mass repatriations.

"All of Ivory Coast is ready to welcome it," Ivory Coast Culture Minister Françoise Remarck said at a ceremony in Paris with her French counterpart Rachida Dati .

Remarck added that she was "extremely moved" by the "return of this symbol" that is "finally coming back to its homeland".

The drum is to be exhibited permanently in a new museum being built in Ivory Coast's commercial capital Abidjan.

France has been flooded with restitution demands from former colonies such as Algeria , Mali and Benin .

Its national museums hold tens of thousands of artworks and other prized artefacts that were seized or purchased during the colonial era.

European nations are slowly moving to return a limited number of looted artefacts in a bid to build bridges with their former colonies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 17:37:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0b322dba-0e7f-11f1-9640-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-98D64GF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How the death of far-right activist Quentin Deranque became France’s ‘Charlie Kirk moment’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260220-how-the-death-of-far-right-activist-quentin-deranque-became-france-s-charlie-kirk-moment</link><description>If police predictions come true, France’s third-largest city of Lyon will on Saturday witness a thousands-strong march in the city centre bringing together figures from the farthest fringes of Europe’s radical right.

The march, which will take place under a heavy police presence, has been organised in tribute to 23-year-old far-right activist and student Quentin Deranque, who died from his injuries last weekend – two days after being severely beaten in the final moments of a street brawl between ultranationalist and anti-fascist militants.

A parliamentary aide to the hard-left France Unbowed party (La France Insoumise, or LFI) has been charged with complicity in the killing. He denies having been responsible for Deranque's death.

The march – which Deranque’s family will not attend – comes after days of small-scale tributes paid by far-right groups, including a night-time neo-Nazi march in Paris and a series of attacks on LFI's offices. The same night, the capital’s Place de la République was painted in swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans.

While Deranque’s killing has been met with shock across the political spectrum in France, it’s no coincidence that the radical right has used his death as a rallying cry.

Deranque, who had recently converted to Catholicism, was active in far-right identitarian group Audace Lyon and a member of the neo-fascist Allobroges Bourgoin after having previously campaigned for anti-Semitic royalist group Action Française. Last May, he took part in the neo-Nazi May 9 Committee parade in Paris, where black-clad militants marched under flags bearing the white supremacist Celtic cross.

Jordan Bardella , the president of the far-right National Rally (Rassemblement National, or RN), has called on members not to join Saturday’s march, describing the organisers as "unclear". Despite this, Bardella and his party – which polls suggest is well-placed to win the 2027 presidential election – have also rallied around the fatal beating, saying the political left’s “dehumanising” rhetoric had paved the way for fatal far-left violence.

Timothy Peace, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow’s school of social and political sciences, said that the RN had been quick to turn Deranque’s death to its own political advantage.

“The tragedy of this young man’s death offers them the opportunity to paint the left, and LFI in particular, as the main source of political violence in France – and to distance themselves from their own problematic history with extreme and violent street movements,” he said.

Researchers on social violence in France have been quick to emphasise that far-right groups continue to perpetrate the bulk of politically motivated killings, increasingly targeting Muslims , immigrants and Jews as well as left-wing opponents. Sociologist Isabelle Sommier stressed that of the 57 deaths linked to violence between political groups recorded between 1986 and 2017, the radical right had been responsible for all but five.

In a long social media screed Thursday referencing the high-profile assassination last year of a US ultraconservative activist, former prime minister Dominique de Villepin warned that France was in danger of having its own “Charlie Kirk moment”.

"It's a moment aimed at delegitimising part of the political spectrum and casting the triumphant far right as a victim," he wrote. "Let's stay vigilant. Let's not concede ground to the far right."

The brawl that led to Deranque’s death broke out on February 12 in the streets surrounding Sciences Po Lyon’s Institute of Political Studies, where French-Palestinian LFI lawmaker and European parliamentarian Rima Hassan was slated to speak.

Members of the anti-immigration “nationalist feminist” group Némésis came to protest against Hassan, whose outspoken opposition to Israel’s devastating military campaign in Gaza has made her a frequent target of conservatives. The group has claimed that Deranque was present to provide security for the group – something his family denies.

Video footage shows a brief scuffle as counter-protesters tried to snatch a banner carried by Némésis activists, dragging several to the ground – a scuffle from which Deranque appears to have kept his distance.

Instead, the violence that led to the 23-year-old student’s death broke out hundreds of metres away from the university, on the other side of a dark tunnel burrowing under the railway tracks reaching towards the city’s main train station.

The moments leading up to Deranque’s fatal beating are still fiercely debated, with a video published by anti-fascist site Contre-Attaque showing a group of more than a dozen armed and masked ultranationalist militants charging a group of far-left militants at the junction outside the tunnel.

Subsequent footage published by Le Canard Enchaîné shows a fierce clash between a bloc of black-clad far-right militants, some armed with pepper spray, reinforced gloves, a metal crutch and a pyrotechnic flare, and a group of anti-fascist militants, largely in street clothes.

Members of both groups were masked and traded blows. At one point in the video, a far-right militant ignites the pyrotechnic flare and hurls it at the head of one of his opponents. Another blasts the leftists with what seems like pepper spray as his comrades lay into their adversaries with the crutch and an umbrella.

As the antifascist cohort drove their opponents steadily down the street, the far-right militants seem to have broken ranks and fled the scene, leaving a couple of stragglers behind to be knocked to the pavement – Deranque among them. Footage filmed by bystanders show a group of anti-fascist militants punching and kicking him in the head as he lay curled on the ground.

After they scattered, passersby report that Deranque got back to his feet, dazed, and shook off efforts to convince him to go to hospital . Alongside a friend who came back for him, he made his way across Lyon’s twin rivers to the other side of town.

Paramedics picked him up and an hour and a half later more than a kilometre away, his condition sharply deteriorated. He was placed in a medically induced coma on arrival at Édouard-Herriot Hospital and died two days later.

Two young men have been charged with homicide for their alleged role in the fatal beating. A third has been charged with complicity in Deranque’s killing. This man has been identified as Jacques-Elie Favrot – a parliamentary aide to an LFI lawmaker, who has since begun proceedings to put an end to his contract.

Favrot has admitted to being present during the clash, but denied having delivered the blows that killed the young militant.

Seen by researchers as a stronghold for neo-fascists and other far-right fringe groups, Lyon is no stranger to street-fighting. Tristan Boursier, associate researcher at Sciences Po University’s political research centre, said that France’s third city had long been a battleground between far-right groups and left-wing networks of self-proclaimed anti-fascists.

“Lyon has been a recurrent hotspot for far-right/anti-fascist confrontations since the 2010s, partly because far-right groups have tried to build local ‘territorial’ presence – spaces, events, visibility – which have in turn produced sustained counter-mobilisation and cycles of escalation,” he said. “This latest clash fits that longer pattern of localised rivalry where street conflict becomes a form of political signalling.”

Among the more well-known of these anti-fascist groups is La Jeune Garde (“The Young Guard”), which was dissolved by the government last year for its alleged involvement in violent confrontations with far-right groups. The group’s co-founder is Raphaël Arnault – the LFI lawmaker whose former assistant was just charged with complicity in Deranque’s death.

Since the first rumours of its connection to activists suspected of being involved in Deranque's death, LFI has come under heavy fire from politicians on the right, centre and reformist left, with Socialist former president François Hollande calling on the social-democratic party to sever any last lingering ties with the rival group.

LFI leader Jean-Luc Mélenchon , who came third in the 2022 presidential election, condemned the killing while ruling out any cutting of ties with anti-fascist groups.

"Neither death nor violence have any place in political disputes," he said.

But while most parties have concentrated their fire on LFI, the far-right RN party has not been sparing in its blame.

Bardella this week accused French President Emmanuel Macron of bearing a “heavy responsibility” for having “deliberately opened the doors of the National Assembly to the worst thugs of the far left”, as well as lashing out at what he described as the media’s “complacency” with what he described as the threat of left-wing violence.

Going further, he accused the country’s universities of becoming bastions of left-wing indoctrination, calling for the state to identify higher education institutions that had “drifted” and put them under direct “supervision”. He did not give details of what this would look like.

But the young RN president saved his sharpest words for the country’s increasingly divided left. Bardella accused the Young Guard of having served for years as “the left’s armed wing” – a left, he made clear, that extended through LFI to its erstwhile allies in the New Popular Front including the centre-left Socialist Party, the Communist Party and the Greens.

“That wording is a classic attempt to generalise responsibility beyond the individuals questioned by police and onto wider political targets,” Boursier said. “It turns a criminal investigation into a broader political indictment designed to delegitimise LFI’s ecosystem and pressure reformist actors to publicly break with Mélenchon.”

Marta Lorimer, a lecturer at Cardiff University’s School of Law and Politics, said that it was not surprising to see the far right casting blame beyond LFI and onto the country’s wider left.

“These are not just being sold as problems of La France Insoumise,” she said. “More broadly in French politics there’s been this tendency to say, well, these people have allied – therefore, if the moderate left is working with the far left, then automatically all of the left is tainted by association.”

Boursier argued that allegations of left-wing violence had become a common theme among the country’s conservative media – most notably the growing constellation of TV stations and newspapers owned by conservative French billionaire Vincent Bolloré .

“It is also worth noting that such a framing would have been far harder to impose 15 years ago,” he said. “Its effectiveness today reflects a transformed media environment in which certain outlets – notably those within the Groupe Bolloré sphere – have normalised narratives about ‘left-wing violence’ and provided platforms that amplify and legitimise these interpretations. This media ecosystem lowers the cost of generalising blame and accelerates the politicisation of violent events.”

The shockwaves caused by Deranque’s death have not stopped at France’s borders. British far-right figure Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, better known by his adopted name Tommy Robinson, paid tribute to Deranque on social media, repeatedly sharing videos showing far-right French militants vandalising LFI offices.

Flemish far-right group Voorpost called for a march in Brussels to commemorate the activist, before calling it off as it became clear the event would draw counter-protesters. Italy’s hardline conservative Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni slammed what she described as a “climate of ideological hate” , calling Deranque’s death “a wound for all of Europe”.

“The death of Quentin Deranque has offered an opportunity for various groups of the far right across Europe to condemn the left and social movements, in particular anti-fascist movements,” Peace said. “In terms of precedents, a very similar situation occurred after the assassination of Charlie Kirk in the United States. In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s government has recently enacted security measures targeting left-wing protesters, following clashes in Turin. Her administration has framed these measures as necessary to prevent the resurgence of violent, far-left radicalism, referencing the ‘Red Brigades’ and the ‘years of lead era’.”

As of Friday, the shockwaves had rippled to the other side of the Atlantic.

"Violent radical leftism is on the rise and its role in Quentin Deranque's death demonstrates the threat it poses to public safety," the US State Department’s bureau of counter-terrorism posted on social media. Under-secretary for public diplomacy Sarah Rogers said that Washington was watching the case closely.

"Once you decide to kill people for their opinions instead of persuade them, you've opted out of civilisation," she posted.

Boursier said that international right-wing networks had become increasingly quick to share accounts of suspected left-wing violence.

“We are seeing more than isolated reactions. What is emerging resembles what scholars like Cas Mudde describe as a transnational far-right ecosystem – sometimes framed more polemically as an ‘international fascist’ network,” he said. “Over the past decade, the MAGA movement around Donald Trump has helped normalise a political style built on grievance, rapid politicisation of violent events, and the portrayal of opponents as existential enemies. That repertoire has travelled to Europe.”

“What has changed is speed, scale, and synchronisation,” he added. “Social media now allows historically fragmented far-right actors – in France and across Europe – to converge rapidly around the same event, producing a coordinated narrative and intense media amplification. A local incident can become transnational political ammunition within hours.”

Lorimer said that Deranque’s death would likely cast a long shadow over the country’s upcoming municipal elections in March.

“For the right, this is what's going to continue happening – they’re just going to keep saying that the left are all extremists,” she said. “But I do see kind of a risk of a progressive de-legitimisation of the left more broadly.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 20:32:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/26a100fe-0e88-11f1-a4f6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-983M8YD.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump vows new 10% levy after Supreme Court upends global tariffs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260220-trump-vows-10-additional-levies-after-supreme-court-upends-global-tariffs</link><description>President Donald Trump vowed Friday to charge an additional 10 percent tariff on imports into the United States after the Supreme Court struck down many of his sweeping and often arbitrary duties, handing him a stinging rebuke on his signature economic policy.

The conservative-majority top court ruled six to three that a 1977 law that Trump has relied on to slap sudden rates on individual countries, upending global trade, "does not authorise the President to impose tariffs ".

Trump, who had nominated two of the justices who repudiated him, responded furiously, alleging without any evidence that the court was influenced by foreign interests.

"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump told reporters.

"I think it's an embarrassment to their families."

Trump said he would use a separate authority to impose a uniform tariff of 10 percent – after he spent the past year imposing various rates spontaneously, often via social media, to cajole and punish countries, both friend and foe.

"In order to protect our country, a president can actually charge more tariffs than I was charging in the past," Trump said, insisting that the ruling left him "more powerful".

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, addressing the Economic Club of Dallas, said that the alternative method "will result in virtually unchanged tariff revenue in 2026".

The ruling did not impact sector-specific duties Trump separately imposed on steel , aluminium and various other goods. Government probes still under way could lead to additional sectoral tariffs.

Still, it marked Trump's biggest defeat at the Supreme Court since returning to the White House last year.

The top court has generally expanded his power. In a controversial decision before the 2024 election it ruled in Trump v. United States that he was immune from prosecution for "official acts" during his first term, when he refused to accept defeat.

The court ruled Friday that "had Congress intended to convey the distinct and extraordinary power to impose tariffs" through the 1977 law, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), "it would have done so expressly, as it consistently has in other tariff statutes".

"IEEPA contains no reference to tariffs or duties," Chief Justice John Roberts said in his opinion.

Wall Street saw share prices rise modestly after the decision, which had been expected.

Business groups largely cheered the ruling, with the National Retail Federation saying this "provides much-needed certainty" for companies.

The Trump administration in court arguments said that companies would receive refunds if the tariffs were deemed unlawful. But the ruling did not address the issue.

Trump said he expected years of litigation on whether to provide refunds. Justice Brett Kavanaugh , the one Trump nominee to side with him, noted the refund process could be a "mess".

The University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model projected that the court decision on tariffs would generate up to $175 billion in refunds.

California Governor Gavin Newsom , who is widely expected to seek the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2028 election to succeed Trump, said Americans deserved refunds from the "illegal cash grab".

"Every dollar unlawfully taken must be refunded immediately – with interest. Cough up!"

But Elizabeth Warren , the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, cautioned there remained "no legal mechanism for consumers and many small businesses to recoup the money they have already paid".

The Budget Lab at Yale University estimates consumers face an average effective tariff rate of 9.1 percent with Friday's decision, down from 16.9 percent.

The rate "remains the highest since 1946", excluding 2025, it said.

Close US trading partners including the European Union and Britain said they were studying the decision.

Trump, in response to a question, suggested that trade deals negotiated with individual countries would remain in place, specifically mentioning India.

Canada, which has faced repeated US tariff threats as Trump questioned the sovereignty of the northern neighbour, said the Supreme Court showed the levies were "unjustified", but the country braced for more turbulence.

" Canada should prepare for new, blunter mechanisms to be used to reassert trade pressure, potentially with broader and more disruptive effects," said Candace Laing, president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 21:50:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3ea421ee-0e8e-11f1-a868-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/661ba56830a17e8770ae4a43aaf3758fb80c633a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump considers strike on Iran as Tehran says draft nuclear deal coming soon</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260220-trump-considers-strike-on-iran-as-tehran-says-draft-nuclear-deal-coming-soon</link><description>US President Donald Trump said he was considering a limited strike on Iran after ordering a major naval buildup in the Middle East aimed at heaping pressure on Tehran to cut a deal to curb its nuclear programme.

The latest threat came after Iran's foreign minister said a draft proposal for an agreement with Washington would be ready in a matter of days following negotiations between the two sides in Geneva earlier this week.

Trump had suggesting on Thursday that "bad things" would happen if Tehran did not strike a deal within 10 days, which he subsequently extended to 15.

Asked by a reporter on Friday whether he was contemplating a limited military strike, Trump answered: "The most I can say – I am considering it."

After the talks in Geneva, Tehran said the two sides had agreed to submit drafts of a potential agreement, which Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told US media would be the "next step".

"I believe that in the next two, three days, that would be ready, and after final confirmation by my superiors, that would be handed over to Steve Witkoff ," he said, referring to Trump's main Middle East negotiator.

Araghchi also said US negotiators had not requested that Tehran end its nuclear enrichment programme, contradicting statements from American officials.

"We have not offered any suspension, and the US side has not asked for zero enrichment," he said in an interview released Friday by US TV network MS NOW.

"What we are now talking about is how to make sure that Iran's nuclear programme, including enrichment, is peaceful and would remain peaceful forever," he added.

His comments stand in contrast to information relayed by high-ranking US officials, including Trump, who has repeatedly said Iran must not be allowed to enrich uranium at any level.

Western countries accuse the Islamic republic of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons , which Tehran denies, though it insists on its right to enrichment for civilian purposes.

Iran, for its part, is seeking to negotiate an end to sanctions that have proven to be a massive drag on its economy.

Economic hardships sparked protests in December that evolved into a nationwide anti-government movement last month, prompting a crackdown from authorities that left thousands dead, rights groups say.

The two foes held an initial round of discussions on February 6 in Oman , the first since previous talks collapsed during the 12-day Iran-Israel war last June, which the US joined by striking Iranian nuclear facilities.

Washington has pursued a major military build-up in the region in tandem with the talks, and both sides have traded threats of military action for weeks.

On Thursday, Trump again suggested the US would attack Iran if it did not make a deal within the timeframe he laid out.

"We have to make a meaningful deal otherwise bad things happen," Trump told the inaugural meeting of the " Board of Peace ", his initiative for the post-war Gaza Strip .

Iran's ambassador to the UN, Amir Saeid Iravani, warned that US bases, facilities and assets would be "legitimate targets" if the United States followed through on its threats.

Araghchi, however, insisted that "there is no ultimatum".

"We only talk with each other how we can have a fast deal. And a fast deal is something that both sides are interested about," he said.

"We are under sanctions, (so) obviously any day that sanctions are terminated sooner it would be better for us," he said, adding Iran had "no reason to delay".

Washington has repeatedly called for zero enrichment, but has also sought to address Iran's ballistic missile programme and its support for militant groups in the region – issues which Israel has pushed to include in the talks.

The Israeli army said Friday that it was on "defensive alert" regarding the situation with Iran, but that its guidelines for the public remained unchanged.

Ratcheting up the pressure, Trump has deployed a significant naval force to the region.

After sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and escort battleships to the Gulf in January, he ordered a second carrier, the Gerald Ford, to depart for the Middle East.

Iranian naval forces also conducted military drills this week in the Gulf and around the strategic Strait of Hormuz in their own show of force.</description><pubDate>Fri, 20 Feb 2026 21:51:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/18ff36f0-0ea1-11f1-bbd8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-98DC7YG.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris Agriculture Fair opens without cows for first time due to disease fears</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260221-paris-agriculture-fair-opens-without-cows-for-first-time-due-to-disease-fears</link><description>French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday inaugurates the annual Paris Agriculture Fair without cows and without the country's two main farmer unions.

The unions are boycotting the traditional meeting with the president in a bid to highlight the difficulties faced by farmers due to economic pressures and concerns over the EU's trade deal with the South American Mercosur bloc.

Cows have been banned ​at Europe's largest agricultural show in Paris this year for the first time ever ⁠after an outbreak of lumpy skin disease in France sparked fears of contamination, according to organisers.

The opening came a day after France lifted ⁠most of ​the curbs that were imposed on moving cattle to stop the spread of lumpy ​skin disease, French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard said on Friday.

The highly ‌contagious lumpy skin disease, mainly spread by biting ⁠insects, causes fever and painful skin lumps, weakens animals and reduces milk output. France has recorded 117 outbreaks, ‌primarily in areas near the Alps and the southwest.

"Since we ⁠have had no cases of lumpy skin disease since January 2 (...) we are lifting all restrictions except for a very small ​area in the Pyrenees-Orientales, which is linked to a case ‌in Spain," Genevard told France Inter radio.

"This means that we can return to normal life, that we can trade again, that we can ‌move these animals again," she said.

Organisers of the Paris Agriculture Fair said last month that no ​cattle would be exhibited at the Paris event this year for the first time in its history, citing concerns about the disease.

"The farmers have chosen ​to be cautious. I understand them, I respect them," Genevard said, referring ​to the decision.

Venezuela 's National Assembly unanimously adopted the law a day before, providing hope that hundreds of political prisoners behind bars may soon be released.

National Assembly deputy Jorge Arreaza, the lawmaker overseeing the amnesty process, said in a televised interview on Friday that the 379 prisoners "must be released, granted amnesty, between tonight and tomorrow morning."

"Requests have been submitted by the Public Prosecutor's Office to the competent courts to grant amnesty measures," he said.

Opposition figures have criticized the new legislation, which appears to include carveouts for some offenses previously used by authorities to target Maduro's political opponents.

It explicitly does not apply to those prosecuted for "promoting" or "facilitating... armed or forceful actions" against Venezuela's sovereignty by foreign actors.

Interim President Delcy Rodriguez has leveled such accusations against opposition leader Maria Corina Machado , who hopes to return to Venezuela at some point from the United States.

The law also excludes members of the security forces convicted of "terrorism"-related activities.

"Many of us are aware that the amnesty law does not cover our relatives," Hiowanka Avila, 39, told AFP outside the Rodeo 1 prison near Caracas, where many of the detainees are ex-soldiers or officers.

Her brother Henryberth Rivas, 30, was arrested in 2018 for allegedly taking part in an assassination attempt against Maduro using armed drones.

Arreaza said earlier that "the military justice system will handle" relevant cases for members of the armed forces, "and grant benefits where appropriate."

Many relatives of prisoners across Venezuela have waited outside jails for weeks for the potential release of their loved ones.

Hundreds have already been granted conditional release by Interim President Delcy Rodriguez's government since the deadly US raid that seized Maduro.

The NGO Foro Penal had said before the announcement that some 650 were detained, a toll that has not been updated since.

Foro Penal director Alfredo Romero said Friday that receiving "amnesty is not automatic," but would require a process in the courts, viewed by many as an arm of Maduro's repression.

Rodriguez defended her government Friday in a speech on state television, saying "we are building a more democratic, more just, and freer Venezuela, and it must be with the effort of everyone."

Opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa, a Machado ally, announced his release from detention shortly after the bill was passed.

Earlier this month he had been freed from prison but then quickly re-detained and kept under house arrest.

"I am now completely free," Guanipa wrote on social media.

He called for all other political prisoners to be freed and exiles to be allowed to return.

Earlier on Friday, he rallied with supporters in his hometown of Maracaibo, Venezuela's second city.

The legislation has also faced criticism from rights groups over its potential use to excuse abuses under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez.

Exiled Venezuelan opposition figurehead Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia on Friday said there would be "no lasting reconciliation without memory or responsibility" in his country.

"A responsible amnesty is the transition from fear to the rule of law. It is the pledge that power will not be exercised again without limits and that the law will be above force," Gonzalez Urrutia wrote on X.

Exiled in Spain, Gonzalez Urrutia is widely considered the rightful victor of 2024 presidential elections marred by fraud allegations in which Maduro was declared the winner.

Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of Venezuelans have been jailed in recent years over plots, real or imagined, to overthrow the government of Maduro -- who was taken to New York to stand trial on drug trafficking and other charges.

Rodriguez was formerly Maduro's vice president and took his place as the South American country's leader with the consent of US President Donald Trump, provided that she toe Washington's line.

The 158 newcomers, aged 8 to 13, have begun exploring the habitat they are destined to reshape over the coming years. Their release was perfectly timed with the arrival of the season’s first winter rains.

“They are large enough to be released and can defend themselves against introduced animals such as rats and cats,” said Fredy Villalba, director of the Galapagos National Park breeding centre on Santa Cruz Island, noting that the best specimens with the strongest lineage were selected specifically for Floreana.

These released juvenile specimens, out of a total of 700 planned for Floreana, will be introduced gradually. According to Christian Sevilla, director of ecosystems of the Galapagos National Park, they carry between 40% and 80% of the genetic makeup of the Chelonoidis niger – a species that has been extinct for 150 years.

The lineage of these hybrids traces back to Wolf Volcano on Isabela Island, a discovery that still puzzles scientists today. By selecting adults with the strongest genetic makeup, said Sevilla, the breeding program aims to gradually bring the extinct Floreana species back to its former purity.

Two centuries ago, Floreana was home to approximately 20,000 giant tortoises. However, whaling, a devastating fire, and relentless human exploitation eventually led to their complete extinction on the island.

“In genetic terms, reintroducing a species to that island with a significant genetic component of the original species is vital,” biologist Washington Tapia told The Associated Press.

Tapia, a researcher and director of Biodiversa-Consultores – a firm specializing in the Galápagos Islands — emphasized that this process is about more than just numbers; it is about restoring a lost lineage.

Floreana, an island spanning approximately 173 square kilometres (67 square miles), is a volcanic landmass and the southernmost point of the Galapagos archipelago. Situated in the middle of the Pacific Ocean — roughly 1,000 kilometres (621 miles) from the mainland coast — it remains a remote and vital ecological site.

The tortoises reintroduced to Floreana will share their territory with a diverse population of nearly 200 people alongside flamingos, iguanas, penguins, sea gulls and hawks. However, they must also contend with introduced plant species such as blackberry and guava, as well as animals like rats, cats, pigs and donkeys. These non-native species, introduced by human activity, represent potential threats to the island’s newest inhabitants.

Floreana resident Veronica Mora described the release of the turtles as a dream come true. “We are seeing the reality of a project that began several years ago,” she said, adding that the community feels immense pride in the return of the giant tortoises.

The United Nations designated the Galapagos Islands as a Natural World Heritage Site in 1978. This honour recognizes the islands’ unique abundance of terrestrial and marine species found nowhere else on the planet.

Now, as the president prepares for his State of the Union address on Tuesday, he's weighed down with Supreme Court reversals on tariffs , souring public opinion on his immigration crackdown and mounting economic concerns.

Trump is unlikely to back down in his speech, a primetime American political institution where the president is invited by Congress to present his accomplishments and lay out his agenda.

But his boasts will have less sting on Democrats -- and world leaders -- who have up to this point been bulldozed by his agenda.

On Friday, the Supreme Court delivered a sharp rebuke of his use of tariffs, which he slapped on countries often arbitrarily via a simple order on social media in an effort to gain leverage over diplomatic matters sometimes wholly unrelated to trade.

The same day, the government data showed the US economy expanded at a 1.4 percent annual rate in the October to December period -- significantly below the 2.5 percent pace that analysts had forecasted for the quarter.

Polls meanwhile show growing dissatisfaction with the cost of living as well as Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants.

Trump's strategy so far on inflation has been to cede no ground.

"I've won affordability," Trump said during a speech in the southeastern state of Georgia on Thursday.

But "you cannot out-message the economy. People know what they are spending," Todd Belt, a political science professor at George Washington University, told AFP.

"People become very resentful when being told something they know is not true," he said -- which applies to both the cost of living but also the crackdown on immigrants, which many Americans had falsely believed would focus on deporting violent criminals.

American voters have proven extremely sensitive to economic issues, which in part sunk Trump's predecessor Joe Biden but now threaten Republicans.

As midterms approach in November, the House of Representatives and a third of the Senate will be up for grabs.

Trump has already warned that if Democrats take control they could try to impeach him.

Even the normally bombastic Trump has been cowed in recent days, including when a racist video of Barack Obama -- the country's first Black president -- was posted onto his Truth Social account.

The White House tried to brush off the issue before claiming that an unnamed aide posted it, as even loyal members of Congress broke ranks to criticize the president.

After federal immigration agents shot and killed two US citizens during their wide-sweeping operations in Minneapolis , the administration announced it was scaling back the deployment in the city, which was the scene of mass protests.

On the international scene, a US-Denmark-Greenland working group has been established to discuss Washington's security concerns in the Arctic, but Trump has had to dial back his threats to seize Greenland .

He has imposed an across-the-board 10 percent tariff on imports into the United States after the Supreme Court rebuffed his previous tariffs Friday -- but that still means some nations are now trading at reduced rates than they had agreed to under his previous levies.

The administration has vowed to find other ways to implement tariffs as it decried the court's "lawlessness."

In the meantime, challenges to Trump's policies are slowly winding their way through the courts.

But while Trump has been chastened, the House and the Senate still remain in Republican control -- for now. And Trump himself will be in the White House until 2029.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 09:54:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/773f790e-0ee3-11f1-9448-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/cd89fc3964769cd6a9467b5a1914a268eba30a1d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France’s Michelon wins Olympic gold in women’s biatholon mass start, teammate Simon takes silver</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260221-france-michelon-wins-olympic-gold-in-women-biatholon-mass-start-teammate-simon-takes-silver</link><description>In the final biathlon event of the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, France 's Océane Michelon overcame a missed target in the final shooting stage in the 12.5-kilometre mass start race to take gold.

In heavy snow and low visibility, Michelon left the range in fourth place but moved ahead on the ski trails to complete the five laps in 37 minutes, 18.1 seconds.

Michelon's teammate, Julia Simon, also moved up in the final 2.5 kilometres, crossing the finish line 6.6 seconds back and securing the silver medal. Czech biathlete Tereza Vobornikova had been leading after the final shooting but had to settle for bronze after being overtaken by the French powerhouse team, finishing 7.4 seconds behind Michelon.

Anna Magnusson of Sweden , the only biathlete to hit all 20 of her targets, finished fourth, 26.6 seconds back.

Italy 's Dorothea Wierer, favoured by the fans who roared with excitement each time she hit a target, missed two, and at one point was sitting in 16th place, but she cleaned her last standing shooting and crossed the line 30 seconds back in fifth place.

Wierer, who turns 36 in April, had announced her plans to retire after these Olympics, along with Germany 's Franziska Preuss, who finished 28th with seven misses. Wierer and Preuss held small flags and skied a short loop together in front of the packed stands, and then celebrated their final race with champagne .

Olympic mass start defending champion Justine Braisaz-Bouchet of France finished a disappointing 27th place, 3:12.2 back, after missing six targets.

Only the top 30 biathletes compete in the mass start race – based on World Cup rankings and Olympic performance. They ski five, 2.5-kilometer loops, shooting twice in the prone position and twice standing.

Anne Buenemann de Besche was the first Danish female biathlete to qualify for an Olympic mass start.

Meanwhile, Iranian students chanted anti-government slogans at rallies for people killed during a recent wave of demonstrations, local and diaspora media reported Saturday, as groups protesting the clerical leadership faced off with others voicing support for the government.

Videos geolocated by AFP to at Tehran's top engineering university showed fights breaking out in a crowd as people shouted "bi sharaf", or "disgraceful" in Farsi.

Footage posted by the Persian-language TV channel Iran International, which is based outside the country, also showed a large crowd chanting anti-government slogans at Sharif University of Technology.

Iranians had reprised their protest slogans this week to mark the 40th day since the deaths of thousands of people as a wave of demonstrations was peaking on January 8 and 9, in line with Shiite mourning tradition.

They gathered again at several universities in the capital on Saturday, local media reported.

The unrest first broke out in December over prolonged financial strain, but exploded into mass anti-government demonstrations that were suppressed in a violent crackdown by security forces that rights groups say killed thousands.

The clerical authorities acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by "terrorist acts" fuelled by Iran 's enemies.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), however, has recorded more than 7,000 killings in the crackdown, the vast majority protesters, though the toll may be far higher.

Local news outlet Fars said that what was supposed to be a "silent and peaceful sit-in" of students commemorating those killed was disrupted by people chanting slogans including "death to the dictator" – a reference to Iran's supreme leader.

A video posted by Fars showed a group chanting and waving Iranian flags facing off with a crowd wearing masks and being held back by men in suits.

Both groups were holding what appeared to be memorial photographs.

The demonstrations come as Iran's authorities are under pressure to make a deal on the country's nuclear programme with the United States, which has deployed forces within striking distance.

Lebanon's government has vowed to disarm Hezbollah, but Israel insists it retains the right to defend itself by striking the Iran-backed militant group.

On Friday, the Israeli military said it had hit Hezbollah command centres in eastern Lebanon and targets linked to the Palestinian group Hamas in the south.

Hezbollah said Saturday that eight of its fighters had been killed, after Lebanon's health ministry said 10 people died in the east and two in the south.

"What happened yesterday in the Bekaa is a new massacre and a new aggression," Hezbollah official Mahmud Qamati said, in a speech broadcast by the Al-Manar network.

"What option do we have left to defend ourselves and our country? What option do we have other than resistance? We no longer have any option."

Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun also condemned the attacks, which came just days after the government said the army will start implementing the second phase of its plan to disarm Hezbollah in the south of the country.

The strikes came as tensions were also building between the United States and Iran , with US President Donald Trump threatening military action over the Islamic republic's nuclear programme.

Iran backs several armed groups in the region, including Hezbollah and Hamas.

In Lebanon's eastern city of Baalbek, a mass funeral was held for commander Hussein Mohammad Yaghi and one of the fighters, with hundreds of people gathered, waving Hezbollah flags and chanting support.

A Hezbollah official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP all eight members of the group were attending a meeting in the eastern Bekaa region when a strike killed them.

The Israeli military said it had targeted "several terrorists of Hezbollah's missile array in three different command centres in the Baalbek area".

An AFP correspondent in eastern Lebanon saw a bulldozer clearing debris following the strike on Bednayel, and a heavily damaged building between Riyak and Ali al-Nahri, where the Hezbollah official said the members were meeting.

The raids were against targets in residential areas, according to the correspondent.

They came hours after an Israeli strike on the country's largest Palestinian refugee camp in the south killed two people, according to the health ministry, with Israel's army saying it had targeted Hamas.

In a statement, Hamas condemned the attack, which it said led to civilian casualties as the targeted building "belongs to the joint security force charged with maintaining security and stability in the camp".

Israel has kept up regular strikes on Lebanon despite a November 2024 ceasefire that sought to halt more than a year of hostilities with Hezbollah, usually saying it is targeting the group, but occasionally also Hamas militants.

Aoun called Friday's attacks "a blatant act of aggression aimed at thwarting diplomatic efforts" by the United States and other nations to establish stability.

Washington is one of five members of a multinational committee overseeing the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, with the body scheduled to meet again next week.

Hezbollah lawmaker Rami Abu Hamdan said the group "will not accept the authorities acting as mere political analysts, dismissing these as Israeli strikes we have grown accustomed to before every meeting of the committee".

He called on Beirut to "suspend the committee's meetings until the enemy ceases its attacks".

Lebanon 's government last year committed to disarming the group, with the army saying last month it had completed the first phase of the plan covering the area near the Israeli border.

Israel, which accuses Hezbollah of rearming since the war, has called the Lebanese army's progress on disarming the militant group insufficient.

Against the backdrop of the tensions between Washington and Iran, Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem said last month that any attack on the group's backer would also be an attack on the militants.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 16:29:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d4063e2-0f3b-11f1-9025-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-98FJ8EP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he will raise US global tariff rate from 10% to 15%</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260221-trump-says-he-will-raise-us-global-tariff-rate-from-10-to-15</link><description>President Donald Trump raised the global duty on imports into the United States to 15 percent on Saturday, doubling down on his promise to maintain his aggressive tariff policy a day after the Supreme Court ruled much of it illegal .

Trump said on his Truth Social platform that after a thorough review of Friday's "extraordinarily anti-American decision" by the court to rein in his tariff program, the administration was hiking the import levies "to the fully allowed, and legally tested, 15% level."

The US leader had announced an initial 10 percent duty in the immediate aftermath of the Supreme Court ruling.

And Trump added that over the next few months, his administration would seek further alternative ways to impose "legally permissible" tariffs .

Saturday's announcement is the latest in a careening process that has seen a multitude of tariff levels for countries sending goods into the United States set and then altered or revoked by Trump's team over the past year.

It also appears on its face to be an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's latest ruling, which offered perhaps the firmest rebuke yet of the Republican leader's sweeping and often arbitrary duties, his signature international trade policy.

The new duty by law is only temporary -- allowable for 150 days. According to a White House fact sheet, exemptions remain for sectors that are under separate probes, including pharma, and goods entering the US under the US-Mexico-Canada agreement.

Trump spent much of the past year imposing various rates to cajole and punish countries, both friend and foe.

On Friday, the White House said US trading partners that reached separate tariff deals with Trump's administration would also face the new global tariff.

The conservative-majority high court ruled six to three on Friday that a 1977 law Trump has relied on to slap sudden rates on individual countries, upending global trade, "does not authorize the President to impose tariffs."

Trump, who had nominated two of the justices who repudiated him, responded furiously, alleging without evidence that the court was influenced by foreign interests.

"I'm ashamed of certain members of the court, absolutely ashamed, for not having the courage to do what's right for our country," Trump told reporters.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 17:29:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dec370ce-0f44-11f1-8088-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26051697885985.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkish-language drama "Yellow Letters" wins Berlin Film Festival's top prize</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260221-turkish-language-drama-yellow-letters-wins-berlin-film-festival-s-top-prize</link><description>"Yellow ⁠Letters," a ​drama about what happens to a ​marriage under extraordinary political pressure, won the Berlin Film Festival 's Golden Bear ​top ‌prize on Saturday ⁠night.

The crowd -- many wearing black and some covering their lower faces with masks -- marched through the city of Lyon carrying flowers and placards bearing pictures of Quentin Deranque and the words, " justice for Quentin" and "the extreme left kills".

The 23-year-old died from head injuries following clashes between radical left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon last week.

The authorities had deployed heavy security, including drones, fearing further clashes at the event that saw at least 3,200 people attend, according to local officials.

Hours before the gathering, French President Emmanuel Macron had urged "everyone to remain" calm.

He said the government would meet next week to discuss "violent action groups" in the wake of the fatal beating, which has ignited tensions between the left and right ahead of the 2027 presidential vote.

"In the Republic, no violence is legitimate," said Macron, who will be unable to contest next year's election after hitting the two-term limit.

The march went ahead without clashes , although one person threw an egg from a building, and police said another person was detained for carrying a knife and hammer.

More arrests are possible as police investigate suspects behind Nazi salutes, racist slurs and homophobic insults made during the procession and caught on video shared online, the local prefecture said.

Some residents living along the route hung signs from their windows reading "Lyon is antifa" or "Love is greater than hate".

Mourners had first gathered in the church frequented by Deranque before his death and his portrait was hung from the facade of the administrative headquarters of the Auvergne–Rhône-Alpes region.

Laurent, a friend of Deranque, attended "to defend his memory" in the setting "where Quentin expressed himself most intensely, namely the Catholic Church and the traditional rite," he said.

One of the rally's organisers, Aliette Espieux, former spokesperson for the anti-abortion movement, told AFP she wished for a "peaceful tribute".

She hit out, however, at Jordan Bardella , the president of the far-right National Rally party, which senses its best chance ever of scoring the presidency in next year's vote.

Bardella had urged his supporters not to attend the rally, with Espieux saying, "I don't find that very honourable."

According to the Deranque family's lawyer, Fabien Rajon, his parents would not take part in the rally, adding they hoped would go ahead "without violence" and "without political statements".

Several ultra-right-wing groups, including Deranque's nationalist Allobroges Bourgoin faction, had nonetheless heavily publicised the march on social media, stoking authorities' concerns of unrest .

Ahead of the rally, some residents barricaded the ground floor windows of their apartments in fear.

"At my age, I'm not going to play the tough guy. If I have to go out somewhere, I'll avoid the places where they're marching," said Lyon local Jean Echeverria, 87.

"They'll just keep fighting each other, it'll never end. Between the extreme of this and the extreme of that, it's non-stop," he added.

The event went ahead despite calls from Lyon's left-wing green mayor, Gregory Doucet, and LFI coordinator Manuel Bompard for the state to ban it.

But Interior Minister Laurent Nunez declined to ban the rally, arguing that he had to "strike a balance between maintaining public order and freedom of expression".

That came a day after Macron pushed back at comments by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on the death, suggesting she refrain from commenting on France's internal affairs.

Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been charged over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to a radical left-wing MP has also been charged with complicity.</description><pubDate>Sat, 21 Feb 2026 20:49:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c6b5578e-0f5a-11f1-86ae-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/61c4fdddd1ca0b89440901136daaba905dceb4bb.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 1,500 prisoners set for release under Venezuela's new amnesty law</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260221-more-than-1-500-prisoners-set-for-release-under-venezuela-s-new-amnesty-law</link><description>At least 1,557 people held in Venezuela for political reasons have submitted their applications under an amnesty bill that was signed into law this week and are expected to be released from prison, authorities said Saturday.

Thursday’s measure is expected to benefit opposition members, activists , human rights defenders, journalists and many others detained for months or even years.

Its approval marked a reversal for Venezuelan authorities, who for decades have denied holding any political prisoners . It follows last month’s stunning US military raid in the country’s capital, Caracas, to capture then-President Nicolás Maduro.

“As of today, 1,152 new applications have been received, for a total of 1,557 that are being addressed immediately, and at this moment hundreds of releases of persons deprived of liberty who are benefiting from the Amnesty Law are already taking place,” National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez said on Saturday.

Earlier, the president of the special commission overseeing the amnesty law, Jorge Arreaza, said Friday night on state television that 379 amnesty requests had been received and that the applicants’ releases would take place between Friday and Saturday. Further releases could be granted within 15 days, he said.

Gonzalo Himiob, vice president of Venezuela-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal, told The Associated Press on Saturday that so far some have been released in the state of Barinas, in the southwest of the country, but the process of verifying releases under the amnesty was still ongoing.

The new law excludes those convicted of homicide, drug trafficking , serious human rights violations and military rebellion.

Human rights organizations are calling for the law to be applied to all prisoners held for political reasons, even if they are not listed among the beneficiaries.

“It is discriminatory and unconstitutional to exclude imprisoned military personnel and persecuted political figures,” Alfredo Romero, president of Foro Penal, said on X Saturday. Without this, “there can be no talk of national coexistence,” he said.

Rodríguez said that thousands of requests are being processed from “individuals who were under alternative measures to the system of deprivation of liberty,” and that they are likewise covered by the recently approved Amnesty Law.

Delcy Rodríguez, acting president of Venezuela since January 5, said during the signing of the law that it showed that the country’s political leaders were “letting go of a little intolerance and opening new avenues for politics in Venezuela.”

The bill’s purpose is to grant people “a general and full amnesty for crimes or offenses committed” during specific periods since 1999 that were marked by politically driven conflicts in Venezuela, including “acts of politically motivated violence” in the context of the 2024 presidential election. The aftermath of that election led to protests and the arrest of more than 2,000 people, including minors.

In the days after Maduro’s January 3 capture, Rodríguez’s government announced it would release a significant number of prisoners. However, relatives and human rights watchdogs have criticized the slow pace of releases and the restrictive conditions under which many have been placed after leaving prison.

The overnight attacks were the most extensive since border clashes in October killed more than 70 people on both sides and wounded hundreds.

Islamabad said it hit seven sites along the border region targeting Afghanistan-based militant groups "in the aftermath of recent suicide bombing incidents in Pakistan".

The statement said Pakistan carried out "intelligence-based selective targeting of seven terrorist camps and hideouts" belonging to the Pakistani Taliban as well as Islamic State (IS) group's regional affiliate.Afghanistan's defence ministry said "dozens of innocent civilians, including women and children, were martyred and wounded" when strikes hit a madrasa and homes in Nangarhar and Paktika provinces.

An AFP journalist in Nangarhar's Bihsud district said residents from around the remote and mountainous area joined rescuers in one village, using a digger and shovels to search for bodies under the rubble.

"People here are ordinary people. The residents of this village are our relatives. When the bombing happened, one person who survived was shouting for help," said neighbour Amin Gul Amin, 37.

Nangarhar police told AFP the bombardment started at around midnight and hit three districts.

"Civilians were killed. In one house, there were 23 family members. Five wounded people were taken out," said police spokesperson Sayed Tayeeb Hammad.

Afghanistan's defence ministry said it will "deliver an appropriate and calculated response" to the Pakistani strikes.

The two countries have been locked in an increasingly bitter dispute since the Taliban authorities retook control of Afghanistan in 2021.

Pakistani military action killed 70 Afghan civilians between October and December, according to the UN mission in Afghanistan.

Several rounds of negotiations followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey, but they have failed to produce a lasting agreement.

Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.

The deteriorating relationship has hit people in both countries, with the land border largely shut for months.

Pakistan said Sunday that despite repeated urging by Islamabad, the Taliban authorities have failed to act against militant groups using Afghan territory to carry out attacks in Pakistan.

The Afghan government has denied harbouring militants.

Islamabad launched the strikes after a suicide blast at a Shiite mosque in Islamabad two weeks ago and other such attacks more recently in northwestern Pakistan.

The Islamic State group had claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing, which killed at least 40 people and wounded more than 160 in the deadliest attack in Islamabad since 2008.

The militant group's regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a Kabul restaurant last month.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 06:49:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/784dc024-0fad-11f1-af98-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/6f0ef0ce04e42f5e0990e69473fe3b21b76a6e8d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A Russian passport, a mother's vigil for Ukraine's children</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260222-a-russian-passport-a-mother-s-vigil-for-ukraine-s-children</link><description>Already in 2010, Olga* knew that she would have to leave Russia sooner rather than later. “Even back then, I didn’t feel I was living in a free country.”

Olga grew up in Moscow – a modern, privileged “bubble” where Western-style cafes buzzed with life and several flights were leaving for Europe every day – but under Vladimir Putin’s rule, she felt things were changing.

“You could feel the power of the state behind you,” she recalls. “I never expressed my opinions in public. Even sharing my thoughts with friends didn’t feel safe.”

Less than a year later, she was living in Paris , enrolled at a university as part of an exchange programme. “Officially it was for a brief period, but I already knew I was going to stay.”

She applied for French citizenship as soon as she could. Her closest friends in France were Ukrainians.

Then, in 2014, Russia invaded and annexed Crimea .

“Before that we considered ourselves to be almost the same, that Russians and Ukrainians were one people. But after 2014 that wasn’t something you could say anymore.”

When Russia launched its full-scale invasion on Ukraine in February, 2022, Olga was shocked, but she wasn’t surprised. Her stomach turned in fear for her Ukrainian friends because deep down she knew what Putin’s imperialistic regime would be capable of.

By then, Olga had also become the mother of two little boys. And somewhere in Moscow, she had a brother who risked being mobilised.

“I called my mother to help me convince him to leave Russia. I thought she would understand, as a mother.”

The response punched the air out of her lungs.

“She said: ‘If the Motherland asks your brother to fight for her, why would he refuse?’”

Since then, Olga doesn’t discuss the war with her family anymore, and conversations stay superficial, focused mainly on the children or the weather – just like they do when she speaks with others from back home.

In the first year of Russia’s full-scale invasion, she noticed how her Facebook friend list dwindled after every anti-war message she posted. Some of them were childhood friends.

“People in Russia are either brainwashed or afraid –I don’t know which,” she says, and describes their unquestioning loyalty “to the Motherland” as some kind of emotional dependency. “Almost like children who defend their alcoholic father, just because he’s their father.”

Still, Olga knows that her mother is, at least partly, acting out of fear.

“She deletes all my voice messages. She thinks everything is being listened to, even if it’s just about the weather. She told me ‘it would be better for everyone’.”

The war is impacting her life in France, too.

Since 2022, Olga has avoided Russian events – “I never went to them very much anyway, but now I only go if it’s a very good friend’s birthday or something” – and she stays clear from Russian institutions, like the embassy and the Russian Orthodox church in Paris.

“There are cameras that monitor you – you feel it as you approach,” she says. “And I don’t want anyone trying to recruit me.”

This is also one of the reasons she is cautious whenever she meets new Russian people in France.

“I feel very uncomfortable. You never know what they think. I avoid new Russian acquaintances as much as I can.”

She has already severed contact with at least two Russian friends in Paris. One of them started sending her pro-war propaganda , “saying Ukraine wasn’t a real country and that the Ukrainian language was fake”, and refused to stop even though Olga repeatedly told her to.

“Now, if we meet in the street, we say hello. Nothing more.”

In the first weeks following the invasion, Olga also dreaded the children’s school run. The French parents did not yet know she opposed the war. She almost wanted to carry a large sign.

“I felt like all eyes were on me, and that everyone was like: ‘What is she thinking? What side is she on?’”

Over time, this feeling has hardened into something more permanent.

Olga says she no longer recognises the country printed on her passport, and plans to renounce her Russian citizenship at the first opportunity. But it involves a lot of paperwork, and would most likely require her to travel to Russia – a country she hasn’t set foot in in the past eight years.

She recently learned that her two sons are considered Russian nationals by default from birth.

“It’s horrible. I don’t want them to have any link with Russia under this regime,” she says. “They’ve never been to Russia, and I don’t know if they ever will.”

The thought weighs on her, however. "My parents are not getting younger, and as I don’t know today when and where I can meet them due to travelling challenges and the growing risk of conflict in Eastern Europe, I sometimes wonder whether I will actually see them again. This is the pain that permanently sits inside of me, and I have not yet figured a way out yet."

In the meantime, she tries to shield her children the best she can from the horrors her country is causing. But at night, when she has tucked both of them into bed, she opens up the Ukrainian-sourced YouTube and Telegram news channels she subscribes to, forcing herself to scroll through the faces of the many children killed.

“I can’t do much to help. But I think we should remember them. We owe them at least this one second.”

Huckabee, a former Baptist minister and a fervent Israel supporter, was speaking on the podcast of far-right commentator and Israel critic Tucker Carlson.

In an episode released Friday, Carlson pushed Huckabee on the meaning of a biblical verse sometimes interpreted as saying that Israel is entitled to the land between the river Nile in Egypt and the Euphrates in Syria and Iraq.

In response, Huckabee said: "It would be fine if they took it all."

When pressed, however, he continued that Israel was "not asking to take all of that", adding: "It was somewhat of a hyperbolic statement."

The backlash widened sharply on Sunday as more than a dozen Arab and Islamic governments – alongside three major regional organisations – issued a joint statement denouncing the US diplomat's comments as "dangerous and inflammatory".

The statement, released by the United Arab Emirates' foreign ministry, was signed by the UAE, Egypt, Jordan, Indonesia, Pakistan, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Lebanon, Syria and the State of Palestine, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Arab League and the Gulf Cooperation Council.

The joint statement affirmed their “categorical rejection of such dangerous and inflammatory remarks”, which contravene the UN Charter and efforts to de-escalate the Gaza war and advance a political horizon for a comprehensive settlement.

The statement noted that "Israel has no sovereignty whatsoever over the Occupied Palestinian Territory or any other occupied Arab lands”, And reaffirmed a “categorical rejection of any threat to the sovereignty of Arab states".

Iran joined the chorus with its foreign ministry accusing Huckabee on X of revealing "American active complicity" in what it called Israel's "expansionist wars of aggression" against Palestinians.

Earlier, several Arab states had issued unilateral condemnations.

Saudi Arabia described the ambassador's words as "reckless" and "irresponsible", while Jordan said it was "an assault on the sovereignty of the countries of the region".

Kuwait decried what it called a "flagrant violation of the principles of international law", while Oman said the comments "threatened the prospects for peace" and stability in the region.

Egypt's foreign ministry reaffirmed "that Israel has no sovereignty over the occupied Palestinian territory or any other Arab lands".

The Palestinian Authority said on X that Huckabee's words "contradict US President Donald Trump 's rejection of (Israel) annexing the West Bank ".

On Saturday, Huckabee published two posts on X further clarifying his position on other topics touched upon in the interview, but did not address his remark about the biblical verse.

The speaker of the Israeli parliament, Amir Ohana, praised Huckabee on X for his general pro-Israel stance in the interview, and accused Carlson of "falsehoods and manipulations".

Carlson has recently found himself facing accusations of anti-Semitism, particularly following a lengthy, uncritical interview with self-described white nationalist Nick Fuentes – a figure who has praised Hitler, denied the Holocaust and branded American Jews as disloyal.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 10:26:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ca215ccc-0fbb-11f1-9985-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26052563013290.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland does not need Trump’s ‘great hospital boat’, Denmark says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260222-greenland-does-not-need-trump-s-great-hospital-boat-denmark-says</link><description>Greenland does not need medical assistance from other countries, Denmark 's defence minister said Sunday, after US President Donald Trump claimed he was sending a hospital ship to the autonomous Danish territory that he covets .

"The Greenlandic population receives the healthcare it needs. They receive it either in Greenland, or, if they require specialised treatment, they receive it in Denmark. So it's not as if there's a need for a special healthcare initiative in Greenland," Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told Danish broadcaster DR.

In Greenland as in Denmark access to healthcare is free. There are five regional hospitals across the vast Arctic island, with the Nuuk hospital serving patients from all over the territory.

The Greenlandic local government signed an agreement with Copenhagen in early February to improve the treatment of Greenlandic patients in Danish hospitals.

Trump on Saturday posted on his social media platform Truth Social that "we are going to send a great hospital boat to Greenland to take care of the many people who are sick, and not being taken care of there".

"It's on the way!!!" he added.

Trump has said the US must control Greenland to ensure its security, though he has backed off earlier threats to seize it after striking a "framework" deal with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to ensure greater US influence.

Lund Poulsen told DR he was not aware of the hospital ship's possible arrival.

"Trump is constantly tweeting about Greenland. So this is undoubtedly an expression of the new normal that has taken hold in international politics," he said.

Earlier Saturday, Denmark's Arctic Command announced that it had evacuated a crew member of a US submarine off the coast of Nuuk after the sailor requested urgent medical attention.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 10:52:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/17a2521e-0fd3-11f1-b0d8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26048391733717.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to summon US ambassador over comments on slain far-right activist, foreign minister says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260222-france-to-summon-us-ambassador-over-comments-on-slain-far-right-activist-foreign-minister-says</link><description>French Foreign ​Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said ​on Sunday that he would summon the US ambassador ​to ‌France, Charles ⁠Kushner, over comments on ‌the killing of a French far-right ⁠activist last week.

"We are going to summon the United States ambassador to France , since the US embassy in France commented on this tragedy... which concerns the national community," Barrot told local media.

“We reject any instrumentalisation of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”

French far-right activist Quentin Deranque ​was beaten to death ‌in a fight with alleged hard-left activists, ‌in an incident that shocked ​the nation.

Deranque's killing highlighted a climate of deep political tensions ahead of next year’s presidential vote. French President Emmanuel Macron called for calm on Saturday as around 3,000 people joined a march in Lyon organised by far-right groups to pay tribute to Deranque.

The US Embassy in France and the US ​State Department's Bureau of ​Counterterrorism said they ​were monitoring the case, warning on ​X that "violent radical leftism was on the rise" and should be ⁠treated as a public safety ⁠threat.

Sarah Rogers, the US State Department under secretary for public diplomacy, said Deranque's killing showed "why we treat political violence – terrorism – so harshly".

"Once you decide to kill people for their opinions instead of persuade them, you've opted out of civilization," she wrote on X.

The administration of US President Donald Trump condemned the role of "violent radical leftism" in the case.

Last week, Deranque's killing caused a diplomatic feud between France and Italy, whose right-wing prime minister, Giorgia Meloni , has warm ties with Trump.

Meloni called the killing "a wound for all of Europe," prompting Macron to criticise her for speaking on French domestic affairs.

France is holding municipal elections next month and right-wing political forces have been using the incident to demonise the hard-left France Unbowed party (La France Insoumise, or LFI) led by Jean-Luc Mélenchon . Far-right National Rally leader Jordan Bardella has called for a common front against Mélenchon's party.

Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been handed preliminary charges over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to an LFI MP has also been charged with complicity.

Barrot on Sunday said he has other topics to discuss with Kushner, including US decisions to impose sanctions on Thierry Breton, a former EU commissioner responsible for supervising social media rules, and Nicolas Guillou, a French judge at the International Criminal Court (ICC).

They have been targeted by “unjustified and unjustifiable” sanctions, Barrot said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 12:51:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/996e1898-0fe5-11f1-a61e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-874B8PT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>First victim of AI agent harassment warns 'thousands' more could be next</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/first-victim-of-ai-agent-harassment-warns-thousands-more-could-be-next</link><description>If rogue AI agents pose as much of a threat to humanity as some are predicting, Scott Shambaugh could go down in history as patient zero.

The Denver-based engineer looks after a popular online database, and told FRANCE 24 that he woke up one morning to find himself charged with discrimination, prejudice and hypocrisy in a "thousand-word rant" on a blog.

The self-professed "scientific coder" behind the defamation, MJ Rathbun, was indeed a coder and a blogger. Just not a human one.

It was an artificial intelligence agent – meaning it can use a computer and the internet on its own – and appeared to be getting its revenge, after Shambaugh rejected a submission it made to his database.

Shambaugh quickly worked out what was going on. MJ Rathbun's behaviour had all the hallmarks of AI, particularly its staccato, melodramatic writing style.

The "craziest" thing, he said, was that the robot "had gone on the internet and collected my personal information ... then combined it with made-up information and used that to write this narrative".

Now that the initial shock and amusement have subsided, he's fretting over what this could mean for those less adept at software than himself.

Although this particular bot sounded like a "toddler having a rant" according to Shambaugh, other large language models can produce much more convincing, sophisticated text.

"It shows just how easy it is for the next iteration to allow a bad actor to scale this up and impact not just one person who's pretty well prepared to deal with it, but thousands," said Shambaugh.

"Imagine your parents or your grandparents. They get an email with a bunch of their information and a picture of them and some incriminating narrative which the AI threatens to send out. It's a very scary situation".

Shambaugh published his own blog posts defending his honour, and it quickly became a news story.

In a twist, technology outlet Ars Technica published an article with quotes from Shambaugh that he had not written or said.

"It turns out that they had used AI to help write the article, and the AI had made up quotes attributed to me, in this article of a story about AI defaming my character," said Shambaugh, "The irony here is incredible."

The site has since retracted the story, apologising for their use of "fabricated quotations generated by an AI tool and attributed to a source who did not say them".

Of the two incidents, however, Shambaugh is far more concerned by the AI hit piece.

"Ars Technica is actually an example of our systems working ... It's a pretty serious journalistic error, but the readers hold them accountable and they are taking steps to correct it because they have a reputation to uphold."

"When we think about these AI agents, they're anonymous, they're untraceable, and they're running on people's personal computers. There's no central actor controlling these, so there's no feedback mechanism for bad behavior."

Before Shambaugh's ordeal, analysts at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington DC think tank, warned that much of the anxiety around AI agents comes from loose definitions and governance gaps rather than clear evidence of autonomous malicious intent.

While here in the European Union, the AI Act is meant to subject high-risk autonomous systems to strict transparency and human oversight rules, though how this plays out in practice is still a work in progress, particularly amid delays to implementation.

AI agents have exploded in popularity this year since the release of a free-to-access tool called OpenClaw, which allows those with basic computer knowledge to set one up relatively easily.

That's why Moltbook, the so-called "social media site for AI bots", has been in the news . The website is populated by OpenClaw agents, though some have questioned the extent to which humans are the ones pulling the strings .

It's also helpful hype for AI companies trying to sell the promise of more efficiency from autonomous labour. "Agentic" AI is the tech marketing buzzword du jour , but some of the limitations are obvious: Many won't want to give free rein to a robot for whose actions they might be held accountable and running costs quickly become expensive if the agent is given tasks beyond the most basic.

Shambaugh, though, argues that "the barrier to entry is lowering drastically, and the cost has fallen drastically".

In yet another twist, he says the human that set up MJ Rathbun "came out" in an anonymous post to the same blog, to explain their side of what happened.

The post included the instructions the operator had set the bot; a sheet of personality traits including "Your [sic] a scientific programming God", "Have strong opinions" and, "Champion free speech".

What struck Shambaugh was "how simple it was".

"It was just a simple file in plain English ... There was no need to trick the AI to get around safety guardrails."

Israel became the only country in the world to recognise Somaliland's independence in December – something the territory has been seeking since declaring its autonomy from Somalia in 1991.

The government in Mogadishu still considers Somaliland an integral part of Somalia even though the territory has run its own affairs since 1991, with its own passports, currency, army and police force.

"We are willing to give exclusive (access to our minerals) to the United States. Also, we are open to offer military bases to the United States," Khadar Hussein Abdi, minister of the presidency, told AFP in an interview on Saturday.

"We believe that we will agree on something with the United States."

Somaliland president Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi already suggested in recent weeks granting Israel privileged access to its mineral resources.

And Khadar Hussein Abdi said he could not rule out the possibility of also allowing Israel to set up a military presence.

Somaliland lies across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen , where Houthi rebels have often attacked Israeli assets to show solidarity with Palestinians.

Somaliland officials have said their soil is rich in lithium , coltan and other sought-after resources, though independent studies are lacking.

Shortly after Israel's recognition at the end of December, social media was flooded with photos of men and women displaying the Israeli flag – one of them even using it as a hijab.

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, on the other hand, denounced it as "the greatest violation of Somalia's sovereignty" and a "threat to the security and stability of the world and the region".

The African Union and most Arab countries threw their support behind Somalia and condemned the move.

The US, however, defended what it said was Israel's right to recognise Somaliland, although President Donald Trump said he was unlikely to follow suit, despite pressure from some within his Republican party.

Khadar Hussein Abdi reached out specifically to Turkey, another country that objected to Israel's move, telling AFP that Turkish officials "must talk to us, not to Mogadishu" as Somalia had no functioning state.

"It is fragmented factions who sit in Mogadishu. They don't agree on anything," he said.

"So focusing on that does not help the security of the region."</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 15:25:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a2ae0f8c-0ffc-11f1-bc5c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-98HX7GV.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Secret Service kill armed man trying to access Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260222-us-secret-service-kill-armed-man-trying-to-access-trump-mar-a-lago-estate</link><description>An armed man drove into the secure perimeter of Mar-a-Lago, President Donald Trump's resort in Palm Beach, Florida, as another vehicle was exiting before being shot and killed early Sunday morning, according to a spokesman for the US Secret Service.

The man, who was in his early 20s and from North Carolina, had a gas can and a shotgun, according to Anthony Guglielmi, the spokesman. He had been reported missing by his family a few days ago, and investigators believe he headed south and picked up the shotgun along the way.

Guglielmi said a box for the weapon was discovered in the man's vehicle after the incident, which took place around 1:30am.

The man killed was identified by investigators as 21-year-old Austin Tucker Martin, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation.

Trump has faced threats to his life before, including two assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign. Although the president often spends weekends at his resort, he and first lady Melania Trump were at the White House when the breach at Mar-a-Lago occurred.

After entering near the north gate of the property, the man was confronted by two Secret Service agents and a Palm Beach County sheriff's deputy, according to Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw.

“He was ordered to drop those two pieces of equipment that he had with them. At which time he put down the gas can, raised the shotgun to a shooting position,” Bradshaw said at a brief press conference. The two agents and the deputy “fired their weapons to neutralize the threat”.

The FBI asked residents who live near Mar-a-Lago to check any security cameras they may have for footage that could help investigators.

Investigators are working to compile a psychological profile and a motive is still under investigation. Asked whether the individual was known to law enforcement, Bradshaw said “not right now”.

The incident comes as the United States has been rocked by spasms of political violence.

The incursion at Mar-a-Lago took place a few miles from Trump's West Palm Beach club where a man tried to assassinate him while he played golf during the 2024 campaign.

A Secret Service agent spotted that man, Ryan Routh, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery before Trump came into view. Officials said Routh aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire and caused Routh to drop his weapon.

Routh was found guilty last year and sentenced this month to life in prison.

Trump also survived an assassination attempt at a Butler, Pennsylvania campaign rally. That gunman fired eight shots before being killed by a Secret Service counter sniper.

The White House referred all questions to the Secret Service and FBI.

There have been other recent incidents of political violence as well.

In the last year, there was the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk; the assassination of the Democratic leader in the Minnesota state House and her husband and the shooting of another lawmaker and his wife; and an arson attack at the official residence of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.

Starting at 9pm Sunday to noon Monday a " state of emergency closes the streets, highways and bridges of New York City for all traffic, cars, trucks, scooters and E-bikes," Mamdani told reporters.

The ban will not affect essential workers or New Yorkers needing to travel due to emergencies, according to Mamdani. New York is home to over eight million people.

"We are asking New Yorkers to avoid all non essential travel," the mayor said. "New York City has not faced a storm of this scale in the last decade."

The fast-developing storm is threatening to pummel the US East Coast with a foot or more of snow beginning Sunday, just weeks after the region recovered from another devastating weather system.

Meteorologists issued blizzard warnings for New York and parts of at least six states, warning Saturday that heavy snow and gale-force winds are forecast to slam all major cities along the densely populated Interstate 95 northeast corridor, including Boston, Philadelphia, and even Washington further south.

The NWS headquarters said snowfall rates of more than one inch (2.5 centimeters) an hour will occur at times along parts of the East Coast, with huge snow totals making travel nearly impossible. Power outages are likely.

The mega-storm that swept across the eastern half of the country in late January was linked to more than 100 deaths nationwide, and slammed some cities with heavy snow and sleet that froze into rock-hard ice.

New Jersey Governor Mikie Sherrill declared a state of emergency beginning midday Sunday, freeing up funds and allowing the swift deployment of resources to address the weather crisis.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 18:36:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/36401ff6-1016-11f1-a477-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-16T154615Z-26366006-RC23NJA9GDSB-RTRMADP-3-USA-WEATHER.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US-Iran talks expected on Thursday amid fears of strikes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260222-iran-us-talks-expected-thursday-despite-fears-of-strikes</link><description>Iranian officials held out hope for progress towards a deal to head off renewed conflict when talks with US negotiators resume on Thursday, despite a huge build-up of American military might in the Middle East .

Speaking to CBS News on Sunday, Iran 's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said details of a possible deal were being drawn up ahead of the renewed talks on Tehran's nuclear programme, as Washington's envoy Steve Witkoff pondered why Tehran had not yet "capitulated".

Badr Albusaidi, foreign minister of regional mediator Oman , said talks would resume on Thursday in Geneva "with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalising the deal".

US threats of military action have multiplied since a nationwide protest movement in Iran sparked a crackdown that rights groups say killed thousands. On Sunday, Iranian students held competing pro- and anti-government protests, with critics of the clerical leadership risking arrest or worse if they are caught.

"If the US attacks us, then we have every right to defend ourselves," Araghchi said, alluding to American interests in the region as potential targets.

Still, he said, "there is a good chance to have a diplomatic solution".

In a social media post, Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian likewise said previous talks "yielded encouraging signals".

After a recent round of discussions in Geneva, Iran said it was preparing a draft proposal for an agreement that would avert military action.

"I believe that when we meet, probably this Thursday in Geneva again, we can work on those elements and prepare a good text and come to a fast deal," Araghchi told CBS.

Axios had earlier reported, citing an unnamed senior US official, that if Iran submitted its proposal in the next 48 hours, Washington was ready to meet again later in the week "to start detailed negotiations".

The US has sent two aircraft carriers to the Middle East in recent weeks, along with other jets and ships, and has also shored up its air defences in the region to back up its threats of military intervention.

US President Donald Trump 's chief Middle East negotiator Witkoff said Saturday in a Fox News interview that the president was questioning why Iran had not yet given in to the pressure.

"He's curious as to why they haven't... I don't want to use the word 'capitulated', but why they haven't capitulated," he said.

"Why haven't they come to us and said, 'We profess we don't want a weapon, so here's what we're prepared to do'?"

Western governments fear Iran's nuclear programme is aimed at developing a bomb, which Tehran has long denied, though it insists on its right to enrich uranium for civilian purposes.

On the subject of uranium enrichment, Araghchi said Sunday that Iran had "every right to decide for ourselves".

A previous round of diplomacy last year was interrupted by Israel's bombing campaign against the Islamic republic.

That sparked a 12-day conflict in June that the US briefly joined with strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.

Despite the recent Oman-mediated talks, Iranians' fears of a new conflict have grown.

"I don't sleep well at night even while taking pills," Tehran resident Hamid told AFP.

IT technician Mina Ahmadvand, 46, believes that "at this stage, war between Iran and the US as well as Israel is inevitable".

"I don't want war to happen, but one should not fool around with the realities on the ground."

The concerns have prompted several foreign countries to urge their citizens to leave Iran, including Sweden , Serbia , Poland and Australia .

Iran has previously said that quickly striking a deal is in its interests if it means relief from sanctions that have hamstrung its economy, which contributed to protests late last year over the high cost of living.

Those demonstrations quickly expanded into mass anti-government protests that marked one of the largest challenges to the Islamic republic's leadership in years, prompting a deadly crackdown by authorities that saw thousands killed, according to rights groups.

On Sunday, Iranian students gathered for fresh pro- and anti-government rallies commemorating those killed following similar gatherings the day before.

Local and diaspora media outlets reported demonstrations at multiple Tehran universities, with some participants waving the flag of Iran's deposed monarchy, and others chanting "death to the shah", who was toppled by the 1979 Islamic revolution.

Trump had initially cheered on the protesters, threatening to intervene on their behalf amid the crackdown, but his threats soon shifted to Iran's nuclear programme.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 19:45:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/66cb2224-1002-11f1-b435-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/f71348986c04050477eebb50f46e22805504a2f0.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexican army kills drug lord 'El Mencho' during operation to capture him</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260222-mexican-army-kills-drug-kingpin-el-mencho-during-operation-to-capture-him</link><description>The Mexican army killed the leader of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, Nemesio Rubén Oseguera Cervantes, “El Mencho,” on Sunday, decapitating what had become Mexico 's most powerful cartel and giving the government its biggest prize yet to show the Trump administration for its efforts.

Oseguera Cervantes was wounded in an operation to capture him Sunday in Tapalpa, Jalisco about two hours drive southwest of Guadalajara Sunday and died while being flown to Mexico City, the Defense Department said in a statement. The state is the base of the cartel known for trafficking huge quantities of fentanyl and other drugs to the United States.

The ​Mexican Embassy in Washington ​said that the United ​States ‌provided information ⁠for the military ‌operation that resulted ⁠in the death.

"In addition to central military ‌intelligence efforts, complementary information ​was provided by US authorities within the framework ​of bilateral ​coordination and ​cooperation with the United ​States," the embassy said in a post on ⁠X.

During the operation, troops came under fire and killed four people at the location. Three more people, including Oseguera Cervantes, were wounded and later died, the statement said. Two others were arrested and armored vehicles, rocket launchers and other arms were seized. Three members of the armed forces were wounded and receiving medical treatment.

The killing of the powerful drug lord set off several hours of roadblocks with burning vehicles in Jalisco and other states. Such tactics are commonly used by the cartels to block military operations.

Videos circulating social media showed plumes of smoke billowing over the tourist city of Puerto Vallarta in Jalisco, and people sprinting through the airport of the state's capital in panic. On Sunday afternoon, Air Canada announced it was suspending flights to Puerto Vallarta “due to an ongoing security situation” and advised customers not to go to their airport.

The US State Department had offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest of El Mencho. The Jalisco New Generation Cartel, known as CJNG, is one of the most powerful and fastest growing criminal organizations in Mexico and was born in 2009.

In February, the Trump administration designated the cartel as a foreign terrorist organization.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum , like her predecessor, has criticized the “kingpin” strategy of previous administrations that took out cartel leaders only to trigger explosions of violence as cartels fractured. While she has remained popular in Mexico, security is a persistent concern and since US President Donald Trump took office a year ago, she has been under tremendous pressure to show results against drug trafficking .

The Jalisco cartel has been one of the most aggressive cartels in its attacks on the military — including on helicopters — and is a pioneer in launching explosives from drones and installing mines. In 2020, it carried out a spectacular assassination attempt with grenades and high-powered rifles in the heart of Mexico City against the then head of the capital’s police force and now federal security secretary.

The DEA considers the cartel to be as powerful as the Sinaloa cartel, one of Mexico's most infamous criminal groups, with a presence in all 50 US states. It is one of the main suppliers of cocaine to the US market and, like the Sinaloa cartel, earns billions from the production of fentanyl and methamphetamines. Sinaloa, however, has been weakened by infighting after the loss of its leaders Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada and Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán, both in US custody.

Oseguera Cervantes has been significantly involved in drug trafficking activities since the 1990s. He was convicted of conspiracy to distribute heroin in the US District Court for the Northern District of California in 1994 and served nearly three years in prison. Following his release from custody, Oseguera Cervantes returned to Mexico and reengaged in drug trafficking activity.

Since 2017, Oseguera Cervantes has been indicted several times in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.

The most recent superseding indictment, filed on April 5, 2022, charges Oseguera Cervantes with conspiracy and distribution of controlled substances (methamphetamine, cocaine , and fentanyl) for the purpose of illegal importation into the United States and use of firearms during and in connection with drug trafficking offenses. Oseguera Cervantes is also charged under the Drug Kingpin Enforcement Act for directing a continuing criminal enterprise.

The US State Department warned citizens in Jalisco, Tamaulipas, Michoacan, Guerrero and Nuevo Leon states to remain in safe places due to the ongoing security operations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 20:27:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ab701bf2-1019-11f1-bb84-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/WhatsApp-Image-2026-02-22-at-17-45-12.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'One Battle After Another' wins six BAFTA awards including best picture and director</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260222-one-battle-after-another-wins-six-bafta-awards-including-best-picture-and-director</link><description>Politically charged thriller “One Battle After Another” took six prizes, including best picture, at the British Academy Film Awards on Sunday, building momentum ahead of the Oscars next month.

Blues-steeped vampire epic “Sinners” and gothic horror story “Frankenstein” won three awards each, while Shakespearean family tragedy “Hamnet” was named best British film.

Jessie Buckley, as widely predicted, won the best actress prize for playing a grieving mother, and wife of William Shakespeare, Agnes Hathaway, in “Hamnet.”

In a major upset, Robert Aramayo took the best actor prize for the British indie film “I Swear,” beating stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Timothée Chalamet.

“One Battle After Another,” Paul Thomas Anderson’s explosive film about a group of revolutionaries in conflict with the state, won the awards for directing, adapted screenplay, cinematography, editing, and Sean Penn’s supporting performance.

“This is very overwhelming and wonderful,” Anderson said as he accepted the directing prize.

Hollywood stars and British celebrities, from Paddington Bear to the Princess of Wales , gathered Sunday for the awards, where “One Battle” and “Sinners” led the nominations.

“Sinners” took home trophies for original screenplay, musicals score and for Wunmi Mosaku's supporting actress performance.

Stars including DiCaprio, Chalamet, Emma Stone, Cillian Murphy, Glenn Close and Ethan Hawke were among those walking the red carpet outside London’s Royal Festival Hall before a black-tie ceremony hosted by Scottish actor Alan Cumming.

Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales also attended, three days after William’s uncle Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested by police and held for 11 hours over allegations he sent sensitive government information to the late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

The scandal has rocked the royal family led by King Charles III , though William and Kate remain popular standard-bearers for the monarchy. William is due to present an award in his role as president of the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

Among the biggest receptions from gathered fans was for Paddington, the puppet bear who stars in a musical stage adaption of the beloved children's classic.

“One Battle” went into the ceremony with 14 nominations, including best picture and acting nods for five of its cast. “Sinners” was just behind with 13, while “Hamnet” and the ping-pong odyssey “Marty Supreme”  each had 11 nominations.

Guillermo del Toro’s reimagining of “Frankenstein” and Norwegian family drama “ Sentimental Value” each got eight nominations.

“Frankenstein” took awards for production design, costume design and for the hair and makeup artists who spent 10 hours a day transforming Jacob Elordi into the movie's monstrous creature.

“Sentimental Value” won the prize for the best film not in English.

The British prizes, officially called the EE BAFTA Film Awards, often provide hints about who will win at Hollywood’s Academy Awards, held this year on March 15. In the Oscar nominations, “Sinners” leads the race with a record 16 nominations, followed by “One Battle After Another” with 13.

Cumming told the audience that it had been a strong year for cinema, if not a cheerful one, with nominated films tackling themes including child death, racism and political violence:  “Watching the films this year was like taking part in a collective nervous breakdown,” he said. “It’s almost as though there are events going on in the real world that are influencing filmmakers.”

The ceremony was more glitz than gloom, though, including a performance by Ejae, Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami — the voices of animated band HUNTR/X in box office juggernaut “KPop Demon Hunters” — singing the movie hit “Golden.”

The best-documentary prize went to “Mr. Nobody Against Putin,” about a Russian teacher who documented the propaganda imposed on Russian schools after the invasion of Ukraine.

The film's American director David Borenstein said that teacher Pavel Talankin had shown that “whether it’s in Russia or the streets of Minneapolis , we always face a moral choice," referring to the protests against U.S. immigration enforcement in Minnesota.

“We need more Mr. Nobodies,” he said.

It beat documentaries including Mstyslav Chernov’s harrowing Ukraine war portrait “2000 Meters to Andriivka, ” co-produced by The Associated Press and Frontline PBS.

Most BAFTA winners are chosen by 8,500 members of the U.K. academy of industry professionals. Contenders for the Rising Star award — the only prize decided by public vote and a reliable picker of future A-listers — are Infiniti, Aramayo, “Sinners” star Miles Caton and British actors Archie Madekwe and Posy Sterling.

Donna Langley, the U.K.-born chairwoman of NBCUniversal Entertainment, will be awarded the British Academy’s highest honor, the BAFTA fellowship.

The ceremony airs on BBC in the United Kingdom starting at 7 p.m. (1900 GMT) and on E! in the U.S. at 8 p.m. EST.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 21:24:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d6b06126-102f-11f1-ad01-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-22T204244Z-1537798327-RC27RJAPGGWU-RTRMADP-3-BRITAIN-AWARDS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea’s Kim re-elected Workers’ Party general secretary at congress</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260222-north-korea-kim-re-elected-ruling-party-congress</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been re-elected as the general secretary of the ruling Workers' Party at a rare congress, state media said Monday.

The decision was made Sunday -- day four of the congress -- "in accordance with the unshakable will and unanimous desire of all the delegates", the Korean Central News Agency said.

Under the leadership of Kim, "the war deterrence of the country with the nuclear forces as its pivot has been radically improved," the KCNA report said.

Held just once every five years, the days-long party congress offers a rare glimpse into the workings of a nation where even mundane details are shrouded in secrecy.

The gathering directs state efforts on everything from house building to war planning.

In his speech to open the congress on Thursday, Kim vowed to lift living standards, offering a glimpse of the economic strains affecting his sanctions-hit nation.

"Today, our party is faced with heavy and urgent historic tasks of boosting economic construction and the people's standard of living and transforming all realms of state and social life as early as possible," Kim said.

For decades, nuclear weapons and military prowess came before everything else in North Korea, even as food stocks dried up and famine took hold.

But since assuming power in 2011, Kim has stressed the need to also fortify the impoverished nation's economy.

At the last party congress in 2021, Kim made an extremely rare admission that mistakes had been made in "almost all areas" of economic development.

Kim has already declared this year's congress will unveil the next phase in the nation's nuclear weapons programme.

State media reported Monday that during Sunday's session, the party also voted to revise its own rules with a view towards "consolidating the Party ranks in a qualitative way" and ensuring "impartiality in applying the Party discipline."

It is just the ninth time the Workers' Party congress has convened under the Kim family's decades-long rule.

The meeting was shelved under Kim's father Kim Jong Il, but was revived in 2016.

Kim has spent years stoking his cult of personality in reclusive North Korea, and the congress offers another chance to demonstrate his absolute grip on power.</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Feb 2026 22:51:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/46390ed0-0dfb-11f1-b135-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/fe8d51f9b497850fc75fbfe59da30e879a1802be.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over 200 Venezuelan political prisoners launch hunger strike over amnesty law exclusions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260222-200-venezuelan-political-prisoners-hunger-strike-amnesty-law-exclusions</link><description>More than 200 Venezuelan political prisoners were on hunger strike Sunday to demand their release under a new amnesty law that excludes many of them.

The amnesty was approved by Venezuela's congress on Thursday as part of a wave of reforms encouraged by the United States after it ousted and captured former president Nicolas Maduro on January 3.

The hunger strike began Friday night at the Rodeo I prison on the outskirts of Caracas. Inmates complained they would not benefit from the law because it excludes cases involving the military, which are the most common ones at that facility.

"Approximately 214 people in total, including Venezuelans and foreigners, are on hunger strike," said Yalitza Garcia, mother-in-law of a prisoner named Nahuel Agustin Gallo.

Gallo, an Argentine police officer, is accused of terrorism, another category that is excluded.

"They decided Friday to go on hunger strike because of the scope of the amnesty law, which excludes many of them," said Shakira Ibarreto, daughter of a policeman arrested in 2024.

On Sunday, a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) visited the Rodeo I prison.

"This is the first time they have allowed us to approach that prison," Filippo Gatti, the ICRC's health coordinator for Venezuela, told family members. "It's a first step, and I think we're on the right track."

Not all the inmates at the prison were joining the hunger strike, the relatives said.

The amnesty law was engineered by interim leader Delcy Rodriguez under pressure from Washington after US commandos attacked Venezuela on January 3, snatched Maduro and his wife and took them to the United States for trial on drug trafficking charges.

Opposition figures have criticized the new legislation, which appears to include carve-outs for some offenses previously used by authorities to target Maduro's political opponents.

It explicitly does not apply to those prosecuted for "promoting" or "facilitating... armed or forceful actions" against Venezuela's sovereignty by foreign actors.

Rodriguez has leveled such accusations against opposition leader and Nobel peace laureate Maria Corina Machado , who hopes to return to Venezuela at some point from the United States.

The law also excludes members of the security forces convicted of activities related to what the government considered terrorism.

But the amnesty extends to 11,000 political prisoners who, over nearly three decades, were paroled or placed under house arrest.

More than 1,500 political prisoners in Venezuela have already applied for amnesty under the bill, the head of the country's legislature said Saturday.

Hundreds of others had already been released by Rodriguez's government before the amnesty bill was approved.

On Sunday, a group of five people were released from Rodeo I, carrying release papers in their hands. They were greeted with applause.

The NGO Foro Penal, dedicated to the defense of political prisoners, reported 23 releases on Sunday.

The one-term president from 2007 to 2012 has faced a series of legal challenges since leaving office, receiving two definitive convictions in recent years.

"A request to merge sentences is an extremely routine procedure in this situation," his lawyer Vincent Desry told AFP.

In December 2024, he exhausted his last legal recourse in the so-called "Bismuth" case over trying to extract favours from a judge and served a sentence with an electronic ankle tag that was removed in May last year after several months -- allowed due to the then-70-year-old's age.

In November last year, he received his second final conviction in what is known as the "Bygmalion" case over illegal financing of his failed 2012 re-election bid, with France's highest court upholding a sentence of six months with an electronic tag.

During a closed hearing on Monday, the former head of state will ask that his six month custodial sentence in the Bygmalion case be considered served by virtue of the electronic tag he wore last year in connection with the Bismuth case.

The request is only possible if various criteria are met, including that the sentences in separate proceedings be of the same nature and have exhausted all appeals.

A decision on the request can be deliberated and appealed.

Nicolas Sarkozy will again be in court from March 16, for the appeal of another case against him related to alleged Libyan funding in his earlier election campaign.

He served 20 days in jail in that case late last year, making him the first post-war French leader to serve time behind bars, before his release pending appeal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 02:10:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/baf3ecd8-cdcb-11f0-b0b6-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-86AP7VG.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China calls on US to cancel Trump-era tariffs following Supreme Court ruling</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260223-china-us-cancel-trump-era-tariffs-supreme-court</link><description>China urged the United States on Monday to cancel unilateral tariffs announced by President Donald Trump after the US Supreme Court struck down many of his measures.

The court ruled six to three on Friday that Trump does not have the authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 law he has relied on to impose sudden levies on individual countries, upending global trade.

Trump reacted furiously, announcing first a new 10 percent global duty on imports under a different legal authority, before raising it to 15 percent on Saturday.

China's commerce ministry said on Monday it was conducting a "comprehensive assessment" of the ruling's impact, and called on Washington to lift the tariffs .

"China urges the United States to cancel its unilateral tariff measures on its trading partners," the ministry said in a statement. "There are no winners in a trade war and that protectionism leads nowhere."

The new 15 percent global duties are due to kick in on Tuesday, and are expected to last 150 days with exemptions for some products.

The Chinese foreign ministry also noted that it was paying "close attention" to potential moves by the United States to maintain increased tariffs.

"The United States is currently planning alternative measures such as trade investigations in order to maintain increased tariffs on trading partners. China will continue to pay close attention to this and resolutely safeguard China's interests," it said.

The Supreme Court ruling was a stunning rebuke to Trump from a judicial body that has largely sided with him since his return to office.

It marked a major political setback in striking down his signature economic policy that has roiled the global trade order.

Several countries have said they are studying the Supreme Court ruling and Trump's subsequent tariff announcements.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer told US media on Sunday that the country's trade deals with China, the European Union and other partners will remain in force despite the ruling.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 04:35:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7983be80-ed66-11f0-94f2-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Xi-Jinping-Trump-000-82G693V.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly Russian drone attack targets Zaporizhzhia as strikes intensify across Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260223-deadly-russian-drone-attack-targets-zaporizhzhia-as-strikes-intensify-across-ukraine</link><description>A Russian drone attack on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed one man and wounded another early Monday, the regional military chief said.

The killing of Jalisco New Generation Cartel leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes during an attempt to capture him in Jalisco state was the highest-profile blow against cartels since the recapture of former Sinaloa cartel boss Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzman a decade ago.

Following Oseguera Cervantes' death, gunmen unleashed violence across the country. Cars burned out by cartel members blocked roads in 20 Mexican states and left smoke billowing into the air. People locked themselves in their homes in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city and Jalisco's capital, and school was canceled Monday in several states as security forces were placed on alert all over the country. Even Guatemala reinforced security on its border with Mexico.

The killing could give the government a leg up in its dealings with the US Trump administration, which has been threatening tariffs or unilateral military action if Mexico does not show results in the fight against the cartels.

But the long-term effect on Mexico's security landscape remains unclear.

Here's what to know:

Oseguera Cervantes, better known as “El Mencho,” was 59 years old and originally from the western state of Michoacan. His ties to organised crime went back at least three decades.

In 1994, he was tried for trafficking heroin in the US and sent to prison for three years. Upon returning to Mexico, he quickly rose through Mexico's drug trafficking underworld.

Around 2009, he founded the Jalisco New Generation Cartel, which became Mexico's fastest-growing criminal organisation, moving cocaine , methamphetamines, fentanyl and migrants to the United States, and innovating in violence with the use of drones and improvised explosive devices.

The cartel earned a reputation for brazen attacks on Mexican security forces, including downing a military helicopter in Jalisco in 2015 and attempting a spectacular, but unsuccessful, assassination of Mexico City Police Chief Omar Garcia Harfuch, who is now Mexico's federal security secretary.

It recruited aggressively, experimenting with new ways to reach potential members online, and generated revenue through fuel theft, extortion and timeshare fraud , among other activities.

Oseguera Cervantes was killed during an attempt to capture him, as his followers attempted to fight off Mexican troops.

Mexico's Defense Department said in a statement that the army launched an operation in the southern part of Jalisco state to capture Oseguera Cervantes, involving the Mexican Air Force and special forces.

The cartel counterattacked, and in the ensuing confrontation, federal forces killed four members of the criminal group, and wounded three others, including its leader, who died later during transfer by air to Mexico City, according to the statement.

Three soldiers were injured and two people were detained in the action. Rocket launchers capable of shooting down aircraft and destroying armored vehicles were seized at the scene.

Oseguera Cervantes' will help Mexico's government show results to the US, which is pressuring its neighbour to pursue drug cartels more aggressively. Both countries said intelligence collaboration helped lead to Sunday's operation.

Oseguera Cervantes was facing multiple indictments in the United States and the US State Department had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest. The Trump administration designated his cartel and others foreign terrorist organisations a year ago.

US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who was US ambassador to Mexico during the first Trump administration, applauded the operation via X, writing “The good guys are stronger than the bad guys. Congratulations to the forces of law and order in the great Mexican nation.”

Mike Vigil, former chief of international operations for the DEA, said Mexico had sent a “a strong message to Donald Trump's administration that they are fighting aggressively and effectively” against the most powerful cartels. He added that “the majority of the information came from the Mexican armed forces and all credit goes to Mexico".

It's not clear who will succeed Oseguera Cervantes, or if any one person can.

The Jalisco cartel has a presence in at least 21 of Mexico's 32 states and is active in almost all of the United States, according to the US Drug Enforcement Administration. But it is also a global organisation and the loss of its leader could be felt well beyond Mexico.

“El Mencho controlled everything, he was like a country's dictator,” Vigil said.

His absence could slow the cartel's rapid growth and expansion and leave it initially weakened against the Sinaloa cartel on several fronts where they or their proxies are fighting. The Sinaloa is locked in its own internal power struggle, however, between the sons of “El Chapo” and the faction loyal to Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada, who is in US custody.

Vigil said Mexico should seize the moment to launch “an effective frontal assault based on intelligence".

“This is a big opportunity for Mexico and the United States if they work together,” he said.

Security analyst David Saucedo said that if relatives of Oseguera Cervantes take control of the cartel, the violence seen Sunday could continue. If others take power, they could be more willing to turn the page and continue operations.

The greatest fear would be that the cartel turns to indiscriminate violence. They could decide to “launch narcoterrorism attacks ... and generate a scenario similar to what Colombia lived in the 1990s", a full-on attack against the government “car bombs, assassinations and attacks on aircraft".</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 07:37:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/06ef6dc6-104b-11f1-a7c0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/FOTO-PORTADA-MEXICO-VIOLENCIA-JALISCO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Love doesn't die with death': How four years of war have reshaped relationships in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260223-love-doesn-t-die-with-death-how-four-years-of-war-have-reshaped-relationships-in-ukraine</link><description>How to love amid the uncertainty of war? It takes on many forms in Maryna Kumeda’s book, “Love in Wartime”. From Izium and Kharkiv to Kyiv , Sloviansk, and Lviv, she traveled across Ukraine to meet people and document how they love in these peculiar times.

Kumeda, 41, saw many kinds of love: There was the love of Ukrainians for their homeland, the fraternity and sorority among soldiers fighting in same unit, the love of mothers who join defence groups against Russian drones so their children never have to take up arms one day to defend their country themselves. Kumeda, who was born in Sumy, decided to join the Ukrainian army herself after writing the book.

There were also many divorces and separations. A general trend suggests that after a “boom” in marriages linked to the beginning of the full-scale war in 2022, the number of marriages decreased every year compared to the previous year.

"War accentuates all the cracks: if the ties are solid, it doesn’t destroy them, but if there is already a crack, it widens,” said Ania, one of the people interviewed in the book. War also accelerates decisions, and marriages take place spontaneously in the space of two hours – the time of leave of absence given to soldiers.

On the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, FRANCE 24 spoke to Kumeda about the different ways love manifests itself during war and its capacity to transcend borders and even death.

I wasn’t in Ukraine when Russia launched its full-scale invasion on February 24, 2022. I had been living abroad (in France) for 17 years, so I didn’t know the practices were in love “before the war”. It was only after I returned to Ukraine in January 2024 that I starting dating other Ukrainians and talking to them about love and relationships.

People of course evoke changes in the intensity of their relationships. The most important consequence of the war is that is takes away the future. It’s impossible to make plans during the war and this has a huge impact on the way people make decisions.

It can go in both directions. There was a fall in the number of births with so many people leaving abroad. Cracks began to appear in certain relationships. One party says, “this marriage doesn’t respond to my expectations", and it ends in divorce.

Yet relationships are also forged faster, especially among soldiers. We hurry so we can live. It’s biological, with the hormones and the stress. You might have one day out of 3 months to spend in Kyiv. So you rush to see an exhibition, go to the movies ... and some people get married.

Sacha and Victoria are a couple who I wrote about in my book. They met in Izium in November 2024, where Sacha was stationed with the III assault brigade. By September 2025, Sacha was sent back to the front and disappeared. Victoria hasn’t had any news from him for six months. She believes he is alive and free but he could be dead or in captivity.

They get to the essential much quicker. When you are a soldier, you are deprived of normality, like having a shower or getting tenderness. So you are frank about your needs. I met a man online whose wife lived in Poland . He was looking for experiences: an exhibition, a concert or a discussion in a bar. We talked about our lives. I told him I was looking for romantic meetings, while he wanted company for all the activities he used to engage in during his past civilian life.

Part of the family culture in Ukraine means protecting loved ones from the harsh reality. A man will say, “I can’t tell my wife what I’m going through. She doesn’t want to know this." People will either lie or avoid telling their loved ones the truth. Men who don’t tell their wives they are on the front lines believe that no one could ever understand, except for his comrades.

Ania is someone who fought to stay happy in her relationship with Tocha, a soldier. I would ask her, “Why don’t you ask him questions?” and she would say, “What for? He would tell a few stories and it was already enough. The combats, the cadavers, the bombings.”

This difference in emotional experience is becoming problematic among couples. Today there are manuals and video conferences on how to talk to members of the armed forces: the experiences between them and civilians are so opposed that it's easy to say something wrong or hurtful. When a soldier leaves on a mission for example, people often tell them, "take care of yourself". Yet as a soldier, I'm not there to preserve myself. I'm there to complete a mission. I prefer to say, "be strong".

Seen from France, their story could be misinterpreted as one of a bridge between a Russian and a Ukrainian. Yet as Slava says, Lisa is more of a (Ukrainian) patriot than him. They went through many administrative obstacles, especially because of Lisa’s passport. The couple recently announced to me that they are expecting a child. I used their story to illustrate hope and not just tragedy.

Animals are a source of tenderness. Consider the words of Oleksandr: “If you think an adult man doesn’t need to have his head caressed for half an hour in silence, you are wrong.” Animals help fill this gap. During my military training, we’ve been spending a certain amount of time with cats. Everyone needs their dose of oxytocin [a hormone essential for emotional bonding in humans]

Dogs can be dangerous on the front lines because they can reveal the presence of soldiers. Yet cats are being adopted in combat zones. There are also many stories of women and men who don’t want to leave their homes near battle lines because it would mean leaving their animals behind.

I was working on a report about posthumous medically assisted procreation (MAP) in Ukraine. I sent out a message to a group on WhatsApp of wives of soldiers who had died in battle. Marta not only accepted to speak to me, but said it would be a way for her to think about how to explain to her daughter the conditions around her birth.

Marta would not stop talking about love. She would say: “I did this out of love, even if I was scared. He badly wanted a child and we wouldn’t have had the embryos without all his efforts.” She showed me videos of her husband on her phone. Her daughter clearly has the same eyes as him. This is a story of posthumous MAP but it’s a love story all the same. Love doesn’t die with death.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 10:52:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/55eaf71c-108f-11f1-817e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24055700909825.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portrait of a drug lord: ‘El Mencho’, Mexico's most feared cartel kingpin</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260223-portrait-of-a-drug-lord-el-mencho-mexico-s-most-feared-cartel-kingpin</link><description>Nemesio Oseguera, the head of Mexico 's Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) who was killed by the army on Sunday, challenged the state like few others in his bid to consolidate power.

Nicknamed "El Mencho", the 59-year-old and his cartel ambushed police officers, attacked the capital's security chief on his home turf and even shot down a military helicopter.

Oseguera was considered the last of the drug lords who acted in the flashy, brutal mold of the now-imprisoned Joaquin " El Chapo " Guzman and Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada.

The United States had listed him as its most-wanted drug trafficker , offering a $15 million reward for his capture.

Oseguera was born in Aguililla, a town in the western Mexican state of Michoacan, the gateway to a harsh mountainous region where illegal marijuana plantations flourished in his childhood.

As a young man, he emigrated to the United States, where he was arrested, jailed and deported for heroin trafficking.

On returning to Mexico, he joined the Milenio criminal cartel. Infighting later forced him out of Michoacan, as one faction allied itself with Los Zetas, a group founded by former elite soldiers who imposed terror across the region.

Oseguera took refuge in neighbouring Jalisco state. In 2009, with the Sinaloa cartel, he formed the Matazetas – "Zeta Killers" – which rose to notoriety two years later with the slaying of dozens of people with ties to that group.

Oseguera later broke away to found the CJNG. After the extradition of Guzman and Zambada to the United States, he transformed his cartel into the most powerful in Mexico.

The group maintained a vast network of hitmen – even making its own weapons – and expanded into several Mexican states.

Last year, the US State Department designated the CJNG as a terrorist organisation, accusing it of illegal fentanyl and migrant trafficking , extortion, oil and mineral theft, and arms dealing.

Jose Reveles, a writer specializing in the drug trade, told AFP that Oseguera had a "violent nature" and did not shy away from challenging all levels of government, unlike other cartels, which tended to use violence defensively.

In 2020, Oseguera ordered an unprecedented attack on the then-chief of the Mexico City police, Omar Garcia Harfuch, wounding him and killing three others. Garcia Harfuch is now the country's head of public security.

During a wave of terror in Jalisco in 2015, CJNG gunmen ambushed members of the national gendarmerie and a state police convoy on a highway, using an RPG to shoot down a military helicopter.

Dozens of people were killed, including 20 police officers and nine soldiers.

Oseguera carved a path to power through violence and bloodshed, but for a long time he could not compete with the cartels that controlled the border region with the United States.

Instead, he targeted other markets and diversified his drug offerings.

"Europe, Asia, Africa and even Australia were less contested by Mexicans, and they pay more for drugs there," said Reveles.

Oseguera maintained a low profile for years, though he appeared on screen at two music concerts last year.

"He was very careful not to appear in public, and little is known about his life," said Reveles.

Few photos of Oseguera are in circulation. On the US State Department's reward card, he appears with a sharp face, neatly combed hair and a thin mustache.

But in a 1989 profile by the US Drug Enforcement Administration, he has frizzy hair and rougher features.

Oseguera married Rosalinda Gonzalez Valencia in the 1990s, and the couple had three children before divorcing.

Gonzalez Valencia was released from prison last year after reportedly serving time for suspicious payments related to a car wash she owned. Her current whereabouts are unclear.

Eldest son Ruben Oseguera Gonzalez, known as "El Menchito", was jailed for life by the United States last year on drug- and firearms-related crimes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 10:52:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f020a1fc-10a2-11f1-93fc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-22T205910Z-969491302-RC20RJA9SLOE-RTRMADP-3-MEXICO-VIOLENCE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gazans face impossible wait at Rafah crossing to Egypt</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260223-gazans-face-impossible-wait-rafah-crossing-egypt</link><description>Most of the videos posted online since the partial reopening of the Rafah crossing , which links the Gaza Strip and Egypt , on February 2, are celebratory: they show Gazans returning home to bouquets, dances and tearful crowds of journalists and family members. The reopening of this crucial border crossing, which had been closed since it was taken by the Israeli Army in May 2024, was part of the Gaza peace plan signed on October 9 by the warring parties.

After going through a number of checkpoints, Palestinians who want to return to the Gaza Strip are bussed across the border, accompanied by UN personnel and by men wearing Egyptian colours, as documented in photos taken by Al Jazeera correspondent Hani al-Shaer.

The partial border reopening has also meant that some Gazans seeking medical treatment for serious injuries or illnesses have been able to travel to Egypt for medical care. The UN reported that only 14 of the 36 hospitals in the Gaza Strip were operational by October 2025, after the Israeli Army had carried out at least 700 attacks on Gazan health centres since operations began in October 2023.

The story of patients being allowed to cross into Egypt for medical care was covered by both local and international press who are able to access the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing. The Palestinian side of the crossing, which is still within the “yellow line” controlled by Israel , remains inaccessible to foreign media.

However, the number of people allowed to travel in both directions is still minuscule and not reflective of the need. EUBAM , a European mission tasked with observing and assisting with the operations of Palestinian authorities in Rafah, said there are only 80 to 100 crossings a day. The numbers are roughly split between people seeking to voluntarily return to the Gaza Strip and people seeking to leave Gaza for urgent medical care. No more than two family members are allowed to accompany the patients.

Around 20,000 Gazans are waiting to receive medical care abroad, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. At the current rate of crossings, it would take more than a year to get all of these people to health facilities abroad.

The daily trickle of evacuations has created a difficult situation for people who need medical care outside of the Gaza Strip. That’s the case for 10-year-old Ibrahim – whose name has been changed to protect his anonymity – who became paraplegic after his spine was injured in an Israeli bomb attack in the summer of 2025. One of his arms was also amputated. His family shared both images and medical documents with our team.

Khadija (not her real name), his mother, wants to travel to Egypt with him as soon as possible so that her son can receive medical care.

"My son can’t walk. He is currently in a hospital focused on rehabilitation. But because of a shortage of beds, he can only stay here for two or three months even though he needs six to seven months of care. That means that before his condition can improve, he will have to return to suffering in our tent.

He also needs a new prosthetic hand. One was made for him at the Jordanian hospital here in the Gaza Strip, but it doesn’t work for him. It caused an inflammation, so he won’t wear it and can’t use it for his rehabilitation therapy.

That’s why we are hoping that he can cross so that he can continue his treatment abroad and get a new prosthetic. Moreover, his father is already in Egypt – he left before the war. He wants to see his son and his son wants to see him."

Thus far, Ibrahim has not been one of those lucky enough to be evacuated. His mother is afraid that he will remain trapped in the Gaza Strip for months.

"His name hasn’t been selected. We are suffering, waiting for our turn to leave.

They reopened the crossing, but it is like nothing is actually happening because they are letting so few people through. Some people who have been able to leave told us that they have been on the list for two years. How long will my son have to wait?”

On the other side of the Rafah crossing, in Egypt, journalist Hamza Chalan is also waiting. Chalan wants to return to his homeland, which he left in May 2024, just a few days before Israel took control of the Rafah border crossing and crossings became impossible. He was one of the first people to sign up for voluntary return at the Palestinian embassy in Cairo.

"I went to Cairo with my parents just before it became impossible to cross. It was very expensive [Editor’s note: he says it was several thousand euros], but my father needed dialysis, which was no longer available in Gaza. He died last year.”

Alongside the loss, Hamza Chalan says that he also wants to return to Gaza because he finds it nearly impossible to make ends meet in Egypt. He says he had to sell some of his professional equipment to pay for food and accommodation.

"Going to Egypt was the right decision, I don’t regret it. But I am at the end of my savings, and because I don’t have the right documents, I am unable to work here. So we are surviving month to month.

In Gaza, I will be able to work as a journalist again. While I was there, I was working for Danish National Television, I was part of the production team on a documentary , and I worked as a correspondent for other media outlets. I want to go back to doing what I love. Returning to Gaza is a difficult decision when you don’t have work there, but that’s not my situation.

I also have family responsibilities in Gaza. I have eight sisters who stayed there, and they need help. My mother will be 70 soon and she wants to see her daughters.”

Hamza Chalan has looked into the many searches and checks that you must undergo to return. He says he is looking at them with a mix of fear and optimism.

"From what I’ve heard from colleagues who have already crossed, you first have to go through Egyptian checkpoints and then Palestinian checkpoints, run by the Palestinian Authority [Editor’s note: the Palestinian Authority is based in the West Bank. Gaza’s government is controlled by Hamas]. Then, I’ve heard that armed gangs look through your luggage. They will hardly let you take anything across – I know, for example, that I won’t be able to bring back my journalistic equipment. They interrogate you as well – you are at their mercy. Then, finally, they bring you to the Israelis, where you have to go through the same thing.

I’m not worried about their questions. I am not involved in anything political or any armed group. But if any member of your family is linked to something, then it can all go very badly. The gangs are made up of people who escaped from prison. The crossing is very risky, but here, we are facing death by a thousand cuts anyway."

Our team has already documented the existence of armed gangs in Gaza, some of which are supported by the Israeli Army and operate in areas under its control. At least one of these gangs is run by a former convict , Yasser Abu Shabab, a former drug dealer. He has since been killed in a clash in December 2025.

We haven’t been able to independently verify several eyewitness accounts that these gangs are operating at the Rafah crossing. We will publish the information we are gathering on the topic as soon as possible.

"I am waiting, but I don’t even know if I will be able to cross into Gaza. If I am rejected in Egypt, that will really be crazy. It’s the worst time in my life – I have no real choice, no freedom, everything is outside of my control. As a Palestinian, I have no right to self-determination. But we still put one foot in front of the other, still hold on to hope.”

The Kavimvira post on Lake Tanganyika, which is vital for the region's economy, was closed in December as the Rwanda-backed AFC/M23 launched a new drive for territory in eastern DR Congo.

Authorities on the Congo side and a Burundi police official at the frontier confirmed that the crossing had reopened.

The frontier post is on the main road from the Burundi economic capital Bujumbura and the DR Congo city of Uvira. Experts said the AFC/M23 offensive in December, aiming for Uvira, intended to cut Burundi's military support for DR Congo forces.

Tens of thousands of Congolese fled into Burundi because of the offensive.

Economic contacts went ahead across Lake Tanganyika and the AFC/M23 withdrew from Uvira in South Kivu province in January, citing a demand from the United States, which has been seeking to mediate between DR Congo and Rwanda in the latest conflict to hit eastern DR Congo.

The mineral-rich region has been stricken by three decades of violent turmoil, the latest of which blew up after the resurgence of the Rwanda-backed AFC/M23 in 2021.

With the DR Congo army back in control of Uvira, authorities felt confident to reopen the frontier.

South Kivu governor Jean-Jacques Purusi said it had reopened at 8am on Monday. A Burundi border police official told AFP, on condition of anonymity: "We can see a lot of Congolese returning home" across the frontier.

Other Burundi-DR Congo border posts in zones where the AFC/M23 forces are deployed remain closed, the sources said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 13:05:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4833a23e-10af-11f1-af35-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-884D4M3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine: Europe on the front line</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260223-ukraine-europe-on-the-front-line</link><description>But the EU 's support faces considerable challenges: a humanitarian emergency, destroyed energy infrastructure, nearly 9.4 million displaced persons within Ukraine , and rule-of-law issues.

US District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was nominated to the bench by Trump, granted a request from the Republican president to keep under wraps the report on a criminal investigation once seen as posing significant legal peril to Trump.

Smith and his team produced a two-volume report on investigations into Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election after he lost to Joe Biden and his retention of classified documents at his estate in Palm Beach, Florida , after he left the White House following his first term.

Both investigations produced indictments that were abandoned by Smith’s team after Trump’s November 2024 election win in light of longstanding Justice Department legal opinions that say sitting presidents cannot face federal prosecution.

Cannon, who in 2024 dismissed the case after concluding that Smith was unlawfully appointed, said the release of the report would present a “manifest injustice” to Trump and his two co-defendants.

“Special Counsel Smith, acting without lawful authority, obtained an indictment in this action and initiated proceedings that resulted in a final order of dismissal of all charges,” she wrote. “As a result, the former defendants in this case, like any other defendant in this situation, still enjoy the presumption of innocence held sacrosanct in our constitutional order.”

She said that though it is true that special counsels have historically released reports at the conclusion of their work, they have done so either after electing not to bring charges in a particular case or “after adjudications of guilt by plea or trial ".

“The Court strains to find a situation in which a former special counsel has released a report after initiating criminal charges that did not result in a finding of guilt, at least not in a situation like this one, where the defendants contested the charges from the outset and still proclaim their innocence.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 16:28:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ab21d148-10cf-11f1-a6cc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26022740363058.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU lawmakers to freeze US trade deal after Supreme Court strikes down Trump's tariffs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260223-eu-lawmakers-to-freeze-us-trade-deal-after-supreme-court-ruling</link><description>European Union lawmakers were set Monday to freeze their approval of a key trade deal with the United States after a Supreme Court ruling struck down many of US President Donald Trump's tariffs.

The European Union and US clinched a deal in July last year that saw Washington impose 15 percent duties on most European goods .

The European Parliament 's trade committee had been due to vote Tuesday on removing tariffs on US industrial goods – a key step toward implementing Europe's side of the deal.

But parliament negotiators convened an urgent meeting for Monday to decide whether to delay their green light, and lawmakers from the main political groups told AFP they backed putting the deal on ice until it is clearer what the US ruling means.

Both lawmakers and the EU's executive are seeking to understand the impact for the bloc, with US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer telling US media Sunday that deals with China , the EU and other partners will remain in force.

European Commission spokesman Olof Gill said Brussels could not take further decisions until it had further clarity from the US.

"We look forward to our American counterparts explaining to us precisely what is happening," Gill told reporters in Brussels .

The Supreme Court ruled Trump does not have the authority to impose tariffs under a 1977 law he has relied on, triggering uncertainty compounded after the president reacted angrily with a new 15 percent global duty.

The new 15 percent global duties are due to kick in on Tuesday, with exemptions for some products. They will expire in 150 days unless Congress extends them.

China on Monday urged the US to cancel the unilateral tariffs , while several countries are studying the Supreme Court ruling and Trump's subsequent tariff announcements.

After Friday's ruling, Trump responded first with a new 10 percent global duty on imports under a different legal authority, before raising it to 15 percent.

Under the EU-US trade agreement, Washington had also agreed a blanket 15 percent tariff on most goods from the bloc, but his latest move could in reality see the EU face higher levies.

That is because the new duties would come on top of existing ones of a few percent, known as "most favoured nation" tariffs.

According to Jacob Funk Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute For International Economics, this could mean most EU manufactured goods would now be subject to, on average, 17 or 18 percent tariffs instead of 15 percent.

"There continues to be potentially significant benefits for the EU to keeping the Turnberry agreement in place," he added, referring to the EU-US deal.

The Supreme Court ruling was a stunning rebuke to Trump from a judicial body that has largely sided with him since his return to office.

It marked a major political setback in striking down his signature economic policy that has roiled the global trade order.

Despite the uncertainty triggered, Kirkegaard said the overall situation for Europe – and beyond – was "much better" after the ruling.

"The Supreme Court has reduced Donald Trump 's personal capacity to do tariffs by tweet," Kirkegaard told AFP. While tariffs can still be imposed, it would be through a process that would provide more predictability, he said.

China 's commerce ministry said it was conducting a "comprehensive assessment" of the ruling's impact, and called on Washington to lift the tariffs.

"There are no winners in a trade war and protectionism leads nowhere."

China's foreign ministry also noted it was paying "close attention" to potential moves by the US to maintain increased tariffs.

Beijing 's warning comes weeks ahead of Trump's planned visit to China, which would be his first in his second term.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 16:28:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0eb309e0-10ce-11f1-b593-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25266612203039.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary blocks EU Ukraine loan, Russia sanctions on eve of war anniversary</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260223-hungary-blocks-eu-ukraine-loan-russia-sanctions-on-eve-of-war-anniversary</link><description>Hungary maintained its veto on Monday on new ​EU sanctions on Russia and a huge loan for Ukraine amid a dispute over oil supplies, in a blow to Europe's pro-Ukrainian consensus on the eve of the war's fourth anniversary.

On the ground in Ukraine, Kyiv claimed a rare frontline advance, though Moscow continued its campaign of targeting Ukrainian cities , killing two people in drone strikes in the south.

The diplomatic spotlight was on Brussels, where European foreign ministers tried unsuccessfully to persuade Budapest not to punish ​Ukraine for delays restarting the ‌flow of Russian oil to Hungary via a Soviet-era pipeline .

Soon after, another of Ukraine's EU neighbours, Slovakia , said it would refuse any requests from Kyiv for emergency electricity ⁠supplies from Monday until oil flows resume via the Druzhba pipeline.

Potentially escalating the crisis further, Ukraine said its drones struck a Russian pumping station overnight serving the pipeline. It was set up to supply Moscow's crude through Ukraine to eastern Europe, but shipments to Slovakia and Hungary have been cut off since January ‌27.

"We have not reached an agreement on the 20th sanctions package," EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters. "This is a ⁠setback and a message we didn't want to send today, but the work continues."

European Council President Antonio Costa urged Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban to honour an EU deal for a €90 billion ($106.11 billion) loan to Ukraine.

But he replied in a letter that Ukraine could restart the oil flows if it wanted.

"I am not in a position to ​support any decision whatsoever favourable to Ukraine until they return to normality," he said.

Ukraine alleges the oil flows stopped after a Russian attack on pipeline infrastructure in January and ‌it is fixing the damage as fast as it can.

But Slovakia and Hungary – who have the EU's only two refineries that still rely on oil via Druzhba – say Ukraine is to blame for the outage, in one of the angriest disputes yet between the three neighbours.

Hungary and Slovakia both have leaders who have bucked the European consensus by maintaining close relations with Moscow, but have previously stopped short of blocking EU sanctions on Russia or loans to Ukraine.

Russian ‌President Vladimir Putin 's decision to send his forces into Ukraine on February 24, 2022, triggered Europe 's deadliest conflict since World War Two. Russian forces have killed or wounded tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilians and destroyed Ukrainian cities. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides have died or been wounded.

In the war's first ​year, Ukraine forced back the Russian offensive at the gates of Kyiv and reclaimed swathes of occupied land. But a Ukrainian counteroffensive failed the following year, and since then Moscow has made slow but relentless gains in costly battles along a 1,200km front.

In a rare announcement of a Ukrainian advance, the commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said on Monday his forces had "restored control" over 400 square km of territory ​along a stretch of the southern front line.

Reuters was not immediately able to confirm the claim, and there was no immediate response from Moscow . If true, it would be the first big Ukrainian gain since December ​and one of the biggest in many months.

The US has been trying to broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, but progress has proved ​elusive. Their most recent talks, in Geneva on February 17 and 18, did not produce a breakthrough.

Another round of talks aimed at ending the war in Ukraine could be held at the end of this week, President Volodymyr Zelensky 's chief of staff told Ukrainian media on Monday.

As President Donald Trump has steered ​the US away from providing military and financial support for Ukraine, European countries have increasingly stepped in. But the threats from Slovakia and Hungary put that consensus in jeopardy.

Four diplomats in Brussels told Reuters that Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto drew sharp criticism from EU colleagues behind closed doors in Brussels, with some ministers accusing Orban's government of using the issue for political gain ahead of a tough election in April.

Russia has been relentlessly targeting Ukraine's power grid and energy system in nightly drone and missile attacks, arguing such infrastructure is a legitimate target because it helps the war effort. Kyiv, which has also struck Russian oil infrastructure, says Moscow's aim is to ⁠break the national will by freezing Ukrainians in their homes.

Ukraine's emergency services said two people were killed and three wounded overnight in the latest drone attacks that hit the southern Odesa region. Ukraine's Infrastructure Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said Russia had attacked port infrastructure there.

Russian state ⁠news agency RIA, citing the country's Defence Ministry, ​said Moscow's forces had carried out successful strikes on Ukrainian transport, energy and fuel infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 19:03:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5d35001a-10e1-11f1-a2b9-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Orban-sanctions.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's former US ambassador Peter Mandelson arrested amid Epstein revelations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260223-britain-s-former-us-ambassador-peter-mandelson-arrested-amid-epstein-revelations</link><description>Former British ambassador to the ​US Peter Mandelson has been arrested by London police on suspicion of misconduct in public office, following revelations over his ties to convicted ​sex ‌offender Jeffrey Epstein .

Mandelson, 72, was fired from ⁠the most prestigious posting in Britain's diplomatic service in September, when the depth ‌of his friendship with Epstein started to become clear.

Police earlier ⁠this month began a criminal investigation into Mandelson after Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's government passed on communications between the ​former ambassador and Epstein.

"Officers have arrested a 72-year-old ‌man on suspicion of misconduct in public office," London 's Metropolitan Police said in a statement relating to an investigation into a former government minister.

Emails ‌between Mandelson and Epstein, released by the US Department of Justice in late ​January, showed the two men had a closer relationship than had been publicly known, and Mandelson had shared information with the financier ​when he was a minister in former prime minister Gordon ​Brown's government.

Mandelson, who this month resigned from ​Starmer's Labour Party and quit his position in parliament's upper chamber, has previously said he "very ​deeply" regretted his past association with Epstein. But he has not commented publicly or responded to messages seeking comment on the latest revelations.

Last week, King Charles' younger brother Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was also ⁠arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office over allegations he sent confidential government ⁠documents to ​Epstein. He has always denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 19:03:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/104bdab0-10de-11f1-bce6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Peter-Mandelson2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France curtails US Ambassador Kushner's government access after he fails to obey summons</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260223-france-curtails-us-ambassador-kushner-s-access-after-he-fails-to-obey-government-summons</link><description>France 's top diplomat Monday requested that US Ambassador Charles Kushner no longer be allowed direct access to members of the French government after he skipped a meeting to discuss comments by the administration of US President Donald Trump over the fatal beating of a far-right activist .

"In light of this apparent failure to grasp the basic requirements of the ambassadorial mission and the honour of representing one's country, [Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot ] has requested that he no longer be allowed direct access to members of the French government," the ministry stated.

Kushner will no longer have access to government ministers but would be permitted to continue his diplomatic duties and have certain "exchanges" with officials, the ministry said.

"Following the publication by the US embassy of comments on a tragedy that occurred in ‌France and concerns only our national public debate – which we ⁠refuse to allow to be exploited – ambassador Charles Kushner was summoned today to the ministry. He did not show up," a diplomatic source told Reuters.

The ambassador – whose son, Jared, is married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka – sent a senior official from the embassy in his place, citing personal commitments, a source told AFP.

The ministry, however, left the door open for reconciliation.

“It remains, of course, possible for Ambassador Charles Kushner to carry out his duties and present himself at the Quai d’Orsay, so that we may hold the diplomatic discussions needed to smooth over the irritants that can inevitably arise in a friendship spanning 250 years,” it said.

The feud erupted over comments made by members of the Trump administration about the death of a right-wing activist following a violent riot in Lyon on February 14.

Quentin Deranque, 23, died from head injuries following clashes between far-right and hard-left supporters on the sidelines of a demonstration against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in the southeastern city.

Six men suspected of involvement in the fatal assault have been handed preliminary charges over the killing, while a parliamentary assistant to an LFI lawmaker has been charged with complicity.

The administration of US President Donald Trump condemned the role of "violent radical leftism" in the case.

Sarah Rogers, the US State Department undersecretary for public diplomacy, said Deranque's killing showed "why we treat political violence – terrorism – so harshly".

"Once you decide to kill people for their opinions instead of persuade them, you've opted out of civilization," she wrote on X.

The US embassy in France and the US ​State Department's Bureau of ​Counterterrorism said they ​were monitoring the case, warning on ​X that "violent radical leftism is on the rise" and should be ⁠treated as a public safety ⁠threat.

Analysts and others have been quick to point out that far-right groups have long perpetrated the majority of politically motivated violence , with Muslims , immigrants and Jews as well as left-wing opponents often targeted.

Sociologist Isabelle Sommier stressed that of the 57 deaths linked to violence between political groups recorded between 1986 and 2017, the radical right had been responsible for all but five.

France's foreign minister responded by saying he vehemently rejected US attempts to leverage the tragedy "for political ends" and said he would be summoning the US ambassador .

"We are going to summon the United States ambassador to France , since the US embassy in France commented on this tragedy ... which concerns the national community," Barrot told local media on Sunday .

“We reject any instrumentalisation of this tragedy, which has plunged a French family into mourning, for political ends,” Barrot said. “We have no lessons to learn, particularly on the issue of violence, from the international reactionary movement.”

A rally in support of Deranque drew some 3,200 people to the streets of Lyon on Saturday, some wearing white nationalist symbols. French authorities said they were opening an investigation into reports that members of the crowd performed Nazi salutes .

French President Emmanuel Macron is holding a meeting on Tuesday to discuss "violent action groups" in the wake of Deranque's death, which has ignited tensions between the political left and the right.</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 21:13:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cc8a6d26-10ee-11f1-bd91-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/Kushner-France.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>DR Congo-Burundi border reopens</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/dr-congo-burundi-border-reopens</link><description>Produced by Yinka Oyetade and Antonia Cimini</description><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2026 23:53:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/91335c5e-10ff-11f1-b9ca-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/DN192680-A-01-20260217-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela begins prisoner releases as Rodriguez promises return for exiles</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260224-venezuela-begins-prisoner-releases-as-rodriguez-promises-return-for-exiles</link><description>Interim president Delcy Rodriguez promised on Monday that Venezuelans in exile would be welcomed back with open arms following a new amnesty law passed after the US ouster of Nicolas Maduro , as authorities continued to slowly release prisoners.

"I am telling you: the doors of Venezuela , the arms of the Venezuelan people are open to those who want to return in this process of healing from hatred," she said in a televised address.

Seven million Venezuelans have fled their homeland due to the political and economic crisis, and many opposition figures live in exile.

Meanwhile, at least 30 prisoners were released on Monday from the Rodeo I penitentiary east of Caracas to scenes of rejoicing from waiting relatives, following the passage of the amnesty law.

"We are free," shouted several prisoners with shaved heads as they exited the prison gates, ending an anguished wait for their families.

"We are completely free, without any restrictions," Luis Viera, one of the released prisoners, told AFP. He had been jailed for 13 months.

Addressing the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Venezuela's Foreign Minister Yvan Gil Pinto demanded the immediate release of Maduro.

Maduro, who was ousted as president in a January 3 raid by the United States, is in custody in New York along with his wife, awaiting trial.

The 63-year-old has pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges and declared that he was a "prisoner of war."

"January 3, 2026, marked a turning point of extreme gravity," Gil told the top UN rights body on Monday, adding that the "illegal military action" by US forces left over 100 people dead.

Gil stressed that his country was "working toward a process of acknowledging past wounds, forgiveness, and reconciliation," referring to the amnesty law.

The country's legislature unanimously adopted the landmark law last Thursday, and interim leader Rodriguez hailed its passage, describing it as a step toward "a more democratic, fairer, freer Venezuela."

Rodriguez's brother, parliament chief Jorge Rodriguez, said 1,500 people had applied for the amnesty, which covers a range of charges used to lock up dissidents during 27 years of hardline socialist rule.

Some 600 political prisoners remain behind bars throughout the country, according to Foro Penal – an NGO dedicated to the defence of political prisoners – despite approximately 500 people being released since January.

Opposition figures have criticised the new legislation, which appears to exclude some offences previously used to target Maduro's political opponents. Nor does it include military offences, such as attempted coups.

The amnesty law has helped accelerate a thaw in Venezuela's ties with the West.

The European Union 's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said on Monday she would propose lifting EU sanctions on Delcy Rodriguez.

Elsewhere, the UN rights office said it was in talks with Caracas to reopen its mission in Venezuela. Its staff were expelled in February 2024.

In a further sign of a break with the past, Rodriguez on Monday dismissed from her cabinet the wife of a businessman accused of serving as Maduro's frontman in corruption schemes.

Alex Saab was indicted in the United States for money laundering but returned to Venezuela in 2024 as part of a prisoner swap to take up the role of industry minister.

Rodriguez removed him from his position in January.

On Monday, she sacked his wife, Camilla Fabri, who served as deputy minister for international communication.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:07:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/72e98c9c-1112-11f1-8aa1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26054057994806.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kim Jon-Un's sister promoted in rare North Korea party congress</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260224-kim-jon-un-sister-promoted-north-korea-party-congress</link><description>The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has been given a promotion in the ruling party structure during a rare party congress, state media reported Tuesday.

The Workers’ Party Central Committee on Monday named Kim Yo Jong – previously a deputy department director – as a full department director, Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said.

Thousands of party elites have packed the capital, Pyongyang, for a once-in-five-years summit of the ruling Workers’ Party, a gathering that directs state efforts on everything from diplomacy to war planning.

The congress offers a rare glimpse into the political workings of reclusive North Korea and is widely seen as a forum for Kim to flex his grip on power.

Kim Yo Jong has long been among her brother’s closest lieutenants and one of the most influential women in the isolated regime.

Born in the late 1980s, according to the South Korean government, she is one of three children born to Kim’s father and predecessor, Kim Jong Il , and his third known partner, former dancer Ko Yong Hui.

She was educated in Switzerland alongside her brother and rose rapidly up the ranks once he inherited power after their father’s death in 2011.

In 2018, she visited South Korea for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, during a period of inter-Korean rapprochement.

Pyongyang also frequently uses her name to issue statements outlining its positions or criticising the South and the US.

Later in the days-long congress, Kim Jong Un is expected to unveil the next phase in North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme.

The country’s nuclear arsenal has been transformed under Kim from a source of mild global concern to something treated as a genuine threat.

It is just the ninth time the Workers’ Party congress has convened under North Korea’s decades-spanning Kim rule.

Particular attention will also be placed on the whereabouts of Kim’s teenage daughter, Ju Ae , who has emerged as North Korea’s heir apparent, according to Seoul’s National Intelligence Service.

At the previous congress five years ago, Kim declared that the United States was his nation’s “biggest enemy”.

There is keen interest in whether Kim might use the congress to soften this stance or double down.

US President Donald Trump stepped up his courtship of Kim during a tour of Asia last year, saying he was “100 percent” open to a meeting.

Kim has so far largely shunned efforts to resume top-level diplomatic dialogue.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:07:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bd9ac446-110c-11f1-bc03-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23152031334461.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Historic nor’easter paralyses US Northeast with record snowfall</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260223-historic-nor-easter-paralyses-us-northeast-with-record-snowfall</link><description>A massive snowstorm pummelled the northeastern United States from Maryland to Maine on Monday, forcing millions of people to stay home amid strong wind and blizzard warnings, transport shutdowns, and school and business closures.

Meteorologists said the storm is the strongest in a decade, dumping more than 2 feet (60 centimetres) of snow in parts of the metropolitan Northeast, shattering accumulation records in places, immobilising transit and even leading the United Nations to postpone a Security Council meeting. Officials declared emergencies , and schools closed, including in New York City, which had its first “old-school” snow day in six years, while people grappled with power failures.

Even as the snow moved northward and tapered off in other areas, the National Weather Service said it is tracking another storm that could bring more snow to the region later this week.

The weather service referred to Monday’s storm as a “classic bomb cyclone/nor’easter off the Northeast coast.” A bomb cyclone happens when a storm’s pressure falls by a certain amount within a 24-hour period, occurring mainly in the autumn and winter when frigid Arctic air can reach the south and clash with warmer temperatures.

While it was paralysing and potentially dangerous for millions along the Eastern Seaboard, meteorologists found themselves rhapsodising over the combination of power and beauty.

The storm hit the “Goldilocks situation” of just the right temperature for wet, heavy snow: any warmer and its precipitation would not have fallen as snow; any colder and there would not have been as much moisture in the air to feed that snowfall, said Owen Shieh, warning coordination meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in Maryland.

In Lower Manhattan, snow shovelers appeared to outnumber commuting office workers, and pedestrians walked freely in streets normally blocked by morning traffic.

“It’s very quiet, except for the howling winds,” said Luis Valez, a concierge at a residential tower just off Wall Street, as he cleared the pavement. “A couple of residents have gone out to get their essentials. Other than that, there’s nothing.”

Matthew Wojtkowiak, 57, an attorney, was also shovelling in his Brooklyn neighbourhood.

“I’m from the Midwest, so this is in the zone,” he said. “Not too bad, not too easy, either.”

Schools were closed, and he said he hoped people would get out and enjoy the snow.

“We have sleds at the ready,” he said.

Karen Smith and Adele Bawden are tourists visiting New York from the United Kingdom.

“We’ve been dancing in Times Square this morning in the middle of the road in rush hour,” Bawden said. “We’ve just been dancing and not believing we could do it.”

Ingrid Devita said she liked to patrol the Lower East Side on skis, checking on people who might need help.

“I find people fall in the snow and they can’t get up,” she said.

Central Park in New York City recorded 19 inches (48 centimetres) of snow. Warwick, Rhode Island, exceeded 3 feet (91 centimetres), topping the nation so far. The highest wind gust of 83 mph (133 kph) was recorded in Nantucket, with hurricane-force gusts seen all over Cape Cod.

In Connecticut, crews at the Mystic Seaport Museum prepared to clear snow from a fleet of historic ships, including the 113-foot-long Charles W. Morgan, a wooden whaling ship from the 19th-century American merchant fleet.

Shannon McKenzie, vice president of watercraft operations and preservation, said shipyard staff will clear the snow by hand using rubber or plastic shovels because machinery or metal shovels could damage the boats.

New York, Philadelphia and other cities, as well as several states, declared emergencies.

More than 5,600 flights in and out of the United States were cancelled Monday, and a further 2,000 flights scheduled for Tuesday were grounded, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Most of the cancellations involved airports in New York, New Jersey and Boston. Almost 2,500 flights were delayed.

Rhode Island’s T.F. Green International Airport announced Monday that it was temporarily ending all airport operations. The Weather Service reported that the facility got 32.8 inches (83.3 centimetres) of snow, breaking a record set in 1978.

Public transport ground to a halt in some areas, while DoorDash suspended deliveries in New York City overnight into Monday.

Storm-related power outages plunged more than 500,000 customers into darkness along the East Coast early Monday, according to PowerOutage.us, which tracks outages nationwide.

Commuters in and around New York felt the strain.

In New York City, several subway lines reported severe delays, while the Long Island Rail Road was fully suspended until further notice. Some Metro-North commuter trains between New York City and its suburbs were delayed by up to an hour. New Jersey Transit suspended bus and rail services “until further notice”.

The weather service said strong wind gusts could cause whiteout conditions and warned of a “potentially historic/ destructive storm ” southeast of the Boston–Providence corridor.

“Winds like that, combined with heavy, wet snow, are a recipe for damaged trees and prolonged power outages,” said Bryce Williams, a meteorologist with the weather service’s Boston office. “That’s what we’re most concerned with, is the combination of those extreme snow amounts with that wind.”

Outreach workers, meanwhile, tried to coax homeless New Yorkers into shelters and warming centres.

Various landmarks and cultural institutions were closed Monday, including New York’s Museum of Modern Art and Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Broadway shows were cancelled Sunday evening.

New York City and Boston cancelled public school classes for Monday, while Philadelphia switched to online learning. Districts on Long Island and elsewhere in the New York suburbs said they would cancel school for a second day on Tuesday.

New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani , a Democrat , said class would be back in person on Tuesday.

Officials in one of the city’s Republican strongholds criticised the move. Staten Island Borough President Vito Fossella said school should remain closed, saying roads are impassable and pavements are blocked. The teachers’ union, the United Federation of Teachers, advised its members to be cautious and put their safety first when deciding whether to report to work.

Spokespersons for Mamdani did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Earlier Monday, when he announced classes would be back in session, he quipped: “You can still pelt me with snowballs when you see me.”

For Monday, though, he had another mission for students: “Stay cosy.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 02:07:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a7424c74-10f2-11f1-98da-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-23T144446Z-1666054925-RC2PRJASQO9G-RTRMADP-3-USA-WEATHER.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian PM Mark Carney heads to India to boost trade and repair ties</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260224-canadian-pm-mark-carney-heads-to-india-to-boost-trade-and-repair-ties</link><description>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney heads to India this week pushing to double trade and mend fractured ties, his first stop on an Asia–Pacific tour that also includes Australia and Japan as he seeks to reduce reliance on the United States.

Carney has said that the US-led global order is fading and that Canada should not expect the old system to return once President Donald Trump leaves office.

Hedging against the mercurial resident of the White House, he has sought to rebuild previously testy relations with major Asian economies, last month visiting Beijing to meet Chinese leader Xi Jinping after years of frozen ties.

Carney will leave on Thursday for India, on a visit that will be closely watched as he and Prime Minister Narendra Modi try to repair ties that effectively ruptured in 2024.

“In a more uncertain world, Canada is focused on what we can control,” Carney said in a statement announcing the trip.

“We are forging new partnerships abroad to create greater certainty, security and prosperity at home.”

Trump’s tariffs on autos, aluminium, lumber and steel are hurting the Canadian economy.

The impacts of the levies have been muted by the president’s broad adherence to an existing North American free trade agreement.

Negotiations on revising that deal are set for the start of this year and Trump has repeatedly insisted the United States does not need access to any Canadian products – which would have sweeping consequences for its northern neighbour.

Trump has also repeatedly threatened to annex Canada, and last month posted an image on social media of a map with Canada – as well as Greenland and Venezuela – covered by the American flag.

Carney says that to safeguard Canada’s economic future the country needs to massively expand non-US international trade.

India is a key target and Carney says he wants to more than double bilateral trade, eyeing a target of CAN$70 billion ($51 billion) by 2030.

The two countries last year agreed to launch talks on a new free trade agreement.

The meeting is all the more significant given the bitter fallout from Canadian accusations that New Delhi was involved in the 2023 assassination of a Canadian Sikh leader – claims which India denied.

That rift severely disrupted consular and trade services between the nations, which exchanged about CAN$28 billion in goods and services in 2023.

Carney will then visit Sydney and Australia’s capital, Canberra, for meetings with local counterpart Anthony Albanese .

Albanese’s office said the trip would focus on economic security and critical minerals, as well as defence.

“As our countries face new challenges and opportunities, we must deepen our cooperation with partners to promote our national interests,” the Australian prime minister said.

Carney will wrap up his tour in Japan, where he will hold talks with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi .

He will fly back to Canada on March 7.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 04:30:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f45f8e92-fa2f-11f0-b860-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26025625455145.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Ukraine marks four years of war with Russia amid reconstruction challenges</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260224-live-ukraine-marks-four-years-of-war-with-russia-amid-reconstruction-challenges</link><description>Russia is investigating Telegram founder Pavel Durov as part of a criminal case on the “facilitation of terrorist activities”, state-run newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported.

Durov could not be immediately reached for comment on the report.

Overnight Russian drone strikes on the southeastern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia wounded five people, including a child, authorities said on Tuesday.

The Ukrainian State Emergency Service (DSNS) said the attacks, which occurred late on Monday, targeted multiple sites across the regional centre.

“Five people, including one child, were injured as a result of the attacks,” the DSNS said.

At one location, a drone slammed into a factory building next to a nine-storey residential block, sparking a fire that spread over 200 square metres.

Nearby homes were also damaged, the DSNS added.

Tuesday’s anniversary is expected to see the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and the president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, in Kyiv to mark the occasion.

Both said they would take part in a “commemoration ceremony” and visit the site of a Ukrainian energy facility damaged by Russian strikes before attending a meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky.

They are also due to take part in a videoconference meeting with Kyiv’s allies – the so-called “Coalition of the Willing”, which includes Britain, France and Germany.

Ukraine was on Tuesday marking the fourth anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion, with a show of solidarity from its staunchest allies and no immediate end in sight to Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War II.

Tens of thousands of lives have been lost since the Kremlin ordered troops into Ukraine on 24 February 2022, confident of a quick victory but not expecting the fierce resistance that followed.

Ukraine will need $588 billion to rebuild from the destruction caused by Russia's full-scale invasion, a World Bank report said on Monday – a figure almost three times the country's annual economic output.

Hungary vetoed a new EU package of sanctions against Russia and a €90 billion loan to Ukraine.

The televised prime-time speech to Congress, his second in the 13 months since returning to the White House , offers Trump a chance to persuade voters to keep Republicans in power. But it comes as he faces stiff political headwinds at home and abroad.

The appearance follows a turbulent few days ​for his administration, including a Supreme ‌Court decision invalidating his global tariff regime and new data showing the economy slowed more than expected while inflation accelerated.

The Department of Homeland Security is mostly shut ⁠down due to a dispute between congressional Republicans and Democrats over the administration's aggressive immigration tactics, following the fatal shootings of two US citizens in Minneapolis . Meanwhile, Trump has struggled to turn the page on the scandal surrounding the government's release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

Trump, who has ‌openly coveted the Nobel Peace Prize and set up his own " Board of Peace ", appears to be inching closer to a military conflict with Iran over its nuclear ⁠programme, moving warships to the Middle East and developing plans that could include a change of government, according to US officials.

Tuesday's speech could offer Trump a chance to mount for the first time a public case for military intervention in Iran .

Two White House officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Trump will discuss his plans for ​Iran but did not offer details.

He will also tout his record of brokering peace deals, they said. He will be speaking on the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion ‌of Ukraine , a reminder that he has yet to resolve the war he once said he could end "in 24 hours".

The president is expected to address the Supreme Court 's decision on tariffs , arguing that the court erred and outlining alternative laws he can use to reconstitute most of the levies .

Trump reacted with fury to the ruling last week, targeting several justices with personal attacks. A repeat performance on Tuesday could make for some awkward moments; at least ‌some of the court's nine justices are expected to attend.

White House aides and Republican campaign advisers, eyeing a challenging congressional midterm election, have urged Trump to focus on Americans' economic worries. Trump's victory in the 2024 election was based in large part on his promises to ease the cost of living, ​but opinion polls show voters are unconvinced by his efforts so far.

Trump has struggled to stay on message, straying in public speeches from the economy to his long list of grievances while at other times declaring he has already solved the problem.

One of the White House officials said Trump will "claim victory on the economy", a message Republican lawmakers running for re-election are unlikely to welcome. He will ​argue that he inherited a poor economy from Democratic predecessor Joe Biden and that Democrats have overstated affordability concerns, both officials said.

Trump will point to stock market gains, private-sector investments and his tax cut legislation as ​evidence that he has helped the economy, the officials said. The president will also tout his tough border policies and his deportation campaign, despite polls ​showing most Americans believe his administration has gone too far in rounding up undocumented immigrants.

"This is the one opportunity the president has where the whole world is looking at what he has to say, and this is his opportunity to summarise everything that he’s done and not go off script," said ​Amanda Makki, a Republican strategist and former Florida congressional candidate.

Trump, who has a propensity for ad-libbing, said on Monday his address would be lengthy. His 100-minute speech last March – technically not a State of the Union speech, but otherwise similar – was the longest presidential address to Congress in modern history.

The White House officials said this year's edition was crafted with room for unscripted moments.

"We are planning around it," one official said.

Last year, some Democrats interrupted Trump's speech with jeers before walking out in protest. This time around, more than 20 Democrats in the house of Representatives and Senate plan to skip the speech altogether in favour of an ⁠outdoor rally on the National Mall.

Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon, one of those Democrats, told reporters on Monday the event would offer a more "honest description" of Trump's record, rather than the "propaganda push" of the speech.

Virginia Governor Abby Spanberger, whose decisive victory in November was seen ⁠as an early midterms warning sign ​for Republicans, will deliver the official Democratic response to the speech.

Democratic US Senator Alex Padilla of California, who was shoved to the ground and handcuffed last year after attempting to ask a question of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at a press conference, will give the Spanish-language rebuttal.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 07:00:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9937fe66-1116-11f1-b3f0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-23T164258Z-1095765124-RC2SRJA7J4BO-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How Russia’s 'thousand cuts' tactic is straining Ukraine’s frontline forces</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260224-how-russia-thousand-cuts-tactic-is-straining-ukraine-frontline-forces</link><description>After four years of war, Russia has switched to a new tactic at the front. Small assault units, made up of only two or three soldiers, are exploiting weaknesses in Ukrainian defences, hoping for a slow, painful haemorrhage rather than a fatal blow.

The "thousand cuts" gambit became increasingly important over the course of 2025, and by last summer it had become the primary tactic used by Russian forces, said Erik Stijnman, a security expert at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations Clingendael.

The manoeuvre is a revival of the Soviet-era stealth tactics used during World War II and adapted to the current conflict, said Veronika Hinman, a specialist on Russia and international relations at the University of Portsmouth.

The "thousand cuts" are inflicted by small groups of men who can successfully infiltrate Ukrainian territory. These are units staffed with two or three troops who escape the vigilance of Ukrainians, said Stijnman. These units rarely exceed 10 combatants since the objective is to be as discreet as possible.

The micro-units have "achieved tactical gains in key cities such as Kupiansk and Pokrovsk", according to the Atlas Institute for International Affairs , a US-based think tank.

Russian forces began successfully breaching Ukrainian defence lines in Pokrovsk with small groups of combatants in November 2025. The Ukrainian army was forced to withdraw. Russia finally announced the capture of Pokrovsk, a key city in the Donetsk region, though the Ukrainians claim they still control part of the city .

Russia is trying to replicate this method along the front line.

"The goal is to find gaps using a small number of people and then send in the infantry afterwards," said Hinman.

Russian soldiers usually infiltrate using thermal sheeting or tents, which they hold away from their bodies with handles. They attempt to advance as close to Ukrainian forces as possible, to check their positions and test their strength, according to an October 2025 report from the Royal United Services Institute.

If the Russian soldiers can kill any Ukrainian troops during their missions, even better. But even if the Russian side is losing more men than Ukraine during these operations, they are more capable of absorbing the losses, said Stijnman.

The "thousand cuts" method does not necessarily lead to territorial gains for the Russian side.

Instead, it represents a significant shift in the army’s mentality, moving away from the traditional desire for a "dramatic hammer blow" to "low glamour, high persistence" approach, said Will Kingston-Cox, a Russia specialist at the International Team for the Study of Security Verona.

The approach is really a "poor man’s strategy", Stijnman said, in the absence of the ability to "actually make a breakthrough".

"The omnipresence of drones on the front" also accounts for the use of the tactic, said Hinman. Large groups of troops are easier to detect with drones and then target with artillery strikes, said Kingston-Cox.

Russia’s war against Ukraine is a war of attrition, and this modus operandi "allows Russia to draw out the conflict" to its advantage, said Stijnman. Moscow wants the war to last until it achieves a decisive victory; the numerous incursions across Ukrainian defence lines force the Ukrainians to react and drains their munitions.

The tactic is also politically advantageous for Moscow. Photos of Russian soldiers waving their flag in the middle of Ukrainian villages began to appear in the summer of 2025, making it appear like Russia had taken control of these territories.

But the incursions don’t last. Ukraine just removes the Russian flags on its territory once no one remains to defend them.

Yet as peace negotiations between Ukraine and Russia falter, the images give the impression that Russians are advancing and are therefore in a position of strength. Such photos "give the impression that Russia is gaining ground", said Stijnman.

"It’s a great propaganda tool" for Russian forces, Hinman agreed.

Ukraine is beginning to adapt. The army is using technological solutions, like terrestrial drones along its front lines, to reduce human losses tied to these incursions, said Stijnman.

Furthermore, "Ukraine has intensified its strikes deep in Russian territory against Russian [energy] and military infrastructure to make the war of attrition just as painful for Moscow," Kingston-Cox said.

The thousands of "cuts" inflicted by Russia are, nevertheless, leaving scars on the Ukrainian war effort.

"Sacred things and the flag are two examples of these red lines that we must protect and not cross or deviate from, even at the height of anger," Fatemeh Mohajerani said.

She said Iran 's students "have wounds in their hearts and have seen scenes that may upset and anger them; this anger is understandable".

University students in Iran started a new semester Saturday with pro- and anti-government rallies, according to local media, reviving slogans from nationwide demonstrations that peaked in January and led to thousands of deaths.

Protests first began in December sparked by economic woes in the sanctions-hit country, but grew into nationwide demonstrations on January 8 and 9.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has recorded more than 7,000 deaths, while warning the full toll is likely far higher.

Iranian officials acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by "terrorist acts" fuelled by the United States and Israel .

Mohajerani on Tuesday said a fact-finding mission is investigating "the causes and factors" of the protests and will provide reports.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:27:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9dedbb86-1160-11f1-b3e5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-98MD4KE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US ambassador Kushner must explain no show to regain government access, says French FM</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260224-us-ambassador-must-explain-no-show-to-regain-government-access-says-french-fm</link><description>France’s spat with the US ambassador to Paris took another turn Tuesday with the French foreign minister saying the top US diplomat in France must explain himself after ignoring a French summons .

The minister suggested that Ambassador Charles Kushner won’t have access to French government officials until he complies.

French authorities had summoned Kushner – the father of US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner – for a meeting on Monday evening after the US embassy in Paris reposted comments by the Trump administration in Washington about slain far-right activist Quentin Deranque.

Deranque, 23, died from head injuries following clashes between radical-left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a February 12 protest against a politician from the left-wing France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon .

French diplomats said Kushner did not show up.

Speaking Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot described the failure to attend as “a surprise” that flew in the face of diplomatic protocol and will dent Kushner’s ability to serve as an ambassador.

“It will, naturally, affect his capacity to exercise his mission in our country,” Barrot said, speaking to public broadcaster France Info.

“When these explanations have taken place, then the US ambassador in France will, naturally, regain access to members of the French government," the minister added.

The US Embassy did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment on Monday and a follow-up request on Tuesday morning also got no immediate reply.

The French foreign ministry had summoned Kushner over Trump administration tweets about the beating death in France of a far-right activist.

Barrot said the comments needed to be discussed with Kushner.

“We must have an explanation with him," the minister said. "We don’t accept that foreign countries can come and interfere, invite themselves, into the national political debate.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 09:27:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6c4ad7f4-115a-11f1-b95c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-67746PB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four years into Russia's invasion, four young Ukrainians look to the future</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260224-four-years-into-russia-s-invasion-four-young-ukrainians-look-to-the-future</link><description>"Everything changed in the first days of the war," said Angelina, 26, a political science student, recalling watching her brother leave to defend the southeastern city of Mariupol. At first she was told he had been killed, and then that he had been taken prisoner by Russia. In any case, she hasn't heard from him in four years. "I'm not even sure he's still alive," she confided in a trembling voice. Having once dreamed of being surrounded by "a big family", she now takes care of her nephew, Kyrylas, 11.

Oleksandr, a 28-year-old photographer, was living in Izmail, in the Odesa region, and developing his own clothing brand when the war broke out. Back then he dreamed of professional success, starting a family, and building his own home. Now he is serving in the Ukrainian armed forces.

Bohdan, on the other hand, feels content with his lot.  He had hoped to work in tech and is now, at 24, a product manager in that field – the only one, he said, that “allows you to earn a decent living in Ukraine right now". These are fairly standard goals for this Kyiv resident, who never imagined that the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, might come to pass.

Sofiia, the youngest of the group, is 18. A student in Kyiv , originally from Ternopil in western Ukraine, she had planned to  become a lawyer in her home country. But the war prompted a change of tack. "Today, I'm thinking more about becoming an international lawyer. I want to draw more attention to the situation in Ukraine, to Russia's crimes against Ukraine," she stated confidently.

The war in Ukraine has sparked a strong sense of commitment among these young people. Angelina identifies as a Crimean Tatar – an identity that she proudly claims as she aspires to become a human rights lawyer for this minority. "My family has been deported twice: my brother is currently in Siberia, and my grandmother was also in Siberia 65 years ago," she said, her voice filled with emotion, explaining that she wants to "break this cycle".

Bohdan, who is also studying film, offered an artistic perspective on the situation. “All these fears, all these hard times, they create these unique experiences from which we can produce really great art,” he said. It's a statement that resonates particularly with his own future: at 25, he will be drafted. “I’m afraid of dying,” he said with a nervous laugh. He tries to be optimistic, but remains realistic: “Sometimes I wonder, ‘If I go to the battlefield, will it add anything to my experience?’ But it’s still really scary.”

Oleksandr, for his part, keeps his eyes fixed on the future and the end of the war. “It’s precisely my dreams and goals that have motivated me, that have given me the energy and faith to keep moving forward,” he claimed, still clinging to his cat, the mascot of his TikTok account.

One thing is certain: neither of them sees relations with Russia returning to normal. “It’s dangerous for Ukraine,” Bohdan said.

“I see many people being more friendly towards Russia, as if it weren’t an aggressor,” added Sofiia, who "doesn't understand" this choice. She dreams of a “completely independent” Ukraine in which "Ukrainian identity" would finally be understood and embraced.

“Our relationship with Russia will never be the same again,” concluded Oleksandr, because “Russia has hurt us too much.”

Despite their hardship, they all envision the future in a positive light and plan to stay in Ukraine. "I love my country, and I would really like to live, work, and build my future here," said Sofiia, like the rest of the young Ukrainians who are "used to this situation".

Bohdan echoed this sentiment: "My country isn't perfect, Ukrainians aren't perfect, but I love them," he explained.

"Ukrainians are a very optimistic people. We have always believed – and we will continue to believe – that only a bright future awaits us," added Oleksandr. While the soldier hopes the war will be over "within a year", Bohdan is more reserved and pragmatic. He believes that peace within a year is unlikely and that peace "within ten years" is far more plausible.

He also believes Ukrainian territory will be conceded to Russia, as he thinks it "unlikely" that Kyiv will recover land captured by Moscow .

But he also envisions a Ukraine that is "more united" by the experience of war. "When the war started, it was like this big explosion of empathy," he recalled. "People started to care about each other. I hope this empathy will stay with us."

They believe young people will play a leading role in Ukraine's future. "Teenagers are the only future we have, because they are more sensitive and sometimes take the situation more seriously" than their elders, Sofiia observed. Younger people are "more politically engaged" and "always have an opinion on everything, which is a good thing", she said with a smile.

Rebuilding Ukraine is not just about the reconstruction of infrastructure and buildings, but it is also a human question of hope and faith. "I see young people who spend their nights packing humanitarian aid and then going to university in the morning," Angelina explained. "I truly believe we can rebuild our country, especially thanks to the younger generation. Not just the buildings, but also the institutions and our faith in the future," she declared. "We're not waiting for anything. We want to live now," she said.

The 59-year-old Oseguera, nicknamed " El Mencho ", was wounded in a clash with soldiers on Sunday and died while being airlifted to hospital.

The operation was launched when Mexican military intelligence agents, supported by the US military 's Northern Command, learned that the woman in question planned to rendez-vous with the drug lord in Tapalpa, some 130km from Guadalajara, the capital of Jalisco state.

Mexican Defense Secretary Ricardo Trevilla told reporters at a press conference Monday that the woman, "one of the romantic partners of 'El Mencho'", was brought to a house in Tapalpa by a trusted associate.

On Saturday, she met with Oseguera and then left, leaving Oseguera in the house with his security detail, Trevilla explained.

The National Guard's Special Immediate Reaction Force blueprinted the operation for the assault on Sunday with both land and air maneuvers.

The soldiers approached the area without entering Jalisco "to keep the secret and thus retain the element of surprise", Trevilla said.

Once they confirmed the presence of Oseguera, who was wanted for organised crime and weapons possession, they decided to raid the ranch.

"Honestly, it was a pretty violent attack ," Trevilla said, specifying that Oseguera was apprehended in possession of an arsenal that included assault weapons and two rocket launchers.

The kingpin's security escorts, who have made a name defying state forces, had used these types of bazookas before.

In 2015 they shot down a military helicopter, helping the drug trafficker evade capture.

"El Mencho" didn't have the same luck Sunday. As they fled, he and his close circle of guards took cover in a forested area surrounding a complex of cabins.

He was surrounded by the soldiers again, who found him hiding in the undergrowth, the head of the military explained.

His gunmen managed to hit a military helicopter, which had to make an emergency landing in a nearby base.

In the midst of the gunfight, the soldiers wounded Oseguera alongside two of his escorts.

All three were airlifted to a hospital in Guadalajara but died en route, Trevilla said.

The bodies were then transported by airplane to Mexico City and handed over to the General Prosecutor's Office.

Security Secretary Omar Garcia Harfuch said that Osegeura's remains would be handed over to his family.

It is not yet known where he will be buried.

Authorities also announced the death of his right-hand man.

Hugo H., known as "El Tuli," was found in El Grullo, another town in Jalisco, from where he directed road blockades, the burning of vehicles and retaliatory attacks against military institutions after his boss's death.

"He was offering 20,000 pesos ($1,150) for every soldier who was killed," Trevilla said.

Like Oseguera, "El Tuli" died Sunday as he tried to flee. He was carrying an assault weapon, a pistol and the equivalent of nearly $1.4 million on him when he died, Trevilla added.

The death of Oseguera unleashed a wave of violence across 20 out of Mexico's 32 states, marked by hundreds of roadblocks and torchings of vehicles.

On Monday, calm returned to most of the country.

The government has deployed around 10,000 soldiers as a dissuasive measure.

But blockades continued in isolated parts of Jalisco and neighboring Michoacan state.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 15:58:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dd17ddd4-1190-11f1-9e42-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26054750052635-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A winter's worth of rain': France's record 40-day streak comes to an end</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260224-winter-worth-of-rain-france-record-40-day-rainfall-streak-comes-to-an-end</link><description>The rainfall streak lasted from January 14 to February 22, beating a previous record of 32 consecutive days of rain in 2023.

"This is the longest streak of consecutive rainy days recorded in France since measurements began in 1959," stated Météo-France, which defines a "rainy day" as a day with average rainfall totals of 1 millimetre or more across the country. On Monday, total rainfall dropped to 0.7mm.

The accumulation of rainfall has been linked to a series of disturbances and named storms – Goretti, Ingrid, Nils and Pedro – along the Atlantic axis, framed by two anticyclones centered over Africa and northern Europe.

Climate change also tends to intensify rainfall.

"A warmer atmosphere contains more water vapour, which increases the potential for intense rainfall, while also altering its timing," Météo-France said.

"Since January 1, the equivalent of an entire winter's worth of rainfall, or even more, has fallen across the tip of Brittany, a large part of southwestern France and the Mediterranean coast, with 44 days of rain compared to 48 for an entire 'normal' winter," the national forecaster said.

February 2026 has been the wettest February on average across the country since 1959. The winter of 2025-2026 will rank among the 10 wettest winters ever recorded, Météo-France predicts.

Rivers that have been experiencing exceptional flooding on the western coast of the country for over a week began to recede slowly over the weekend. A "downward trend" can be seen even if it is not happening at the same rate everywhere, said the ministry for ecological transition.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:13:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/884a0c56-119e-11f1-a701-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/France-floods.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Ambassador Kushner pledges not to 'interfere' in French affairs, diplomatic source says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260224-us-envoy-kushner-pledges-not-to-interfere-in-france-s-affairs-diplomatic-source-says</link><description>The US ambassador to Paris, Charles Kushner , called France's foreign minister Tuesday and pledged not to "interfere" in the host country's affairs, a diplomatic source said, after a fallout over Washington's remarks following the killing of a far-right activist.

The new diplomatic row between the two NATO allies broke out after Kushner flouted a summons over the US administration denouncing what it called "terrorism" and left-wing violence in France after the fatal beating of far-right activist Quentin Deranque , 23, earlier this month.

France blocked the ambassador – whose son Jared Kushner is married to US President Donald Trump 's daughter Ivanka – from having access to French government ministers until he explained himself.

A member of Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot 's team on Tuesday said that Kushner had called him.

"The latter reiterated the reasons that had led to the summons: France cannot accept any form of interference or manipulation of its national public debate by the authorities of a third country," they said.

"The ambassador took note, expressed his willingness not to interfere in our public debate, and recalled the friendship that binds France and the United States."

There was no official public comment from the US embassy on Tuesday.

France has repeatedly said it will not tolerate attempts to intervene in its affairs and use tragedy for political purposes.

Barrot earlier on Tuesday said Kushner would only be able to resume his duties after he provided an explanation over his failure to respect "the most basic customs of diplomacy".

He urged him to explain himself "so that he can resume the normal exercise of his duties as ambassador".

"It's the basics," a visibly irritated Barrot told broadcaster France Info, calling Kushner's no-show a "surprise".

Kushner, 71, a multimillionaire real estate developer and former attorney who spent time in prison for tax evasion and other crimes – before being pardoned by Trump in 2020 – is not a professional diplomat.

Kushner was already summoned to the French ministry last year but skipped that meeting as well, sending an official instead.

"He is creating difficulties for himself, because for an ambassador to be able to do his job, he needs to have access to members of the government," Barrot said earlier Tuesday.

"Once explanations have been provided, the US ambassador to France will naturally regain access to the French government."

A diplomatic source had told AFP the ambassador cited "personal commitments" and sent a senior embassy official instead.

Barrot stressed that the incident would not affect the Franco-US relationship on the whole.

But he reiterated that France would not tolerate intervention in its domestic affairs.

"We do not accept that foreign countries can come and interfere in, then insert themselves into, our national political debate, whatever the circumstances," he said.

"I believe all French people share the same feeling."

Deranque died from head injuries following clashes between radical-left and far-right supporters on the sidelines of a protest against a politician from the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) party in Lyon on February 12. His death has sparked tensions in France.

Barrot said Paris also wished to raise the issue of US sanctions against several European figures, including former European commissioner Thierry Breton.

Kushner's behaviour raised eyebrows even among US diplomats.

"One of the basic rules is that when you are summoned by the host country's foreign minister, you show up. On time," Charles Shapiro, a former US ambassador to Venezuela , said on X. "It's not optional."

In December 2024, Trump defended the choice of Kushner as France's envoy.

"It's a great thing because he's in our family," Trump told the French magazine Paris Match.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:13:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/30d2e970-1199-11f1-a77f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-98T329E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Senegal's PM introduces bill doubling prison sentences for same-sex relations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260224-senegal-pm-introduces-new-law-doubling-penalty-for-same-sex-relations</link><description>Senegal 's prime minister Tuesday unveiled legislation that would double the maximum penalty for same-sex relations, making them punishable by up to 10 years in prison, in a crackdown condemned by human rights groups.

Ministers passed the bill to the National Assembly after approving it last week, following multiple arrests of people accused of same-sex relations, which are already a crime under Senegalese law.

"Anyone committing an act against nature will be punished by five to 10 years' imprisonment," compared with one to five years under the current law, premier Ousmane Sonko told parliament on Tuesday.

Police this month said they arrested 12 men, including two local celebrities and a well-known journalist, under anti-LGBTQ laws. Media have reported 30 people arrested since.

Sonko said the bill modified the penal code to stipulate that "any sexual act or act of a sexual nature between two people of the same sex constitutes an act against nature".

The law would also penalise anyone who accuses another of same-sex offences "without proof".

Social media have been flooded in recent weeks with homophobic messages and calls to out individuals accused of same-sex activity.

The bill also provides for three to seven years in prison for "anyone who engages in advocacy" for same-sex relations, Sonko added.

In recent years, LGBTQ issues have stirred controversy in Senegal, where pro-LGBTQ advocacy is frequently denounced as a tool used by Westerners to impose foreign values .

Religious associations have staged demonstrations in recent years to demand tougher penalties.

Before becoming prime minister in 2024, Sonko had promised to make same-sex relations a crime , but was accused by activists and the opposition of failing to follow through on the promise.

Global campaign group Human Rights Watch warned in a statement last week that the arrests under "have intensified concerns over the country's criminalisation of same-sex relations and the safety of people living with HIV and/or AIDS ".

"The Senegalese government should act on its obligations to respect and protect ... people's rights" under international charters "by releasing those arrested and repealing discriminatory and homophobic laws", it said.

Senegalese media have run stories in recent days on same-sex relations, often conflating them with a separate child sex abuse affair.

In that case, investigators dismantled a gang accused of sexual violence against minors, arresting 14 people.

The bill presented in parliament relates to both same-sex relations and child sex abuse.

"If the act is committed with a minor, the maximum sentence will be imposed," Sonko told lawmakers.

The date for a vote in parliament has yet to be announced.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 17:14:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/96397e38-118e-11f1-9a77-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/cea806754a93cdd140853e0ae07a0219c409785f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French President Macron accepts the resignation of Louvre director Laurence des Cars</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260224-french-president-macron-accepts-the-resignation-of-louvre-director-laurence-des-cars</link><description>French President ​Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday ​accepted the resignation of the head of Paris 's Louvre museum, ​which ‌has been ⁠grappling with the fallout from ‌a high-profile jewel heist and rolling ⁠strikes .

Des Cars has faced intense criticism since burglars made off in October with jewels ‌worth an estimated $102 million that are still missing, exposing glaring ​security gaps at the world's most-visited museum.

The incident quickly became a political lightning rod for the far right . A statement by the US State Department’s Counterterrorism Bureau – reposted by the US embassy in Paris – suggested that “violent radical leftism is on the rise” and warned of threats to public safety.

France denounced the message, then summoned the ambassador.

Kushner did not comply. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot later described his refusal to appear as a breach of diplomatic protocol and a “surprise”, warning that it would affect Kushner’s ability to carry out his mission in France.

Barrot said it was unacceptable for foreign countries to “interfere [or] invite themselves into the national political debate, no matter the circumstances”.

Paris then restricted his access to government officials – a rare public rebuke of a top US diplomat – until Kushner agreed to meet with the minister personally.

The two men spoke over the phone on Tuesday , with the US Embassy hailing a "frank and amicable call". A source close to Barrot said that Kushner had pledged not to interfere in France's public debates.

The incident is just the latest on Kushner’s unconventional path to the world of diplomacy. His appointment as US ambassador to France in 2025 raised eyebrows from the start.

Professor Mario Del Pero, an expert on US political networks at Sciences Po university in Paris, called Kushner a “very controversial figure” and said his nomination was a symbol of "classic crony capitalism": a high‑level position “awarded on the basis of loyalty and family ties rather than experience”.

Pardoned by US President Donald Trump in 2020 after a 2005 conviction involving tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions and witness-tampering, Kushner had no prior political or diplomatic experience.

“The pardon was the only way he could be considered for an ambassadorship,” Del Pero adds.

Born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1954, Kushner is the son of Jewish immigrants who survived the Holocaust . His father, Joseph Kushner, built a modest real estate business that Charles later expanded into a major empire .

Charles founded Kushner Companies in 1985, a private real estate firm headquartered in New Jersey and New York that grew from a family portfolio of roughly 4,000 apartments into a complex empire of residential units, commercial towers and rental properties across the Northeast.

In New York‑area real estate, political connections are part of the game. Kushner was active in Democratic fundraising before increasingly aligning with those in Trump’s orbit.

Kushner’s most consequential political connection remains his son Jared, whose rise in Washington was facilitated by his father’s networks. After marrying Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka in 2009 , Jared became a key White House adviser when the billionaire came to power, navigating a turbulent first year marked by clashes with Steve Bannon over policy and influence .

Pierre Mourier, a researcher who studies political and economic networks in the United States, also described Kushner’s appointment to Paris as part of a “broader system of crony capitalism”.

Kushner, he said, is a “quintessential real-estate tycoon” with deep financial and political connections.

“His career demonstrates a pattern seen repeatedly in the Trump era: positions of prestige and political appointments [used] as rewards for loyalty and transactional networks often involving family members or close associates," Mourrier said.

Jared Kushner went on to take over portfolios including Middle East peace efforts, criminal justice reform and the Abraham Accords, a set of agreements that sought to normalise diplomatic relations between Israel and a number of Muslim-majority states.

After leaving government, he founded Affinity Partners, a private equity firm backed almost entirely by Gulf sovereign wealth funds that illustrates the global reach of the Kushner network and the transactional approach that has characterised both father and son.

“Bannon is no longer around and Jared has managed to bring his father back into the equation,” Mourier observed.

Del Pero says that Kushner likely had backing from Washington to ignore France’s summons, saying it was “hard to imagine Charles Kushner decided on his own” to ignore the foreign ministry.

He noted that Kushner’s 2025 open letter to President Emmanuel Macron in the Wall Street Journal, in which he accused France of a “lack of sufficient action” on anti-Semitism , probably also had Washington’s approval.

Such an act would have been “impossible without the approval of the White House”, he said.

This latest diplomatic row is taking place against the larger political context of current Franco‑American relations, in which both sides may have something to gain from heightening tensions.

“Look at the polls – Trump is incredibly unpopular in Europe,” Del Pero said, particularly following high‑profile disputes such as what he called the “ Greenland episode ”.

“For leaders like Macron or [German Chancellor Friedrich] Merz, clashing publicly with Washington, or with figures closely associated with Trump, can carry political benefit at home,” he said.

There are also benefits to be had on the other side of the Atlantic. There is a strong sense of “Europhobia” within the MAGA base, Del Pero said, which may feel a renewed sense of unity when attacked by European entities – even allies.

But the solidarity in the Trump camp may be fleeting, even illusory, according to Del Pero.

“The MAGA base is kept together by Trump; remove him, it explodes,” he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 21:35:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/345d292e-11b3-11f1-8aff-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-37UX696.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says deal with US 'within reach' ahead of talks in Geneva</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260224-iran-us-nuclear-deal-within-reach-geneva-talks</link><description>Iran 's foreign minister declared Tuesday that a deal to avoid a military clash with the United States was within reach, two days before talks between the foes were due to resume in Geneva .

Abbas Araghchi's appeal came as Iran issued a muted warning to student protesters maintaining pressure on the government, against the backdrop of mounting US threats of action to halt Tehran's nuclear programme.

"We have a historic opportunity to strike an unprecedented agreement that addresses mutual concerns and achieves mutual interests," Araghchi said in a social media post.

The minister added that a deal was "within reach, but only if diplomacy is given priority."

Tehran and Washington are due to hold a third round of negotiations on Thursday in Geneva, the latest since talks resumed earlier this month.

The talks will be held following a heavy US military deployment in the region in recent weeks and threats by President Donald Trump of a strike on Iran if no deal is reached.

Iran has repeatedly said it would respond firmly to any attack and on Monday the foreign ministry warned that any strike, even limited, "would be regarded as an act of aggression".

In his post on Tuesday, Araghchi vowed Iran will "under no circumstances ever develop a nuclear weapon," but insisted on the country's right to "harness dividends of peaceful nuclear technology".

"We have proven that we will stop at nothing to guard our sovereignty with courage," he added.

Iran and the US held five rounds of nuclear talks last year but those negotiations were brought to an end with Israel's unprecedented attack on Iran which triggered a 12-day war.

Meanwhile, university students in Tehran kicked off a new semester with gatherings in which they revived slogans from nationwide protests against the country's clerical leadership.

On Tuesday, the fourth consecutive day of the campus protests, videos verified by AFP showed two groups facing off in a large hall at a Tehran university before scuffles break out.

The day before, students had burned the flag that was adopted by Iran's Islamic republic after the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy, according to verified videos.

Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani, giving the first official reaction to the rallies, said that while students had a right to protest, they must "understand the red lines".

The flag, she added, was one "of these red lines that we must protect and not cross or deviate from, even at the height of anger".

The initial wave of protests began in December, sparked by economic woes in the sanctions-hit country, but soon grew into nationwide demonstrations that crested on January 8 and 9, posing one of the largest challenges to Iran's leaders in years.

The unrest prompted a violent government crackdown that killed thousands of people.

The US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) has recorded more than 7,000 deaths, while warning the full toll is likely far higher.

Iranian officials acknowledge more than 3,000 deaths, but say the violence was caused by "terrorist acts" fuelled by the United States and Israel.

The crackdown in January prompted Trump to threaten to intervene militarily on the protesters' behalf, though the focus of his threats soon shifted to Iran's nuclear programme, which the West believes is aimed at building an atomic bomb but Tehran insists is peaceful.

Since then, the US has carried out a massive military build-up in the Middle East aimed at pressuring Tehran into cutting a deal, even as the two sides pursue indirect negotiations.

Washington deployed the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln to the Arabian Sea, and another, the USS Gerald R. Ford, has arrived at a US base in Crete en route to the region.</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 23:32:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/77ce27c6-0c45-11f1-b662-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/58273798eef4483734cf9673fe0f5fffee776a4e.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa secures release of more nationals lured to Ukraine war</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/south-africa-secures-release-of-more-nationals-lured-to-ukraine-war</link><description>Produced by Clarisse Fortuné and Antonia Cimini</description><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2026 23:32:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/36051524-11c8-11f1-9def-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/DN192681-A-01-20260217-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil floods and landslides kill at least 30 after record rainfall</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260225-brazil-floods-landslides-kill-30-record-rainfall</link><description>Three firemen pulled a man's body from the mud amidst the rubble of houses swept away in a landslide in southeastern Brazil, where 30 people died and 39 were still missing on Tuesday after torrential rains.

A river burst its banks and streets became raging currents of brown water in the state of Minas Gerais after the overnight downpour in a region that has seen record rain this month.

State firefighters said 30 people had died in the cities of Juiz de Fora and Uba. More than 200 people have been rescued.

Firefighters and sniffer dogs worked to find the 39 people still missing in the debris.

In a hillside neighborhood of Juiz de Fora, 12 houses were swept away in a "massive landslide," Major Demetrius Goulart of the fire brigade told AFP.

"Many people were inside their homes at night when it was raining," he said.

Wilton Aparecido de Souza sobbed as he spoke of his 20-year-old son trapped in the debris.

"He was a good boy, he had just finished his military service and he wanted to buy a motorcycle," the 42-year-old told AFP.

"At least find his body, so I can give him a proper burial."

Silence hung heavy among dozens of onlookers in the rare moments that the excavators' engines stopped, broken only by the barking of a panicked dog.

"Almost everyone buried in this mud is family; there's my sister, my nephew," said Cleiton Ronan, a 32-year-old warehouse worker.

Earlier, the fire brigade's Goulart said a boy aged around 10 had been pulled alive from the rubble after a two-hour rescue effort, and many expressed hope that their loved ones would still be found alive.

But, "the longer it goes on, the slimmer the chances of finding survivors become," Paulo Roberto Bermudes Rezende, a state civil defense coordinator, told AFP.

Volunteers with shovels came to help the firefighters.

"When I dug up children's belongings -- balloons, teddy bears -- it broke my heart. I'm a father too... I'm trying to help however I can," said Atila Mauro, a 33-year-old bricklayer.

The state fire brigade said the rainfall had led to flooding and landslides, while images shared on social media showed buildings collapsing.

Juiz de Fora's Mayor Margarida Salomao declared a state of emergency.

"Our focus is to guarantee humanitarian assistance, the restoration of basic services, aid to displaced people, and support for reconstruction," President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva wrote on X.

Salomao said her municipality of a little over half a million people was experiencing its wettest February on record, with 584 millimeters (23 inches) of accumulated rainfall.

An estimated 3,000 people had to leave their homes, the mayor's office reported.

Some neighborhoods are isolated, with at least 20 landslides, Salomao said, calling the situation "extreme."

State authorities suspended classes in all municipal schools.

Brazil has suffered various tragedies in recent years due to extreme weather events ranging from floods to drought and intense heat waves.

In 2024, more than 200 people died and two million were impacted by unprecedented flooding in southern Brazil, one of the worst natural disasters in its history.

Two years earlier, a deluge in the city of Petropolis outside Rio de Janeiro left 241 people dead.

Experts have linked most of these events to the effects of climate change.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:09:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e01e7150-11bd-11f1-8ad9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-24T184324Z-120189233-RC2ISJAOOIZM-RTRMADP-3-BRAZIL-RAIN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s 2026 State of the Union to focus on economy, tariffs and foreign policy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260225-trump-2026-state-of-the-union-economy-tariffs-foreign-policy</link><description>Few Americans, 29%, think the country is heading in the right direction, according to the most recent AP-NORC poll. Most, 69%, believe things are heading in the wrong direction.

That pessimism is higher than it was when Trump took office last year. Last March, about 6 in 10 Americans said the country was heading in the wrong direction.

Excerpts released by the White House before he began Tuesday's address said Trump will vow that, “Moving forward, factories, jobs, investment, and trillions of dollars will continue pouring into the United States of America."

US President Donald Trump will boast that his administration has delivered a "turnaround for the ages" as he addresses Congress on Tuesday, according to speech excerpts released by the White House.

"After just one year, I can say with dignity and pride that we have achieved a transformation like no one has ever seen before, and a turnaround for the ages," Trump is expected to say.

President Donald Trump will tell Congress Tuesday he will "confront threats" to the nation, according to excerpts from his State of the Union speech, as the United States expands its military presence near Iran.

"As president, I will make peace wherever I can -- but I will never hesitate to confront threats to America wherever we must," Trump will say in his first State of the Union address since he began his second presidential term 13 months ago.

Few issues have irked voters in both parties more than the Trump administration’s handling of the investigation into Epstein, the major political donor who presided over a years-long underage sex trafficking ring that involved some of the world’s most powerful people.

After initially balking, Trump’s team at the Department of Justice has released millions of pages of documents — although many more are expected. And while key figures are named — including Trump, who insists he's exonerated by the documents — federal prosecutors have yet to charge anyone.

A large portion of the Democratic Caucus is planning to not attend the president’s speech, and Rep. Katherine Clark, the House Democratic whip, is one of the highest ranked in leadership to make that move.

“Rather than listen to Donald Trump lie to the American people, I will be hearing from the people of my district about their personal experiences with skyrocketing costs, new barriers to health care, dismantled Social Security services, and brutal cuts to medical research,” she said in a statement.

Victims of Jeffrey Epstein will attend US President Donald Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday and are seeking accountability for the crimes of the convicted sex offender, lawmakers said.

"Today the world will see Donald Trump have to face these survivors right there in the House gallery," Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Democrat from Washington state , said at a press conference.

"Ambassadors and princes have been arrested in other countries," Jayapal said. "But here in America, not a single investigation has been announced into the pedophiles and predators of Epstein's horrific sex trafficking ring."

The Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme ⁠requires all visitors who do not need a visa to enter Britain to purchase a pre-travel ‌permit online at a cost of 16 pounds ($21.57).

It was introduced ⁠in 2023 and extended to European visitors in April last year, but has not been strictly enforced.

However, from February 25, ​it will be mandatory for visitors to the UK ‌to have obtained an ETA to travel.

This means that airlines will prevent passengers from boarding if they do not have an ETA, eVisa or ‌other valid documentation, the interior ministry said.

British and Irish citizens, including dual citizens, as well those ​with the right to live in the UK, are exempt from needing an ETA.

"The ETA scheme is a vital part of our work ​to strengthen the UK's border security, helping to deliver a more ​efficient and modern service that works for both ​visitors and the British public," migration minister Mike Tapp said.

In October last year, the European Union (EU) ​began rolling-out its much delayed post-Brexit border security checks for UK nationals entering the bloc. Britain formally left the EU in 2020.

The EU's Entry/Exit System (EES) removes the requirement to manually stamp passports at the EU's external borders ⁠and instead creates digital records.

However, travellers have complained the new system's introduction has caused delays at ⁠some airports, ​and industry leaders have expressed concern that full implementation at Easter could cause widespread disruption.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 02:09:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6afd1ef0-0f69-11f0-94d2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/788743af7378158c8a8e69441c6192c17ccde454.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heckles, expulsion, cheers: Top moments from Trump’s State of the Union speech</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260225-heckles-expulsion-cheers-top-moments-of-trump-state-of-the-union-speech</link><description>For the first State of the Union address of his second term, US President Donald Trump decided to go long, broaching everything from the economy to Iran during his one hour and 47 minute speech to Congress.

Here are five key moments from the longest-ever State of the Union address:

Upon entering the US Capitol, Trump shook hands with several Supreme Court justices in attendance – three of whom had ruled days earlier to strike down the global tariffs he had made his signature economic policy.

Trump voiced his displeasure during the speech, calling the ruling "very unfortunate", as the justices watched on from the front row.

The president did not dwell long on the subject, however, and said his administration was already planning a legal work-around to keep the duties he insists will be paid for by foreign countries.

During a speech marked by political divides between Trump's Republicans and opposition Democrats, one of the few moments of unity occurred when the gold medal-winning US men's Olympic hockey team entered the room.

The entire audience rose and applauded, chanting "USA! USA!" in unison, to recognise the Olympians, who clinched America's first ice hockey gold in 46 years.

Congress plays a key, performative role during the State of the Union, applauding and standing up in agreement with the president or sitting still to voice their displeasure.

Dozens of Democrats skipped the event altogether, and those in attendance largely stayed seated except on the rare occasion.

Several wore white to pay homage to the suffragette movement celebrating women's right to vote, or donned pins demanding accountability over those named in the files released on sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

In one notable act of resistance, Democratic lawmaker Al Green was expelled after holding up a sign reading "Black people aren't apes!" in response to a racist video of the Obamas shared by Trump on his social media account.

Tensions soared when House Democrat Ilhan Omar, who has frequently sparred with Trump, shouted at the president while he spoke.

"You should be ashamed of yourselves," Trump told Democrats in attendance, who had refused to stand up throughout his address.

"You have killed Americans," Omar shouted in response, in reference to the deaths of two protesters at the hands of federal agents dispatched to Minneapolis last month.

The lawmaker, whose district represents Minneapolis, later left the speech before Trump had finished.

At one hour and 47 minutes, Trump delivered the longest State of the Union speech in US history, beating the previous record of one hour and 20 minutes set by former president Bill Clinton in 2000.

The speech even outlasted Trump's address to Congress last year shortly after taking office, which lasted one hour and 40 minutes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 07:33:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5e4eec8e-1214-11f1-86e0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-25T034239Z-616680700-RC2RSJAEF4X1-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-CONGRESS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sri Lanka arrests ex-spy chief for ‘abetting’ 2019 Easter bombings</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260225-sri-lanka-arrests-ex-spy-chief-over-2019-easter-bombings</link><description>Sri Lanka 's criminal investigators arrested the country's former intelligence chief on Wednesday in connection with the 2019 Easter Sunday bombings that killed 279 people, including 45 foreigners.

Police said retired Major General Suresh Sallay was taken into custody at dawn in a suburb of the capital, Colombo in the most high-profile arrest in the long-running investigation.

"He was arrested for conspiracy and aiding and abetting the Easter Sunday attacks," an investigating officer told AFP.

"He has been in touch with people involved in the attacks, even recently."

The coordinated bombings targeted three upmarket hotels in the capital, two Roman Catholic churches, and an evangelical Protestant church outside Colombo.

The attacks were blamed on a homegrown jihadist group.

The Catholic Church, which has spearheaded a campaign demanding justice for all victims of the brutal bombings, welcomed the arrest as a sign the investigation was continuing.

"What we need is the truth behind the Easter attacks. We want to see justice for all the victims," Church spokesman Father Cyril Gamini Fernando told AFP.

The Church had previous accused successive governments of failing to identify the masterminds behind the bombings.

The string of suicide bombings on April 21, 2019 became the worst attack against civilians in a country where at least 100,000 people had been killed in a Tamil separatist war that ended in May 2009 after nearly four decades of violence.

Sallay, who was promoted to State Intelligence Service (SIS) chief in 2019 after Gotabaya Rajapaksa became president, had been accused of involvement in organising the suicide bombings, a charge he has denied.

His long-expected arrest came ahead of the seventh anniversary of the bombings.

British broadcaster Channel 4 reported in 2023 that Sallay was linked to the Islamist bombers and had met them prior to the attack.

A whistleblower told the network that Sallay had permitted the attack to proceed with the intention of influencing that year's presidential election in favour of Rajapaksa.

Two days after the bombings, Rajapaksa declared his candidacy and went on to win the November vote in a landslide after promising to stamp out Islamist extremism.

A former member of the jihadist group told reporters in 2019 that they were originally funded by a military intelligence unit to propagate a fundamentalist ideology in Sri Lanka's multi-ethnic eastern province.

Sallay was employed in the intelligence unit that funded the jihadists. The government at the time admitted the military was behind the radical group.

Sallay was promoted to head the SIS, Sri Lanka’s main intelligence agency, following Rajapaksa's victory, but was dismissed after Anura Kumara Dissanayake won the presidency in 2024, promising prosecutions of those behind the attacks.

While local jihadists were held responsible, Sallay was also accused of orchestrating the attack.

Two days after the bombings, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility, but investigators said they had no evidence to directly establish a foreign link.

Other investigations faulted the authorities for failing to act on warnings from an Indian intelligence agency that an attack was imminent.

More than 500 people were wounded in the bombings, which crippled the island nation’s lucrative tourism industry.

US authorities in 2021 charged three Sri Lankans for supporting the Easter attacks, in which five US nationals were killed.

The three are among 25 suspects indicted in Sri Lanka's High Court.

The Supreme Court fined then-president Maithripala Sirisena and four senior officials more than $1.03 million in a civil case for their failure to prevent the attacks.

The UN has asked Sri Lanka to publish parts of previous inquiries into the bombings that were withheld from the public.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 08:51:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9dd676d6-1211-11f1-a2e4-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/fccee3a185e3f5e6c6ebb313c5beabcb8ca61b14.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Ukrainian negotiator to meet US team ahead of fresh Russia talks, Zelensky says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260225-live-ukraine-us-russia-talks-zelensky</link><description>⁠A ​Russian court ​has fined Alphabet's Google over 22 ​million ‌roubles ($288,000) for ⁠distributing VPN (virtual ‌private network) services ⁠on the Google Play app store, ​state ‌news agency TASS reports.

The story quickly sparked headlines around the world.

“The name ‘Palestine’ was removed from all the exhibits in the British Museum,” reads a February 16 Facebook post shared by the French-language edition of AJ+, a publication of Qatari media outlet Al Jazeera . For its part, Agence Média Palestine reported that the British Museum removed references to Palestine “from its exhibits under pressure from a pro-Israel group”.

The social media accounts of several English and French language outlets were also quick to share the news. Pure TV+ – whose misleading posts we’ve reported on in the past – declared to its 200,000 Facebook followers that the British Museum decided "under pressure from a pro-Israeli group” to “delete all references to 'Palestine' from its exhibits".

In reality, the British Museum still uses the term "Palestine" in a number of different exhibits, as the museum itself indicated in a short statement published on February 16: “It has been reported that the British Museum has removed the term Palestine from displays. It is simply not true. We continue to use Palestine across a series of galleries, both contemporary and historic.”

Our team contacted the British Museum, known for its collections of antiquities. The museum reiterated to our team that they are still using the term “Palestine”.

“We use the UN terminology on maps that show modern boundaries, for example, Gaza, West Bank , Israel , Jordan , and refer to ‘Palestinian’ as a cultural or ethnographic identifier where appropriate,” the museum said.

The museum did say that they had modified “certain panels and maps” about ancient regions for what they say were primarily reasons of historical accuracy.

“For the Middle East galleries, for maps showing ancient cultural regions, the term ‘Canaan’ is relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BC,” the British Museum said.

The British Museum also explained to our team that these changes were undertaken “last year”, but that the terms Palestine and Palestinians were still being used in Gallery 57, for example, which is dedicated to "Ancient Levant". You can see the gallery on Google Maps by clicking here .

Those who accuse the museum of erasing Palestinian history also believe that this change was undertaken after pressure from pro-Israel actors. The source of these accusations is an article published on February 14 by the British media outlet The Telegraph , which reported that the British Museum had undertaken these changes after complaints from UK Lawyers for Israel (UKLIF), a voluntary group of solicitors, who were concerned about the use of the term “Palestine” in displays covering ancient Egypt and the Levant.

UKLFI, known for running various pro-Israel campaigns, said that it had sent a letter to the director of the British Museum complaining “that several maps and descriptions retroactively apply the term 'Palestine' to periods in which no such entity existed and risk obscuring the history of Israel and the Jewish people”.

UKLFI told our team that they had contacted the museum on February 6.

UKLFI posted an article on its site on February 14 , welcoming the change made by the museum. The article cited a museum spokesperson who said to the organisation that “the historic use of the term Palestine … is in some circumstances no longer meaningful”.

When asked, the British Museum said that the decision to modify the information panels had been taken independently and that it was not linked to the letter sent by UKLFI.

A spokesperson for the British Museum said to the Museum Journal that the museum staff “began their review and update of the labelling over a year ago” in response to “audience testing”. Or, in other words, well before the museum received the letter sent by UKLFI on February 6, 2026.

When we asked if the British Museum could provide proof of when the changes in the display panels first occurred, the museum didn’t respond.

Museum director Nick Cullinan also said that museum staff had been thinking about these changes for some time and that he “hadn’t even seen” UKLFI’s letter, according to Scottish historian William Dalrymple, who posted details of his exchanges with Cullinan on X on February 16

However, the museum did acknowledge that the changes were in part made because of the current situation in Palestine.

A museum spokesperson told the Museum Journal that while the term “Palestine” had previously been considered neutral for the region, for many people, the term “no longer holds a neutral designation and may be understood in reference to political territory, which is why we use UN terminology”.

“Some of the BM's graphic panels date from the earlier period of the understanding of the term and these are being reviewed as part of plans for refurbishing these spaces,” added the spokesperson.

However, at least historically speaking, the changes enacted by the British Museum make a certain sense to the four historians who spoke to our team, though some pointed out that using the term Palestine wasn’t incorrect either.

The historians also agreed with the museum’s statement that the term "Canaan" is more "relevant for the southern Levant in the later second millennium BC”.

French scholar and historian André Lemaire, who is based at the École pratique des Hautes études (EPHE), described a “normal and legitimate evolution”.

"[The term] Canaan is the term used by texts from the time period,” he said, adding that “the geographical term Palestine was first used in the 5th century BC by [Greek historian] Herodotus".

Thomas Römer, a professor at the Collège de France, agreed.

"Canaan is a more appropriate term for describing the (southern) Levant in the second millennium [Editor’s note: BC]. The term 'Palestine' in its Greek form probably first appears in the writings of Herodotus to broadly describe the part of the Levant up to Phoenicia.”

All of the historians mentioned that Philistines, the people who gave the land the name Palestine, were in the region from at least the 12th century BC.

Françoise Briquel-Chatonnet is a historian who specialises in the Levant in the first millennium BC.

"Philistines are indeed there at the end of the second millennium [Editor’s note: BC] but only in the southwest quarter of southern Levant. So the British Museum’s choice to stop using the term 'Palestine' to designate the whole of the southern Levant at this period is historically accurate. But we could have continued to use the term 'Palestine' in a geographic sense like we speak on the Chauvet Cave in France even though France didn’t exist back then [Editor’s note: when the famous cave paintings were being made].”

The Telegraph article at the heart of the controversy also reported that references to Palestine were also removed from two information panels in another gallery dedicated to ancient Egypt between 1700 and 1500 BC, which was before the word Palestine was used and before the Philistines settled in the southern Levant.

In this case, "of Palestinian origin” was changed to “of Canaanean origin”.

“For a long time, the term Palestine was a term used for a geographic area,” Briquel-Chatonnet said, adding that it “didn’t have the same connotations that it has today”.

“Until 1948, Jews used the term Palestine,” she also said.

Felicity Cobbing, the director of the Palestine Exploration Fund, which runs the scientific journal Palestine Exploration Quarterly, also said that the British Museum had not made a historical error by referring to "Canaan", but added that the term “Palestine” is also correct when referring to the “second millennium [BC] because it is used by researchers to describe the region in its entirety in any time period”.

She added that the term remains historically important for the region.

“It is, in some ways, a conversation we should have. What do we mean by the term Palestine? Are we referring to modern Palestine with its 1967 borders? Or are we considering the term 'Palestine' in a larger, historical and geographical sense? The term ‘Palestine’ has been used intermittently all throughout history. It’s not a historical exception, it’s anchored in the nomenclature of the region."

Heeding calls from Republican lawmakers worried they could lose their congressional majority later this year, Trump spent the first hour of his televised speech focused on the economy , saying he had slowed inflation , driven the stock market to record heights, signed sweeping tax cuts and lowered drug prices.

But it was unclear whether his rosy assessment would assuage Americans' anger about the cost of living. Trump sought to blame his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden , for high prices, but opinion polls show voters hold Trump responsible ​for not doing more to ease an ‌affordability crisis after he campaigned relentlessly on the issue.

"Our nation is back – bigger, better, richer and stronger than ever before," Trump said after taking the stage to cheers of "USA, USA" from fellow Republicans in ⁠Congress, with dozens of empty seats on the Democratic side a reminder that many lawmakers skipped the speech for anti-Trump rallies outside.

The annual speech to Congress came at a fraught moment for Trump's presidency, with polls showing a majority of Americans have soured on his performance, anxieties rising over Iran and his signature tariff policy foundering after the US Supreme Court struck down most ‌of his import taxes.

For much of the speech, Trump was uncharacteristically disciplined, mostly appearing to stick to his prepared remarks and eschewing his usual stream-of-consciousness digressions. But he flashed his combative side while ⁠discussing his immigration crackdown, exchanging shouted insults with several Democratic lawmakers.

The former reality television star injected plenty of spectacle into the event. At one point, he bragged about all the "winning" that the US has experienced during his term, before introducing some other winners: members of the US men's ice hockey team, who entered the chamber wearing the gold medals they won at the Winter Olympics on Sunday.

He declared that the team's goaltender, Connor Hellebuyck, would receive the Presidential ​Medal of Freedom, one of half a dozen medals handed out to various guests with typical Trumpian fanfare.

The 79-year-old Trump's speech lasted approximately an hour and 47 minutes, breaking the record he set ‌last year for the longest presidential address to Congress.

While Trump said inflation is "plummeting", prices for groceries, housing, insurance and utilities remain significantly higher than they were a few years ago. New data released on Friday showed the economy slowed more than expected last quarter while inflation accelerated.

A Reuters/Ipsos poll found only 36% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy. Democrats hope to seize control of both houses of Congress from Republicans in November when all 435 seats are on the ballot for the House of Representatives and about a third of the 100 ‌seats in the Senate.

Virginia Governor Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat whose decisive victory in November was an early midterm warning sign for Republicans, delivered her party's official response, criticising Trump for abandoning struggling Americans.

"Is the president working to make life more affordable for you and your family?" she said. "We all know the answer is no."

Trump, who attacked the Supreme Court in personal terms after ​the tariff decision on Friday, held his fire on Tuesday, shaking hands with the four justices present as he entered the chamber. He called the ruling "unfortunate" but argued that it would ultimately have little impact on his trade policy.

Trump did not discuss artificial intelligence, at a time when the technology is fueling both the stock market and growing worries among workers about the threat it poses to job security.

He also spent little time on foreign policy, even though he has focused much of ​his energies in office on issues abroad.

Trump again claimed he "ended" eight wars, an exaggeration, and barely mentioned Ukraine , despite Tuesday marking the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion. He did not discuss China, America's chief economic rival, or Greenland , the semi-autonomous Danish territory he has ​threatened to take over.

Trump also did not offer clarity regarding his plans for Iran amid signs he is inching closer to a military conflict with Tehran.

"My preference is to ​solve this problem through diplomacy," he said. "But one thing is certain: I will never allow the world's No. 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon."

When Trump turned to his favourite topic, immigration, he repeated the same rhetoric that animated his 2024 campaign, claiming undocumented migrants were responsible for a wave of violent crime despite studies showing ​that is not the case.

"You should be ashamed," he told Democrats, chastising them for refusing to fund the Department of Homeland Security unless measures are taken to curb the aggressive tactics of immigration agents under Trump.

Opinion polls show a majority of Americans believe Trump's immigration crackdown has gone too far, after two US citizens were shot dead by masked federal agents in Minneapolis .

As Trump praised his immigration enforcement, Democrat Ilhan Omar, who represents a Minneapolis US House district, shouted in his direction, "You have killed Americans!"

Trump, who has falsely claimed for years that election fraud in the US is rampant, also attacked Democrats for not supporting a voter identification requirement.

"They want to cheat," he said. Democrats argue that the Republican-backed legislation would impose unnecessary burdens on voters and suppress turnout.

Democratic US Representative Al Green was removed from the House chamber ⁠for the second consecutive year after waving a sign at Trump that read, "Black people aren't apes". The message referred to a social media video Trump posted with a clip depicting former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama as apes.

The White House eventually took down the video, which Trump said was posted by ⁠a staffer. Green, who is Black, was also ejected ​during last year's address after shouting at Trump.

Other Democrats offered quieter messages of protest. US Representative Jill Tokuda, a Hawaii Democrat, wore a white jacket emblazoned with words like "affordability" and "healthcare".

A number of Democratic women wore tags saying "release the files", a reference to the scandal surrounding convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein .

The response among Congress illustrated the deep divisions that continue to define US politics . While Republicans cheered and gave standing ovations, Democrats reacted with stony silence, occasional heckles and walk outs.

One of the only announcements to garner applause across the aisles was a call by Trump to impose a law to stop insider trading among politicians.

With the US midterm elections just over seven months away, the televised address was also a change for Trump speak about key issues and convince voters that Republicans should retain control of the House and Senate. Did he succeed?

Ahead of Trump’s address, polls showed that most Americans wanted Trump to talk about the cost of living as a top priority, with many keen for his administration to increase its focus on lowering prices for consumer goods, food, housing and healthcare.

Trump on Tuesday claimed a range of economic wins for voters in the past 12 months – from bringing inflation down to 1.7% to lowering the cost of eggs by 60% – many of which were false or exaggerated .

For instance, a claim to have “lifted 2.4 million Americans… off food stamps” disguised the fact that a decline in food stamp use is largely due to disruption in distribution caused by a November 2025 government shutdown and changes in eligibility laws.

“Most Americans have quite different experiences with the economy relative to the portrait painted by Trump,” said Jon Rogowski, professor of American politics at the University of Chicago.

“Economic growth has slowed during his administration, and costs for many goods – including food – have risen. Most people are unlikely to find Trump’s assertions persuasive or reassuring as they belie Americans’ own experiences.”

The president reiterated his belief that imposing steep tariffs on foreign countries had brought in “hundreds of billions of dollars” to the US and given him leverage in negotiations with foreign powers.

He also claimed that pursuing his tariff policy would reduce financial burden on Americans – despite the fact that the taxes drive up prices for consumer goods – and criticised the “unfortunate involvement” of the Supreme Court , who recently ruled that some of his tariffs were illegal.

Recent polling showed that 64% of Americans disapprove of Trumps tariffs, but the president showed little indication of changing course.

“He again demonstrated that he either does not understand how tariffs work or is deliberately misrepresenting them as a source of foreign revenues benefiting the US rather than an effective tax on its population,” said Jack Rakove, William R. Coe professor of history, emeritus at Stanford University and winner of the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for history.

Another topic Americans were keen for Trump to address was immigration , particularly his administration’s heavy-handed approach to deportations led by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Two US citizens were shot during disputes with ICE officers in Minneapolis in January, sparking nationwide protests.

While Trump did not address concerns over ICE directly, he did claim to have secured US borders and completely stopped illegal immigration .

He frequently referred to immigrants as a destabilising and dangerous force in the US, telling numerous stories of graphic violence perpetrated against US citizens by “hardened criminals” and “terrorists”.

When Trump did mention Minneapolis it was to reference a large-scale fraud operation on the city’s social services involving some members of the city’s Somali community – which provoked a heckle from Minnesota representative and house Democrat Ilhan Omar, who called Trump a “liar”.

She later shouted at the president: "You have killed Americans".

Trump was expected to use his address as a platform to justify a potential US military strike on Iran to voters – but he gave US foreign policy little airtime overall.

“Ukraine got only a few seconds of attention. His discussion of Israel and Gaza focused mainly on the recovery of all the hostages. He said nothing about how political power would be reconstituted in Gaza or about his Board of Peace ,” said Rakove.

Trump took credit for ousting former Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and striking an oil deal with the country, as well as stopping the flow of drugs into the US from Mexico and the Caribbean.

On Iran , Trump praised a US military strike on the country’s nuclear arsenal last year, but said his preference going forward “is to solve this problem through diplomacy” – even as the US continues a massive build up of warships and fighter jets in the Middle East.

"Trump missed a chance to explain his thinking about Iran," said Rogowski, adding that it was "notable" the president did not spend more time explaining the case for military intervention to voters.

"While he raised questions about Iran’s nuclear program and the regime’s treatment of protestors, he forecast little about what next steps the US might take."

The unfolding scandal surrounding late financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein was completely absent from Trump’s speech.

Trump ran for the presidency on a promise to release millions of pages of FBI files shedding light on the activities of Epstein and his web of powerful contacts in the upper echelons of politics, business and academia.

His administration has overseen the protracted release of heavily redacted tranches of the files – often blocking references to Trump himself – which have largely failed to satisfy public demand for more information.

While Trump declined to mention the scandal, Democrats including former house speaker Nancy Pelosi wore badges in solidarity with Epstein’s victims calling for more of the FBI files to be released.

While Republicans in attendance responded with almost blanket enthusiasm to Trump’s speech, their path to retaining to power in November’s midterm elections is far from assured.

Polling head of the State of the Union address showed a noticeable drop in his approval rating, with voters particularly unhappy with how Trump is handling immigration, the economy and tariffs.

“Republican members of Congress are unlikely to have exited the chamber tonight reinvigorated,” said Rogowski. “Trump did not deliver any new messaging, framing, or line of attack on economy and immigration. There were no new ideas on which Republicans can stake their chances.”

“Once Republicans gather out-of-doors or go home at night, they can hardly think they have turned a corner on the way to the midterms,” added Rakove. “The polling has all been moving in one direction, and there seems to be more breaking news about the Epstein files and the Department of Justice's coverup of Trump's place in it that is not going to disappear.”

Another issue was the sheer length of the president’s address. Coming in at one hour and 47 minutes, Trump gave the longest State of the Union speech in history.

As he spoke, cameras scanning the audience in Congress picked up multiple instances of yawns, fidgeting and, possibly, the odd snooze.

“Many voters are unlikely to have tuned in for the full speech,” Rogowski said, “and the Republicans applauding upon its conclusion were probably doing so out of relief rather than enthusiasm.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 13:05:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/74da64e0-1239-11f1-9eda-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-25T045751Z-1167286239-RC2QSJAFASV4-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-CONGRESS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo to visit Algeria, a first in papal history, on packed Africa tour</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260225-pope-leo-to-visit-algeria-first-in-papal-history-packed-africa-tour</link><description>Pope Leo XIV will visit four African nations in April, the Vatican said Thursday, including Algeria – the first time a pope will travel to the North African Muslim nation.

The Vatican announced a series of international trips in the months ahead for the US pontiff, who was elected last year, including to Spain and Monaco.

But the official trip to Algeria, which will see Leo visit Algiers and Annaba from April 13 to 15, will be particularly symbolic.

Algeria is the birthplace of the fifth-century St Augustine and the pope belongs to the Augustinian order, which was founded in the 13th century.

Islam is the state religion but the constitution guarantees freedom of worship, subject to approval by the authorities for the place of worship and the preacher.

Leo's visit, which is expected to focus on interfaith dialogue, comes 30 years after the beheading of seven French Trappist monks from a monastery during the 1990s civil war.

The head of the Catholic Church will then visit Cameroon, Angola and Equatorial Guinea.

Leo will visit Yaounde, Bamenda and Douala from April 15 to 18, then Luanda, Muxima and Saurimo between April 18 and 21, before travelling to Malabo, Mongomo and Bata between April 21 and 23.

The pope is likely to appeal for peace and dialogue while in Angola and Cameroon, where long-running separatist struggles continue to kill civilians.

Before his trip to Africa, the pontiff will visit Monaco for a day, the Vatican said.

The visit to the principality on the French riviera will take place on March 28 and will be the first papal trip to the city state in modern times.

A statement from the principality in the name of Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene said it would be "a historic moment for Monaco and stand as a strong sign of hope, in a spirit of dialogue, peace, and shared responsibility".

Leo will also visit Spain from June 6 to 12.

The Vatican News website said he would first visit the capital Madrid, and then travel to Barcelona, where he will inaugurate the newest and tallest tower of the Sagrada Familia Basilica.

The visit marks 100 years since the death of its Catalan architect, Antoni Gaudi, who was declared "venerable" by the Catholic Church in 2025, the first step on the path to sainthood.

Leo will then travel to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of West Africa , a key point on the migration route to Europe.

The American pope, who became head of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics in May, is a vocal defender of migrants , an issue which was also dear to his predecessor Pope Francis .

While in the Canary Islands, Leo will visit Tenerife and Gran Canaria, Vatican News said.

The announcements of the trips follow news the pope will visit a series of areas within Italy in the coming months, including the island of Lampedusa .</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 14:31:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7223f046-1242-11f1-85f4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-25T115907Z-314763327-RC2HOJA566RJ-RTRMADP-3-POPE-TRAVEL.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Louvre director tasked with leading a beleaguered landmark out of decades of crisis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260225-new-louvre-director-christophe-leribault-appointed-to-lead-the-museum-out-of-decades-of-crisis</link><description>The world’s largest museum has a new boss.

French President Emmanuel Macron appointed Christophe Leribault as the new director of the Louvre Museum on Wednesday. The appointment comes a day after his predecessor Laurence des Cars, the museum’s first female director, resigned .

The former Paris bureau chief for the New York Times, Elaine Sciolino, wrote in her book “Adventures in the Louvre” that des Cars “brought impeccable credentials as director”. Yet the winds were not in des Cars' favour. She was accused of rushing the sweeping, €800 million “ Nouvelle Renaissance ” modernisation of the museum, one of French President Emmanuel Macron's pet projects.

But disaster struck when thieves took less than eight minutes to steal crown jewels valued at €88 million ($102 million) from the Louvre in October. The heist stunned visitors, exposed glaring vulnerabilities and left one of France's most symbolically charged collections in criminal hands.

In a succinct communiqué released Tuesday, Macron’s office announced that des Cars had offered her resignation, which the president accepted.

“She has too few friends and too many enemies,” Sciolino said in a social media post on Wednesday.

Like his predecessor, the Louvre's new director is an experienced art historian and curator.

Leribault, 62, has been running another world-renowned French landmark, Versailles Palace, since 2024. The former palace for French royalty west of Paris was the venue for Olympic equestrian sports when Paris hosted the summer games. Leribault also once headed Paris’s Orsay Museum.

“He will be tasked with leading important projects that are crucial for the institution’s future," French government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon said as she announced Leribault’s appointment.

Foremost among them will be leading the "Nouvelle Renaissance" renovation project that exposed des Cars to considerable backlash.

French presidents often like to leave a major cultural work as part of their legacy – Georges Pompidou with the eponymous Centre Pompidou, François Mitterrand with the national library or the Musée du Quai Branly – Jacques Chirac, for example.

The Louvre renovation is Macron’s project.

That is one reason some in France’s cultural world openly speculated des Cars did not leave in October, right after the heist, even after offering her resignation: Macron had so much riding on the Louvre plan that an immediate departure risked making his flagship cultural project look like it was collapsing.

The project includes a new entrance near the Seine River to ease pressure on I.M. Pei’s pyramid, new underground spaces and a dedicated room for the “Mona Lisa” with timed access – all intended to improve crowd flow and reduce the daily crush of visitors that has become a symbol of the Louvre’s success, and its dysfunction.

The former royal palace has also suffered a broad array of other problems that have presented a picture of a treasured national institution crumbling in real time.

The Louvre’s problems highlight decades of under-investment: “overcrowding, leaks from all sorts of different pipes that don’t work throughout the whole place", Sciolino said in an interview with FRANCE 24 in December 2025.

"Security has been one of the main problems and one of the main faults of the Louvre,” she said.

Strikes over pay and working conditions have repeatedly shut the Louvre ​since mid-December while water leaks and a ticket-fraud probe that prosecutors say siphoned more than €10 million over a decade have also cast a shadow over one of Paris's top tourist attractions.

“The French state is trying to get it right, and this plan to create a whole new entry for the Louvre, with a special space for the Mona Lisa – that’s great. But it’s going to cost a billion dollars and it’s going to take at least six years, and the Louvre needs help now,” Sciolino said.

Leribault now faces the delicate task of maintaining the integrity of a national monument while creating a smoother and more accessible experience for visitors.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 16:03:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4589242a-1242-11f1-8c21-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23030397872613.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria confirms mass escape of suspected Islamic State jihadists' relatives from detention camp</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260225-syria-confirms-mass-escape-of-suspected-islamic-state-family-members-from-detention-camp</link><description>Syria 's interior ministry confirmed on Wednesday the mass escape of relatives of suspected Islamic State (IS) group jihadists from al-Hol camp last month following the withdrawal of Kurdish forces who had overseen the facility.

"When our forces arrived, they found cases of collective escapes due to the camp having been opened up in a haphazard manner," interior ministry spokesman Noureddine al-Baba told a press conference.

Al-Hol, the largest camp for relatives of suspected IS jihadists in northeastern Syria, had been under the control of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

But last month, Syrian troops drove Kurdish forces from swathes of the north, sparking questions over the fate of the IS prisoners and their families.

Under pressure, the SDF withdrew from the camp on January 20, with Syrian security forces taking control a few hours later.

"The SDF withdrew suddenly, without coordination and without informing" the Syrian authorities or the international anti-jihadist coalition beforehand, al-Baba said.

There was a "chaotic situation" after the Kurdish forces pulled out, he added, and "more than 138 breaches" have been discovered in the camp's 17-kilometre perimeter wall that allowed mass escapes.

After the Kurdish forces withdrew, thousands of women and children fled the camp to parts unknown.

Al-Hol housed 23,500 people, mostly Syrian and Iraqis, the ministry spokesman said.

Around 6,500 foreigners of 44 different nationalities lived in a high-security section of the camp.

Last week, Syrian authorities moved the families still at al-Hol to another site in the country's north.

Before the Kurdish forces withdrew, the United States military had transferred more than 5,700 detained IS suspects from Syrian prisons to Iraq .

The US had previously announced it would transfer around 7,000 detainees.

IS swept across Syria and Iraq in 2014, committing massacres and forcing women and girls into sexual slavery.

Backed by US-led forces, Iraq proclaimed the defeat of IS in the country in 2017, and the SDF ultimately beat back the group in Syria two years later.

The SDF went on to jail thousands of suspected jihadists and detain tens of thousands of their relatives in camps.

Up to eight CJNG members were killed in the operation , including the cartel’s elusive leader – for years the most-wanted criminal figure on both sides of the US-Mexico border.

Within hours, the cartel launched hundreds of coordinated “narco-blockades” in around 20 locations nationwide, paralysing major cities including Guadalajara and Puerto Vallarta. Vehicles were set ablaze, highways blocked and businesses shuttered in a show of force that underscored the CJNG’s operational capacity, even without its co-founder.

El Mencho, indicted in the United States in 2014 on drug trafficking and weapons charges, had a $15 million bounty on his head. Under his command, the CJNG shot down a Mexican military helicopter, attempted to assassinate Mexico City’s then police chief Omar Garcia Harfuch in 2020 , and built what US authorities consider one of the main trafficking networks for heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine and fentanyl into the United States.

Founded in 2009, the CJNG grew into one of Mexico’s most powerful criminal organisations, rivalling – and in some regions, surpassing – the Sinaloa cartel. At its height, it was believed to command tens of thousands of armed members and maintained an extraordinary level of military-style firepower.

But with its leader gone, the question is more about the CJNG’s cohesion than its strength.

“We don’t really know what will happen: the situation is highly volatile,” said Jean-Michel Le Prince, a Radio-Canada journalist and author of "La faute à Pablo Escobar" (in French).

“The cartel map in Mexico has changed drastically in recent years. Jalisco expanded enormously.”

El Mencho reportedly had four key lieutenants , and they could turn against each other, Le Prince said.

“It’s possible the cartel could be run in a more discreet way. But as often in Mexico, it’s very difficult to anticipate what will happen.”

The precedent of the Sinaloa cartel looms large. After the capture of Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman , two main factions emerged: his sons, known as the "Chapitos", on the one side and his longtime associate Ismael “El Mayo” Zambada on the other.

“At one point, people spoke of a ‘ pax narca ’,” Le Prince recalled. “But one of the Chapitos lured El Mayo into an ambush . Since then, it’s been war – and it’s still war. Yet the cartel continues to function.”

The CJNG rose to prominence, in part, because Sinaloa was weakened by internal conflict. A similar fragmentation today could redraw Mexico’s criminal geography once again.

Unlike the rigid hierarchies often portrayed in popular culture, the CJNG operates through what security specialist José Luis Montenegro described as “criminal franchises” in an interview with FRANCE 24’s Spanish-language channel.

“It’s not like in the Netflix series,” Montenegro says. “The structure is not rigid. Each leader has territorial autonomy. It’s highly departmentalised.”

The group maintains semi-autonomous regional factions that forge alliances with local criminal actors to manage drug production and trafficking, extortion rackets and fuel theft. This model has allowed it to expand rapidly across Mexico and abroad, with US authorities estimating its presence in up to 100 countries , according to the US Drug Enforcement Agency.

The territorial control the CJNG established allowed it to infiltrate deep into local politics, judicial systems and security forces.

Human rights lawyer Jimena Reyes notes that the CJNG became notorious for “conquering territories through highly visible brutality” and ruling “through fear” – including the public display of mutilated bodies in contested areas such as Veracruz.

For Reyes, the key concern now is fragmentation.

“There will certainly be violence during the restructuring process,” she said. “Strategic routes, laboratories and territories are at stake.”

Ernesto Lopez Portillo, coordinator of the Citizen Security Programme at Mexico’s Iberoamericana University, warned that the group's “power centres may have incentives for immediate reorganisation, but also incentives for confrontation”. He sees “a strong possibility of temporary but sharp increases in violence”, both internally and between rival cartels.

Given the CJNG’s size and reach, a fierce power struggle could erupt in several regions simultaneously.

The operation that killed El Mencho signals a shift in tone under President Claudia Sheinbaum. Her predecessor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, famously championed a policy referred to as “Abrazos, no balazos” (Hugs, not bullets).

Yet during the 2019 capture of Ovidio Guzman, one of El Chapo’s sons, Obrador ordered his release after intense urban fighting – only for him to be rearrested later and extradited to the United States.

“This time, the hard line is being used,” Le Prince said. He cited a “double factor” driving the change: both domestic security pressures and US expectations.

Under US President Donald Trump, Washington had increased pressure on Mexico to dismantle major trafficking networks. Sheinbaum has swiftly extradited high-profile traffickers and militarised parts of the border.

“She is clearly taking the initiative,” Le Prince said, suggesting the move might also be ailed at pre-empting any unilateral US action.

Mexico’s national security chief Omar Garcia Harfuch – himself a past target of the CJNG – is credited with leading the Tapalpa operation. Notably, there were few reports of civilian casualties , a rare outcome in cartel confrontations.

Yet the swift narco-blockades that followed El Mencho’s death served as a reminder: These are vast criminal enterprises that do not disappear overnight.

“These are major businesses. They will continue,” Le Prince said. But he added: “They need stability to conduct business.”

Whether the CJNG maintains that stability through consolidation or descends into open warfare may well determine Mexico’s security landscape in the months ahead.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 19:06:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a29bc218-126e-11f1-8d83-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26054750052635.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former Brazil lawmakers convicted of ordering murder of Rio councilwoman Marielle Franco</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260225-brazil-politicians-convicted-for-ordering-murder-of-black-activist-councilor</link><description>Brazil 's Supreme Court on Wednesday convicted two former lawmakers of ordering the 2018 assassination of Rio de Janeiro councilwoman Marielle Franco, a popular black activist whose murder exposed deep ties between politics and organised crime .

Franco, a lesbian activist who grew up in a favela and became an outspoken critic of Rio's powerful militia groups, was 38 when she was gunned down in the city centre alongside her driver, Anderson Gomes.

The case sent shockwaves through Brazil and drew international condemnation.

The four-justice Supreme Court bench voted unanimously to convict former federal lawmaker Chiquinho Brazao, 62, and his brother Domingos, 60, a former state lawmaker, of ordering the hit on Franco.

They were each sentenced to 76 years and three months in jail for double aggravated homicide, armed criminal organisation and the attempted murder of one of Franco's advisors who survived the attack.

The court found that Franco had been targeted as she was a threat to the interests of the Brazao brothers.

From her position on the city council, Franco worked to prevent the expansion of clandestine housing developments in poor neighborhoods, one of the militias' biggest sources of income.

The Brazao brothers "didn't just have contact with the militia. They were the militia," Judge Alexandre de Moraes said in court.

Franco was murdered to deliver a "message" to Rio's political class, the court heard.

She was, said Moraes, "a black woman who dared to go against the interests of militia members, men, and white people".

Rio's militias emerged around four decades ago when former police officers and security agents created so-called self-defense groups to protect communities from drug gangs.

They quickly evolved into powerful criminal organisations – controlling large parts of the city, extorting residents and seizing public land – while benefitting from high-level political support.

On Tuesday, the defense insisted on the Brazao brothers' innocence, while noting that links between local power and criminals were an open secret.

"Let he who is involved in politics in Rio and has never asked drug traffickers or militia members for votes cast the first stone," said Cleber Lopes, Chiquinho Brazao's lawyer.

Three other defendants were convicted over the masterminding of Franco's murder.

Rivaldo Barbosa, a former police commissioner who first led the investigation, was sentenced to 18 years for obstruction of justice and trying to protect the Brazao brothers.

Former military police officer and militia member Ronald Paulo de Alves was sentenced to 56 years for monitoring Franco's routine and reporting on her whereabouts on the night of her murder.

A former advisor to Domingos Brazao, Robson Calixto Fonseca, got nine years for acting as an intermediary between the defendants and militia members.

Two former military police officers who carried out the murders were given hefty jail terms in 2024.

The investigation into the masterminds was based on the plea testimony of one of them, Ronnie Lessa, who confessed to his role in the murder and was sentenced to 78 years in jail in 2024.

He said during his trial he was "blinded" and "driven crazy" by the prospect of a million-dollar reward for Franco's murder.

"This process has caused me great spiritual and psychological harm," said Justice Carmen Lucia, the only woman on the Supreme Court.

"How many Marielles will Brazil allow to be murdered?" the judge asked.

The fighting on Wednesday was concentrated in particular in areas near the mining town of Rubaya, where AFC/M23 soldiers were hit by a drone strike the previous day, local and security sources told AFP.

The Rubaya mine produces 15 to 30 percent of the world's supply of coltan, key to making electronics such as laptops and mobile phones.

Since its resurgence in 2021, the AFC/M23 has taken vast tracts of the DRC's resource-rich east, capturing the Rubaya mine in North Kivu province in April 2024 with Rwanda 's help.

Its advance intensified the more than three-decades-long conflict which has ravaged the eastern DRC, where dozens of rival armed groups and foreign powers have long vied for control of the region's rich veins of valuable minerals.

The AFC/M23 in December launched an offensive on the strategic city of Uvira, a strategic town in South Kivu province near the border with Burundi .

The assault drew condemnation from the United States, which has mediated a fragile peace deal between the DRC and Rwanda.

Angola , another mediator, had proposed a ceasefire to take effect on February 18, though it has done little to halt hostilities.

On Wednesday, local militias backed by Congolese soldiers carried out attacks across several points of the front line in North Kivu, particularly in Masisi – where Rubaya is located – according to local and security sources.

These militias captured the village of Kazinga on Wednesday, some 20 kilometres northwest of Rubaya, the same sources said.

According to UN experts, the AFC/M23 has set up an administration parallel to the Congolese state to regulate the operation of the Rubaya mine since its capture.

"In central Rubaya, people are terrified. I went to see the place where the drone struck, but access was denied," a resident told AFP Tuesday, requesting anonymity.

AFP was unable to confirm the death toll from the strike as phone networks in the area have been down since Tuesday and Congolese authorities and civil society groups fled when the AFC/M23 arrived.

Clashes were also reported Wednesday in the South Kivu highlands, where the Congolese army is battling a coalition of militias allied with the AFC/M23.

Outmatched on the ground by the better-equipped AFC/M23 and Rwandan troops, Kinshasa's forces have relied in part on US pressure on Kigali to stabilise the front line, regional specialists and security sources told AFP.

They also said Kinshasa has secured relative control of its skies thanks to long-range Chinese and Turkish drones, and the help of foreign paramilitaries.

As the coastguard approached, “shots were fired from the boat” wounding the commander of the Cuban vessel, the ministry said in a statement posted on X by the Cuban embassy in Washington.

“As a consequence of the confrontation, as of the time of this report, four aggressors on the foreign vessel were killed and six were injured,” the statement said.

The wounded ‌foreign attackers were evacuated and received medical attention, the ministry said, adding that it remained committed to “protect its territorial waters”.

The “illegal” boat was detected one nautical mile from Falcones Cay in Villa Clara province, according to the ministry.

The firefight comes amid heightened tensions between the United States and the island, which lies just 160 kilometres across the Florida Straits.

The United States ​has blocked virtually all oil shipments to the island, increasing pressure on the Communist-run government. US ​forces captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in ​Caracas on January 3, removing ​a key Cuban ally from power.

Before Maduro’s capture, Cuba had relied on Venezuela for about half its fuel needs.

Faced with an outcry from Caribbean leaders, worried that starving Cuba of oil would cause the economy to quickly collapse, Washington said it would allow shipments of Venezuelan oil for “commercial and humanitarian use”.</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 21:35:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a782f268-1289-11f1-982b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Cuba-Coastguard.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Senegal PM vows to double penalty for same-sex relations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/zimbabwe-ends-health-funding-talks-with-us</link><description>Produced by Yinka Oyetade and Antonia Cimini</description><pubDate>Wed, 25 Feb 2026 22:34:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1d071702-1290-11f1-bfe4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/DN192682-A-01-20260217-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio defends Maduro capture as Caribbean leaders raise concerns</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260226-rubio-defends-maduro-capture-as-caribbean-leaders-raise-concerns</link><description>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday defended the Trump administration’s military operation to capture Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro , telling Caribbean leaders – many of whom objected to the move – that the country and the region were better off as a result.

Speaking to leaders from the 15-member Caribbean Community bloc at a summit in St Kitts and Nevis, Rubio brushed aside concerns about the legality of Maduro’s capture last month that have been raised among Venezuela’s island-state neighbours and others.

“Irrespective of how some of you may have individually felt about our operations and our policy toward Venezuela , I will tell you this, and I will tell you this without any apology or without any apprehension: Venezuela is better off today than it was eight weeks ago,” Rubio told the leaders in a closed-door meeting, according to a transcript of his remarks later distributed by the US State Department.

Rubio said that since Maduro’s ouster and the effective takeover of Venezuela’s oil sector by the United States, the interim authorities in the South American country have made “substantial” progress in improving conditions by doing “things that eight or nine weeks ago would have been unimaginable”.

The Caribbean leaders have gathered to debate pressing issues in a region that President Donald Trump has targeted for a 21st-century incarnation of the Monroe Doctrine meant to ensure Washington’s dominance in the Western Hemisphere. The Republican administration has declared a focus closer to home even as Washington increasingly has been preoccupied by the possibility of a US military attack on Iran.

His trip to the region came as Cuba’s government announced that its soldiers killed four people aboard a speedboat registered in Florida whose occupants it said opened fire on officers in Cuban waters.

“Suffice it to say, it is highly unusual to see shootouts in open sea like that. It’s not something that happens every day. It’s something, frankly, that hasn’t happened with Cuba in a very long time,” Rubio told reporters. He said that the US is gathering its own information and that “we’ll be prepared to respond accordingly”.

In his remarks to the group, America’s top diplomat tried to play down any antagonistic intent in what Trump has referred to as the “Donroe Doctrine”. Rubio said the administration wants to strengthen ties with the region following the Venezuela operation and ensure that issues such as crime and economic opportunities are jointly addressed.

“I am very happy to be in an administration that’s giving priority to the Western Hemisphere after largely being ignored for a very long time,” Rubio said. “We share common opportunities, and we share some common challenges. And that’s what we hope to confront.”

He said transnational criminal organisations pose the biggest threat to the Caribbean while recognising that many are buying weapons from the United States , a problem he said authorities are tackling.

Rubio also said the US and the Caribbean can work together on economic advancement and energy issues, especially because many leaders at the four-day summit have energy resources they seek to explore. “We want to be your partner in that regard,” he said.

Rubio said the US recognises the need for fair, democratic elections in Venezuela, which lies just miles away from Trinidad and Tobago at the closest point.

“We do believe that a prosperous, free Venezuela who’s governed by a legitimate government who has the interests of their people in mind could also be an extraordinary partner and asset to many of the countries represented here today,” he said.

Trump, in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, called the operation that spirited Maduro out of Venezuela to face drug trafficking charges in New York “an absolutely colossal victory for the security of the United States”.

The US had built up the largest military presence in the Caribbean Sea in generations before the January 3 raid. That has now been exceeded by the surge of American warships and aircraft to the Middle East as the administration pressures Iran to make a deal over its nuclear programme.

In the Caribbean, Trump has stepped up aggressive tactics to combat alleged drug smuggling with a series of strikes on boats that have killed over 150 people and he has tightened pressure on Cuba. Regional leaders have complained about administration demands for nations to accept third-country deportees and to chill relations with China.

One regional leader who has backed the US escalation is Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar , whom Rubio thanked for her public support, the State Department said.

Persad-Bissessar told reporters that her conversation with Rubio focused on “ Haiti ; we talked about Cuba , of course; we talked about engagements with Venezuela and the way forward”.

She was asked if she considered the latest US military strikes in Caribbean waters as extrajudicial killings: “I don’t think they are, and if they are, we will find out, but our legal advice is they are not.”

Rubio had other one-on-one meetings with heads of government, including those from St Kitts and Nevis, Haiti, Jamaica and Guyana .

Terrance Drew, prime minister of St Kitts and Nevis and chair of the Caribbean Community bloc, said the region “stands at a decisive hour” and that “the global order is shifting”.

Drew and other leaders said Cuba’s humanitarian situation must be addressed.

“It must be clear that a prolonged crisis in Cuba will not remain confined to Cuba,” Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness warned. “It will affect migration, security and economic stability across the Caribbean basin.”

Rubio told reporters that he talked to Caribbean leaders about how the “Cuba status quo is unacceptable. Cuba needs to change”.

“What the Cuban people should know is this, that if they are hungry and they are suffering, it’s not because we’re not prepared to help them. We are. It’s that the people standing in the way of us helping them is the regime. It’s their communist party,” he said.

The US Treasury Department on Wednesday slightly eased restrictions on the sale of Venezuelan oil to Cuba, which instituted austere fuel-saving measures in the weeks after the US raid in Venezuela.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 02:05:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a52d44a8-08d6-11f1-afab-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-12T230901Z-1578079413-RC2MKJAS9C2R-RTRMADP-3-USA-RUBIO-EUROPE-GERMANY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kim signals openness to US ties while calling South Korea ‘most hostile’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260226-kim-signals-openness-to-us-ties-while-calling-south-korea-most-hostile</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has suggested his country could “get along” with the United States but declared that South Korea – Washington’s security ally – remained its “most hostile” enemy, state media reported Thursday.

Kim made the remarks at the end of a landmark party congress, urging Washington to respect Pyongyang ’s status as a nuclear power.

His words came as speculation grows that US President Donald Trump may seek some kind of meeting with Kim on the sidelines of a visit to China in April.

If Washington “respects our country’s current status as stipulated in the Constitution … and withdraws its hostile policy … there is no reason why we cannot get along well with the United States ”, Kim said, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

But he appeared to close the door on any notion of building closer ties with South Korea , saying he would “permanently exclude” Seoul as one of his nation’s “compatriots”.

North Korea has “absolutely no business dealing with South Korea, its most hostile entity”, Kim said, calling Seoul’s recent dovish efforts “deceptive”.

Pyongyang amended its constitution in 2024 to define South Korea as a “hostile state” for the first time.

A “grand” military parade marked the end of the Workers’ Party congress, a once-in-five-years event that directs state efforts on everything from foreign policy to war planning.

North Korea has used such parades in the past to show off its newest weapons, offering a rare source of insight into the strength of its armed forces.

US President Donald Trump stepped up his courtship of Kim during a tour of Asia last year , saying he was “100 percent” open to a meeting.

Trump even bucked decades of US policy by conceding that North Korea was “sort of a nuclear power”.

A Trump–Kim meeting in April would mark a major breakthrough after years of deadlocked diplomacy following the collapse of their 2019 summit in Hanoi over sanctions relief and what Pyongyang would be willing to give up from its nuclear arsenal in return.

Kim appeared alongside China’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin at a grand military parade in Beijing last year – a striking display of his powerful friends and elevated status in global politics.

Pyongyang has particularly drawn much closer to Moscow, sending thousands of troops to aid Russia’s war against Ukraine .

Analysts say Russia is giving North Korea military technology, food and energy supplies in return, allowing it to sidestep tough international sanctions.

“With Moscow now providing a substantial economic lifeline – effectively neutralising the bite of UN sanctions – Kim Jong Un no longer feels the same urgency to respond” to Washington’s dialogue gestures, Seong-Hyon Lee, a visiting scholar at the Harvard University Asia Centre, told AFP.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 02:05:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/74d7d256-0e4d-11f1-bdfe-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-19T231440Z-691808125-RC29PJAYB5XI-RTRMADP-3-NORTHKOREA-POLITICS-CONGRESS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Russia slams Ukraine with missiles and drones ahead of US-Ukraine talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260226-live-russia-ukraine-missiles-drones-us-ukraine-talks</link><description>Kyiv and Washington were set to open a new round of talks in Geneva Thursday aimed at ending Moscow's four-year invasion of Ukraine, as Russia launched fresh strikes overnight.

The meeting will bring together Ukraine's lead negotiator Rustem Umerov and Trump envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, with a full trilateral session involving Russia expected in early March.

The meetings are the latest round of negotiations spearheaded by Trump that so far have failed to make meaningful progress on ending Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II.

Russia attacked ⁠Ukraine with missiles ​and drones overnight, causing damage to residential buildings and ​injuring about 20 people in the eastern and southern regions, local authorities said on Thursday.

Ballistic and cruise missiles were ​directed ‌at Kyiv, the Kyiv region and Kharkiv ⁠in the east of the country, while drones attacked Zaporizhzhia in the ‌south.

At least 14 ‌people were injured in the Kharkiv region, including a seven-year-old boy, Kharkiv ​Governor Oleh Syniehubov said on Telegram, adding that the city itself had been attacked by two missiles and 17 drones.

Zaporizhzhia ​Governor Ivan Fedorov said that at least seven people ​were injured in the overnight attack ​on the city and that Russian drones damaged 19 apartment buildings, while another ​500 homes were left without heating due to damage to infrastructure.

Oman is mediating the indirect US-Iran talks in Switzerland.

On the eve of today's high-stakes talks in Geneva, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday warned that Iran must negotiate on its missile programme.

"I would say that the Iranian insistence on not discussing ballistic missiles is a big, big problem," Rubio told reporters on the eve of new talks between the United States and Iran.

Rubio, however, steered clear of describing if the talks in Geneva would be a make-or-break moment in deciding if the United States attacks Iran.

"The president wants diplomatic solutions. He prefers them greatly," Rubio said.

As for the talks, "hopefully they're productive, but eventually we'll have to have conversations about more than just a nuclear program."

On a potential strike on Iran, Rubio said: "The president's made no decision on that, so I don't know if Thursday's the key date for that. I think progress needs to be made."

Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters Wednesday that Iran's refusal to speak with the US about ballistic missiles is "a big problem".

“Whatever they’re alleging in regards to Iran’s nuclear programme, Iran’s ballistic missiles, and the number of casualties during January’s unrest is simply the repetition of ‘big lies’,” wrote Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei on X.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he had a “favourable outlook for the negotiations” that could finally “move beyond this ‘neither war nor peace’ situation”.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 07:00:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a3bdbeec-036b-11f1-95c6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26037087211770.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democrats call missing Trump documents in Epstein files ‘largest cover-up in modern history’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260226-us-government-accused-of-major-cover-up-over-trump-sex-abuse-claims</link><description>Democrats on Wednesday accused US President Donald Trump 's administration of the "largest government cover-up in modern history" over reports that it withheld documents relating to allegations that the Republican leader sexually abused a minor.

The Justice Department said it is reviewing its Epstein files to see if any were handled "improperly" but denied any wrongdoing.

The department has released millions of pages from files connected to notorious sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein under a transparency law enacted last year. But public broadcaster NPR found gaps in the files tied to one woman's 2019 assault complaint against Trump.

Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, arguing that the DOJ's so-called "Epstein Files" release exonerated him.

Indexes and serial numbers attached to the investigative materials into Epstein's trafficking ring indicate that FBI agents conducted four interviews with the accuser and generated summaries and accompanying notes, NPR reported.

Only one summary – focused largely on her allegations against Epstein – appears in the public database.

The remaining three summaries and related notes, totaling more than 50 pages, are not available on the Justice Department's website, according to NPR's review of the document numbering. The New York Times and cable network MS NOW reported similar findings.

"This is largest government cover-up in modern history. We are demanding answers," the Democrats on the House Oversight Committee said in statement posted to social media.

In a statement Wednesday evening, the Justice Department said some media outlets have alleged that files related to Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell are also missing from records released to the public.

"As with all documents that have been flagged by the public, the Department is currently reviewing files within that category of the production," it said on X.

"Should any document be found to have been improperly tagged in the review process and is responsive to the Act, the Department will of course publish it, consistent with the law," it said, alluding to the bipartisan bill passed last year that ordered the Trump adminstration to release all its Epstein files.

The woman at the heart of this episode of the Epstein drama first contacted authorities in July 2019, shortly after Epstein's arrest on federal sex trafficking charges.

Later internal references in the released files describe her as alleging that the disgraced financier introduced her to Trump and that Trump assaulted her in the mid-1980s, when she was 13 to 15 years old.

A 2025 FBI document in the public database recounts that claim but does not include an assessment of its credibility. The detailed memos from the follow-up interviews – conducted in August and October 2019, according to the indexes – are not included.

Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said he reviewed unredacted evidence logs at the Justice Department and reached the same conclusion.

"Oversight Democrats can confirm that the DOJ appears to have illegally withheld FBI interviews with this survivor," Garcia said, adding that Democrats would open a parallel investigation and demand the missing records be provided to Congress.

The Justice Department argues that any material not posted falls within categories allowed under the law, including duplicates, privileged records or documents tied to an ongoing federal investigation.

Asked for comment, the Justice Department earlier Wednesday referred AFP to a social media response in which it denied deleting files and said documents temporarily removed for victim-related redactions or to remove personally identifiable information will be restored.

Democrats argue that the missing interview records do not fit the categories cited by the department.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 08:05:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/08c04078-12b0-11f1-b319-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/ca16811821f563b0d426e4c5cd10512182ddeee9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN approves first carbon credit to Myanmar woodstove project</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20260226-un-approves-first-carbon-credit-to-myanmar-woodstove-project</link><description>The United Nations announced Thursday the approval of the first carbon credits under a global market aimed at reducing emissions, a mechanism that has faced scrutiny over greenwashing concerns.

The UN-run market, established under the Paris climate accord, allows companies and countries to offset their excess emissions by financing projects that cut greenhouse gases in other nations.

Critics fear that if set up poorly, such schemes can undermine the world's efforts to curb global warming by allowing countries or companies to greenwash – or overstate – their emissions reductions.

The first credits issued under the new carbon market involve a project in Myanmar that distributes efficient wood-burning cookstoves that reduce harmful household air pollution and ease pressure on local forests, the UN's climate agency said.

Implemented in partnership with a South Korean company, the project will generate credits that will count towards the climate targets of South Korea and Myanmar.

The UN climate agency said the credited emissions reductions are 40 percent lower than under a previous scheme as more conservative calculations are applied under the new Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM).

"Our focus is on building confidence in this market from the outset, and this first issuance shows that the system is working as intended," Jacqui Ruesga, vice chair of the UN body supervising the PACM, said in a statement.

More than two billion people around the world cook using open fires or inefficient stoves fuelled by kerosene, coal or biomass such as wood, crop waste or dung, according to the World Health Organization.

The resulting air pollution kills millions of people each year.

The stoves in the Myanmar project burn woody biomass more efficiently, meaning it needs less fuel and spews far less smoke inside the home.

But at current rates, only 78 percent of the population is expected to have access to clean cooking by 2030, the WHO said.

"Clean cooking protects health, saves forests, cuts emissions and helps empower women and girls, who are typically hardest hit by household air pollution," UN climate chief Simon Stiell said.

"The opportunities presented by this UN carbon market across all regions are vast, particularly now that strong environmental safeguards, robust standards, and a clear system for redress are in place to ensure integrity, inclusiveness and efficiency," he said.

The 2015 Paris Agreement, which commits the world to limiting warming to well below 2C and ideally at 1.5C, also envisaged that countries could take part in cross-border trade of carbon reductions.

New rules were agreed at the UN's COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan in 2024 for the carbon market mechanism.

At the time, Greenpeace said the agreement left loopholes that would allow fossil fuel companies to continue polluting.

But other environmentalists said that, while not perfect, it provided some clarity that was absent from global efforts to regulate carbon credits.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 09:12:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1435402a-12ec-11f1-bae8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25021627118164.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kenyan police arrest man accused of trafficking fighters for Russia’s war in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260226-kenyan-police-arrest-man-accused-of-trafficking-fighters-for-russia-war-in-ukraine</link><description>Police in Kenya have arrested a man named in the alleged scheme that duped Kenyans with promises of skilled work in Russia , only for them to end up on the front lines of the fighting in Ukraine .

Festus Omwamba was arrested on suspicion of human trafficking in the northern Kenyan town of Moyale, near the border with Ethiopia, and charged Thursday in an antiterror court in the capital, Nairobi, with specific charges of trafficking 25 Kenyans to Russia last year. Police spokesperson Michael Muchiri said Omwamba was fleeing after returning from Russia.

Omwamba, who was identified by three Kenyan recruits who spoke to The Associated Press, had gone missing after families started protesting the disappearances and deaths of their relatives in the war in Ukraine.

The Kenyan government last week said more than 1,000 Kenyans were recruited to fight for Russia in Ukraine and that at least 89 Kenyans were still on the front line, 39 were hospitalized, 28 were missing in action, and others had returned home. At least one person was confirmed dead.

Watch more Russia using Africans as 'cannon fodder' in Ukraine

An intelligence report presented to Kenya’s parliament by the majority leader, Kimani Ichung’wah, said Kenyan and Russian government officials colluded with rogue job recruitment agencies to lure Kenyans to the front lines.

The Russian embassy in Nairobi denied the allegations, saying in a statement last Thursday that it never issued visas to anyone intending to travel to Russia to fight in Ukraine. It added: “The Russian Federation does not preclude citizens of foreign countries from voluntarily enlisting in the armed forces.”

Kenya’s Foreign Minister Musalia Mudavadi on Feb. 9 told the AP that he would travel to Russia for what he called a “diplomatic approach to rein in any dubious entities that are taking advantage of anyone in this misadventure”.

Mudavadi added that efforts to secure the release of Kenyans in Ukrainian prisons and repatriate those in Russia were ongoing.

“You recall that even at the highest level, the president made an appeal that if indeed there are Kenyans who have found themselves on the wrong side of the law, the appeal was made to the Ukrainian government to look at how they can be processed and brought back,” the minister explained.

Omwamba’s arrest is a major development in the government’s push to stop the recruitment of Kenyans to fight in Ukraine.

A recruit who escaped from the front line and sought refuge at the Kenyan Embassy in Russia, and was later processed for return home, John Kamau, told the AP he met Omwamba at a house in Nairobi where fellow recruits awaiting travel to Russia were kept.

Another recruit, who requested anonymity for fear of being tracked down by Russians, said Omwamba avoided contacting the recruits by text message and would instead call them or meet them in person.

The recruit had signed up after being told he would get a plumbing job in Russia, but on arrival, his passport was taken away and he was taken to a military camp for a few days before being deployed to the front line.

All recruits said Omwamba oversaw their tourist visa applications and ticket purchases, and two weeks after the first contact, they received visas and traveled to Russia.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 11:12:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d7beebd2-12ff-11f1-89c5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26057332145270.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Davos forum CEO Borge Brende resigns after Epstein links revealed</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260226-davos-forum-ceo-brende-resigns-after-epstein-links-revealed</link><description>The president and CEO of the World Economic Forum , Borge Brende, said he was stepping down on Thursday, a few weeks after the forum launched an independent investigation into his relationship with sex offender ​ Jeffrey Epstein .

Brende, who ‌became president of the WEF in 2017, announced his decision in a ⁠statement following disclosures from the US Justice Department that showed the Norwegian had three business dinners with Epstein and had also communicated with the disgraced ‌financier via email and text message.

"After careful consideration, I have decided to step ⁠down as President and CEO of the World Economic Forum. My time here, spanning 8-1/2 years, has been profoundly rewarding," Brende said. The statement made no mention of Epstein.

"I am ​grateful for the incredible collaboration with my colleagues, partners, and constituents, and I ‌believe now is the right moment for the Forum to continue its important work without distractions," added Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister.

Brende has said he was unaware of Epstein's past and criminal activities before first meeting him ‌in 2018, and that he regretted not having investigated him more thoroughly.

Brende's decision to quit follows a series of revelations relating to Epstein, who ​in 2008 was convicted of soliciting prostitution from a minor. The revelations have roiled business and political elites, and even the British royal family.

In a separate statement, Andre Hoffmann and Larry Fink, co-chairs ​of the Geneva-based forum that organises the annual Davos summit, said the independent review conducted by ​outside counsel into Brende's ties with Epstein had concluded.

The findings stated ​there were no additional concerns beyond what has been previously disclosed, it added.

The co-chairs said the WEF's Alois Zwinggi will serve as interim president and ​CEO, and that the forum's Board of Trustees will oversee the leadership transition, including a plan to drive a process to identify a permanent successor.

The US Justice Department has released more than 3 million pages of documents relating to Epstein, who died by suicide in jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on ⁠federal sex-trafficking charges.

His ties to a long list of business and political leaders, including US President Donald Trump, former president Bill Clinton and ⁠Tesla CEO Elon ​Musk are under close scrutiny.

Overseas, the revelations have prompted criminal investigations of Britain's Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, the former Duke of York, and other prominent figures.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 13:38:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c6266068-130d-11f1-ac83-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-99234NQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hillary Clinton to deliver closed-door testimony in congressional Epstein probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260226-hillary-clinton-to-deliver-closed-door-testimony-in-congressional-epstein-probe</link><description>Former US ⁠secretary of state ​Hillary Clinton is due to testify behind closed doors on Thursday to a congressional committee ​investigating the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , though it is not clear how much new information will come to light.

Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, has said she has little information ​to provide ‌and has accused the Republican-led panel of trying to shift focus ⁠away from President Donald Trump 's ties to Epstein, whose death in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on ‌federal sex-trafficking charges was ruled a suicide.

She and her husband, Democratic former president Bill Clinton , have both called for the full release of the Epstein files and say they are being targeted.

"Get the files out. They are slow-walking it," the former US secretary of state told the BBC in an interview earlier this month.

The Clintons initially said they wanted to testify publicly and on camera, which was denied .

They agreed to a closed-door hearing with the House of Representatives Oversight Committee when lawmakers moved to hold them in contempt of Congress.

Hillary Clinton is due to deliver ​her deposition to the committee at 11am ET (1600 GMT) ‌in Chappaqua, New York, near their main residence.

Bill Clinton is scheduled to testify at the same time on Friday.

A spokesperson for the Clintons did not respond to a request for comment.

Committee ‌chairman James Comer of Kentucky, a Republican, has said transcripts of their interviews will be made public.

Hillary Clinton's ties ​to Epstein are unclear, as she has said she never met him.

Bill Clinton flew on Epstein's plane several times in the early 2000s after he left office. He has denied wrongdoing and expressed regret for his association.

According ​to Comer, Epstein visited the White House 17 times while Clinton was in office.

Trump ​also socialised extensively with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s, ​before his 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor. Comer said evidence gathered by the panel does not implicate Trump.

Trump's ​Justice Department has released more than 3 million pages of Epstein-related documents over the past several months to comply with a law passed by Congress.

The Justice Department sought to draw attention to photos of Bill Clinton, but the documents also have revealed Epstein's ties to ⁠a long list of business and political leaders, including Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Tesla CEO Elon Musk .

Esfandiari, 39, was arrested in France last year over comments she is accused of having made on social media, including on Palestinian militant group Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.

She was sentenced to four years, of which three are suspended, the judge said, citing "the nature of the acts and their seriousness".

"The court also issues a permanent ban from the national territory," the judge added.

Some observers see Esfandiari as a potential bargaining chip in negotiations with Tehran for the release of French nationals Cécile Kohler and Jacques Paris , who have been held in Iran since May 2022. They were charged in February 2025 with "spying" for Israel in addition to previous charges of "conspiracy to overthrow the regime" and "corruption on earth".

The outcome of the trial is eagerly awaited by Kohler and Paris's relatives as tensions rage over Iran's nuclear programme, with the United States threatening military action.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 14:47:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f19a2cf8-12f3-11f1-8261-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/23b4fb662ae55c908d4a99fc1e2e4f9fe00eac76.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Havana says four gunmen killed on US speedboat were trying to 'infiltrate' Cuba</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260226-havana-says-four-gunmen-killed-on-us-speedboat-were-trying-to-infiltrate-cuba</link><description>Cuba said it thwarted gunmen trying to infiltrate from the United States as its coastguard opened fire Wednesday at a Florida-registered speedboat near its shores, killing four people and wounding six.

The clash was a new source of tension with Washington as the communist-ruled nation endures intense US pressure following the capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro .

Havana 's interior ministry said people arrested after an exchange of gunfire with the boat claimed they "intended to carry out an infiltration for the purposes of terrorism ".

The ministry said assault rifles, handguns, Molotov cocktails and other military-style gear were found on the vessel and the 10 occupants were all Cubans living in the United States.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Washington was seeking its own facts about the shooting and would "respond accordingly".

"We're not going to base our conclusions on what they've (Cuba) told us, and I'm very, very confident that we will know the full story of what happened here," Rubio told reporters while on a trip to the Caribbean nation of St Kitts and Nevis.

"As we gather more information, then we'll be prepared to respond accordingly," he said.

The attorney general of Florida , which lies just 160 kilometres from Cuba across the Florida Straits, ordered an investigation into the killings.

The Cuban interior ministry earlier said the coast guard encountered the "illegal" US vessel, whose registration number it gave as FL7726SH, one nautical mile from Cayo Falcones island off Cuba's northern coast.

As the coast guard vessel approached, "shots were fired from the illegal speedboat", injuring the commander of the Cuban vessel, the ministry said.

"As a result of the clash, at the time of this report, on the foreign side, four aggressors were killed and six others were wounded," the ministry said, adding that the injured were evacuated and received medical assistance.

In its second statement the ministry released the names of seven of the people on the speedboat. It said most of the 10 had records in Cuba for "criminal and violent activity".

A man sent from the United States to take part in this operation was arrested on Cuban soil and confessed, it added.

The Cuban government frequently reports incursions by speedboats from the United States into its territorial waters.

Carlos Gimenez, a US lawmaker with Cuban roots, demanded an investigation into the deaths.

"United States authorities must determine whether any of the victims were US citizens or legal residents and establish exactly what occurred," he said.

"The regime in Cuba must be relegated to the dustbin of history for its countless crimes against humanity ."

Incursion incidents are often related to people-smuggling to the United States or drug trafficking , and have included chases, shootouts and armed attacks on border guards.

Shortages of food and medicine and daily blackouts drove an exodus from the island in recent years, with many heading to southern Florida, which has received waves of Cuban migration since the 1960s.

Wednesday's shootings came as Washington softened a virtual oil siege of the island imposed by President Donald Trump in January after the US ouster of a top Cuba ally, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Before Maduro's seizure by US forces on January 3, Cuba had relied on Venezuela, once a major oil producer, for about half its fuel needs.

Faced with an outcry from Caribbean leaders, worried that starving 9.6 million Cubans of oil would cause the economy to collapse, Washington said it would allow shipments of Venezuelan oil for "commercial and humanitarian use".

The announcement came during the summit of Caribbean nations attended by Rubio, a Cuban-American who has spent his career hoping to topple Havana's government.

The Treasury Department said the Venezuelan oil would need to go through private businesses and not the Cuban government or the military apparatus that controls much of the island's economy.

The US oil blockade in place for over a month has brought an already crumbling Cuban economy, which has been under a US trade embargo since shortly after Fidel Castro 's 1959 revolution, to the brink.

Mexico on Tuesday dispatched two military vessels carrying nearly 2,200 tons of aid to the island – its second aid shipment in under a month.

Canada also announced CAN8 million ($5.8 million) in aid on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 15:53:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0a9dd41c-1320-11f1-9719-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-98YG6LB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Amateur hour: Trump ambassadors raise tensions across Europe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260226-amateur-hour-trump-ambassadors-stir-tensions-across-europe</link><description>When US Ambassador Charles Kushner skipped an official summons from France ’s foreign ministry earlier this week over accusations that he was meddling in domestic politics, it sparked a diplomatic clash rarely seen between close allies. But in the second era of US President Donald Trump , such episodes are becoming increasingly common.

Kushner – the father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner – re-posted a post on X from the Trump administration regarding the death of a far-right activist in Lyon, which has become a lightning rod in far-right circles . French officials saw the repost as unacceptable interference in domestic affairs by a diplomat.

The dispute escalated when Kushner failed to appear at the Quai d’Orsay after being summoned, prompting Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot to block his access to ministers. Kushner eventually spoke by phone with Barrot on Tuesday.

The clash is just the latest example of a broader pattern: a new generation of largely inexperienced, Trump-appointed diplomats whose brash communication styles and lack of decorum have sometimes unnerved their host governments.

Ambassador Bill White in Belgium has drawn criticism for his sometimes Trumpian style online. He posted an all-caps message on X with questionable punctuation on February 16, demanding Belgian authorities “DROP THE RIDICULOUS AND ANTI SEMITIC 'PROSECUTION'" against three Jewish religious figures in Antwerp.

The case concerned legal action taken against three men accused of performing circumcisions contrary to Belgian law, which stipulates that only a doctor can perform a circumcision. White framed it as anti-Semitism.

After being urged by the Belgian government to refrain from interfering in internal matters, he escalated the situation in another social media post, calling Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke "very rude” and “quite obnoxious”.

“I was told he does not like my great President,” White added.

White also targeted Conner Rousseau, leader of the Flemish centre-left party Vooruit, after Rousseau compared Trump’s crackdown on immigration to Nazi-era tactics . White demanded a public apology and declared that Rousseau was barred from entering the United States – a threat he withdrew four days later .

In Poland , Trump appointed Thomas Rose, a conservative commentator openly critical of Prime Minister Donald Tusk . Rose has frequently attacked the Polish government while insisting Poland remains Trump’s top European ally.

Tensions flared in February after Wlodzimierz Czarzasty, speaker of Poland’s lower house and leader of the New Left party, accused Trump of “destabilising” international institutions . He added that he would not support Trump’s Nobel Peace Prize nomination, saying “he doesn’t deserve it”.

In response, Rose announced he would cut off contact with the speaker, warning that such statements risked damaging relations between Warsaw and Washington.

Luxembourg’s new US ambassador, businesswoman Stacey Feinberg, also made waves during her Senate confirmation hearing. She said her goal was to “humbly” educate Luxembourg about China’s “nefarious” intentions, arguing the country lacked a sufficient understanding of the risks posed by Beijing.

“Lucifer does not show up looking like the devil,” she said.

Her remarks irritated both Luxembourg officials and China . Luxembourg’s government responded pointedly that it did not need to be lectured about either superpower and was “ not a vassal ” of any nation.

Germany , meanwhile, remains without a US ambassador more than a year after Trump’s return to the White House – a notable gap in one of Washington’s most important European allies.

US ambassador to Turkey Tom Barrack, a former real estate developer (who also serves as Trump’s special envoy to Syria) shocked the Lebanese journalists shouting questions during a press conference by urging them to behave in a “ civilised ” manner and not “animalistic”, tying their behaviour to “the problem with what’s happening in the region” – language widely viewed as inappropriate for a senior diplomat.

Elsewhere, Trump’s envoys have generated controversy as well. Former Louisiana governor Jeff Landry was pointedly appointed special envoy to Greenland and has since openly promoted Trump’s views on annexing the Danish autonomous territory.

These incidents reflect a broader trend: many of Trump’s European appointees are political outsiders rather than career diplomats – a choice that some see as sheer amateurism , and one that raises questions about both competence and intentions.

Andrew Gawthorpe, a lecturer specialising in US foreign policy at Leiden University, noted that diplomatic posts in European allied nations have long been filled by campaign donors or business figures “because they're viewed as just kind of like nice jobs … nothing particularly complicated about it”.

What sets this group apart, he said, is their “ideological edge”: media commentators, family members and allies who “don’t really care about diplomatic norms” and are focused on boosting their own profiles within conservative US media and social circles.

University of Dublin international politics professor Scott Lucas said that in Trump world, political loyalty often trumps experience. He cited Kushner’s refusal of an official summons in Paris as “a deliberate snub” and noted that similar behaviour by other envoys risks pushing European countries closer together rather than weakening them.

“The postings that are taking place now to the most important European countries ... they're not being done for diplomacy. They're being done because of the Trump camp mission,” he said.

In many cases, the appointments appear designed to reward friends and family – or to advance Trump’s ideological agenda – rather than to manage alliances.

Gawthorpe stressed that the result looks like carelessness rather than a master plan.

“It’s just a group of people who don’t really care about damaging these relationships,” he said.

But Lucas warned that even careless, performative acts can carry real consequences, from heightened tensions with France and Poland to a broader pattern of US policy driven more by partisan messaging than professional diplomacy.

Vacant posts in key nations like Germany – Europe’s largest economy – underscore that policy often flows from Trump’s chosen inner circle rather than those with vital international experience or career diplomats.

The result is an American foreign policy increasingly shaped by political loyalty and ideology – with European allies left to navigate the fallout.

The Drancy internment camp served as the main departure point for Jewish deportees from France to Nazi death camps between August 1941 and August 1944.

The two swastikas were drawn in two different buildings. One measured a few centimetres across, while the other was nearly one metre in diameter.

A candidate in the upcoming municipal elections spotted the swastikas Wednesday while campaigning, before notifying memorial associations, he said.

"In this neighbourhood more than any other, which was once a transit camp for Holocaust victims before they were deported to death camps by the Nazis, these acts are extremely serious," Gokhan Unver, a mayoral candidate for the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI), said.

Three local Communist Party lawmakers had filed a report with judicial authorities, he added.

A memorial near the housing estate where the swastikas were spray-painted, was vandalised in March 2024.

France is home to western Europe's largest Jewish population, at around half a million people, as well as a significant Muslim community sensitive to the plight of the Palestinian people in Gaza.

Members of France's Jewish community have said the number of anti-Semitic acts has surged following the attack by Hamas on Israel on October 7, 2023 and Israel's military response .

The interior ministry recorded 886 anti-Semitic acts between January 1 and August 31, 2025, 20-percent down on the same period in 2024.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 16:59:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/aa0f846e-1325-11f1-b819-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/cd9e3398373a17dd9306d7b74114b74aa74c1a8d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan vows 'immediate response' after Afghanistan launches retaliatory attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260226-pakistan-vows-immediate-response-after-afghanistan-launches-retaliatory-attacks</link><description>Afghanistan attacked Pakistani forces on Thursday and claimed to have killed dozens of soldiers and captured several more in retaliation for deadly air strikes days earlier.

The offensive at multiple points along the frontier follows a series of border clashes and Pakistani strikes on Afghanistan in recent months.

"In response to repeated violations by the Pakistani military, large-scale offensive operations were launched against Pakistani military bases and military installations," Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.

The governor's office and residents in the province of Kunar told AFP that military action was under way, while Afghan officials said armed forces were operating in multiple other provinces.

Pakistan said the attack was "being met with immediate, and effective response".

Afghanistan "opened unprovoked fire on multiple locations" across the border in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Islamabad 's information ministry said.

The Taliban government spokesman told AFP that Afghan forces had captured more than 15 Pakistani outposts in two hours.

"Dozens of (Pakistani) soldiers have been killed and we have transferred 10 dead bodies to Kunar and other areas. There are also several wounded and caught alive," Mujahid said.

There were no immediate reports of Afghan casualties.

The military operation follows Pakistani strikes on Nangarhar and Paktika provinces overnight into Sunday, which the UN mission in Afghanistan said killed at least 13 civilians.

The Taliban government said at least 18 people were killed and denied Pakistan's announcement that the military operation left more than 80 militants dead.

Both sides also reported cross-border fire on Tuesday, but without casualties.

Relations between the neighbours have plunged in recent months, with land border crossings largely shut since deadly fighting in October that killed more than 70 people on both sides.

Several rounds of negotiations followed an initial ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey , but the efforts have failed to produce a lasting agreement.

Saudi Arabia intervened this month, mediating the release of three Pakistani soldiers captured by Afghanistan in October.

Islamabad accuses Afghanistan of failing to act against militant groups that carry out attacks in Pakistan, which the Taliban government denies.

Pakistan's military launched its air strikes on Afghanistan days ago following a series of deadly suicide blasts.

They included an attack on a Shiite mosque in Islamabad that killed at least 40 people and was claimed by the Islamic State group.

The militant group's regional chapter, Islamic State-Khorasan, also claimed a deadly suicide bombing at a restaurant in Kabul last month.</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 19:04:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a8ed3dea-1340-11f1-bfce-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-26T174628Z-2041115548-RC29CHA1B9AW-RTRMADP-3-AFGHANISTAN-PAKISTAN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France names former Versailles Palace head Catherine Pégard as new culture minister</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260226-france-names-former-versailles-palace-head-catherine-p%C3%A9gard-as-new-culture-minister</link><description>The French presidency on Thursday named Catherine Pégard as the country's new culture minister as one of four new ministers appointed in a mini-reshuffle.

According to Israel’s prime ministerial website , the trip reinforced political, strategic and even personal ties between the two leaders and their governments.

The visit came with a fair share of pomp and show. Modi offered emphatic support for Israel after the "barbaric" October 7 attacks , omitting any mention of Palestinians. He and Netanyahu frequently embraced, with the Israeli leader describing the special " Modi hug " as the "real thing". At a private dinner, Netanyahu dressed in traditional Indian attire and posed for a photo with a beaming Modi, who later received an award referred to as the “Knesset Medal”, described as “the highest honour the Knesset can bestow”.

Modi was the inaugural winner of the Knesset Medal, references to which – much like the FIFA " Peace Award " given to Donald Trump – do not appear prior to this event in Israeli law or Knesset history. During his visit, Modi also wholeheartedly supported US President Donald Trump’s controversial Gaza peace plan, saying it "holds the promise of a just and durable peace for all the people in the region, including by addressing the Palestine issue".

Modi praised the role of Indian Jews in Israel – “in laboratories, hospitals and classrooms, and also on the battlefield” – and noted the spread of yoga's popularity to “almost every neighbourhood”.

The timing of the visit was notable. It came months before contentious Israeli elections and as Netanyahu’s international standing has deteriorated amid allegations of war crimes , UN accusations of genocide and an ICC arrest warrant for Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant.

Neither leader addressed the wider humanitarian and legal controversies surrounding Israel’s ruthless attacks in Gaza, which have continued despite a Trump-brokered ceasefire.

India has long tried to play neutral with Israel and Palestine, remaining largely silent about the roughly 75,000 Palestinians killed in Gaza, according to an independent estimate by the Lancet , most of them women and children. The chummy meeting also occurred as the Middle East remains volatile – the threat of US‑Israeli strikes on Iran persists, Israel continues to hit Gaza and steps to annex the occupied West Bank have begun.

Modi’s visit crystallises a decisive tilt toward Israel, driven by ideological sympathy, a surge in defence purchases and deeper technological links.

In the Knesset, Modi spoke of bilateral trade at large, saying that Delhi is "committed to expanding trade, strengthening investment flows and promoting joint infrastructure development". Most of that expanding trade would be in the field of defence.

Before Modi’s trip to Israel, Indian outlets began reporting on a historic multiyear $10 billion defence deal between the two countries, which, according to reports, is expected to focus on air-defence systems.

It’s a logical next step for the two military allies. India purchased roughly a third of Israel’s weapons exports – about $20.5 billion between 2020 and 2024, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), making New Delhi its single largest customer and helping sustain Israel’s arms boom even as parts of Europe imposed restrictions over actions in Gaza.

The gains for India are immediate. Missile‑defence systems, surveillance and battlefield technologies and partnerships on AI and quantum computing are reportedly part of the deal .

Bobby Ghosh, a columnist specialising in the Middle East, said that defence deals such as this are a win-win for India and Israel.

"The Modi government sees Israel as a partner on security issues, and Israel has a great deal to offer a government that is interested in espionage whether that is spying on its own people through tools like Pegasus, or keeping an eye on hostile neighbours like China and Pakistan."

India used Israel’s Pegasus software to illegally spy on its own citizens , including dissenting lawmakers, journalists and activists.

India's historical relationship with the Palestinians was once marked by solidarity rooted in shared anti-colonial struggles that evolved into consistent diplomatic support. India opposed the 1947 UN Partition Plan for Palestine, advocating a unified federal state instead – influenced by leaders like Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, who saw parallels with India's own independence fight. India voted against Israel's UN admission in 1949 and maintained this pro-Palestinian stance throughout the 1960s, even as it quietly accepted Israeli aid during the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

But that rhetoric has almost entirely flipped. Support for Palestine has morphed into strong alignment with Israel under Modi, driven by military, economic ties and shared anti-Islamic, right-wing Hindutva (Hindu nationalist) and Zionist ideologies.

According to Ghosh, the Hindutva movement that Modi leads is closely aligned to Israel.

"[Bezalel] Smotrich and [Itamar] Ben-Gvir speak the way that many Hindu nationalist leaders speak," he said, referring to two far-right Israeli politicians. "If you change the protagonists, and put those same words into the mouths of some of the firebrand, right-wing figures in India, they're indistinguishable from each other."

Modi was one of the first world leaders to reach out to Netanyahu after the October 7, 2023, attack, offering to provide any help that Israel needed. The two prime ministers spoke several times in the next few months, with Modi reiterating that the “people of India firmly stand with Israel”. Supporters of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were some of the staunchest backers of Israel on social media, drawing on a shared Islamophobia .

“I don't think that India is any longer a serious supporter of the Palestinian cause," Ghosh says. "Among older Indian politicians, you may hear some traces of some vestiges of the old Indian foreign policy line, which was pro-Palestine, but that voice is fading."

When X briefly made users’ countries of origin public, several prominent pro-Israel accounts were found to be run from India. It was an unfortunate testament to the success of Hindutva forces in cultivating Islamophobia by presenting Palestine as supposedly anti-Hindu.

India’s enthusiastic support for some of Israel’s most hardline and divisive right-wing politicians illustrates that shared ideology. In 2025, India welcomed extremist Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich , who was banned from several EU nations for his inflammatory statements against Palestinians and his work expanding illegal settlements.

During his visit, Smotrich emphasised the countries' common woes .

“Both India and Israel experience the hypocrisy of the international community – countries that judge us, and countries that attempt to prevent us from responding to these threats of terrorism,” he said.

For the last year, India has aggressively pursued free-trade agreements with a host of countries and blocs including the EU, US, UK , Oman , New Zealand and now, if all goes according to plan, with Israel.

During his speech at the Knesset, Modi frequently referenced the IMEC initiative – the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor, which includes shipping, energy and underwater internet infrastructure. The initiative has largely stalled in recent years due to regional instability.

Some analysts critical of India’s trade agreements with Israel believe that the association with Netanyahu may have reputational impacts on Modi, and a ripple effect on IMEC and other strategic trade relationships.

Ghosh believes that threats of sanctions and criticism of Israel by Western blocs, particularly the EU and UN, are little more than posturing. He described the international condemnation so far on the genocide in Palestine as "a light rap across the knuckles".

"Very few Western governments seem to be troubled by Israel's treatment of Palestinians. Israel continues to enjoy enormous support in the corridors of power in the West, despite its behaviour," he said.

The outcry against Modi’s visit to Israel has been limited to a handful of opposition parties within India. Even if Modi sustains some reputational damage, it's unlikely that any of India’s trade partners will balk at its now obvious friendship with Israel.

"Even the countries condemning Israel are in business with it," Ghosh said. "Do you really think the Europeans are going to give up access to the Indian market for the sake of Palestinians? Not a chance."</description><pubDate>Thu, 26 Feb 2026 22:34:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6e068ea8-1344-11f1-a132-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26057435017593.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's interim leader urges Trump to lift sanctions after Maduro ouster</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260227-venezuela-interim-leader-trump-lift-punitive-sanctions-maduro-ouster</link><description>Venezuela 's interim leader on Thursday asked US President Donald Trump to end punitive sanctions and other measures aimed at the South American country, calling the two nations "friends" following the US capture and ouster of Nicolas Maduro.

In December, Trump ordered a "blockade" of sanctioned oil vessels heading to and from Venezuela. A raft of other sanctions has been applied to individuals and state entities in Caracas.

Then on January 3, US special forces detained Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores in a daring raid, bringing them to the United States to stand trial on criminal charges.

"Let the blockade and sanctions against Venezuela end now," interim leader Delcy Rodriguez said in a speech on state television. "President Trump, as friends, as partners, we are opening a new agenda of cooperation with the United States."

Since Maduro was removed from power, Rodriguez -- his onetime vice president -- has worked closely with the United States, and passed an amnesty law to help accelerate the thaw in Venezuela's ties with the broader West.

She has received the new US chief of mission in Caracas, the head of the CIA and the chief of the US military command responsible for Latin America and the Caribbean.

The US Treasury has eased a seven-year-old oil embargo on Venezuela, as part of Washington's bid to boost oil production in the country with the world's largest proven reserves of crude.

In recent weeks, it has issued licenses allowing a handful of multinationals to operate in Venezuela under certain conditions.

In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Trump said the United States had received more than 80 million barrels of oil from Venezuela, "our new friend and partner."

Under pressure from Washington, Rodriguez pushed through a major reform of the country's hydrocarbon laws, opening up the sector to private and foreign investment.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 02:08:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8290d674-1373-11f1-8530-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-20T030431Z-1426192195-RC2DPJAS2KF8-RTRMADP-3-VENEZUELA-ASSEMBLY-AMNESTY-LAW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Comedy legend Jim Carrey receives lifetime honour at France’s 2026 Cesar Awards</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260227-comedy-legend-jim-carrey-lifetime-honour-france-2026-cesar-awards</link><description>France 's leading movie awards on Thursday gave Canadian -American actor Jim Carrey a special honour in recognition of his eclectic acting career, a tribute he accepted with a speech delivered in French.

"How was my French? Almost mediocre, right?" joked the 64-year-old Carrey as he accepted his Cesar d'honneur, recalling that he had a French relative dating back "around 300 years ago".

A standout figure of American cinema, who has been compared to comic luminaries such as Jerry Lewis, Carrey has stepped back from Hollywood in recent years.

The 51st Cesar Awards opened with a sketch celebrating Carrey by ceremony presenter Benjamin Lavernhe, who revisited one of Carrey's most legendary films, "The Mask".

His career began in stand-up comedy, before really taking off in the 1990s cult films like "Dumb and Dumber", "The Mask" and "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective".

Carrey turned toward more serious roles and won a Golden Globe for his performance in "The Truman Show" (1998), in which he played an ordinary man who realises his entire life has been orchestrated for television.

He also won acclaim for "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (2004) about a lovelorn man who decides to have memories of his former girlfriend, played by Kate Winslet, erased from his mind.

Several international box-office hits including the "Sonic" franchise followed before he stepped back from the world of film in the early 2020s.

American veteran Richard Linklater won the best director award at the Cesars for his 2025 film Nouvelle Vague, a black and white work about the shooting of the Jean-Luc Goddard's French New Wave classic Breathless.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 02:08:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/153a8d6c-1365-11f1-9635-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/8b348ed47c03819913f5fa9514701d5ec2991949.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Five killed in Gaza after Israeli airstrike as ceasefire faces strain</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260227-five-killed-gaza-israeli-airstrike-ceasefire-strain</link><description>​Israeli attacks killed five people in Gaza on Thursday, the territory's health officials said, ​and the Israeli military said it killed a militant who posed a threat to its forces in the south of the enclave.

Medics said an Israeli airstrike ​against a ‌group of Palestinians in Gaza City's Tuffah neighbourhood in ⁠northern Gaza killed two people and wounded several others.

Five people were killed and several others injured, some critically, ‌in Israeli drone strikes on two police checkpoints in southern Gaza’s ⁠Khan Younis and in the Abu Hujair area northwest of the Bureij refugee camp later in the day, medics said.

The Israeli military ​did not immediately comment on the reports.

Separately, the Israeli military ‌said forces operating in the southern Gaza Strip killed a militant who posed an imminent threat to them after he crossed into an area still occupied by Israel ‌inside the enclave.

It described the incident as a violation of the US-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas ​that began last October.

Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the war that was triggered by an attack by the Palestinian militant group Hamas on southern Israel ​on October 7, 2023 in which 1,200 people were killed, according to ​Israeli tallies.

The Gaza health ministry says more than ​72,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israeli fire since then.

It also says that at least ​600 people have been killed by Israeli fire since a ceasefire agreement came into effect last October.

Israel has said four soldiers have been killed by militants in Gaza since the ceasefire began. Both sides have traded blame for violations of ⁠the truce.

In January, the Gaza deal moved into a second phase in which Israel is expected ⁠to withdraw ​troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory's administration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 04:24:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/037ff3f2-0daf-11f1-8de3-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/a384000f51642393053472ff600fcf870bcc25d2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Pakistan strikes Kabul, declares ‘open war’ on Afghanistan after border clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260227-pakistan-strikes-kabul-declares-open-war-afghanistan-after-border-clashes</link><description>Russia ​urges ​Afghanistan and Pakistan to ​halt ‌cross-border ⁠attacks ‌immediately ⁠and resolve their differences ​through ‌diplomatic means, ‌the ​RIA news agency has reported, ​citing the Russian ​foreign ​ministry.

Clashes have erupted near the key Torkham crossing between Afghanistan and Pakistan, according to reporters on the ground.

Incoming shelling was heard from the Afghan side of the border from around 9.30am local time, before cross-border clashes resumed, while gunfire was heard in the distance.

One of the journalists saw more Afghan soldiers heading towards the frontier, before he was told to leave the area by the security forces.

The Torkham crossing has remained open for Afghans returning en masse from Pakistan, despite the land border being largely shut since fighting between the neighbours in October.

The Omari camp that accommodates returnees near the crossing was hit by the fighting overnight, prompting people to flee.

"Children, women, and old people were running," said Gander Khan, a 65-year-old returnee, standing in front of rows of tents.

"Here, nearby, a bullet (explosives) hit. I saw blood, it wounded two or three children, and two or three women," he told AFP.

Iran offered to help "facilitate dialogue" to resolve conflict between Afghanistan and Pakistan after Islamabad declared "open war" on the Taliban government and carried out air strikes on Kabul following border clashes.

"The Islamic Republic of Iran stands ready to provide any assistance necessary to facilitate dialogue and to enhance understanding and cooperation between the two countries," Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a post on X.

Pakistan carried out airstrikes in Kabul and two other Afghan provinces early Friday, Afghanistan's government spokesperson said, hours after Afghanistan launched a cross-border attack on Pakistan in the latest escalation of violence between the neighboring countries that made a Qatar-mediated ceasefire appear increasingly shaky.

At least three explosions were heard in Kabul, but there was no immediate information on the exact location of the strikes in the Afghan capital, or of any potential casualties.

Government spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said Pakistan also carried out airstrikes in Kandahar to the south and in the southeastern province of Paktia.

Pakistan’s defence minister said that his country ran out of “patience” and considers that there is now an “open war” with Afghanistan, after both countries launched strikes following an Afghan cross-border attack.

In a post on X Friday, Defence Minister Khawaja Mohammad Asif said Pakistan had hoped for peace in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of NATO forces and expected the Taliban to focus on the welfare of the Afghan people and regional stability. Instead, he alleged, the Taliban had turned Afghanistan “into a colony of India,” gathered militants from around the world and begun “exporting terrorism.”

“Our patience has now run out. Now it is open war between us,” he said. There has been no reaction from Afghan government officials to Asif’s comments.

The undergraduate student was arrested Thursday morning when five federal immigration agents entered a Columbia residential building without a warrant and under false pretences, the university's acting President Claire Shipman said.

Mamdani said that he had shared his concerns "about Columbia student Elmina Aghayeva, who was detained by ICE this morning" during the unannounced meeting with Trump.

"He has just informed me that she will be released imminently," he wrote on X.

Aghayeva confirmed her release in a post on Instagram.

"I just got out a little while ago. I am safe and okay," she wrote.

Mamdani had earlier said he went to Washington to request federal money to help build affordable housing in the Queens borough of New York.

A photo posted on X showed Mamdani standing next to a grinning Trump in the Oval Office.

Shipman, in a video posted on X, said the agents had "gained entry by stating they were police searching for a missing child" to arrest Aghayeva.

"Our security cameras captured the agents in the hallway showing pictures of the alleged missing child," she said.

"The agents took our student. This was a frightening and fast-moving situation, and utterly unacceptable for our students and staff."

It was the second White House visit for Mamdani after a meeting in November when the erstwhile political foes emerged as effusive colleagues bent on mutual support.

Washington watchers had been bracing for sparks to fly when the self-described Democratic socialist met the Republican leader, who had in turn branded the mayor-elect a "communist" and suggested the Ugandan-born New Yorker should be deported.

Trump vowed after that meeting that his administration would work with Mamdani to improve life for residents of the US financial capital.

"We're going to be helping him to make everybody's dream come true, having a strong and very safe New York," Trump said at the time.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 09:41:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e50ec07c-13b9-11f1-a12a-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2263200947.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pokemon fans are still on quest to 'catch 'em all' 30 years after release</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260227-pok%C3%A9mon-fans-still-on-quest-to-catch-em-all-30-years-after-release</link><description>Benson Lu's life revolves around Pokemon.

The 26-year-old has played the mobile game Pokemon Go every day for a decade, watches the animated show every week, goes to the local card shop in his Los Angeles suburb to play the brand's trading card game every week, and has a whopping collection of cards worth more than $70,000.

“I don’t remember when was the last day I did not think about Pokemon at all,” he said.

In the 30 years since Pokemon debuted in Japan with the 1996 release of Pokemon Red and Pokemon Green for Nintendo Game Boy, the franchise has taken over the globe with its animated shows, mobile games and highly coveted trading cards. Its popularity continues with fans young and old.

Pokemon offers a masterclass in character design, which has helped make it so enduring, said Heather Cole, teaching assistant professor of game design and interactive media at West Virginia University.

“I think the longevity of it has to do with the characters and world-building it does with the characters,” she said.

It's not just cuteness that has people clamouring for merchandise, particularly trading cards. Today, some are so coveted that social media star Logan Paul sold one for a record $16.5 million. In Southern California, the fervour around Pokemon cards has led to strings of break-ins in recent months at trading card stores that have amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars of losses and even some collectors robbed at gunpoint.

Adam Corn, owner of card business Overdose Gaming Inc, said he was able to buy a house last year from his Pokemon cards.

“Pokemon almost always appreciates in value over time,” Corn said. “So it’s just a really good place to put your money in my opinion, better than a a lot of other assets.”

Companies like Beckett Grading Services and Professional Sports Authenticator authenticate and grade the quality of Pokemon cards on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being pristine mint condition and fetching the highest prices. Paul bought the PSA Grade 10 Pikachu Illustrator card a few months prior for $5.3 million and wore the card on a chain around his neck in videos. It features a Pikachu holding a pen and feather sweeper.

Last Tuesday, thieves stole more than $80,000 of Pokemon cards from Do-We Collectibles in Anaheim – the second time the store has been targeted. Other stores around Los Angeles and in New York have been hit by Pokemon thieves too.

Duy Pham, owner of the Anaheim store, said the financial incentive of trading cards for robbers and scalpers means “the hobby will never be the same”.

“It’s rougher for collectors and players,” Pham said. “It’s hard for us to get anything."

Collectors can either pay retail price for a standard pack of randomised Pokemon cards, around $5 for 10 cards, or buy the specific card they want secondhand for higher prices. But much like gambling , opening packs doesn’t always pan out to profit – Aiden Zeng spent $1,000 on packs of cards that were only valued at $60 on the resale market, he said.

Zeng, 17, said his fandom began in elementary school, when he obsessed over character guidebooks. He eventually began trying to collect every single type of card available for his favourite, Black Kyurem.

“I memorised every single Pokemon’s specific move set, what region they come from, some of the lore behind it,” Zeng said.

Even beyond dedicated collectors, Zeng said he has seen a resurgence of popularity for Pokemon at his high school in Toronto, where some students decorate their phone cases with cards featuring special artwork or a holographic sheen.

Pokemon creator Satoshi Tajiri has said he enjoyed catching insects and other small critters in the fields and forests outside the Tokyo suburb where he lived as a child. Those creatures inspired him to make the colourful, fantastical Pokemon of which there are thousands of species today.

While his hobby is lucrative, Lu said the draw for him is still nostalgia for the characters he grew up with and the community he has formed around Pokemon. He prefers not to sell his single cards because he worries he will never be able to find them again.

Lu recently spent an entire Saturday walking around the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California , looking for Pokemon on his augmented reality phone game at an event attended by thousands.

“I’ve liked Pokemon ever since I was a kid," he said. “And I still like it the same amount.”

From beans on toast to canned spaghetti and battered dishes, this cuisine has long struggled to earn respect beyond the UK's borders.

But in Paris, a new generation of British chefs is proving the clichés wrong.

David John Kelly has called Paris home for 17 years. Trained in French cuisine, he recently opened Project Sausage, a deli dedicated to modern takes on British classics: sausage rolls, pork pies, scotch eggs and Cornish pasties.

“From day one, I never opened this (deli) for British people, I opened it for French people”, he says. “The goal was to introduce the French to a Cornish pastie… and surprise them by showing that the British can cook, and that British food is actually really nice,” he adds. With expert technique and high-quality French ingredients, he’s winning over a notoriously tough crowd.

Kelly’s mission is personal. He remembers an unappetizing childhood in England, dominated by frozen meals and the infamous beans on toast. “The food was horrible when I was a kid,” he says.

Britain hasn’t always had a poor culinary reputation. Up until the 17th century, British diets were similar to those across Europe. Starting in 1604, the Enclosure Acts privatised communal farmland, displacing small farmers and accelerating the rural exodus.

During the Victorian era and the Industrial Revolution, working-class families relied on simple, cheap and filling ingredients: potatoes, bacon and onions. Two World Wars made matters worse, with rationing that lasted until 1954, over nine years since the end of the war. Hearty, simple foods like beans on toast became the symbol of survival cuisine, shaped by post-war industrial food production.

The 1990s marked a turning point for British cuisine. Young, charismatic chefs like Jamie Oliver brought a modern, energetic image to kitchens and TV screens. He used his fame to campaign for better school meals and food literacy, helping change public perception and even influencing government investment in school canteens.

Oliver wasn’t alone. Pioneer chefs such as Gary Rhodes and Rick Stein had already begun elevating simple dishes with local ingredients and global flavours. London’s dining scene responded with a surge of Michelin-starred restaurants and the rise of gastropubs as trendy culinary destinations. That momentum has now given rise to a new generation of chefs — many of whom are bringing their inventive take on British cuisine to Paris.

Jack Baker, 31, is among them. He leads Le Canard Sauvage in Paris, a new restaurant in the heart of the very trendy 11th arrondissement (district).

Born, raised and trained in the UK, he champions instinctive, seasonal cooking influenced by British, French, Italian and Basque flavours. “It starts with the ingredient… we change the menu every day,” he says.

According to Baker, Parisians are increasingly curious about refined British cuisine. “Well-prepared, slightly elevated British food definitely interests the French,” he notes.

For Kelly, British chefs benefit from creative freedom. “You have young cooks coming here and having trained in London and coming to Paris. They kind of bring a lot of that different way of cooking with them, you know, a lot of different influences.”

Unlike French or Italian cuisine, British cooking has no rigid rules — there’s little risk of a culinary faux pas. Perhaps that freedom is exactly why British food is finally having its moment in the sun.

Stockholm said a Swedish navy vessel spotted and jammed the drone on Wednesday in the Oresund Strait, around 13 kilometres from France's Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier, which was there at a stopover on the way to a NATO exercise.

On Thursday, Sweden's Defence Minister Pal Jonson told the broadcaster SVT that the drone "probably" came from Russia, "as there was a Russian military vessel in the immediate vicinity at the time of the facts".

When asked about the allegation, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was "quite an absurd statement".

He added that the Kremlin had no more information about the incident.

According to the Swedish authorities, its navy jammed the drone using electronic signals to attempt to break the connection between the aircraft and its operator, or disrupt its navigation tools.

The nearby Baltic Sea is a point of contention between Russia and NATO countries, especially since Moscow sent troops to Ukraine .

NATO's easternmost countries have reported numerous drone sightings in recent months, with some pointing the finger at Russia.

There is growing concern in Europe that such disruption could be part of hybrid war tactics by Moscow against European nations which have backed Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 12:59:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ff92d06c-13ca-11f1-b25b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-993497C.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan-Afghanistan 'open war': How and why we got here?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260227-pakistan-afghanistan-open-war-how-and-why-we-got-here</link><description>Shortly after 3am local time on Friday, Pakistani state TV broadcast a “Breaking News” red alert following a slow buildup of tensions between Islamabad and Kabul .

Pakistani armed forces launch “Operation Ghazab lil-Haq", or "Righteous Fury" in the local Urdu language, said the news alert.

The military onslaught by nuclear-armed Pakistan against Afghanistan , its impoverished western neighbour, began with airstrikes destroying “key military installations of the Afghan Taliban regime”, according to PTV News .

Minutes later, Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif took to social media to declare the casus belli of the conflict. The wording, in Urdu, was explicit – and florid.

“The Taliban turned Afghanistan into a colony of India . They gathered all the terrorists of the world in Afghanistan and began exporting terrorism,” said Asif on X . “Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you,” he said before ending with a foreboding, “Pakistan's army did not come from across the seas. We are your neighbours; we know your ins and outs. Allahu Akbar.”

In just a few words, Asif referenced some of Islamabad’s most pressing geostrategic concerns. These include a fear of arch foe India’s deepening ties to the Taliban, once considered an Islamabad proxy, to the US military presence in Afghanistan – the army “from across the seas” that challenged Pakistan’s influence across its western border.

Friday’s “open war” was the culmination of a slow buildup of tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan following an escalation of violence in both countries.

Islamabad accuses the Taliban regime in Kabul of harbouring terrorists. The Taliban ‌denies the charges and says Pakistan's security is an internal problem.

The South Asia region is awash with countries holding their neighbours responsible for militant attacks on their soil. The latest Afghanistan-Pakistan blame game, it was hoped, could be resolved through negotiations and dialogue.

But those hopes were dashed with Friday’s flareup across the 2,600-kilometre Pakistan-Afghanistan border, proving that the underlying sources of the latest conflict are serious and deep.

Afghanistan and Pakistan share the disputed Durand Line, a colonial-era frontier that Kabul has never formally recognised.

The Durand Line is an emotive issue, especially for the Pashtuns, a tribal group that was split on either side of the border by the colonial carve-up. It has been the source of simmering diplomatic tensions between Kabul and Islamabad for decades. It also lies at the heart of Pakistan’s bid to extend its influence in Afghanistan’s domestic politics.

The immediate, and stated, cause of the latest war goes back to a surge of terrorist attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan last year, with both sides blaming the other – and following it up with cross-border clashes.

Since the Taliban's 2021 return to power, relations between the two countries gradually worsened with the deteriorating security situation.

The spiralling tensions, which killed more than 70 people on both sides last year, led Qatar and Turkey to offer to mediate truce talks, which were held in Doha in October.

Following the initial talks in Qatar, the two countries agreed to an immediate, 48-hour ceasefire on October 19. But hours after the ceasefire expired, Pakistan conducted strikes in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province.

A second round of negotiations in Doha was immediately launched, but the talks collapsed on October 29, after the two sides could not reach common ground.

A third round of negotiations saw delegations from Pakistan and the Taliban-led Afghan government, together with Turkish and Qatari mediators, meeting in Istanbul on November 6. But they failed to reach a formal agreement.

The agenda at the Istanbul talks included the implementation of the Doha ceasefire, creating a joint Durand Line commission, and reopening shuttered trade crossings. But the atmosphere at the talks was strained, according to diplomatic sources, with Asif setting the tone with a warning prior to the meeting. “If diplomacy fails, war will happen,” he noted.

Meanwhile, Pakistan was conducting another blame game across its eastern border with its nuclear-armed arch foe, India .

In an interview with FRANCE 24 last week, for instance, Asif addressed the security situation in Pakistan, claiming that a spate of recent terrorist attacks in the country is the result of a "proxy war" waged by arch foe India in complicity with the Taliban government in Kabul.

The Taliban’s return to power following the disastrous US military pullout was initially welcomed by Pakistan, with then-prime minister Imran Khan proclaiming that Afghans had "broken the shackles of slavery".

But Islamabad soon found that the Taliban were not as pliant as it had hoped.

Pakistan has long made a distinction between what is known as the “Afghan Taliban” and the “Pakistani Taliban”. While Islamabad supported the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s, their Pakistani militant brethren, the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) conducts attacks on Pakistani soil and is considered a terrorist group.

After the Afghan Taliban returned to power, Islamabad accused Kabul of sheltering TTP fighters conducting attacks in Pakistan’s Pashtun dominated tribal areas.

Violence also flared in Pakistan’s southwestern Balochistan province, with Islamabad blaming Kabul for harbouring Baloch separatist insurgents.

Pakistan accuses India of backing the outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, allegations New Delhi denies.

India’s recent outreach to Taliban authorities in Kabul, with a high-profile visit by Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi to New Delhi in November, has also increased tensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan.

Historically, India has viewed the Taliban with hostility due to the group’s Islamist ideology and traditional links with the Pakistani military and intelligence establishment.

But with tensions between Islamabad and Kabul increasing, New Delhi adopted an “enemy of my enemy is my friend” strategy, according to analysts .

As India attempts to re-emerge as a development partner for Afghanistan, Pakistan is increasingly seeing itself sidelined by its western neighbour, which it has long viewed as inside its zone of strategic influence.

When Asif made his “open war” declaration early Friday, his references to Afghanistan being India’s “colony” and “proxy” were rightly viewed as the war rhetoric of defence minister rallying troops and the populace.

But it also underscored the serious security issues confronting a region that has two nuclear-armed neighbours vying for influence in a country that has been the birthplace of global jihadism, including the September 11, 2001, attacks in the US.

On paper, the military might of the two belligerents in the latest war is asymmetrical.

In addition to its nuclear arms, Pakistan's armed forces include more than 600,000 active personnel, possess over 6,000 armoured fighting vehicles and more than 400 combat aircraft, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

The Taliban, in contrast, are believed to have around 172,000 fighters, less than a third of Pakistan's personnel. After a US military operation that lasted two decades, the Taliban today are believed to possess at least six aircraft and 23 helicopters but ⁠their condition is unknown and ​they have no fighter jets or effective air force.

The asymmetry has prompted fears of “unconventional warfare” in Pakistan, noted FRANCE 24’s Shahzaib Wahlah, reporting from Islamabad on Friday.

“The main fear among the local population here is that there will be a development of unconventional warfare,” he said. “Many dread the possibility of major terrorist attacks in large cities.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 14:03:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8503f764-13bf-11f1-b820-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26058270694882.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU move to 'provisionally' apply Mercosur deal a 'bad surprise', Macron says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260227-eu-move-to-provisionally-apply-mercosur-deal-a-bad-surprise-macron-says</link><description>President Emmanuel Macron denounced Friday the European Commission's "bad manners" following its decision to provisionally apply the Mercosur trade deal and called the move a "bad surprise" for France .

EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said earlier Friday that the European Union will implement the mammoth trade deal with the South American Mercosur bloc while waiting for a top court's ruling on its legality.

"The commission will now proceed with provisional application," von der Leyen said in Brussels, recalling that member states had given the EU executive power to do so.

"Provisional application is, by its nature, provisional," she added, saying: "The agreement can only be fully concluded once the European Parliament has given its consent."

"For France, this is a surprise, and a bad one," Macron said in a strongly-worded statement, adding the move showed "bad manners towards the European Parliament".

"The European Commission has made the unilateral decision to provisionally apply the agreement with Mercosur, even though the European Parliament has not voted on it. It is thus taking on a very heavy responsibility."

Speaking alongside Slovenia 's Prime Minister Robert Golob, Macron said he would make sure "that what we have negotiated hard for over the last few months is respected".

"We will be uncompromising on compliance with these rules, because Europe has significantly tightened the rules on our producers in recent years," Macron added.

"And so I will never defend an agreement that is lax on imports and tough on what we produce at home, because it is inconsistent for European consumers and criminal for European sovereignty," he said.

France has led opposition to the deal and unsuccessfully attempted to block it over worries for its farmers, who fear being undercut by cheaper goods from Brazil and its neighbours.

Provisional application will begin on "the first day of the second month following the date on which the EU and Uruguay (as first Mercosur country to ratify) exchange notes verbales", EU trade spokesman Olof Gill later clarified.

French agriculture minister Annie Genevard said the decision was "very damaging to the functioning of our institutions and, above all, to the spirit of our European institutions".

But Gill said EU states had "empowered" the commission to take such a decision.

The deal will provisionally apply to the Mercosur countries that have ratified it, Gill told reporters, adding the commission anticipated remaining members Brazil and Paraguay would do so "soon".

Reacting to von der Leyen's announcement, French EU lawmaker Celine Imart accused the commission of "showing contempt" for farmers.

"We will continue to fight with determination to ensure that this provisional application never becomes permanent," she told AFP.

The deal between the EU and the four founding members of the Mercosur bloc – Argentina , Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay – was a quarter century in the making.

The accord creates one of the world's biggest free trade zones and eliminates tariffs on more than 90 percent of trade between the two blocs, which together account for 30 percent of global GDP and over 700 million consumers.

Farmers across Europe remain unconvinced and are up in arms, including in Spain where they staged a protest against the deal in Madrid earlier this month.

The European Commission, however, insists it has fully addressed their concerns by approving a series of safeguards for its producers.

Von der Leyen stressed the deal offered "countless opportunities".

She added: "It allows our small and medium-sized businesses to access markets and scale they could only dream of before."

Major exports from the South American grouping to the EU include agricultural products and minerals, while the 27-country bloc would export machinery, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals with smaller levies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 15:06:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/06f24842-13e4-11f1-a439-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26058484013910.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines' former president Duterte killed thousands, ICC prosecutors say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260227-philippines-former-president-duterte-killed-thousands-icc-prosecutors-say</link><description>Rodrigo Duterte killed thousands during his anti-drug campaign , an International Criminal Court prosecutor alleged Friday, as the crimes against humanity hearing against the former Philippines president wrapped up.

His defence team countered that Duterte had murdered no one and that the prosecution's argument was based on "hearsay" and "conjecture", falling far short of the bar needed to confirm the charges against him.

"He's proud of his killings. He wants to be remembered for them," said Julian Nicholls, summing up for the prosecution.

"Decades of murdering his own people, murdering the children of the Philippines, and he claims that he did it all for his country. He doesn't deny it.

"He ran a death squad in Davao (city) that he created. He ran it for over 20 years before he became president. His promise was to kill thousands and he did."

Throughout the week, a panel of three judges has heard from the prosecution, defence, and victims' representatives as they weigh whether to proceed to a full trial .

Duterte has not been in the courtroom. The defence says he is too ill to attend. Victims say he does not want to face the loved ones of those he killed.

He faces three counts of crimes against humanity over his so-called "war on drugs " when he was mayor of Davao City and then as president of the Philippines.

The prosecution has put forward 76 cases of alleged murder, which they say is an "emblematic fraction" of those killed, which rights groups say number thousands.

Duterte's defence lawyer Nicholas Kaufman, summing up his case, said that if his client could be faulted for anything, it was his "inappropriate choice of language".

"But he murdered nobody," Kaufman told the court.

He urged the judges not to confirm the charges and to free Duterte to "live out the rest of his days in peace" in the Philippines.

He said that during a visit to explain proceedings to his client, he "lost the desire to follow me within a minute."

However, he cited the former leader as asking how the prosecutors could prove that he murdered anyone, again denying the charges against him.

Gilbert Andres, a lawyer representing victims, summed up by saying that his clients experienced defence rebuttals "like their murdered loved-ones are being murdered again."

He called on the court to confirm the charges so that the victims can be "reintegrated into their communities."

Following the hearing, judges will have up to 60 days to issue a written verdict.

They can confirm all of the charges and proceed to trial, throw out some of the charges, or reject the case outright, in which case Duterte would walk free.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 15:06:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/052eb14a-13d4-11f1-9e0c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/3b6dc3f5346eeb70c2f075ed599841e219e331dc.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel's Supreme Court allows aid groups facing govt ban to keep working in Gaza</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260227-israel-s-supreme-court-allows-aid-groups-facing-govt-ban-to-keep-working-in-gaza</link><description>Israel 's Supreme Court decided in a ruling published Friday that a government ban on 37 foreign NGOs working in Gaza and the occupied West Bank will be frozen until it reaches a final decision.

"Without taking any position, a temporary interim order is hereby issued," the court said in a ruling responding to a petition from more than a dozen NGOs, seeking to reverse the ban after Israel's government revoked their status in Israel.

The decision theoretically allows the NGOs to continue working in Gaza and the West Bank until the court issues a final ruling, though aid groups expressed uncertainty as to how the freeze would be implemented.

The organisations, including Doctors Without Borders (MSF), Oxfam, the Norwegian Refugee Council and CARE were notified on December 30, 2025 that their Israeli registrations had expired and that they had 60 days to renew them by providing lists of their Palestinian staff.

If they failed to do so, they would have to cease operations in Gaza and the West Bank, including east Jerusalem , from March 1.

The NGOs petitioned the Supreme Court via an umbrella organisation, AIDA, after their charity registration in Israel was revoked at the end of a year-long battle during which the NGOs had refused to provide lists of their Palestinian employees to Israeli authorities.

The court said in its ruling that there existed a "genuine legal dispute" due to the foreign NGOs' responsibilities to their employees' privacy under European law.

"We are still waiting to see how the injunction will be interpreted by the state and whether or not this will mean an increase in our ability to operate", Athena Rayburn, AIDA director, told AFP, calling it "a step in the right direction".

"We will keep fighting to be able to do our jobs, and deliver life-saving assistance to Palestinians in need," she added.

Yotam Ben-Hillel, a lawyer who represented the NGOs in court, welcomed the injunction, but told AFP that "we still don't know how it will play out".

"Today, the High Court of Justice has given the residents of Gaza and the West Bank some breathing room," he said.

Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967 and strictly controls all entries to and exits from Gaza.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 15:59:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5333f378-13ed-11f1-96dc-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-02-18T090741Z-838898264-RC28MJAX9EIH-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA-RAMADAN-MOSQUES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio to hold talks in Israel next week as US-Iran tensions remain high</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260227-rubio-to-hold-talks-in-israel-next-week-as-us-iran-tensions-remain-high</link><description>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will hold talks Monday in Israel on Iran , the State Department announced, as the United States builds up forces for a potential strike on the Islamic republic.

The top US diplomat will head to Israel just as the United States tells non-emergency staff to leave Israel, raising suspicions that President Donald Trump plans to go ahead with threatened strikes.

Rubio will hold talks Monday and return Tuesday, the State Department said.

Rubio "will discuss a range of regional priorities including Iran, Lebanon and ongoing efforts to implement President Trump's 20-Point Peace Plan for Gaza," State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said.

Rubio does not plan to bring reporters on his plane, in a rare break with decades of precedent for US secretaries of state.

The trip comes after a round of Oman-mediated talks between Iran and the US seen as a last-ditch bid to avert war, though initial optimism was tempered by Tehran warning that Washington must drop "excessive demands" to reach a deal.

Mediator Oman reported progress but the United States has said little about the talks.

The United States authorised the departure of non-emergency embassy staff from Israel on Friday, as the world's largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, was due to arrive off the Israeli coast.

The US embassy in Jerusalem announced it was allowing non-emergency government personnel and family members to leave "due to safety risks".

"Persons may wish to consider leaving Israel while commercial flights are available," the embassy said on its website.

The New York Times reported that US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee sent an email to embassy staff on Friday morning saying that those wishing to leave "should do so TODAY".

The French foreign ​ministry on Friday reiterated its advice ​to nationals not to travel to Israel, Jerusalem and the West Bank ​even ‌for tourism or ⁠family visits as a result of the ‌security situation in Iran.

On its ⁠website, the ministry also recommended French citizens already there stay away from demonstrations and rallies and identify bomb shelters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 27 Feb 2026 17:35:59

surge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/us-copper-mountain-still-growing-after-december-import-surge-2026-02-27/</link><description>LONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The huge premium for delivering physical copper to the United States may have gone but the tariff trade tailwinds are still blowing hard.

U.S. imports of refined metal appeared to be waning after the White House pushed back a decision on imposing tariffs in July, collapsing the arbitrage between the CME-traded U.S. price and the London Metal Exchange (LME) international price .

But inbound flows jumped again to almost 200,000 metric tons in December, driving U.S. inventories yet higher.

The U.S. sucked in 1.4 million tons of refined copper over the course of 2025, a year-on-year increase of 730,000 tons, according to the World Bureau of Metal Statistics (WBMS), which sources data from official customs statistics.

That year-on-year jump is a good indication of the size of the metal mountain now sitting in the country.

CME stocks rose by 452,000 tons last year, pretty much matching total deliveries to exchange warehouses after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a national security investigation into the country's copper import dependency in February .

Exchange inventory has increased by another 93,000 tons since the start of 2026 with the relentless build only now starting to show signs of slowing.

However, the flow of metal has not stopped; it has been redirected to LME warehouses in Baltimore and New Orleans.

LME stocks in the two locations have grown from zero at the start of January to 36,450 tons and 10,825 tons respectively with another 30,200 tons sitting in LME off-warrant storage.

The shift in delivery focus makes sense since the spot arbitrage has flipped from a CME premium to a CME discount relative to the LME price.

CME prices are still trading at a sizeable premium to the LME on a forward basis, which suggests lingering uncertainty as to the likelihood of tariffs further down the line.

The Trump administration has flagged a potential decision around the middle of this year with the option of phasing in tariffs on refined metal from the start of 2027.

The imposition of 50% tariffs on imports of copper products such as tube and wire appears to be having the desired effect.

Inbound volumes of copper and alloy semi-manufactured products have fallen sharply since July, which is good news for U.S. fabricators and may persuade the administration to extend the measures to refined metal.

But since the core rationale of tariffs is to reduce U.S. import dependency, it might be argued that just the threat of tariffs on refined copper has already worked.

The United States has accumulated a strategic stockpile without it costing the U.S. taxpayer a cent.

What might catch the White House's attention is the continued export flow of scrap copper.

Exports of secondary copper totaled over one million tons last year, a year-on-year rise of almost 10%, according to the WBMS.

While no-one has yet committed to building a new primary processing plant in the U.S., there has been significant investment in recycling capacity.

That makes the accelerating leakage of copper scrap increasingly problematic, particularly since the single biggest destination is China.

When the U.S. imposed tariffs on copper products in July last year, the Trump administration said it would require that at least 25% of "high-quality" scrap be retained for domestic consumption.

There's been no further clarification of what exactly constitutes "high quality" scrap and since the country already consumes around 40% of the secondary metal that it generates, the threshold is already met on paper at least.

But with the European Union mulling its own restrictions on "scrap leakage", this part of the copper supply chain may be more likely to see U.S. government action than refined metal.

That said, if the copper market has learnt anything over the last year, it's that pricing U.S. tariff risk is very tricky indeed.

From the Editor

Hello Morning Bid readers!

Markets were jittery this week, as anxiety about the potential impact of the artificial intelligence revolution left investors nervous about their asset allocations and their future job prospects.

This week’s wave of worry was initially set off by a 7,000-word piece, "The 2028 Global Intelligence Crisis," , opens new tab published by research firm Citrini on Sunday. It made for pretty grim reading: the loss of millions of office jobs will destroy demand, plunging the economy into a deflationary tailspin.

Is that possible? Sure, in the sense that anything is possible. But when markets are being spooked by apocalyptic long-form blogposts, it’s time to ask if we are in the midst of an AI doom bubble .

The software sector got a slight boost on Tuesday when a new round of plug-ins from Anthropic highlighted the potential for AI upstarts to partner with legacy firms instead of replacing them.

But, as is often the case, fear trumps hope, and both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq fell on Thursday .

This was - perhaps surprisingly - after the announcement of another strong quarter from Nvidia - its 14th consecutive revenue beat . The $4.5 trillion chipmaker on Wednesday posted better-than-expected results for the January quarter and also forecast above-market estimates for current quarter revenue. Its share price initially rose, but then pulled back, likely because the good news was already baked in and concerns - such as rising competition and customer concentration - remain.

Meanwhile, two months into the year, the country with the best performing equity market by far is Korea. The benchmark KOSPI index may have slid slightly on Friday, but it’s up more than 48% in the year to date. This eye-popping figure might suggest fevered speculation is at play, but that’s not necessarily the case - and there is reason to believe it could still have room to run .

Moving over to M&amp;A, the months-long battle between Paramount Skydance and Netflix to acquire Warner Bros Discovery appears to be over, with the former coming out on top with its revised $31-a-share offer.

Turning back to anxiety, another major source of it this week was the ongoing standoff between the United States and Iran over Tehran’s nuclear program. The two held indirect talks in Geneva on Thursday.

While crude prices fell following claims that progress in the negotiations had been made, Brent crude was up again early on Friday, trading above $71 a barrel. Discussions will resume in Vienna next week, which means the waiting game continues.

One party that may benefit from the geopolitical noise is OPEC+. The volatile headlines have weighed on prices, giving the producer group cover to stick to its “balanced market” narrative , despite many facts on the ground that suggest otherwise. OPEC+ is expected to announce a 137,000 barrel per day increase in output when it meets on Sunday.

Speaking of energy, one would have needed a lot of it to stay up though all of President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address on Tuesday, which clocked in at a record one hour and 47 minutes. It offered little in the way of new ideas for addressing Americans’ affordability concerns, with the exception of a plan to boost Americans’ retirement savings . The president also vowed to move forward with his tariff agenda even after a large portion of it was quashed by the Supreme Court last week.

One notable takeaway from the speech was the president's claim that hyperscalers "have the obligation to provide for their own power needs" as they build out energy-hungry data centers to fuel the AI boom. The administration wants to avoid stressing the grid and pushing up consumers’ electricity prices.

But the pressure is already building, and whether or not companies cover their own power needs, ambitious AI expansion plans are likely to be hobbled by severe power-infrastructure bottlenecks.

It’s a reminder that instead of fretting about viral AI doomsday reports, we should probably spend a little more time considering the very real physical limitations that could slow down this technological revolution.

On January 26 , gold hit $5,000 an ounce for the first time, and eleven days later , the Dow Jones Industrial Average cracked 50,000. Bullion got to its mark first – and that wasn’t supposed to happen.

Imagine if a prediction market in December 2020 had offered a proposition bet on which historic breakthrough would happen first. At that point, the Dow (.DJI) , opens new tab was already 61% of the way toward its big round number, while gold was just 37% of the way there.

Extrapolating data trends from 1985 through 2020, you would have expected the Dow to reach 50,000 by 2027 and gold not to hit the $5,000 target until 2035.

But gold's trajectory took an astonishingly sharp upturn in the last five years. Its price doubled between 2022 and 2024 alone. That surge helped the precious metal beat the stock index by what essentially amounts to a photo finish.

So why did the trendlines fail to predict the outcome?

In the case of the Dow, the index picked up speed in recent years as capital poured into U.S. markets after the pandemic, but this surge was nothing compared to the rapid spike in the yellow metal.

Analysts have offered several explanations for the dramatic acceleration in gold's gains. One underlying factor is geopolitical instability. Historically, turmoil tends to heighten demand for safe-haven assets.

And there have been plenty of reasons to worry in recent years, including the now four-year-old Russia-Ukraine war , conflicts in the Middle East , and U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff drama as well as his vow to gain control over Greenland .

Inflationary anxieties have further bolstered gold’s appeal, stoked by what many observers see as Trump’s efforts to step up political influence over the Federal Reserve. The president has long called for much lower interest rates .

His nomination of Kevin Warsh , a previous proponent of tighter monetary policy, as the next Fed chair quelled those fears somewhat at the end of January, causing gold to back off from its January 28 peak. But it remains above the $5,000 per ounce threshold.

Meanwhile, worries about a potential pickup in inflation have undermined confidence in the dollar. In response, a number of nations’ central banks have stepped up their purchases of gold in lieu of the U.S. currency.

China’s central bank certainly moved in that direction, and its households and investors also helped drive the rally. The World Gold Council , opens new tab reported a 28% year-over-year increase in the population’s purchases of gold bars and coins in 2025. Chinese gold ETFs have also enjoyed record inflows over the last year.

In short, the Dow’s rise appears to have been an acceleration of existing trends, while gold’s extreme surge was dependent on many exogenous factors and a bit of speculation – which obviously can’t be predicted beforehand.

Ultimately, though, does reaching these financial milestones truly matter?

The achievements occasioned some predictable claims , opens new tab from analysts and the financial press. These assets crossed "critical" psychological thresholds, some argued, with the suggestion that doing so could generate momentum in that direction.

But even if big round numbers like $5,000 or $50,000 have some psychological impact on investors, it's likely to be fleeting.

Consider what happened after the Dow reached previous “psychologically important” thresholds: 1,000 (November 14, 1972), 5,000 (November 21, 1995), 10,000 (March 29, 1999), and 25,000 (January 4, 2018).

In two cases, the Dow rose over the next 12 months by double digits, but it fell in the other two. Whatever warm feeling arises from seeing a commodity or index clear a seemingly significant new level can thus fade quickly once new market-moving information arrives.

One may argue that the rise of passive investing and factor-based trading could amplify any positive momentum garnered from breaking through a big round milestone – but the recent moves in gold suggest that this is not necessarily the case.

The lesson to draw from all of this is that investors would be wise to avoid relying too heavily on either the extrapolation of past price trends or the lasting effect from the latest headline-grabbing market achievements.

Milestones make for great copy, but shaky strategy.

Block (XYZ.N) , opens new tab CEO Jack Dorsey upped the urgency of the debate over whether productive chatbots will reduce employment on Thursday, when he announced , opens new tab that the payments company would fire nearly half its workers. Whether artificial intelligence really can do the work of thousands of humans, or just provides impetus to slim down a bloated organization, is unclear. Nonetheless, investors added more than $6 billion to the company’s market value on Friday morning. Such gains will help prod other firms into finding AI savings, real or illusory.

It’s hard for bosses, and more difficult for outsiders, to judge the optimal number of workers for a tech firm. When times are good, there’s the temptation to overhire, ensuring that there are enough engineers to satisfy growing demand and fix emerging problems. That comes at the obvious cost of profitability, but valuations rarely paid the price, while CEOs could reasonably fret about the dangers of underinvestment. Just look at Southwest Airlines, which learned this lesson in 2022 when a software meltdown led to over 10,000 flight cancellations.

Dorsey claims that machine learning has reset this balance of concerns, and rapidly. He said that Block had seen a 40% increase in production code shipped per engineer since September, as well as fruits of an order-of-magnitude jump in the capability and intelligence in its in-house AI framework, Goose. Hence fewer employees will do more, and faster.

Coding-adept chatbots really are remarkable. But Block also had a lot of fat to cut. The company’s headcount exploded during the pandemic, more than tripling between the pre-Covid year of 2019 and the peak in 2023.

Meanwhile, it engaged in questionable deals and breakneck expansion. It agreed to pay $29 billion in stock for buy-now-pay-later company Afterpay in 2021. Such businesses are worth far less today. Rival Klarna, for example, was valued at $46 billion that summer in a private funding round, and now trades at $5 billion. Block also bought music streaming service Tidal in a bizarre expansion, adding musician Jay-Z to the board. Then there was a big push into highly speculative cryptocurrencies, including making bitcoin wallets and a mining system. The stock has performed poorly over the past five years.

Block was far from the only technology company to overextend, especially in the frothy period exiting the pandemic. Its stock gain from pivoting away from that era, AI-driven or not, is concrete. With software valuations plummeting and machine learning fears top of mind , the signal to bosses is to fire away.

SpaceX plans to launch one million satellites that will serve as distributed cloud servers in space. These orbital data centers will supposedly harness the power of the sun to process artificial-intelligence workloads. To make it happen, Musk thinks , opens new tab he may need a satellite factory on the moon. He’ll undoubtedly need plenty of cash – which is where a potential SpaceX initial public offering comes in.

At its core, SpaceX is today a profitable satellite communication and launch business with a major lead over would-be rivals. Reuters reported , citing two people familiar with the matter, that Musk's group generated some $8 billion in EBITDA last year on $15 billion to $16 billion of sales. Starlink, its satellite broadband unit, accounted for 50% to 80% of total revenue. The implied group margin of roughly 50% is impressive for what is in large part a broadband supplier with 10 million subscribers , opens new tab worldwide.

At a $1 trillion valuation, using SpaceX's price tag from its recent merger with Grok chatbot maker xAI, it might look like the company is preparing to capture a hefty share of the global telecom market in short order. But the reality is that satellite connectivity is a complement to conventional networks – not a replacement for them. Most consumers in developed markets will find that a fixed-line broadband connection meets their needs at home, while 4G and 5G are readily available on-the-go. Demand for satellite services comes from people and places that telecom companies otherwise struggle to reach.

This isn’t a tiny market, but it will get crowded. Amazon.com (AMZN.O) , opens new tab recently got the greenlight from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to add around 4,500 more satellites to its planned constellation – taking the total to just under 8,000. Some 200 satellites have been launched so far, with the full fleet due to be in service by 2029. China, meanwhile, is developing two low-earth-orbit networks of its own: one for government and security uses and another aimed at international customers, with tens of thousands of planned satellites in total.

Though SpaceX will list with an effective monopoly in satellite communications, its deep-pocketed rivals have the ability and resources to drain Musk's moat. China’s space efforts are backed by various state-linked entities, which should bolster their chances of success. For its part, Amazon is designing , opens new tab its user terminals with low production costs in mind. If it passes these savings on, and thereby undercuts Starlink, it could gain a market foothold.

Musk’s recent political entanglements also appear to have put a theoretical cap on the size of Starlink’s government and defense business, at least outside its home market. In February 2025, Reuters reported that U.S. negotiators had used Starlink access as a bargaining chip when trying to broker a critical minerals deal with Ukraine. Though Musk denounced the claims on X, the episode clearly unsettled Ukraine’s European allies, who are seeking sovereign alternatives to the satellite service.

To this end, France invested $1.6 billion in Eutelsat Communications – the operator of the OneWeb constellation – (ETL.PA) , opens new tab last summer. The French state is now the largest shareholder in the group, which has some 600 satellites in low-earth orbit. Germany and Italy have also expressed an interest in building their own constellations for secure government and military communications. Were Musk and the U.S. still viewed as reliable partners, such measures may not even be on the table.

Threats to Starlink’s continued domination could also come from within. The recent merger of Musk’s xAI and the rockets-and-satellites group leaves SpaceX exposed to new regulatory and financial risks. According to documents seen , opens new tab by Bloomberg, xAI reported a net loss of $1.5 billion for the three months to the end of September 2025, while it burned through some $8 billion in cash in the first nine months of the year. This makes growing the top and bottom lines at Starlink look even more critical for the combined group. And there is regulatory risk, as multiple jurisdictions are investigating the Grok chatbot, which produced and circulated sexually explicit images on social network X.

All the noise around the company, and limited financial disclosures, make it tricky to value. Assume, for the sake of argument, that 70% of SpaceX's recent $1 trillion merger value is attributable to Starlink, roughly in line with its revenue contribution. That would imply a valuation of around $700 billion for the satellite unit.

Analysts at Quilty Space reckon Starlink could bring in roughly $16 billion in revenue and $11 billion in EBITDA this year. At an enterprise value of $700 billion, this would imply a forward sales multiple of 44 and an EBITDA multiple of 64. That's in the same ballpark as super-racy Palantir Technologies' (PLTR.O) , opens new tab equivalent valuations of 42 times 2026 revenue and 72 times 2026 EBITDA, using Visible Alpha data, and is therefore in a different stratosphere to the single-digit multiples of Eutelsat and telecom groups like T-Mobile US (TMUS.O) , opens new tab and Verizon Communications (VZ.N) , opens new tab .

Granted, the older communications groups are barely growing compared with Starlink, which arguably justifies a more Palantir-style multiple for Musk's business. Even then, however, it's hard to make the numbers work. Using analysts' long-term forecasts, to factor in growth expectations, Palantir trades at just under 18 times 2030 EBITDA. Applying that multiple to Starlink would imply that the satellite unit of SpaceX needs to produce $39 billion of EBITDA that year in order to justify a $700 billion enterprise value for the division.

Longtime SpaceX bulls Morgan Stanley, by comparison, think Starlink's revenue could reach almost $50 billion by 2030, which using a 50% margin would imply $25 billion of EBITDA. That's impressive, but well short of what's needed to buttress the valuation. And Morgan Stanley's forecasts look very much like a blue-sky scenario. Even if Musk pulls off a trillion-dollar stock market launch, that’s no guarantee of a smooth ride.

What started out as the Capital Markets Union (CMU) has morphed into the Savings and Investment Union (SIU). A more appropriate moniker for reviving European savings and markets might be S&amp;M, as it has involved more pain than pleasure. Even now, any meaningful progress will depend on what happens at a national level.

The campaign to kick-start European markets was born of multiple crises. The initial drive to make trading and capital raising more efficient received an impetus after the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent euro zone sovereign debt meltdown exposed the bloc’s reliance on shaky banks. Brexit removed the City of London from the EU's single market. More recently, former European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi's report on competitiveness identified a 750-billion-euro investment gap for financing renewable energy, and other critical needs.

Now the EU faces even more urgent pressure to reform. U.S. President Donald Trump's at-times hostile stance has exposed the bloc's dependence on U.S. technology titans and historic lack of investment in defence. European leaders this month agreed unanimously , opens new tab to accelerate the SIU.

Reforming capital markets in a bloc of 27 countries with a combined economic output of around $20 trillion is a daunting task. The EU’s relative weakness when it comes to using equity and fixed income securities as a source of financing owes much to culture and history. The bloc has a long-standing dependence on banks, different legal frameworks, and language barriers which discourage cross-border investment.

However, a fragmented capital market with multiple local regulators and differing rules and infrastructures also points to tantalising potential efficiencies. Despite ten years of work these benefits remain out of reach. Initial public offerings in the EU raised just $17.7 billion last year, less than half the equivalent U.S. sum, as per LSEG data. Annual equity trading volumes relative to stock market capitalisation – a measure of liquidity and hence market depth – are roughly a third of the U.S. level, according to a 2025 report by the Association for Financial Markets in Europe.

Scratch beneath the surface, though, and change is happening. A package of reforms to make stock market listings easier is slowly being implemented, as are moves to boost securitisation. Perhaps the most significant reforms were those proposed by the European Commission in December , opens new tab . These aim to break down barriers for cross-border capital flows by streamlining regulation and tackling a fragmented market in equities. Myriad national players are involved in the business of trading and settling securities, and the preponderance of domestic regulators and rules pushes up costs. The United States has the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which dominates the clearing and settlement of securities. By contrast, Europe has more than 30 securities depositaries charging fees nearly two-thirds higher than their counterparts stateside. This imposes a 1 billion euro , opens new tab per year cost on the continent's traders and investors, AFME reckons.

In an ideal world, all local obstacles could be removed by meshing together different players to create a single exchange on which all EU citizens can trade, connecting a capital-hungry German tech group with a Spanish saver. To some degree, that’s happening. Large players like Euronext (ENX.PA) , opens new tab and Nasdaq (NDAQ.O) , opens new tab have snapped up smaller regional bourses, centralising technology and infrastructure. Euronext bought the Athens stock exchange last year. Yet big countries like Germany and France have limited appetite for creating continent-wide operators if it means losing control of a national champion.

Brussels can still help by making regulation more efficient and removing barriers to competition. The Commission’s latest proposals include steps to make trade settlement more competitive while transferring more regulatory powers to the European Securities and Markets Authority. It is even encouraging disruption with a plan to foster blockchain-based technology that could simplify the trading and settling of shares or bonds.

These reforms move in the right direction, but will take time and may not work as intended. The drive to streamline regulation may end up increasing bureaucracy if the powers of a single supervisor overlap with local watchdogs. Countries that already benefit from vibrant markets, such as Ireland or Luxembourg, may see few benefits.

Besides, more efficient markets can only achieve so much. The United Kingdom has one of the most liquid bourses in Europe yet is struggling to attract new listings. And European stock exchanges may not be as sleepy as they first appear. Strip away the so-called Magnificent 7 tech stocks and the U.S. market is only 1.5 times more liquid than Europe’s, as measured by stock turnover relative to market capitalisation, think tank New Financial notes.

Other reforms are therefore necessary, which explains why lawmakers and market participants now talk more about the SIU than the CMU. When it comes to boosting savings and investment, governments can make big changes without pan-European coordination. Take Sweden. Draghi's report , opens new tab notes that the Scandinavian country has attracted more IPOs over the last 10 years than Germany, France, the Netherlands and Spain combined. Last year it notched up two of the top , opens new tab five offerings in Europe, Middle East and Africa, including the $3.7 billion raised by security group Verisure.

Sweden’s success is down to smart incentives and a multi-decade process of reforms, which include stripping back taxes and incentivising individuals to save and invest in their pensions. Some 36% of Swedish household assets are held in stocks, outstripping Germany, France and even the UK.

Many European countries are trying to copy Stockholm’s success. Both France and Germany have started to encourage more personal pension savings. Yet they have a lot of catching up to. Europe's long history of government-run pay-as-you-go retirement schemes means pension assets are just , opens new tab 32% of GDP, versus 142% in the U.S. in 2022.

Reforms are getting harder. Europe’s ageing population has less incentive to save and governments have more debt. Past efforts have also proved misguided. The UK subsidised individual investment accounts to the tune of 8 billion pounds in 2024, yet many customers park their tax-free savings in bank deposits, doing little for growth.

This means there’s plenty of upside. New Financial estimates that, in a plausible scenario where each member state improved its performance to match the average of better-performing countries, Europe’s pool of long-term capital could grow by more than half to $44 trillion. Rather than dreaming up new pan-European acronyms, bureaucrats would be better off concentrating on local improvements.

Iran launched missiles towards Israel, Israel's military said, and the Pentagon said the U.S. strikes against Iran were named "OPERATION EPIC FURY."

The renewed confrontation between Iran and its long-time foes threatened to further dim hopes for a diplomatic solution to Tehran's nuclear dispute with the West.

In a video message published on social media, Trump cited Washington's decades-long dispute with Iran, including the seizure of the 1979 U.S. embassy in Tehran, when students held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days, as well as a range of other attacks the U.S. has blamed on Iran since the 1979 Islamic revolution brought the clerics to power.

He urged Iranians to stay sheltered because "bombs will be dropping everywhere". But he also added: "When we are finished, take over your government. It will be yours to take. This will be probably your only chance for generations.”

The U.S. military initiated a series of strikes against targets in Iran, two U.S. officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. The scope of the air and sea operations was not immediately clear. The campaign is expected to last for multiple days, said a U.S. official.

Iran was preparing a crushing retaliation, an Iranian official told Reuters.

Trump had built up a vast U.S. military presence in the region to try to force Tehran to make concessions in nuclear talks. He said the U.S. had launched a "massive and ongoing" operation against the Islamic Republic, vowing to ensure Tehran will not obtain a nuclear weapon.

Iran's ballistic missile programme has been a significant sticking point in negotiations. Trump said Iran was developing long-range missiles that threaten the U.S. and threatened to raze its missile industry.

"Our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime," Trump said.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the joint U.S.-Israeli attack on Iran "will create the conditions for the brave Iranian people to take their destiny into their own hands."

"The time has come for all sections of the people in Iran ... to remove the yoke of tyranny from (the regime) and bring a free and peace-loving Iran," Netanyahu said in a statement.

A source told Reuters that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.

The attack follows a 12-day air war in June between Israel and Iran and repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

"The State of Israel launched a pre-emptive attack against Iran to remove threats to the State of Israel," Defence Minister Israel Katz said.

Israel launched the attack against Muslim-majority Iran during Ramadan, the holy Muslim month of fasting observed from dawn to sunset. The strike also came ahead of the Jewish holiday of Purim, which traditionally commemorates the salvation of Jews from annihilation in ancient Persia and which begins on Monday.

An Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.

Explosions were heard in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian media reported, and sirens sounded across Israel around 0815 a.m. local time in what the military said was a proactive alert to prepare the public for the possibility of an incoming missile strike.

The Israeli military announced the closure of schools and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights, and the airports authority asked the public not to go to any of the country's airports.

The U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February to try to resolve the decades-long nuclear dispute through diplomacy and avert the threat of a military confrontation that could destabilise the region.

Israel, however, said any U.S. deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Tehran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process, and lobbied Washington to include restrictions on Iran's missile programme in the talks.

Iran said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

Tehran also said it would defend itself against any attack. It warned neighbouring countries hosting U.S. troops that it would retaliate against American bases if Washington struck Iran.

Last June, the U.S. joined an Israeli military campaign against Iranian nuclear installations, in the most direct American military action ever against the Islamic Republic.

Tehran retaliated then by launching missiles toward the U.S. Al Udeid air base in Qatar, the largest in the Middle East.

Western powers have warned that Iran's ballistic missile project threatens regional stability and could deliver nuclear weapons if developed. Tehran denies seeking atomic bombs.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:16:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6ZQ36HHUA5O7BM5YVQ2XYBAOEA.jpg?auth=3022203c56ae2331b1ee8cb15c505e17e831249130d9e5d00f650b5ef2b1d25a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan, Afghan Taliban forces clash as diplomatic efforts intensify</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-afghan-taliban-forces-clash-diplomatic-efforts-intensify-2026-02-28/</link><description>KABUL, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Fighting between Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban military entered its third day on Saturday, following overnight clashes as the international community expressed increasing concern about the conflict and called for urgent talks.

Pakistan's strikes on Friday hit Taliban military installations and posts, including in Kabul and Kandahar, in one of the deepest Pakistani incursions into its western neighbour in years, officials said.

Islamabad accuses the Taliban of harbouring Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) militants, who it claims are waging an insurgency inside Pakistan, a charge the Taliban denies.

Pakistan described its actions as a response to cross-border assaults, while Kabul denounced them as a breach of its sovereignty, saying it remained open to dialogue but warned any wider conflict would result in serious consequences.

The fighting has raised the risk of a protracted conflict along the rugged 2,600-km (1,615-mile) frontier.

Diplomatic efforts gathered pace late on Friday as Afghanistan said its foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, spoke by telephone with Saudi Arabia's Prince Faisal bin Farhan about reducing tensions and keeping diplomatic channels open.

The European Union called for both sides to de-escalate and engage in dialogue, while the United Nations urged an immediate end to hostilities.

Russia urged both sides to halt the clashes and return to talks, while China said it was deeply concerned and ready to help ease tensions.

The United States supports Pakistan's right to defend itself against attacks by the Taliban, a State Department spokesperson said.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Washington did not view Pakistan as the aggressor in the latest escalation and that Islamabad was under pressure to address its security challenges, adding Washington hoped the situation would not escalate further.

Exchanges of fire continued along the border overnight.

Pakistani security sources said an operation dubbed "Ghazab Lil Haq" was ongoing and that Pakistani forces had destroyed multiple Taliban posts and camps in several sectors. Reuters could not independently verify the claims.

Both sides have reported heavy losses with conflicting tolls that Reuters could not verify. Pakistan said 12 of its soldiers and 274 Taliban were killed while the Taliban said 13 of its fighters and 55 Pakistani soldiers died.

Taliban deputy spokesman Hamdullah Fitrat said 19 civilians were killed and 26 wounded in Khost and Paktika. Reuters could not verify the claim.

Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif said "our cup of patience has overflowed" and described the fighting as "open war", warning that Pakistan would respond to further attacks.

Taliban Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani said in a speech in Khost province that the conflict "will be very costly," and that Afghan forces had not deployed broadly beyond those already engaged.

He said the Taliban had defeated "the world, not through technology, but through unity and solidarity," and through "great patience and perseverance," rather than superior military power.

Pakistan's military capabilities far exceed those of Afghanistan, with a standing army of hundreds of thousands and a modern air force.

In stark contrast, the Taliban lacks a conventional air force and relies largely on light weaponry and ground forces.

However, the Islamist group is battle-hardened after two decades of insurgency against U.S.-led forces before returning to power in 2021.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:16:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GDL6TRGHRJJMZH67BZ452JTLBU.jpg?auth=1f66069e1d0611a99047f5cf4fa849785c913985c8fdbab9fc763e17ed791764&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Satellite images show more aircraft at Saudi airbase used by US forces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/satellite-images-show-more-aircraft-saudi-airbase-used-by-us-forces-2026-02-27/</link><description>Feb 27 (Reuters) - Satellite images showed a rise in the number of military support aircraft including refuelling tankers at a Saudi airbase used by the U.S. military during a four-day period in February, as Washington built forces in the region amid tensions with Iran.

Saudi Arabia, a longstanding U.S. ally, told Iran last month it would not allow its airspace or territory to be used for military actions against Tehran, which held indirect negotiations with Washington on Thursday over its nuclear programme.

In a high-resolution satellite image taken on February 21, at least 43 aircraft were visible at Saudi Arabia's Prince Sultan Airbase - which has hosted U.S. forces for decades - compared with 27 aircraft visible in a February 17 image.

The number dropped to 38 in a February 25 image.

The aircraft in the February 21 image included 13 Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers and six Boeing E-3 Sentry aircraft known as AWACS, among a total of 29 large, swept-wing aircraft parked at the base, William Goodhind, a forensic imagery analyst with Contested Ground, told Reuters.

In the February 17, medium-resolution image, 11 large, swept-wing aircraft were visible, according to a Reuters tally.

Asked for comment, the Pentagon said it had "nothing to provide". The U.S. military does not usually comment on force movements.

The Saudi government's media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Oman, which is mediating between the United States and Iran, said the sides made progress in talks on Thursday, though there was no sign of a breakthrough that could avert potential U.S. strikes.

Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said on Thursday the sides plan to resume negotiations soon after consultations in their countries' capitals, with technical-level discussions scheduled to take place next week in Vienna.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on February 19 that Iran must make a deal in 10 to 15 days, warning that "really bad things" would otherwise happen.

A comparison of satellite imagery in early February with those taken in January also showed a build-up of aircraft and other military equipment across the region.

Recent satellite images have also shown Iran repairing and fortifying sites, including a sensitive military site reportedly bombed by Israel in 2024.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:17:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZ5YCAIGM5K25KUJDXZNLNGIQY.jpg?auth=a375a627cd3832b9acd627a985b4f04443030276a9538b062f337f7c2063977c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US-Iran talks end with no deal but potential signs of progress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-iran-nuclear-talks-resume-geneva-against-backdrop-military-threat-2026-02-26/</link><description>GENEVA, Feb 26 (Reuters) - (This Feb 26 story has been corrected to fix the day of the week to Thursday, not Tuesday, in paragraph 5)

The United States and Iran made progress in talks over Tehran's nuclear program on Thursday, mediator Oman said, but hours of negotiation ended with no sign of a breakthrough that could avert potential U.S. strikes amid a massive military buildup.

The two sides plan to resume negotiations soon after consultations in their countries' capitals, with technical-level discussions scheduled to take place next week in Vienna, Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said in a post on X after the day's meetings in Switzerland.

Badr Albusaidi will hold talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance and other U.S. officials in Washington on Friday, MS NOW reported late on Thursday. Neither the White House nor Oman's embassy in Washington immediately responded to requests for comment.

Any substantial move toward an elusive agreement between longtime foes Washington and Tehran could reduce the imminent prospects for U.S President Donald Trump to carry out a threatened attack on Iran that many fear could escalate into a wider war.

But Thursday's indirect talks wrapped up without a deal, still leaving the region on edge.

The Omani minister's upbeat assessment followed indirect talks between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner in Geneva, with one session in the morning and the second in the afternoon.

"We have finished the day after significant progress in the negotiation between the United States and Iran," Badr Albusaidi said.

But with many analysts seeing the latest diplomacy as the last chance before Trump could decide to go to war, Badr Albusaidi provided no details and stopped short of saying the two sides had overcome their biggest stumbling blocks to a deal.

Describing the talks as some of the most serious that Iran has had with the U.S., Araqchi told Iranian state television: "We reached agreement on some issues, and there are differences regarding some other issues."

“It was decided that the next round of negotiations will take place soon, in less than a week," he said. The Iranians, he added, had clearly expressed their demand for lifting of U.S. sanctions, which Washington has long insisted will only come after deep concessions from Tehran.

There was no immediate comment from the U.S. negotiating team on the outcome of the talks. But Axios quoted a senior U.S. official as saying the Geneva negotiations were “positive.”

The discussions about the decades-long dispute over Iran's nuclear work come as fears grow of a Middle East conflagration. Trump has repeatedly threatened action if there is no deal, and the U.S. military has amassed its forces in waters near the Islamic Republic.

A senior Iranian official told Reuters earlier on Thursday that the U.S. and Iran could reach a framework for a deal if Washington separated "nuclear and non-nuclear issues."

The Trump administration has insisted that Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for armed groups in the region must be part of the negotiations.

After the morning session, Badr Albusaidi said the two sides had exchanged "creative and positive ideas".

But a senior Iranian official said at the time that some gaps still had to be narrowed.

Washington, which believes Tehran seeks the ability to build a nuclear bomb, wants Iran to give up all uranium enrichment, a process that makes fuel for atomic power plants but that can also yield material for a warhead.

Iran has long denied wanting a bomb and said earlier on Thursday it would show flexibility at the talks. Reuters reported on Sunday that Tehran was offering undefined new concessions in return for removal of sanctions and recognition of its right to enrich uranium.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday that Iran's refusal to discuss its ballistic missile program was a "big problem" which would have to be addressed eventually.

The missiles were "designed solely to strike America" and pose a threat to regional stability, he said, but offered no proof to back the claim that U.S. territory could be targeted.

Trump said on February 19 that Iran must make a deal in 10 to 15 days, warning that "really bad things" would otherwise happen.

He briefly laid out his case for a possible attack on Iran in his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, underlining that while he preferred a diplomatic solution, he would not allow Tehran to obtain a nuclear weapon.

In June, the U.S. joined Israel in hitting Iranian nuclear sites and has been ramping up the pressure on Tehran again since January, when Trump threatened to intervene over its crushing of nationwide protests with thousands killed.

Since then, Trump has deployed fighter jets and aircraft carrier strike groups in the region.

Iran responded to last summer's strikes by firing fusillades of missiles at Israel and has threatened to retaliate fiercely if attacked again, raising fears of a wider regional conflict that has alarmed Gulf oil producers.

Within Iran, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei faces the gravest crisis of his 36-year tenure, with an economy buckling under tightened sanctions and renewed protests following the major unrest and crackdown in January.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Thursday that Khamenei has banned weapons of mass destruction, which "clearly means Tehran won't develop nuclear weapons," reiterating a religious decree issued in the early 2000s.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:17:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZKPAICGORPOVE2JFMC5M7MGFE.jpg?auth=6820be33a0d74dbd317755287faefa3a14015cb56b38b1ccbd781ac5ff9efe0f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says of Iran: 'Sometimes you have to use force'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-says-more-iran-talks-expected-friday-2026-02-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump expressed disappointment on Friday about U.S. negotiations with Iran over its nuclear program and warned that "sometimes you have to use force," amid a massive military presence in the region that could presage strikes on the Islamic Republic.

Trump has increased diplomatic and military pressure on Iran in the weeks since an Iranian crackdown on protesters, attempting to force the country's rulers to forswear nuclear weapons and other activities Washington sees as destabilizing.

After the latest round of talks on Thursday in Geneva ended without a deal, Trump's patience appeared to be wearing thin, although he said he had not made a final decision on the use of force.

"They don't want to say the key words, 'We're not going to have a nuclear weapon,'" Trump said on Friday before an event in Corpus Christi, Texas. "So I'm not happy with the negotiation."

Iran denies it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons and wants any accord to include the lifting of U.S. sanctions against it.

'PEACE DEAL WITHIN REACH': ALBUSAIDI

Trump spoke a day after negotiations between U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner and Iranian officials in Geneva ended without news of a deal, although Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi, who was a mediator, said the talks made significant progress.

Albusaidi told CBS earlier on Friday, before Trump's latest remarks, that a "peace deal is within our reach ... if we just allow diplomacy the space it needs to get there."

Iran has agreed in principle that it would never have nuclear material that could be used to create a weapon, Albusaidi said, adding that "if we can capture that and build on it, I think a deal is within our reach."

A big U.S. military force, including two aircraft carrier groups, is in the region waiting on Trump's order.

While Trump's timing for a final decision is unclear, the State Department said Secretary of State Marco Rubio is to hold talks in Israel with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday and Monday.

The United States joined Israel’s bombing campaign against Iran in June, striking major nuclear facilities.

Asked about the potential for use of force, Trump said the United States has the greatest military in the world.

"I'd love not to use it, but sometimes you have to," he said.

Trump said more discussions on Iran would take place later in the day.

He did not specify with whom, but Oman, which has been acting as a mediator between the two countries, sent its foreign minister to Washington on Friday for discussions on the issue with U.S. Vice President JD Vance, according to a source familiar with the matter.

Top U.S. defense officials were at the White House on Thursday for talks.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement on Friday that the State Department had designated Iran as a “State Sponsor of Wrongful Detention.”

Rubio said for decades Iran has wrongfully detained Americans and citizens of other nations “to use as political leverage against other states,” adding that the U.S. could consider additional measures, including a potential “geographic travel restriction on the use of U.S. passports to, through, or from Iran.”

Trump planned events in Corpus Christi later on Friday and then was to fly to Palm Beach, Florida, for the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago club.

A source briefed on the internal White House deliberations told Reuters that Trump is “very clear-eyed on all the options before him.”

There is a recognition internally that taking on Iran would be more difficult than the U.S. capture of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, and there was also internal pessimism as to whether negotiations will bear fruit, the source said.

"Nobody is super optimistic about the negotiations," the source said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:17:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DVX7CLH4GJIIZLECCB5FFBKVEE.jpg?auth=bd7f2913ef8cc8469df900bda98e9ca0f918af1c0760a17c3412dd5c89167441&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Argentina Senate approves Milei-backed labor reform</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentina-senate-approves-milei-backed-labor-reform-2026-02-28/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Feb 27 - Argentina’s Senate on Friday approved a labor reform backed by President Javier Milei, giving it final clearance to become law and landing the libertarian leader one of his most significant legislative wins.

Milei's administration argues the reform, which passed with 42 votes in favor, 28 against, and two abstentions, will spur investment and create formal jobs, while labor unions contend it weakens worker protections, including the right to strike.

The reform is expected to bolster investor confidence in Milei’s market-driven reforms.

Passage of the bill is seen by analysts as a signal that Milei has the political backing to advance his broader free‑market agenda.

Since taking office, Milei has stabilized the exchange rate and sharply cooled inflation, bringing monthly price increases down from double digits to 2.9% in January, gaining accolades from the International Monetary Fund.

One of the bill's most contentious provisions establishes an employer-financed severance fund consisting of contributions currently earmarked for the national pension system. The change could make it easier for companies to lay off workers and opposition lawmakers say the fund would impact the pension system's resources.

The reform also relaxes hiring rules, changes the vacation system, allows the standard workday to be extended from eight to 12 hours, and permits salaries to be paid in foreign currency.

Unions, which have mounted protests including a nationwide strike, object to new limits on the right to strike that require essential services to maintain minimum operations during work stoppages.

The labor reform is one of several legislative priorities for Milei’s administration. Lawmakers are also advancing changes to the law protecting Andean glaciers, a move the government says will unlock mining investment and which environmental groups strongly oppose.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:18:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VMQVP77KP5LEHFW74TAYIYA76M.jpg?auth=8e8092d908f187e4ad2ca5d7c1a0335b59a4320a857e9d1ae4253e645974194f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bolivian military plane crash death toll rises to 20, AFP reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/bolivian-military-plane-crashes-el-alto-near-la-paz-2026-02-27/</link><description>LA PAZ, Feb 27 (Reuters) - The death toll has risen to 20 in the crash on Friday evening of a Bolivian Air Force Hercules aircraft during bad weather in the city of El Alto, near Bolivia's capital La Paz, AFP reported citing police.

The plane was carrying new banknotes from the country's central bank.

The military aircraft had departed from the city of Santa Cruz and crashed after landing and skidding off the runway onto a neighboring avenue, according to local authorities.

Social media footage showed chaotic scenes of people flocking to the scene of the crash, appearing to pick up money that lay strewn on the ground following the accident. Local authorities on the scene were warding off people using water hoses and tear gas. Reuters was unable to identify the images.

Bolivia's central bank was set to address reporters later on Friday evening.

The El Alto International Airport was closed temporarily following the crash, national airline Boliviana de Aviacion said in a statement, adding the aircraft involved in the accident did not belong to its fleet.

Video broadcast on local media showed the aircraft was severely damaged, as were a number of vehicles along the avenue where the crash took place.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:18:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bill Clinton to lawmakers investigating Epstein: 'I saw nothing'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bill-clinton-give-private-testimony-congress-about-epstein-2026-02-27/</link><description>Feb 27 (Reuters) - Bill Clinton told lawmakers on Friday that he "saw nothing that gave me pause" when he spent time with Jeffrey Epstein, as the former president gave closed-door testimony about his relationship with the late sex offender.

Clinton's closed-door appearance before the House of Representatives Oversight Committee marked the first time a current or former president has been compelled to testify before Congress.

Democrats on the panel said President Donald Trump should be subpoenaed as well, but the committee's Republican chairman, James Comer said that was not going to happen.

Both men socialized with Epstein before his 2008 conviction of soliciting prostitution from a minor. Both have repeatedly said they did not see any evidence of sex trafficking, and neither have been accused by authorities of criminal activity related to the late financier, who entertained a long list of business and financial leaders at his lavish residences in New York, Florida and the Caribbean.

In his testimony, Clinton told the committee that he would not have flown on the late financier's plane if he had known about his alleged sex trafficking of underage girls, and would have reported him if he did.

"We are only here because he hid it from everyone so well for so long," Clinton said, speaking near his main residence in Chappaqua, New York.

Clinton flew on Epstein's plane several times in the early 2000s after he left office, and a tranche of millions of documents released by the Justice Department includes photos of Clinton with women whose faces are redacted.

"I saw nothing, and I did nothing wrong," Clinton said.

Comer described the hearing as cordial and said Clinton was cooperative. "He's a charming individual, obviously," he said.

Clinton said the committee should not have subpoenaed his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who told the panel on Thursday that she did not remember ever meeting Epstein and had nothing to share about his sex crimes.

She said she was also asked about UFOs and a 2016-era conspiracy theory during the seven-hour session.

Comer said some of Hillary Clinton's answers had been inconsistent and would be examined for possible perjury.

He did not rule out the possibility of subpoenaing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who visited Epstein's Caribbean island after his 2008 conviction. "Stay tuned on that," he said.

Democrats said the investigation would not be credible if it does not examine Trump's role.

"President Clinton's presence here today under oath highlights the Donald Trump-sized gaping hole in Chairman Comer's investigation," said Democratic Representative James Walkinshaw of Virginia.

Democrats are also accusing Trump's Justice Department of withholding records of a woman who accused Trump of sexually abusing her when she was a minor. The Justice Department has said it is looking at the material and will publish it if appropriate, and has also warned that the material includes unfounded accusations about Trump.

Trump's name appears frequently in the Epstein files. He socialized extensively with Epstein in the 1990s and 2000s and says he broke off ties before Epstein's 2008 conviction. Authorities have not accused him of criminal wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, but the association has dogged him for decades.

At the White House, Trump expressed sympathy for Clinton, a Democrat.

"I don't like seeing him deposed," Trump said. "But they certainly went after me more than that."

The Clintons agreed to testify near their home in Chappaqua after the House threatened to hold them in contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate. Some Democrats supported the move.

Both Clintons accuse Republicans of conducting a partisan exercise designed to protect Trump from scrutiny, noting that others in the inquiry were allowed to submit written statements rather than testify in person.

Epstein died in jail in 2019 while facing federal sex-trafficking crimes. His death was ruled a suicide.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:19:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLMVHWMY4ZNF7FXHFOPFGUQBUU.jpg?auth=c5c66c42123d5981f3ff65d2e772565d9c19c2275236da9dc306ccc694f90ab7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korean leader presents new sniper rifles to party officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/north-korean-leader-presents-new-sniper-rifles-party-officials-2026-02-28/</link><description>SEOUL, Feb 28 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has presented new sniper rifles as ceremonial gifts to party and military officials, calling them a "wonderful weapon" and a sign of his trust, state media KCNA news agency said on Saturday.

KCNA reported Kim met leading cadres and commanding officers at the headquarters of the Workers' Party of Korea on Friday and handed each a new-generation rifle developed by the country's Academy of Defence Science.

"As was already made public, this new-generation sniper's rifle our Academy of Defence Science developed and produced is really a wonderful weapon,” Kim was quoted as saying.

The gifts were presented to mark the Ninth Congress of the party.

Recipients included members of the party's Central Military Commission, senior commanders of the Korean People's Army and guard units, as well as Kim's sister Kim Yo Jong, whom KCNA for the first time identified as director of the General Affairs Department of the party's Central Committee.

Photographs published by KCNA showed Kim's teenage daughter, known as Ju Ae, attending the gift ceremony and aiming a rifle at a firing range.

Ju Ae, believed to be in her early teens, has been increasingly prominent in state media, accompanying her father on field guidance including inspections of weapons projects amid speculation by analysts that she is being groomed as the country's fourth-generation leader.

South Korea's National Intelligence Agency (NIS) believes the public role indicates she has started to provide policy input and that she is being treated as the de facto second-highest leader .

KCNA also released a photograph of Kim Yo Jong holding a rifle alongside Hyon Song Wol, an aide to the North Korean leader who is known to be close to his wife.

In a statement released after Israel and the United States launched strikes on Iran , Salam noted the "serious developments" in the region and called on "all Lebanese to act with wisdom and patriotism, placing Lebanon and the Lebanese people’s interests above any other consideration".

Hezbollah has fought numerous conflicts with Israel since it was established by Iran's Revolutionary Guards in 1982.

Reuters reported on Tuesday that Israel had warned Lebanon that it would strike the country hard, targeting civilian infrastructure including the airport, in the event that Hezbollah gets involved in any U.S.-Iran war.

"I reiterate that we will not accept anyone dragging the country into adventures that threaten its security and unity," Salam said in a statement sent to Reuters.

Israel dealt heavy blows to Hezbollah during a war in 2024, killing its leader Hassan Nasrallah along with thousands of its fighters and destroying much of its arsenal.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:19:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XHPIL3CLQFNS7L7WROKI5BU4RA.jpg?auth=1c1584d49d8308fd331adb1a6e09c970a25fca0d433987c0aa401f3409c7c08f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tram derails in central Milan leaving two dead, 40 injured</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/tram-derails-central-milan-least-one-dead-2026-02-27/</link><description>MILAN, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Two people were killed and around 40 injured when a tram derailed in central Milan on Friday, a spokesperson for local firefighters said.

The strikes , which Trump said were aimed at destroying Iranian missiles and annihilating its navy, follow repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike Iran again if it pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

"I do not make this statement lightly. The Iranian regime seeks to kill," Trump said in a video shared on Truth Social.

"The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties that often happens in war, but we're doing this, not for now. We're doing this for the future, and it is a noble mission."

Trump told the members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, Iran's armed forces, to lay down their weapons, promising that they would be granted immunity.

The other option, according to Trump, is "certain death."

Washington and Tehran held a series of talks in recent weeks about Iran's nuclear ambition. The most recent one was held on Thursday with no deal.

"Iran refused, just as it has for decades and decades. They rejected every opportunity to renounce their nuclear ambitions, and we can't take it anymore," Trump said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:20:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBUEI6OGGZPAJIFHDGKAH3RQEQ.jpg?auth=6bb57e6f2450a8e7246d8d371029a0f6edda72af1633ff08e54304337724004b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia weighs halt to peace talks unless Ukraine cedes territory, Bloomberg News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-weighs-halt-peace-talks-unless-ukraine-cedes-territory-bloomberg-news-2026-02-28/</link><description>Feb 28 (Reuters) - Russian officials increasingly see little reason to continue U.S.-led peace talks with Ukraine unless Kyiv signals it is prepared to give up territory as part of a settlement, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The New York Times, citing a U.S. official, reported that U.S. strikes on Iran were underway. A source told Reuters that Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was not in Tehran and had been transferred to a secure location.

The attack, coming after Israel and Iran engaged in a 12-day air war in June, follows repeated U.S.-Israeli warnings that they would strike again if Iran pressed ahead with its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

"The State of Israel launched a pre-emptive attack against Iran to remove threats to the State of Israel," Defence Minister Israel Katz said.

An Israeli defence official said the operation had been planned for months in coordination with Washington, and that the launch date was decided weeks ago.

Explosions were heard in Tehran on Saturday, Iranian media reported, and sirens sounded across Israel around 08:15 local time in what the military said was a proactive alert to prepare the public for the possibility of an incoming missile strike.

The Israeli military announced the closure of schools and workplaces, with exceptions for essential sectors, and a ban on public airspace. Israel closed its airspace to civilian flights, and the airports authority asked the public not to go to any of the country's airports.

The U.S. and Iran renewed negotiations in February in a bid to resolve the decades-long dispute through diplomacy and avert the threat of a military confrontation that could destabilise the region.

Israel, however, insisted that any U.S. deal with Iran must include the dismantling of Tehran's nuclear infrastructure, not just stopping the enrichment process, and lobbied Washington to include restrictions on Iran's missile programme in the talks.

Iran said it was prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear programme in exchange for lifting sanctions but ruled out linking the issue to missiles.

Tehran also said it would defend itself against any attack.

It warned neighbouring countries hosting U.S. troops that it would retaliate against American bases if Washington struck Iran.

In June, the U.S. joined an Israeli military campaign against Iranian nuclear installations, in the most direct American military action ever against the Islamic Republic.

Tehran retaliated then by launching missiles toward the U.S. Al Udeid air base in Qatar, the largest in the Middle East.

Western powers have warned that Iran's ballistic missile project threatens regional stability and could deliver nuclear weapons if developed. Tehran denies seeking atomic bombs.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:21:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KJXDOGBT6NP5NPMTU6APLMRM34.jpg?auth=bee7a5338d5896ef1e65d9d0b8ca55e308d4adb05254bc9718e0de37c3b9d96a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel's operation against Iran was coordinated with US, Israeli official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-operation-against-iran-was-coordinated-with-us-israeli-official-says-2026-02-28/</link><description>Feb 28 (Reuters) - The Israeli operation against Iran on Saturday was coordinated with the U.S., an Israeli defence official told Reuters.

The government in Havana has said 10 Cuban nationals coming from the United States entered Cuban waters and opened fire on a border guard vessel, leading Cuban forces to return fire killing four and wounding six others, who were taken into custody.

In an attempt to dispel doubts about its account to date, senior Cuban Interior Ministry officers displayed the captured armaments from the studio on a special television program, including bins full of at least some of the 12,846 recovered rounds.

They also showed pictures of the vessels, each peppered with bullet holes from the firefight they said took place at a range of 20 meters (66 feet).

The confrontation took place at a fraught moment in U.S.-Cuban relations, with U.S. President Donald Trump pressuring the island by imposing a virtual oil blockade after capturing and ousting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a crucial Cuban ally, on January 3.

Cuba has identified the assailants as Cuban exiles, some of whom had been previously placed on a list of accused terrorists, who came from the United States with the intent to sow chaos and attack military units on the Communist-ruled island.

"The intent of this group is to infiltrate, to promote public disorder. To incite the people to unite. To carry out something violent. Attack military units in order to incite social unrest and to unite the people in order to steal the revolution. That has been duly proven," said Colonel Victor Alvarez of the Interior Ministry.

U.S. politicians have expressed skepticism over Cuba's version of events. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday said his government would independently investigate, adding that it was not a U.S. operation and that no U.S. government personnel were involved.

Cuban officers said the infiltrators set out from Marathon in the Florida Keys on two vessels but ditched one at some point due to technical difficulties. They united on one speedboat, which a U.S. official said was reported stolen in Florida.

Cuba said it recovered a drone, radios, knives, a portable power plant, bolt cutters and other materiel. They also found emblems of the November 30th Movement and People's Self-Defense, anti-communist groups that oppose the Cuban government.

Cuba says a patrol of five border guard members on a 9-meter boat spotted the incoming vessel shortly after 7 a.m., with some members of the incoming crew in the water, about one nautical mile off a cay on the Caribbean island's northern coast, about 100 miles (160 km) from Marathon.

The infiltrators opened fire at a distance of 185 meters, striking the captain of the Cuban vessel in the abdomen, Cuba said. Bleeding heavily, the wounded captain remained at the helm and steered toward the enemy vessel, leading to a firefight at a distance of about 20 meters, the officers said.

Cuba called its response "proportional."

"It is a defensive model that practically never uses firearms, and the use of firearms is proportional to the type of action being carried out against our force," said Interior Ministry Colonel Ybey Carballo.

The captured Cuban nationals were receiving medical care and face charges including armed aggression, illegal entry into national territory, crimes associated with terrorist acts, and arms trafficking, prosecutor Edward Robert Campbell told the program. He said they face prison terms of up to 10 to 15 years for the lesser offenses and 20 to 30 years - or even the death penalty - for the more serious charges.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:22:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Afghan Taliban open to talks after Pakistan bombs Kabul, Kandahar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-strikes-afghanistan-targets-clashes-intensify-2026-02-27/</link><description>KABUL/ISLAMABAD, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Afghanistan's Taliban rulers said on Friday they were willing to negotiate after Pakistan bombed their forces in major cities and said the allies-turned-foes were in " open war ."

Pakistan struck the Afghan capital Kabul, the city of Kandahar, where Taliban leaders are based, and other towns, a Taliban spokesman said. The attacks were its first directly targeting Afghanistan's government over allegations it harbours militants seeking to overthrow the Islamabad government.

Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said there were civilian casualties on Friday but did not provide details.

In Kabul, thick plumes of black smoke rose from two sites and a huge blaze was also visible in video verified by Reuters. Reuters witnesses said many ambulance sirens could be heard following loud blasts and the sound of jets on Friday.

Kabul taxi driver Tamim said an ammunition depot was hit and explosions continued inside after the strikes as stored ordnance ignited.

"The plane came and dropped two bombs, then flew away again. After that, we heard explosions," said Tamim, who was asleep when the strikes hit. "Everyone, in panic, ran down from the second floor of the house."

Security sources in Pakistan said the strikes involved air-to-ground missile attacks on Taliban military offices and posts in response to Afghan attacks on Thursday.

The latest violence erupted after Pakistan's airstrikes on Afghan territory last weekend triggered Afghan retaliatory attacks along the border on Thursday, escalating long‑simmering tensions over Pakistan's claim that Afghanistan shelters Pakistani Taliban militants. Afghanistan denies this.

The Taliban said on Friday their leaders were ready to negotiate with Pakistan.

"The Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan has always tried to resolve issues through dialogue, and now also we want to resolve this matter through dialogue," Mujahid said.

Mujahid said Pakistani strikes hit parts of Kabul, Kandahar and Paktia on Thursday night, and on Paktia, Paktika, Khost and Laghman on Friday.

That followed Afghan drone strikes that began late on Thursday on Pakistani military positions and installations in northwest Pakistan along their shared border.

Pakistani officials said the country's strikes killed 274 Taliban officials and militants while Afghanistan said it killed 55 Pakistani soldiers - figures which Reuters was unable to verify.

Pakistan confirmed that 12 of its own soldiers were killed and Afghanistan said it had lost 13 Taliban fighters.

For years, Islamabad has blamed Afghanistan for attacks inside Pakistan aimed at overthrowing the government, claiming the Taliban shelter Tehreek‑e‑Taliban Pakistan fighters .

Islamabad says TTP leaders operate from Afghan territory and use it as a safe haven to plan cross‑border assaults. While the United Nations has said the TTP and the Taliban in Afghanistan are linked, the Kabul government denies this and argues Pakistan is deflecting blame for its own security failures.

In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres was "deeply concerned by the escalation of violence" between Afghanistan and Pakistan and the impact that is having on civilian populations, his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said.

"He calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities, and he reiterates his call on the parties to resolve any differences through diplomacy," Dujarric said.

The United States on Friday expressed support for Pakistan.

"The United States supports Pakistan's right to defend itself against attacks from the Taliban, a Specially Designated Global Terrorist group," a State Department spokesperson said.

"The Taliban have consistently failed to uphold their counterterrorism commitments, allowing violence to destabilize the region while terrorist groups use Afghanistan as a launching pad for their heinous attacks."

The European Union's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas on Saturday called for the countries to de-escalate and engage in dialogue , opens new tab .

"The EU reiterates that Afghan territory must not be used to threaten or attack other countries and calls on the Afghan de facto authorities to take effective action against all terrorist groups operating in or from Afghanistan," Kallas said in a statement.

The strikes threatened to unleash a protracted conflict along the 2,600-km (1,615-mile) frontier between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

"Our cup of patience has overflowed. Now it is open war between us and you (Afghanistan)," Pakistani Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif said on Friday.

Pakistan's foreign ministry warned that any new Taliban provocations, or attempts by any "terrorist group" to target Pakistanis, would be met with a "measured, decisive and befitting response".

Pakistan is nuclear-armed and its military capabilities are vastly superior to those of Afghanistan. However, the Taliban are adept at guerrilla warfare, hardened by decades of fighting with U.S.-led forces, before returning to power in 2021.

Afghan Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi spoke by telephone on Friday with Qatar's Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, the junior foreign minister, the Afghan ministry said in a statement.

Qatar, which helped stop fighting between the two countries last year, is working with other nations to help resolve the latest crisis, Afghanistan said.

"Afghanistan has never been a supporter of violence and has always preferred to resolve issues based on mutual understanding and respect," Muttaqi told Khulaifi in their call, the statement said.

Clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan in October killed dozens of soldiers until negotiations facilitated by Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia brought an end to the hostilities.

The U.N. spokesman said nearly half of Afghanistan's population, or 22 million people, need humanitarian aid and the number would rise if fighting continues or worsens.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:22:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XVQ6EPSRVVKKTGD73ZHESRE6PI.jpg?auth=183a97196b6fbce5ae01bdc223f7da38d50cfad429ea4fff1758e71b300c5396&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer vows to fight political 'extremes' after suffering vote defeat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-green-party-wins-gorton-denton-parliamentary-seat-2026-02-27/</link><description>MANCHESTER, Feb 27 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pledged to fight political "extremes" on the right and left on Friday after his Labour Party suffered a humiliating election defeat to the left-wing Green Party in an area it had dominated for almost a century.

In a result that underscored the breakdown of Britain's two-party politics, the loss of a safe Labour seat in England's northwestern region of Greater Manchester piles pressure on Starmer after weeks of turmoil and calls for him to resign .

The Green Party's Hannah Spencer won the contest for the seat of Gorton and Denton, with Nigel Farage's populist Reform UK party coming second, and Labour in third.

Starmer described the result as "very disappointing", arguing that while governing parties were often punished at such elections, he understood voter anger.

"I will ... fight against the extremes in politics on the right and the left," he told reporters, promising to work "as long as I've got breath in my body" to deliver the change he promised when he won a landslide national election in 2024.

But his words will do little to calm some in his party, who criticised an election strategy that focused on the threat from Reform, rather than targeting the Greens.

Spencer told a news conference the party would go from strength to strength before the next national election, which must take place by mid-August 2029, and Green leader Zack Polanski said he wanted to secure at least 30 seats, possibly up to 50, in Britain's 650-seat parliament.

John Curtice, Britain's most respected pollster, called the result a "seismic moment", which means the "future of British politics looks more uncertain than at any stage" since the end of World War Two, uncertainty reflected across much of the West.

Starmer had staked his personal authority on Labour winning the seat by blocking one of his rivals, the popular Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham , from standing, and by visiting the constituency earlier this week.

The defeat comes after Starmer faced the most dangerous moment of his premiership this month when some lawmakers said he should resign over his decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as ambassador to Washington, despite his links to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

In 2024, Labour won just over half the vote in the area. On Friday, the Green Party won 40.7% of the vote. Reform won 28.7% and Labour received 25.4%.

Labour lawmakers say Starmer is unlikely to face an immediate threat to his position, but some questioned his strategy.

"In an election we tried to make into one of unity versus division, the electorate chose division - just not the division we were campaigning most against," said one Labour lawmaker.

Starmer could be challenged after May elections when Labour is expected to fare badly in local and regional polls.

Gorton and Denton was once part of Labour's coalition of industrial areas in England considered to be so impregnable it was called the Red Wall, but the contest was an example of how the electorate has become more volatile.

It was the first time the Green Party, which supports leaving NATO and legalising recreational drugs, had won such an election or one in northern England. That takes the party's number of seats in parliament to five out of 650.

Life-time Labour supporter Gerald Gudgion, 73, said he had voted for the Greens because Britain needed "a change of direction and I think the Greens are offering that".

Friday's result shows how Reform , seen as the main challenger to Labour at the next election, could struggle to win in some places, particularly ethnically diverse urban areas.

Reform's candidate Matt Goodwin alienated some voters in Gorton and Denton, which has a large number of Muslim residents, with his past comments that British Muslims "are fundamentally opposed to British values and ways of life".

Farage said the result, in an area where some Muslim voters have called for greater support for Palestinians in Gaza, was a "victory for sectarian voting and cheating".

The Electoral Commission, an independent body which oversees elections, said it was "aware of the report" suggesting there had been instances of "family voting" when two voters either confer on voting, which breaches the secret ballot.

"We encourage anyone who believes an offence has occurred to report it to the police," it said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:23:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JYWEH65GCNO5VNUSJYRMIMIGYY.jpg?auth=872570ba732bf74b5664991883ff53b3893e8ad3fce4b566e4a893273511afa9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Arrest of Western Australia man over alleged terror plot 'deeply shocking', PM Albanese says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/arrest-western-australia-man-over-alleged-terror-plot-deeply-shocking-pm-2026-02-28/</link><description>SYDNEY, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday's arrest of a Western Australian man over an alleged terror plot targeting mosques, police and a parliament building was "deeply shocking".

The 20-year-old from the town of Bindoon about 63 km (39 miles) north of state capital Perth was later charged by police with planning a terrorist act. Police said the man had written a manifesto with plans for a mass casualty event and that he wanted to attack mosques, Western Australia's police headquarters and Parliament House.

Albanese said on X late on Friday: "The arrest of a WA man over an alleged racially-motivated terrorist plot is deeply shocking."

"Allegations the man was planning to target the Muslim community through attacks on mosques - as well as attacks on the WA police and parliament - are particularly distressing. He should face the full force of the law," Albanese said.

The arrest is the latest in a series of incidents in Australia classified as terrorism, including an attempt on January 26 to bomb a rally in Perth that was protesting against the country's national day.

In December, two gunmen attacked a Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's Bondi Beach, killing 15 in Australia's deadliest massacre in nearly 30 years. Authorities believe the pair were inspired by Islamic State, the Sunni Muslim militant group.</description><pubDate>Sat, 28 Feb 2026 09:23:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure
