"These designations reflect the opening actions of an ongoing, sustained effort to thwart Muslim Brotherhood chapters' violence and destabilisation wherever it occurs," Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

Muslim Brotherhood leaders have said they renounce violence.

The Muslim Brotherhood is a pan-Islamist organisation founded in Egypt in 1928 that later spread across the Arab world . Its founder, Egyptian schoolteacher Hassan al-Banna, argued that reviving Islamic principles in society could enable the Muslim world to resist Western colonialism .

The Muslim Brotherhood is already outlawed as a terrorist group in some countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Jordan banned it in April of this year, accusing the group of manufacturing and stockpiling weapons and planning to destabilise the kingdom, where it remains widely popular.

A US designation as a foreign terrorist group allows Washington to take punitive measures such as freezing any assets the group might have in the United States and denying entry to group members.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ca6cb58a-f09b-11f0-8a43-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-9AH37H.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clintons refuse to testify in Epstein probe as Republicans threaten contempt charges</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260113-clintons-refuse-testify-epstein-probe-as-republicans-threaten-contempt-charges</link><description>Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said they will refuse to comply with a congressional subpoena for them to testify in an investigation into disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein .

The Clintons have slammed a Republican-controlled committee’s attempts as “legally invalid” as GOP lawmakers prepare contempt of Congress proceedings against them.

In a letter released on social media Tuesday, the Clintons told the chair of the House Oversight Committee, Republican congressman James Comer, that he’s on the cusp of a process “literally designed to result in our imprisonment”.

The Clintons said they had tried to provide what "little information" they had ‍to help with the investigation and accused Comer of shifting focus away from the ​Trump administration's failures.

"We've done so because Mr. Epstein's crimes were horrific. If the Government didn't do all it could to investigate and prosecute these ‌crimes, for whatever reason, that should be the focus of your work ... There is no evidence that ‍you are doing so," they wrote.

Comer says he’ll begin contempt of Congress proceedings next week. It potentially starts a complicated and politically messy process that Congress has rarely reached for.

“No one’s accusing the Clintons of any wrongdoing. We just have questions," Comer told reporters after Bill Clinton did not show up for a scheduled deposition at House offices Tuesday.

Clinton has never been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein but had a well-documented friendship with Epstein , a wealthy financier, throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Republicans have zeroed in on that relationship as they try to wrestle control over demands for a full accounting of Epstein's wrongdoing.

“Anyone would admit they spent a lot of time together,” Comer said.

Epstein was arrested in 2019 on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. He was found dead in a New York jail cell while awaiting trial, apparently by suicide.

Multiple former presidents have voluntarily testified before congress, but none has been compelled to do so.

Comer also indicated that the committee would not attempt to compel testimony from President Donald Trump , a fellow Republican, saying that it could not force a sitting president to testify.

Under pressure from the Trump's political base, the administration has ordered the US Justice ‍Department to release files tied to criminal probes of Epstein, who was once friends ‌with Trump ​and the Clintons, in compliance with a transparency law passed by Congress.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 17:53:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/019db34e-f09f-11f0-9c2f-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-13T163503Z-339867903-RC2NDCAR4CM1-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-EPSTEIN-CLINTONS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Little appetite for regime change’: Trump offers 'help' for Iran's protesters, but what can he do?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260113-trump-tells-iran-protesters-help-on-its-way-weighs-military-strikes</link><description>It has been 10 days since US President Donald Trump warned Iran against cracking down on street protests, stressing that the United States was ready to "come to the rescue" of Iranian demonstrators .

As he put it, the US was “locked and loaded and ready to go”.

Trump has since repeated that threat and said he was looking at “very strong options” against Tehran – even as the death toll from the regime’s ferocious crackdown soared to more than 2,000 , according to rights groups.

In a social media post on Tuesday, the US president urged Iranians to continue protesting and said “help is on its way”. He gave no details about what “help” he was leaning towards and when it might come.

The enigmatic message came a day after he exercised economic leverage by announcing 25 percent tariffs on any country that trades with Iran, and spoke of ways to restore internet access shut by Tehran.

Trump was to meet with senior advisers later on Tuesday to discuss possible course of action, with options reported to include military strikes, using secret cyber weapons, widening sanctions and providing online help to anti-government sources.

"Nobody knows what President Trump is going to do except for President Trump," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. "The world can keep waiting and guessing."

Buoyed by the successful capture of Venezuela’s Nicolas Maduro earlier this month, Trump may be tempted to give America’s foes – and the wider world – another taste of US military might.

The US president has already proven his readiness to strike directly at Iran – first with the killing of Iran’s top military commander Qasem Soleimani in January 2020, and more recently with the strikes on Iranian nuclear sites last June .

The latter raid, which involved flying bunker-busting bombs from a base in Missouri and dropping them on two of Iran's most important nuclear sites, showed that Washington is perfectly capable of mounting large-scale operations from a distance.

Both attacks also reflected Trump’s preference, as seen again recently in Venezuela , for one-off military operations he quickly claims as successes.

“Trump clearly has the means to strike key targets within the Iranian regime, but he’s likely to want to do so in a manner that is both decisive and does not drag the US into something long-term and indefinite,” said Anthony Samrani, chief editor of Beirut-based publication L’Orient-Le Jour.

The trouble, Samrani added, “is that there’s no guarantee a US attack would knock out the regime or even coerce it into being more compliant.”

Citing unnamed officials in the Trump administration, the New York Times reported on Sunday that the president was “seriously considering” military strikes against Iran but “has not made a final decision”.

The NYT said advisers presented Trump with a range of potential strike targets, including unspecified non-military sites in Tehran and facilities linked to Iranian security services involved in suppressing protests.

Striking military installations comes with a high risk. Some bases of elite military and security forces may be located in heavily populated areas so any attack ordered by Trump could inflict large civilian casualties.

Iranian authorities have vowed to retaliate against any attack, with parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf warning Washington against "a miscalculation".

“Let us be clear: in the case of an attack on Iran, the occupied territories (Israel) as well as all US bases and ships will be our legitimate target," said Qalibaf, a former commander in Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards.

Despite the damage incurred during last year’s 12-day war with Israel , Iran still has a significant arsenal of ballistic missiles. And while its regional proxies are much diminished, they are still capable of action.

Analysts say the scope of any US attack is likely to prove crucial in terms of either emboldening the protest movement or further hardening the regime’s response.

Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Trump could target forces including the Revolutionary Guards that have taken the lead in repressing the protests. Such a move might ease Iranians' fears and “affect the fence-sitters in thinking about joining the protests or not”, he told AFP.

Others argue that the mere threat of US intervention has had the opposite effect, galvanising the regime’s crackdown on what it regards as foreign-backed “terrorists”.

“We've seen on the surface a consolidation of the government as well as no defections at all,” said Iran expert Trita Parsi, deputy head of the Washington-based Quincy Institute.

“The idea that threats would result in the Iranian regime backing off is not at all what we're seeing,” Parsi added. “On the contrary, we're probably seeing the most brutal level of violence used against people since the start of the Islamic Revolution .”

Senior lawmakers have also voiced contrasting opinions, with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urging Trump to “embolden the protesters and scare the hell out of the regime”.

“If I were you, Mr. President, I would kill the leadership that are killing the people,” Graham, who has often touted a ‍muscular approach to foreign policy, told Fox News on Sunday. “You’ve got to end this.”

But at least two Senate colleagues have sounded notes of caution.

“I don’t know that bombing Iran will have the effect that is intended,” Republican Senator Rand Paul told ABC News, warning that a military attack on Iran could rally the people against an outside enemy.

History shows the dangers of US intervention, added Democratic Senator Mark Warner, ‍who argued that the US-backed 1953 overthrow of Iran's government set in motion a chain of events that gradually led to the rise of the country's Islamic regime.

Reza Pahlavi, whose father the late shah of Iran was overthrown during the 1979 Islamic Revolution, has been one of the most prominent voices calling for a US intervention in the country.

In a message designed to flatter and galvanise Trump, the exiled Pahlavi publicly encouraged the US president to choose a different course from his predecessor Barack Obama , who hesitated at supporting Iran’s massive protest movement in 2009 for fear of co-opting a homegrown movement.

Pahlavi's name has surfaced in protesters’ slogans urging a restoration of the monarchy. On Sunday he said he was prepared to return to Iran to lead a shift to a ‍democratic government.

But Washington has given no indication so far that it plans to back the son of the shah, or indeed push for regime change.

“Unlike what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq in the early 2000s, there is little appetite within the Trump administration for regime change,” said Clément Therme, a historian and Iran expert at the Université Paul-Valéry in Montpellier.

“Instead, the administration’s preference goes to one-off operations aimed at destabilising opponents,” said Therme, noting that the Venezuelan opposition is no closer to power today than it was before Maduro’s capture.

He added: “I very much doubt that Trump will want to invest American military capital in the restoration of the Pahlavi dynasty.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 18:35:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/643a1f98-f0a3-11f0-916e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-13T154555Z-815588752-RC2F0JASSB9S-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN chief warns he could refer Israel to world court over action against UN Palestinian refugee agency</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-chief-warns-he-could-refer-israel-world-court-over-action-against-un-2026-01-13/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned Israel in a letter that he could refer the country to the International Court of Justice if it does not repeal laws targeting U.N. Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA and return seized assets and property.

In a January 8 letter to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Guterres said the United Nations cannot remain indifferent to "actions taken by Israel, which are in direct contravention of the obligations of Israel under international law. They must be reversed without delay."

Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the agency. It then amended that law last month to ban electricity or water to UNRWA facilities.

Israeli authorities also seized UNRWA's East Jerusalem offices last month. The U.N. considers East Jerusalem occupied by Israel. Israel considers all of Jerusalem to be part of the country.

Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon on Tuesday dismissed Guterres' letter to Netanyahu.

"We are not fazed by the Secretary-General's threats," Danon said. "Instead of dealing with the undeniable involvement of UNRWA personnel in terrorism, the Secretary-General chooses to threaten Israel. This is not defending international law, this is defending an organization marred by terrorism."

Israel has long been critical of UNRWA, which was created by the General Assembly in 1949 following the war surrounding the founding of Israel. It provides aid, health and education to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan.

The United Nations has said that nine UNRWA staff may have been involved in the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel and were fired. A Hamas commander in Lebanon - killed in September by Israel - was also found to have had a UNRWA job.

The U.N. has vowed to investigate all accusations made and has repeatedly asked Israel for evidence, which it says has not been provided.

The Hamas attack in 2023 triggered the war between Israel and the Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip. Top U.N. officials and the U.N. Security Council have described UNRWA as the backbone of the aid response in Gaza, where the two-year war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas unleashed a humanitarian catastrophe.

The United Nations' top legal body, the International Court of Justice, in October gave an advisory opinion saying Israel is under the obligation to ensure the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met.

The ICJ opinion was requested by the 193-member U.N. General Assembly. Advisory opinions of the ICJ, also known as the World Court, carry legal and political weight, but they are not binding and the court has no enforcement power.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:21:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KWMCS72VSZNU7FDXZAWYAHBS2E.jpg?auth=bd892e88ad5ddb5663b06315da54cf787641f6b7baee0dfc22fa7abb47423872&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy Witkoff, Reza Pahlavi discussed Iran protests, Axios reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-envoy-witkoff-reza-pahlavi-discussed-iran-protests-axios-reports-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - White House envoy Steve Witkoff over the weekend met with Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's last shah and a prominent voice in the fragmented opposition, to discuss the protests roiling that country, Axios reported on Tuesday, citing an unidentified senior U.S. official.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:22:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B2KWWK3ZARLMPB7CWLLFOOJUIA.jpg?auth=bf5c2c385a0eeafa21c20f1d6bcbf7e97b9202a09b305cf16b3a587a25a9b084&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to revoke citizenship of naturalized migrants convicted of fraud, Trump says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-revoke-citizenship-naturalized-migrants-convicted-fraud-trump-says-2026-01-13/</link><description>DETROIT, Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration is going to revoke the citizenship of any naturalized immigrant from Somalia or any other country who is convicted of defrauding "our citizens."

The number of dead climbed to at least 2,003 , as reported by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency. That figure dwarfs the death toll from any other round of protest or unrest in Iran in decades and recalls the chaos surrounding the country's 1979 Islamic Revolution .

Iranian state television offered the first official acknowledgment of the deaths, quoting an official saying the country had “a lot of martyrs” and that it did not release a toll earlier because of the dead suffering gruesome injuries. However, that statement came only after activists reported their toll.

The demonstrations began a little over two weeks ago in anger over Iran’s ailing economy and soon targeted the theocracy, particularly 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . Images obtained Tuesday by the Associated Press from demonstrations in Tehran showed graffiti and chants calling for Khamenei's death – something that could carry a death sentence.

Iranian state media has said dozens of members of the security forces have been killed, with their funerals turning into large pro-government rallies. Authorities have declared three days of national mourning for those killed.

Soon after the new death toll became public, US President Donald Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform: “Iranian Patriots, KEEP PROTESTING – TAKE OVER YOUR INSTITUTIONS!!!”

He added: “I have cancelled all meetings with Iranian Officials until the senseless killing of protesters STOPS. HELP IS ON ITS WAY.” Trump did not give details.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking to the Qatar-funded satellite news network Al Jazeera in an interview aired Monday night, said he had continued to communicate with US envoy Steve Witkoff .

But after Trump's message Tuesday, top Iranian security official Ali Larijani responded by writing: “We declare the names of the main killers of the people of Iran: 1- Trump 2-” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu .

The activist group said 1,850 of the dead were protesters and 135 were government-affiliated. Nine children were killed, along with nine civilians it said were not taking part in protests. More than 16,700 people have been detained, the group said.

With the internet down in Iran, gauging the demonstrations from abroad has grown more difficult. Outlets have been unable to independently assess the toll. Iran’s government has not offered overall casualty figures.

Skylar Thompson with the Human Rights Activists News Agency said the new toll was shocking, particularly since it reached four times the death toll of the months-long 2022 Mahsa Amini protests in just two weeks.

“We’re horrified, but we still think the number is conservative," she said, warning that the toll would still rise.

Speaking by phone for the first time since their calls were cut off from the outside world, Iranian witnesses described a heavy security presence in central Tehran, burned-out government buildings, smashed ATMs and few passersby. Meanwhile, people were concerned about what comes next, including the possibility of a US attack.

“My customers talk about Trump’s reaction while wondering if he plans a military strike against the Islamic Republic,” said shopkeeper Mahmoud, who gave only his first name out of concern for his safety.

“I don’t expect Trump or any other foreign country cares about the interests of Iranians.”

Reza, a taxi driver who also gave just his first name, said protests are on many people's minds.

“People – particularly young ones – are hopeless, but they talk about continuing the protests,” he said.

Several people in Tehran were able to call the AP on Tuesday and speak to a journalist. The AP bureau in Dubai, United Arab Emirates , was unable to call those numbers back. Witnesses said text messaging was still down, and internet users in Iran could connect to government-approved websites locally but nothing abroad.

Anti-riot police officers wore helmets and body armour while carrying batons, shields, shotguns and tear gas launchers, according to the witnesses. Police stood watch at major intersections. Nearby, witnesses saw members of the Revolutionary Guard's all-volunteer Basij force, who carried firearms and batons. Security officials in plainclothes were visible in public spaces.

Several banks and government offices were burned during the unrest, witnesses said. Banks struggled to complete transactions without the internet, they added.

Shops were open, though there was little foot traffic in the capital. Tehran's Grand Bazaar, where the demonstrations began December 28 over the collapse of Iran's rial currency, opened Tuesday. A witness described speaking to multiple shopkeepers who said security forces ordered them to reopen no matter what. Iranian state media did not acknowledge that order.

The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.

It also appeared that security service personnel were searching for Starlink terminals, as people in northern Tehran reported authorities raiding apartment buildings with satellite dishes.

While satellite television dishes are illegal, many in the capital have them in homes, and officials broadly had given up on enforcing the law in recent years.

On the streets, people also could be seen challenging plainclothes security officials, who were stopping passersby at random.

State television also read a statement about mortuary and morgue services being free – a signal that some likely charged high fees for the release of bodies amid the crackdown.

Khamenei, in a statement carried by state TV, praised the tens of thousands who took part in pro-government demonstrations nationwide on Monday.

“This was a warning to American politicians to stop their deceit and not rely on traitorous mercenaries,” he said. “The Iranian nation is strong and powerful and aware of the enemy.”

State TV on Monday aired chants from the crowd, which appeared to number in the tens of thousands. They chanted “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel !” Others cried out, “Death to the enemies of God!” Iran’s attorney general has warned that anyone taking part in protests will be considered an “enemy of God”, a death-penalty charge.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:44:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a05df8dc-f0bc-11f0-882c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92H27ZQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NAACP says Trump being deceptive about history after reverse discrimination remark</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/naacp-says-trump-being-deceptive-about-history-after-reverse-discrimination-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - The largest U.S. civil rights group on Tuesday said President Donald Trump was being deceptive in his comments about "reverse discrimination" and in his claims that civil rights hurt white people, with the NAACP adding that "deception is the point" of such remarks to lay groundwork for rolling back social progress.

In an interview from last week published by the New York Times, Trump said he believed civil rights-era protections resulted in white people being treated unfairly.

"White people were very badly treated, where they did extremely well and they were not invited to go into a university to college," the newspaper quoted Trump as saying in an apparent reference to affirmative action in college admissions.

The comments came after Trump was asked whether protections that began in the 1960s with passage of the Civil Rights Act resulted in discrimination against white men, according to the newspaper.

"It accomplished some very wonderful things, but it also hurt a lot of people — people that deserve to go to a college or deserve to get a job were unable to get a job," Trump was quoted as saying. "It was a reverse discrimination."

NAACP President Derrick Johnson denounced the comments.

"Donald Trump knows he is lying through his teeth. The issue isn't that he is unaware of the history or lacks education, it's that deception is the point," Johnson said in a statement. There is "zero evidence, none, that the civil rights movement harmed white people in any way," Johnson added.

"Trump does this all the time. He deliberately invents a false reality to lay the groundwork for policies that further benefit the top one percent by privatizing government services and stripping resources away from underserved communities."

Trump has been criticized by rights groups over his immigration crackdown , assault on diversity initiatives , funding freeze against universities over pro-Palestinian protests , opens new tab and attacks against cultural institutions for focusing on issues like slavery .

Trump cites security reasons for his immigration crackdown and says he is fighting against what he calls " anti-American views ."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:23:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C7UWJIU6UBM2NFWPF5YE3P6K5Y.jpg?auth=e74742a3793792d276355eff227ac5154d72aa1a955ef302f696dedcc1cfbe1e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German Foreign Minister Wadephul says there is more consensus than disagreement with the US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/german-foreign-minister-wadephul-says-there-is-more-consensus-than-disagreement-2026-01-13/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Tuesday that there is more consensus than disagreement with the United States.

"I am really returning calm, but also with the feeling that it is good to remain in close exchange in the future," he said ahead of his return to Berlin following two days of meetings in the U.S.

Wadephul's comments came amid increasing tensions over Washington's aims toward Greenland, an autonomous region of Denmark which U.S. President Donald Trump says is vital for U.S. security.

Wadephul reiterated that Greenland and Denmark should decide the future of the island.

"Questions of sovereignty over the territory of the Kingdom of Denmark will be decided by Denmark, by no one else," he said.

The U.S. military and Coast Guard have seized five vessels in recent weeks in international waters that were either carrying Venezuelan oil or have done so in the past. The seizures were part of Washington's campaign to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power that culminated in U.S. forces capturing him on January 3.

Since then, the administration of President Donald Trump has said it plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry.

Trump imposed a blockade to prevent sanctioned tankers from shipping Venezuelan oil in December that brought exports close to a standstill. Shipments have resumed this week under U.S. supervision.

The U.S. government has filed multiple civil forfeiture actions in district courts, primarily in Washington, D.C., enabling the seizure and confiscation of oil cargoes and ships that have been involved in the trade, the sources told Reuters. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

The exact number of seizure warrants the U.S. has filed for, and how many it has already received, is unclear, the sources said, because the filings and legal orders are not public. Dozens have been filed, they added.

The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The vessels already intercepted were either under U.S. sanctions or part of a "shadow fleet" of unregulated ships that disguise their origins to move oil from key sanctioned producers Iran, Russia or Venezuela.

There are still many tankers at sea carrying Venezuelan crude to top buyer China, or that have previously done so. The U.S. has imposed sanctions on many of those vessels for facilitating oil trade with Venezuela or Iran.

SEIZURES PAUSED SINCE FRIDAY: SOURCES

There has been a pause in U.S. action to seize vessels since Friday, the sources said. Action could resume against vessels and cargoes not authorized by the U.S., they said.

The Department of Defense, together with other U.S. agencies, would "hunt down and interdict ALL dark fleet vessels transporting Venezuelan oil at the time and place of our choosing", Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said on Friday on X , opens new tab .

The United States has targeted both the vessels and the cargoes on them in recent seizures. That is an escalation from previous seizures of Iranian cargoes between 2020 and 2023, shipping industry sources said. In those earlier cases, U.S. law enforcers confiscated the oil cargo but not the vessel itself.

The Department of Justice was "monitoring several other vessels for similar enforcement action", U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social media on January 7, after the seizure of the Bella-1 tanker, which was empty of any cargo and the first time in recent memory that the U.S. military has seized a Russian-flagged vessel.

Russia, like Venezuela, relies on the shadow fleet to carry oil that is under sanctions.

Russia's Foreign Ministry described the action as "the illegal use of force" , opens new tab by the U.S. military, adding that the application of U.S. sanctions was "without legal foundation."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:23:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/54K3SJSKLZP5TBYLYSN76V3DCM.jpg?auth=50d187a2add5554c94082e6489027472c3b1422ad4a03a46707f7577a1fc7d69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge suggests visa for college student deported mistakenly to Honduras</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-suggests-visa-college-student-deported-mistakenly-honduras-2026-01-13/</link><description>BOSTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to resolve a "bureaucratic mess" by issuing a student visa to a college student who was deported to Honduras after being arrested at Boston's airport while trying to visit her family for Thanksgiving.

U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns during a hearing in Boston raised that prospect as a "practical solution" to how to resolve a lawsuit by Any Lucia Lopez Belloza, a 19-year-old student at Babson College who was sent to Honduras in violation of a court order.

Lopez Belloza, who was brought to the U.S. from Honduras by her parents when she was 8, was arrested on November 20 based on a removal order she says she did not know existed.

Her lawyer filed a lawsuit challenging her detention the next day.

A federal judge in Massachusetts issued an order on November 21 barring Lopez Belloza from being deported or transferred out of Massachusetts for 72 hours.

But by that time, Lopez Belloza had already been flown to Texas, potentially stripping Stearns' court of jurisdiction. She was flown to Honduras on November 22.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Sauter acknowledged the court's order was violated, a development he blamed on a "mistake" by an officer with Immigration and Customs Enforcement who thought the order no longer applied and failed to properly flag it.

"On behalf of the government, we want to sincerely apologize," Sauter said.

He said there were no grounds to hold anyone in contempt, however. He called it a rare instance of the government not following an order in the over 700 cases filed in Massachusetts by migrants challenging their detention since President Donald Trump took office last year with a hardline immigration agenda.

Stearns, who was appointed by Democratic President Bill Clinton, commended Sauter for acknowledging the mistake and asked what the remedy should be, saying "we don't want to lose sight that we have a real human being here."

Todd Pomerleau, Lopez Belloza's lawyer, urged Stearns to order the government to facilitate the return of his client and to hold officials in contempt.

"The rule of law ought to matter," Pomerleau said.

Stearns did not immediately rule. But he floated an alternative, recommending the State Department issue Lopez Belloza a student visa allowing her to finish her studies.

"We all recognize a mistake was made," Stearns said. "She's a very sympathetic person, and there should be some means to addressing this."</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:24:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D3OGZCMKARIZ7PG2HEFABSQ26U.jpg?auth=3a2cec9f2bca19e74d0fb1ab340c95c2d3f41f37761be69c35405b09a2c360cf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US will take 'very strong action' if Iran hangs protesters, Trump tells CBS News</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-will-take-very-strong-action-if-iran-hangs-protesters-trump-tells-cbs-news-2026-01-13/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States would take "very strong action" if the Iranian government starts hanging protesters, but did not elaborate on what those actions would be.

Rights groups have said that the number of releases ranges between 60 and 70, while complaining about the slow pace and lack of information. On Monday, Venezuela's penitentiary authority said that 116 people had been freed from prison.

Foro Penal, a leading local NGO that works on legal support for detainees, said at least 800 political prisoners were behind bars at the beginning of the year.

The government says it does not hold political prisoners and that those arrested have been charged with legitimate crimes.

Opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who is expected to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, has been one of the leading voices demanding the release of prisoners, some of whom are her close allies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 Jan 2026 22:24:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CK5UVW6Q2RMRZE2DVMN5JILCDQ.jpg?auth=e8625d140615543ac7cf9f65c3b9bf6cd0139a17d03a41b509c1997a58c2a175&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi mulls Feb 8 snap election, Yomiuri reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichi-mulls-feb-8-snap-election-yomiuri-reports-2026-01-13/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi is considering calling a snap lower house election on February 8 after dissolving the house next week, the Yomiuri newspaper reported on Wednesday.

In a short video posted on the Japanese Prime Minister's office Youtube channel on Wednesday morning, the two leaders played the drums to global hits from the likes of BTS and Kpop Demon Hunters.

Takaichi, a keen drummer and fan of heavy metal, complemented Lee's new found chops.

"The president learned to play the drums in just 5, 10 minutes," she said in the video.

"Although our tempos were a bit different, we both tried to match the rhythm together - we will create a future-oriented relationship with one heart," Lee posted on X on Wednesday morning.

While ties between Tokyo and Seoul have often been strained in the past, Takaichi and Lee have forged a friendlier relationship and on Wednesday morning the two also visited Horyuji Temple in Nara, Takaichi's hometown.

In statements on Tuesday, Takaichi and Lee said they aimed to deepen security and economic ties in the face of growing tensions in East Asia and to continue "shuttle diplomacy", with Takaichi next due to visit South Korea.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:50:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R6VBNXUEZBLFBHG3PNCCAI73MQ.jpg?auth=2343ae3e544feef01f210f6f06b9bb5e327d3b3fe8040e353f411b5d9026df50&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone attack forces power cuts in Ukraine's Kryvyi Rih, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-drone-attack-forces-power-cuts-ukraines-kryvyi-rih-military-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russian drones struck infrastructure in the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih on Wednesday, forcing emergency power blackouts for more than 45,000 customers and disrupting heat supplies, military administration head Oleksandr Vilkul said.

"Please fill up on water and charge your devices, if you have the chance. It's going to be difficult," Vilkul said on the Telegram messaging app.

Water utility pumping stations switched to generators and water remained in the system, but there could be pressure problems.

The full scale of the attack was not immediately known. There was no comment from Russia about the strike.

Russia has repeatedly struck Ukraine’s power plants, substations and transmission lines with missiles and drones, seeking to knock out electricity and heating and hinder industry during the nearly four-year war .

Kyiv says the campaign has forced rolling outages and emergency cuts to cities across the country, as repair crews work under fire and Ukraine relies on air defences and electricity imports to stabilise the grid.

Kryvyi Rih, a steel-and-mining hub in the Dnipropetrovsk region and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy’s hometown, has been hit repeatedly , with strikes killing civilians and damaging homes and industry.

The city sits close enough to southern front lines to be within strike range, while its factories, logistics links and workforce make it economically important and a key rear-area centre supporting Ukraine’s war effort.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:52:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone attack forces power cuts in Ukraine's Kryvyi Rih, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-drone-attack-forces-power-cuts-ukraines-kryvyi-rih-military-says-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:52:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US civil rights pioneer Claudette Colvin dies at 86</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260113-claudette-colvin-us-civil-rights-pioneer-dead</link><description>Claudette Colvin, who refused to give up her seat on a segregated bus in Alabama in 1955 and became a US civil rights pioneer, has died aged 86, her foundation said Tuesday.

Colvin, then aged 15, made her protest several months before Rosa Parks' similar act of defiance became a key moment in the birth of the modern civil rights movement in the United States.

Colvin "leaves behind a legacy of courage that helped change the course of American history," her foundation said.

Colvin had been studying Black history in school on March 2, 1955, when she was detained after she refused to give up her seat to a white woman on a bus in Montgomery -- the same southern US city where Parks' protest made headlines.

"I remained seated because the lady could have sat in the seat opposite me," Colvin told reporters in Paris in April 2023.

"She refused because...a white person wasn't supposed to sit close to a negro."

"People ask me why I refused to move, and I say history had me glued to the seat," Colvin said.

Colvin was briefly imprisoned for disturbing public order. The following year, she became one of four Black female plaintiffs who filed a lawsuit challenging segregated bus seating in Montgomery.

The case was successful, impacting public transportation throughout the United States, including trains, airplanes and taxis.

Colvin's role in the US civil rights movement was less celebrated than that of Parks, who was already a key figure in the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) at the time of her arrest.

Parks' arrest triggered a year-long bus boycott in Montgomery that thrust civil rights leader Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to national prominence.

The civil rights movement led to significant advances for Black people in the mid-1960s -- ending legal segregation and securing their voting rights.

Colvin, who was born in Alabama in 1939 as the eldest of eight sisters, would be ostracized from the civil rights movement when she became pregnant out of wedlock.

She spent decades in obscurity, working for 30 years at a Catholic nursing home, caring for elderly patients as a nursing assistant.

But she won recognition later in life.

A 2009 biography by Phillip Hoose, "Claudette Colvin: Twice Toward Justice," won the US National Book Award for young people's literature.

However, it was only in 2021 that the record of her 1955 arrest and adjudication of delinquency was expunged by a US court.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:53:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1bac3fd6-f0d0-11f0-babc-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP21299826050638.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda shuts down internet ahead of election</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uganda-shuts-down-internet-ahead-of-election</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 01:53:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/763f2636-f0c4-11f0-a569-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260113-2141-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's foreign minister to urge NATO to focus on Arctic in Finland and Norway visit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uks-foreign-minister-urge-nato-focus-arctic-finland-norway-visit-2026-01-14/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Britain's foreign minister will visit Finland and Norway on Wednesday, where she will call for NATO to step up its work in the Arctic to safeguard regional interests against Russia.

Yvette Cooper's Arctic Circle tour follows renewed threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to take over Greenland, an autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark. The Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers will meet U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday.

Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said he stands with Denmark in its defence of Greenland.

Cooper's trip will focus on Russia, which the foreign office described in a statement as the "greatest threat" to Arctic security.

In Finland, Cooper will meet border guards defending NATO's eastern flank with Russia, while in Norway she will visit marines taking part in a live training exercise.

The high north, which includes Greenland, is home to key shipping routes and critical infrastructure such as undersea cables, making the region vital to Britain's security, the foreign office said.

"The UK and Norway share a determination to ensure Russia does not succeed in its illegal war of aggression," the foreign office said, adding that Russia posed a threat through its military activity, risks to undersea infrastructure and the use of its "shadow fleet".

Britain last week provided support to the U.S. in its operation to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker in the North Atlantic.

"Arctic security is critical to protecting Britain and NATO," Cooper said, urging the military alliance to enhance efforts to defend Euro-Atlantic interests against "hostile states who seek to meddle" in the high north.

"Coming together as an alliance allows us to unify and tackle this emerging threat," she added, noting that climate change has opened new shipping routes, exposed valuable resources, and turned the region into a "hotspot" for geopolitical competition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:48:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZCR74S76FMHDHVT7Q5RZRWYGQ.jpg?auth=53d75e2b1c894f0a68071b2c0531c282b9176f5d4aa9d7b33cb9fe1c9b5e0aa7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraqi officials arrest man wanted by Australian police as 'number one priority'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/iraqi-officials-arrest-man-wanted-by-australian-police-number-one-priority-2026-01-14/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Iraqi officials have arrested a man wanted by Australian Federal Police as a person of interest in the investigation into a spate of firebombings, including an antisemitic attack on a Melbourne synagogue, police said on Wednesday.

Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said the arrested man, Kazem Hamad, was a threat to national security and that she had identified him as her "Number One priority".

Iraq's National Center for International Judicial Cooperation said in a statement that Kadhim Malik Hamad Rabah al-Hajami had been arrested as part of a drugs investigation, after a request from Australia.

Barrett said Iraqi officials had made an independent decision to arrest the man in their own criminal investigation, after Australian Federal Police provided information to Iraqi law enforcement late last year.

"This arrest is a significant disruption to an alleged serious criminal and his alleged criminal enterprise in Australia," she said in a statement.

In October, Barrett said that in addition to being a suspect in arson attacks in Australia linked to the tobacco trade, the man was "a person of interest in the investigation into the alleged politically-motivated arson attack on the Adass Israel Synagogue" in Melbourne

Australia expelled Iran's ambassador in August after the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation traced the funding of hooded criminals who allegedly set fire to the Melbourne synagogue in December 2024 to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

Hamad, previously convicted in Australia for drug trafficking offences, was deported from Australia to Iraq in 2023.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:48:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>2025 was the world's third-warmest year on record, EU scientists say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/2025-was-worlds-third-warmest-year-record-eu-scientists-say-2026-01-14/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The planet experienced its third-warmest year on record in 2025, and average temperatures have exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming over three years, the longest period since records began, EU scientists said on Wednesday.

The data from the European Union's European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) found that the last three years were the planet's three hottest since records began - with 2025 marginally cooler than 2023, by just 0.01 C.

Britain's national weather service, the UK Met Office, confirmed its own data ranked 2025 as the third-warmest in records going back to 1850. The World Meteorological Organization will publish its temperature figures later on Wednesday.

The hottest year on record was 2024.

ECMWF said the planet also just had its first three-year period in which the average global temperature was 1.5 C above the pre-industrial era - the limit beyond which scientists expect global warming will unleash severe impacts, some of them irreversible.

"1.5 C is not a cliff edge. However, we know that every fraction of a degree matters, particularly for worsening extreme weather events," said Samantha Burgess, strategic lead for climate at ECMWF.

Governments pledged under the 2015 Paris Agreement to try to avoid exceeding 1.5 C of global warming, measured as a decades-long average temperature compared with the pre-industrial era.

But their failure to reduce greenhouse gas emissions means that level could now be breached before 2030 - a decade earlier than had been predicted when the Paris accord was signed in 2015, ECMWF said.

"We are bound to pass it," said Carlo Buontempo, director of the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service. "The choice we now have is how to best manage the inevitable overshoot and its consequences on societies and natural systems."

Currently, the world's long-term warming level is about 1.4 C above the pre-industrial era, ECMWF said. Measured on a short-term basis, the world already breached 1.5 C in 2024.

Exceeding the long-term 1.5 C limit - even if only temporarily - would lead to more extreme and widespread impacts, including hotter and longer heatwaves, and more powerful storms and floods.

In 2025, wildfires in Europe produced the highest total emissions on record, while scientific studies confirmed specific weather events were made worse by climate change - including Hurricane Melissa in the Caribbean and monsoon rains in Pakistan which killed more than 1,000 people in floods.

Despite these worsening impacts, climate science is facing increased political pushback. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called climate change "the greatest con job ", last week withdrew from dozens of U.N. entities including the scientific Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .

The long-established consensus among the world's scientists is that climate change is real, mostly caused by humans, and getting worse. Its main cause is greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas, which trap heat in the atmosphere.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:48:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LY63PDKSE5JXBB7DIZ2HURKFVQ.jpg?auth=5d3efaf92fd189db5b53ff1e165a49665af93a452d6b2a422eebe641dfbee448&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan will not comment on BOJ's absence in joint Powell statement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-will-not-comment-bojs-absence-joint-powell-statement-2026-01-14/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Japan declined on Wednesday to comment on the ​Bank of Japan's absence from a statement by ‌other central banks supporting U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, following the Trump administration's threat of criminal indictment.

Although she remained a largely unsung figure in the civil rights movement for decades, Colvin's 1955 act of rebellion inspired Parks and others and helped form the basis for the federal lawsuit that outlawed racial segregation in U.S. public transportation.

Her death, under hospice care in Texas, was confirmed by Ashley Roseboro, a spokesperson for her family and the Claudette Colvin Foundation.

In one of the first publicized acts of civil disobedience against Montgomery's Jim Crow rules governing city bus seating by race, Colvin refused to relinquish her seat for a white woman, as ordered by the driver, and stayed put until she was dragged off the bus by police.

According to accounts of her testimony in court, Colvin recalled she had been studying anti-slavery abolitionist heroes in school, and felt that she had Harriet Tubman on one shoulder, Sojourner Truth on the other, and "history had me glued to the seat."

But Parks, an older seamstress who was secretary of the local NAACP chapter, was seen as a more dignified, sympathetic figure to rally behind as civil rights leaders organized what became the year-long bus boycott that thrust the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the national stage.

In the lead-up to the boycott, which started in December 1955, issues of social class and even "colorism" - Colvin came from a poorer background and was lighter skinned than Parks - led civil rights leaders to shy away from the teenager as a standard bearer for the movement, according to Roseboro.

About a year after her arrest, she also became pregnant by a married man from an encounter that she later described as statutory rape.

Nevertheless, Colvin went on to become one of several plaintiffs and a principal witness in the Browder v. Gayle lawsuit challenging the city's Jim Crow bus policies. The case eventually led to the landmark 1956 U.S. Supreme Court decision banning segregation in public transit as unconstitutional.

Colvin lived in obscurity for decades afterward, working as a caregiver and nurse's aide and struggling as a single mother, though historians and others have since brought to light the pivotal role she played in the early civil rights movement.

Fred Gray, the attorney behind Browder v. Gayle, credited Colvin with helping to ignite the battle against segregation in the Deep South.

"I don't mean to take anything away from Mrs. Parks, but Claudette gave all of us the moral courage to do what we did," the Washington Post quoted Gray as saying.

In recent years, Colvin succeeded in having her juvenile arrest record expunged, Roseboro said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:49:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AJOTTZ37DFJFFEF3Q74KVJDEJA.jpg?auth=fc2aac3ff81f3c174cead7628f12d54054642369c80c52e2be1476f5611b6fe4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brunei sultan to undergo knee replacement surgery</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/brunei-sultan-undergo-knee-replacement-surgery-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Brunei's ruler Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah will undergo knee replacement surgery this weekend, with a recovery period expected to last between two to three months, his office said.

The 79-year-old sultan, one of the world's longest-reigning monarchs, will be limiting his presence at national and official ceremonies during the recovery process for rest and physiotherapy sessions, the office said in a statement on Tuesday.

"However, His Majesty will continue to carry out official duties during the period," it said, adding the surgery would take place in Brunei on Sunday.

The sultan, who ascended the throne in 1967, holds multiple roles in Brunei, serving also as its prime minister, armed forces commander, finance minister, foreign minister and defense minister.

Once the world's wealthiest man, the sultan remains hugely popular in the tiny, oil-rich nation on the island of Borneo, despite holding a firm grip on power in the country of nearly half a million people.

He was briefly hospitalised in Malaysia in May last year due to fatigue during a summit of Southeast Asian leaders in Kuala Lumpur.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:49:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3ASB5UZZQJLRVMBQZWSXOF7C7U.jpg?auth=32b738a88b279f7ee26561abf1d36dbaa41f483352517f271de5efd524fa27a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran says US seeking 'pretext for military intervention'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260114-live-iran-says-us-seeking-pretext-for-military-intervention</link><description>Iran 's government on Tuesday accused the United States of seeking to manufacture a pretext for military intervention, after US President Donald Trump threatened "strong action" over the deadly crackdown on mass protests.

"US fantasies and policy toward Iran are rooted in regime change, with sanctions, threats, engineered unrest, and chaos serving as the modus operandi to manufacture a pretext for military intervention," Iran 's UN mission posted on X, vowing that Washington's "playbook" would "fail again."

Iranian state media has aired at least 97 confessions from protesters, many expressing remorse for their actions, since the protests began on Dec. 28, according to a rights group that is tracking the videos.

The US.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency says that based on testimony from prior detainees, the confessions often come after psychological or physical torture — and can have serious consequences, including the death penalty.

In a statement published in a state newspaper it called on the International Court of Justice, which began hearings in The Hague on Monday, to "reach its judgement based on fact and settled law strictly within the framework of the Genocide Convention".

ICJ judges are hearing three weeks of testimony as they weigh accusations by The Gambia that Myanmar committed genocide against the Rohingya in a 2017 crackdown.

Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims fled violence by the Myanmar army and Buddhist militias, escaping to neighbouring Bangladesh and bringing harrowing accounts of mass rape, arson and murder.

On the first day of the hearings Gambia's justice minister Dawda Jallow told the court the Rohingya "have been targeted for destruction".

Lawyers for Myanmar will begin their court response on Friday.

The allegations made by The Gambia are flawed and unfounded in fact and law," said the Yangon foreign ministry statement.

"Biased reports, based on unreliable evidence, cannot make up for truth."

The country -- ruled by a military junta since a coup in 2021 -- was co-operating with the ICJ "in good faith" in a sign of its respect for international law, it added.

The statement did not use the word Rohingya, referring instead to "persons from Rakhine state".

Today, 1.17 million Rohingya live crammed into dilapidated camps spread over 8,000 acres in Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh.

Myanmar has always maintained the crackdown by its armed forces was justified to root out Rohingya insurgents after a series of attacks left a dozen security personnel dead.

A final decision could take months or even years, and while the ICJ has no means of enforcing its decisions, a ruling in favour of The Gambia would heap more political pressure on Myanmar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 03:49:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cd528310-f0eb-11f0-9608-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25295489165312.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine drone attack sparks industrial fire in Russia's Rostov-on-Don, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-drone-attack-sparks-industrial-fire-russias-rostov-on-don-officials-say-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian drone attack overnight caused two fires at an industrial facility, injured four people and damaged apartment buildings in the southern Russian port of Rostov-on-Don, regional officials said on Wednesday.

Yuri Slyusar, governor of Russia’s Rostov region, said four people, including a four-year-old child, were injured when falling debris from downed drones damaged their apartments. Rostov-on-Don is the Rostov region's administrative centre.

All of the injured people were hospitalised, Slyusar said on the Telegram messaging app.

He would not say what industrial facility was on fire, adding that by early Wednesday morning, one of the fires was extinguished and the other contained.

Aleksandr Skryabin, the mayor of Rostov-on-Don, said temporary accommodation was arranged for the families from the damaged apartments.

The full-scale impact of the attack was not immediately known. There was no comment from Ukraine about the strike.

Ukraine has used drones to strike targets inside Russia, saying such attacks seek to degrade Moscow’s military and energy infrastructure and respond to Russia’s continued strikes on Ukrainian cities during the war that Moscow launched nearly four years ago.

Rostov-on-Don, a major transport and logistics hub near Ukraine, hosts key military headquarters and routes used to supply Russian forces, making it a strategic rear-area centre for Moscow’s operations and a target for drones.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 04:48:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Far-right group targeting pro-Palestinian voices to close New York operation, NY AG says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/far-right-group-targeting-pro-palestinian-voices-close-new-york-operation-ny-ag-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 13 (Reuters) - New York Attorney General Letitia James' office said on Tuesday it reached a settlement , opens new tab with Betar US that would wind down the far-right Zionist group's New York operations after an investigation found the group intimidated pro-Palestinian activists.

After President Donald Trump took office last year and signed executive orders targeting pro-Palestinian protesters , opens new tab and activists, Betar said it provided names of international students and faculty to the Trump administration for deportation . Trump's deportation attempts have faced legal setbacks.

After investigating Betar, the New York attorney general's office found the group "repeatedly targeted individuals based on religion and national origin," it said in a statement. Betar has been labeled an extremist group by the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish advocacy organization.

"The settlement requires Betar to immediately cease instigating or encouraging violence against individuals, threatening protesters, and harassing individuals exercising their civil rights, and subjects the organization to a suspended $50,000 penalty that will be enforced if Betar violates the agreement," James' office said.

It added that Betar was seeking to dissolve its not-for-profit corporation and had indicated that it was winding down operations in New York.

In a statement, Betar denied wrongdoing and said it aimed to quash antisemitism. Betar calls itself a part of a militant Zionist group, which was founded a century ago in Europe. Its website says it was "reborn in the summer of 2024" and is headquartered in Israel.

Protests erupted at campuses in the U.S. after Israel began its assault on Gaza following Hamas' October 2023 attack on Israel , a key U.S. ally.

Trump attempted to deport foreign protesters, alleging they were antisemitic and sympathetic to extremism. Rights advocates raised free speech and due process concerns.

Protesters, including some Jewish groups, say their criticism of Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and support for Palestinian rights should not be equated with antisemitism and support for extremism.

Israel's assault on Gaza since late 2023 has killed tens of thousands, caused a hunger crisis and internally displaced Gaza's entire population. Multiple rights experts , scholars and a U.N. inquiry say it amounts to genocide. Israel has said it took action in self-defense after Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 hostage in their 2023 attack.

Rights advocates note rising antisemitism and Islamophobia since the start of the war in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 04:48:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ODJPFSJIHNLUJIXM5BFRTZUJF4.jpg?auth=61f38d0ae7b3117de9f252b3ddd6bbf0b916b5486be653706d1ed134d782ae1c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela frees several Americans from prison, US official says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260114-venezuela-americans-prison-us</link><description>Venezuela on Tuesday started freeing jailed Americans, said a US official, who hailed the move by the country's interim leadership following Washington's ouster of ex-president Nicolas Maduro.

The official did not immediately provide details on the release of prisoners or say how many were being freed, other than that there was more than one.

"We welcome the release of detained Americans in Venezuela. This is an important step in the right direction by the interim authorities," a State Department official said on condition of anonymity.

Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro's vice president who has become acting president, ordered the release of prisoners in the wake of the US attack.

US President Donald Trump hailed the gesture, saying that his response was to call off a second wave of strikes on Venezuela.

Many were jailed for taking part in protests over 2024 elections, in which Maduro was declared the victor despite widespread allegations of vote-rigging.

Venezuela earlier freed Spanish and Italian citizens from its jails.

The United States has long made freeing its nationals overseas a major priority, and secured freedom for some in a deal with Maduro last year.

Domestically, Venezuelans regained one freedom on Tuesday -- the ability to post on social media platform X.

The social network was once again accessible, more than a year after users were blocked by deposed president Maduro.

Rodriguez updated her profile's bio -- she served as vice president under Maduro -- and wrote: "Let us stay united, moving toward economic stability, social justice, and the welfare state we deserve to aspire to."

Access remained spotty to the social media network owned by billionaire Elon Musk, who engaged in heated online exchanges with the ousted Venezuelan leader, until Maduro lashed out in retaliation for criticism of his contested 2024 election and shut X down.

After the July 2024 election, Maduro was declared the winner amid allegations of fraud and suspended the platform in August.

Prior to that, X had been a prominent social media network for Venezuelans, but the blockade meant ministers, lawmakers and government institutions stopped updating their pages.

Rodriguez assumed power after Maduro was captured by US military forces on January 3 along with his wife, during attacks that left more than 100 dead, according to official figures.

The couple faces US charges of alleged drug trafficking.

Maduro's X account was also updated with a photo of the deposed leader and his wife, Cilia Flores.

"We want you back," the post reads.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 04:50:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0fab4f4c-eeeb-11f0-8c64-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/FOTO-PORTADA-VENEZUELA-FAMILIARES-PRESOS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>2025 was third hottest year on record, climate experts see no relief in 2026</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/environment/20260114-2025-third-hottest-year-climate-2026</link><description>The planet logged its third hottest year on record in 2025, extending a run of unprecedented heat, with no relief expected in 2026, US researchers and EU climate monitors said Wednesday.

The last 11 years have now been the warmest ever recorded, with 2024 topping the podium and 2023 in second place, according to the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service and Berkeley Earth, a California-based non-profit research organisation.

For the first time, global temperatures exceeded 1.5C relative to pre-industrial times on average over the last three years, Copernicus said in its annual report.

"The warming spike observed from 2023-2025 has been extreme, and suggests an acceleration in the rate of the Earth's warming," Berkeley Earth said in a separate report.

The landmark 2015 Paris Agreemen t commits the world to limiting warming to well below 2C and pursuing efforts to hold it at 1.5C -- a long-term target scientists say would help avoid the worst consequences of climate change.

UN chief Antonio Guterres warned in October that breaching 1.5C was "inevitable" but the world could limit this period of overshoot by cutting greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.

Copernicus said the 1.5C limit "could be reached by the end of this decade -- over a decade earlier than predicted".

But efforts to contain global warming were dealt another setback last week as President Donald Trump said he would pull the United States -- the world's second-biggest polluter after China -- out of the bedrock UN climate treaty.

Temperatures were 1.47C above pre-industrial times in 2025 -- just a fraction cooler than in 2023 -- following 1.6C in 2024, according to the EU climate monitor.

Some 770 million people experienced record-warm annual conditions where they live, while no record-cold annual average was logged anywhere, according to Berkeley Earth.

The Antarctic experienced its warmest year on record while it was the second hottest in the Arctic, Copernicus said.

An AFP analysis of Copernicus data last month found that Central Asia, the Sahel region and northern Europe experienced their hottest year on record in 2025.

Berkeley and Copernicus both warned that 2026 would not break the trend.

If the warming El Nino weather phenomenon appears this year, "this could make 2026 another record-breaking year", Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, told AFP.

"Temperatures are going up. So we are bound to see new records. Whether it will be 2026, 2027, 2028 doesn't matter too much. The direction of travel is very, very clear," Buontempo said.

Berkeley Earth said it expected this year to be similar to 2025, "with the most likely outcome being approximately the fourth-warmest year since 1850".

The reports come as efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions -- the main driver of climate change -- are stalling in developed countries.

Emissions rose in the United States last year, snapping a two-year streak of declines, as bitter winters and the AI boom fuelled demand for energy, the Rhodium Group think tank said Tuesday.

The pace of reductions of greenhouse gas emissions slowed in Germany and France.

"While greenhouse gas emissions remain the dominant driver of global warming, the magnitude of this recent spike suggests additional factors have amplified recent warming beyond what we would expect from greenhouse gases and natural variability alone," said Berkeley Earth chief scientist Robert Rohde.

The organisation said international rules cutting sulfur in ship fuel since 2020 may have actually added to warming by reducing sulfur dioxide emissions, which form aerosols that reflect sunlight away from Earth.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 04:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ddd3561a-f0fa-11f0-866e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/4f842d5a71c78c44ee553b6c15b49cfa1133aed4.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 12 killed after crane falls on train in Thailand's northeast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/least-five-killed-after-crane-falls-train-thailands-northeast-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - A train traveling from Thailand's capital to the country's northeast was derailed on Wednesday after a construction crane fell on top of one of its carriages, killing at least 12 people and injuring at least 30, police said.

The Trump administration threatened Powell with a criminal indictment after a probe into the renovation of the Fed's headquarters but Powell called it ​a "pretext" to win ‍presidential influence over interest rates.

Reserve Bank of New Zealand Governor Anna Breman joined top central bankers in Europe, England, Canada and Australia in signing a statement "in full solidarity with the Federal Reserve System and its Chair Jerome H. Powell."

The statement said Powell had acted with integrity and central bank independence was crucial for keeping prices and financial markets stable.

A RBNZ spokesperson said Breman had signed the statement because she believed strongly in the independence of central banks and that her signature indicated the support of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, which is statutorily independent of the New Zealand government.

However, the decision to do so was criticised by Peters, who said in a post on X that "the RBNZ has no role, nor should it involve itself, in U.S. domestic politics. We remind the Governor to stay in her New Zealand lane and stick to domestic monetary policy."

Peters' post said that if advice on signing on to the statement had been sought from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, she would have been told to stick to domestic monetary policy.

An RBNZ spokesperson declined to comment on Peters' post.

Swedish economist Breman started as New Zealand's central bank governor on December 1, 2025, with her appointment following a challenging time for the bank.

Previous RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr suddenly resigned early in 2025 due to disagreements over proposed government cuts to the central bank's budget. This was then followed by the resignation of RBNZ Chair Neil Quigley over his handling of Orr's surprise departure and concerns around transparency.

New Zealand, which is not a formal ally of the U.S. but is a close friend, has managed its relationship with the U.S. carefully in recent years and Peters has spoken about the need to respect the United States.

"Close friends do not need to be, and should not be, confrontational and rude with one another, as New Zealand sometimes was towards the United States in the mid-to-late 1980s. And we should never forget what binds and unites us, bonds stronger and more long-lasting than the controversies and headlines of the moment," Peters said in a speech last April.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 05:27:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ILCW3RKJTBPUXPSW4ZSWVHOZKE.jpg?auth=a3d02212cdf2afb579eb6d4aa3acc5da959066ab76fb0a58abf3ee17808d57d4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll rises to 19 in Thailand with 80 injured after crane collapses on train, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-rises-19-thailand-with-80-injured-after-crane-collapses-train-police-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The death toll from a train derailure following the collapse of a crane in northeastern Thailand rose to 19 on Wednesday, with about 80 people injured, police said.

Up to 4,000 Cambodian families are unable to return to homes along the disputed frontier because of the Thai incursions, Prak Sokhonn told Reuters, despite a December agreement that halted weeks of fierce border clashes.

"The Thai military is still occupying territories well inside Cambodia," he said on Tuesday in a rare interview from Phnom Penh, the capital, listing at least four border locations as incursion sites.

"The situation remains calm, but there are some risks as well. So we hope that Thailand will remain committed to the full implementation of the ceasefire."

In response to questions from Reuters, Thai military and government officials referred to a January 12 statement by Thailand's foreign ministry that dismissed Cambodia's accusations as "baseless".

"The maintenance of current troop positions following the ceasefire constitutes direct compliance with agreed de-escalation measures," the Thai ministry said. "This cannot be misconstrued as territorial occupation."

With fighter jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages, the two neighbours battled for 20 days in December, following a July round of clashes that ended after calls by U.S. President Donald Trump .

The December fighting killed 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides, in the latest flare-up of a century-old dispute between the countries that has occasionally exploded into conflict.

In recent weeks, Cambodia has asked Thailand for a meeting of the Joint Boundary Commission, a two-way effort to demarcate the border, but Bangkok has not confirmed its participation, according to Prak Sokhonn.

"The occupied village (issue) will be a priority for us because we need to solve those problems in order to allow our people to go back home," he said.

Thailand's foreign ministry said it was finalising internal procedures for the talks, which would happen after a new government takes office following a February 8 election.

"The Thai side reiterates its full commitment to resolving differences through bilateral mechanisms and intends to resume JBC activities at the earliest," it added.

Besides an understanding not to beef up troops on both sides of the border, the December 27 truce also agreed on the return of displaced civilians .

"The two waves of fighting have caused a lot of damage, to both civilian life and infrastructure," Prak Sokhonn added, destroying bridges, schools, pagodas, roads, and buildings.

Although Trump was instrumental in halting the July clashes and then oversaw the signing of a wider ceasefire deal in October, his calls proved unsuccessful in immediately ending the second bout of fighting.

Besides efforts by Trump and Malaysian premier Anwar Ibrahim, Prak Sokhonn also outlined China's involvement in the latest truce, such as key visits by a special envoy to Bangkok and Phnom Penh in late December.

"He met our prime minister, our defence minister, myself," he said, also outlining similar meetings on the Thai side.

"So it was a very, let's say, active contribution from China."

Two days after the latest ceasefire, the top diplomats of China, Thailand and Cambodia met in the southwestern Chinese province of Yunnan, where the combatants agreed to rebuild mutual trust.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:36:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZV3UWIZN7JKY5EAZFDLCLFXQZU.jpg?auth=1153b89ba06fa4c432b65a49332f4020be67b859e2bfdde90207ad198ca75ec2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cambodia to keep up crackdown on scam centres after arrest of alleged mastermind</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/cambodia-keep-up-crackdown-scam-centres-after-arrest-alleged-mastermind-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - Cambodia's arrest of alleged scam centre kingpin Chen Zhi and his extradition to China was "not the end" of the Southeast Asian nation's battle to stamp out trans-border crimes, its foreign minister said.

Last week's surprise arrest of Chinese-born Chen is a key step in an until now fragmented international campaign targeting sophisticated scam networks in Southeast Asia run by criminal gangs, swindling victims worldwide out of billions of dollars.

The extradition of Chen, sanctioned by several countries and indicted by the United States for wire fraud and money laundering, followed a joint investigation by China and Cambodia, details of which have not been made public.

"It's a continued combat, and we have set measures and steps in order to eradicate this crime," Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn said in a rare interview from Phnom Penh, the capital.

Cambodia has always been determined to crack down on transnational crimes, especially crimes employing new technology, such as online scam organisations, he told Reuters.

"The fact that Chen Xi was arrested and extradited to China is just reflecting this firm commitment of Cambodia to combat the crime. And it's not the end of the combat."

He gave no details of the investigation into Chen but said full cooperation with Beijing had started months ago.

Chen, an enigmatic billionaire in his late 30s, heads the Prince Group conglomerate, based out of Cambodia with scores of ostensibly legitimate businesses worldwide.

But U.S. authorities have said those were fronts for "one of the largest investment fraud operations in history".

Last year, Prince Group rejected as baseless the accusations against Chen.

Hong Kong , Singapore and Taiwan have frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in assets linked to Prince Group, while Britain and South Korea have imposed sanctions.

Last year, U.S. prosecutors seized about $15 billion in bitcoin linked to Chen and Cambodia has liquidated the Prince Bank he founded.

It is not clear what Chen will be charged with in China, which set up a special task force in 2020 to investigate Prince Group, Chinese court documents dating to 2022 showed.

Last week, China's state broadcaster showed video of Chen arriving in Beijing handcuffed and hooded .

It said Chen was wanted for fraud and running illegal casinos and described him as the "leader of a major transnational gambling and fraud crime syndicate".

The scams, operated from vast compounds in countries such as Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos, involve tens of thousands of workers.

Among them are human trafficking victims lured by promises of jobs in industries such as technology and hospitality, forced to cheat strangers online or face brutal punishment.

Cambodia has "very close cooperation" on transnational crime with countries such as the United States, China, South Korea and neighbours Vietnam and Thailand, the Cambodian minister said.

"This is the result of a long investigation," Prak Sokhonn added, referring to the events that led to Chen's extradition.

"Chen Zhi had Cambodian nationality, but when we made those investigations and found that his nationality was not legally obtained and he is also a Chinese national ... we have decided to extradite him to China."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:36:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WP7S4WZLTBO45LDZGQANDVYZMA.jpg?auth=d3e59daef63f0aa2a681156d39ae9498c09ff1af2e7106f0f9e9b11d3f6f5cef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 2,571 killed in Iran's protests, US-based rights group HRANA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/least-2571-killed-irans-protests-us-based-rights-group-hrana-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The death toll from protests in Iran has reached 2,571 people, the U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Wednesday, as the Islamic Republic's clerical rulers face the biggest wave of dissent in years.

U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iranians on Tuesday to keep protesting, promising help is on the way. Iranian officials, however, have accused U.S. and Israel of fuelling violence in the country and blamed the deaths on "terrorist operatives" receiving foreign guidance to instigate.

The group said it had so far verified the deaths of 2,403 protesters, 147 government-affiliated individuals, 12 people aged under 18 and nine non-protester civilians.

An Iranian official said on Tuesday about 2,000 people had been killed, the first time authorities have given an overall death toll from more than two weeks of nationwide unrest.

Asked what he meant by "help is on its way", Trump told reporters they would have to figure that out. Trump has said military action is among the options he is weighing to punish Iran over the crackdown.

The unrest, sparked by dire economic conditions, has posed the biggest internal challenge to Iran's rulers for at least three years and has come at a time of intensifying international pressure after Israeli and U.S. strikes last year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:36:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4X4WMN3PFNWZJ46HQSQYMWUCU.jpg?auth=613700e4aaef77a4559a23eb8aaa05ad01f407efcb0f2ceaad0fc9e006efeca5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Actor-director Tim Busfield jailed on child sex abuse charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/actor-director-tim-busfield-jailed-child-sex-abuse-charges-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 13 (Reuters) - Actor-director Timothy Busfield surrendered to authorities in New Mexico on Tuesday to face child sexual abuse charges, accused of inappropriately touching two young cast members on the set of a television show he was directing and producing.

According to a criminal complaint and arrest warrant affidavit, the case involves 11-year-old twin boys who reported the alleged contact occurred over a two-year period, when they were aged seven and eight, during production of the Fox crime drama "The Cleaning Lady."

Busfield was an executive producer of the show, which was filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city, and began directing episodes around the end of the second season, in 2022.

The arrest warrant was issued on Monday. Busfield, 68, turned himself in to the Albuquerque Police Department on Tuesday and was booked into the Bernalillo County jail without bond, said Nancy Laflin, a spokesperson for the district attorney's office.

In a video posted online shortly before his surrender, Busfield professed his innocence, called the allegations against him "lies" and said, "I'm going to be exonerated. I know I am."

"I did not do anything to those little boys," he said during the 45-second clip.

Busfield is best known for his prime-time television roles as a White House reporter on the NBC political drama "The West Wing," which ran on NBC from 1999 to 2006, and as an ad agency executive on the 1980s ABC ensemble series "Thirtysomething."

He is married to actress Melissa Gilbert, a former president of the Screen Actors Guild who gained fame in the 1970s as a child actress on the hit Western family drama "Little House on the Prairie."

Busfield is charged in the complaint with child abuse and two counts of criminal sexual contact of a minor.

According to the affidavit, one of the boys reported multiple instances of Busfield touching his "private areas" over his clothes during pauses in production. His brother also reported being touched by Busfield but was less specific, the affidavit said.

In his own interview for the investigation in November, Busfield acknowledged he probably had physical contact with the boys on occasion, like tickling or picking them up, but in a playful manner with others present, the affidavit said.

Busfield also suggested a possible motive for false allegations against him, according to the affidavit. Citing information he said he gleaned from the show's star, Elodie Yung, Busfield told police that the boys' mother was upset with him to the point of wanting "revenge" after producers decided to replace her sons in the final season of the series.

Yung declined to be interviewed for the police investigation, the affidavit said, but had related a similar account of the mother vowing revenge against Busfield when the actress was questioned by a private investigator for the show's producer, Warner Bros. Television.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 06:37:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Are you dead?' Chinese app for single living goes viral</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/are-you-dead-chinese-app-single-living-goes-viral-2026-01-14/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 14 (Reuters) - An app called "Are you dead" targeted at people living alone has gone viral in China, with surging downloads and widespread commentary on social media, prompting the company to introduce a subscription fee and change its name for a global audience.

The app called Sileme in Chinese, which translates to "Are you dead?" in English, is "a lightweight safety tool created for solo dwellers" from students, to solo officer workers or "anyone choosing a solitary lifestyle", says its development team.

The app requires setting up one emergency contact and sends automatic notifications if the user has not checked in via the app for consecutive days.

China may have up to 200 million one-person households, with a solo living rate exceeding 30%, state newspaper the Global Times said.

Sileme said on its official Weibo on Tuesday that the company will launch the global brand name Demumu in its new version to be released soon.

It is already called Demumu on Apple's paid app chart where it is currently sitting at number two, after surging to the top earlier in the week.

"Thanks to all netizens for their enthusiastic support. We were originally just an unknown small team, co-founded and operated independently by three born after 1995," Sileme said.

It said on Sunday that it would launch an eight yuan ($1.15) payment scheme to help cover increasing costs. Demumu on Apple's App store already was charging HK$8 to download the app.

Netizens on social media platforms, including Weibo, called on Sileme not to change its name, while others suggested options like "Are you alive", "Are you online" or "Are you there."

"Maybe some conservative people can't accept it," said one user, but it is helpful for safety purposes. "It will make us unmarried people feel more at ease to spend our lives."

Russia's State Investigative Committee said that the doctors had been detained on suspicion of causing death through negligence. It was not immediately possible to reach the doctors or their lawyers.

"As a result of the suspects' improper performance of their official and professional duties in organising and providing medical care... nine newborns who were born between 1 December 2025 and 12 January 2026 died," the Committee said.

The case, reported by state and independent news outlets, provoked widespread outrage in Russia.

Politicians, commentators and ordinary Russians asked how the country could hope to raise its birth rate - a priority set by President Vladimir Putin - if such tragedies were allowed to happen.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:27:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M5FSWQLBUBNX7ANLJKOKKPT77Y.jpg?auth=2e07435e7554777980924e10a38fc8c18a4e1f462b7c1a19440c314671ea01db&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to open a consulate in Greenland on February 6</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-open-consulate-greenland-february-6-2026-01-14/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - France will open a consulate in Greenland on February 6, a move that had been planned since last year, French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on Wednesday, amid the U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take control of the Arctic territory .

No casualties were immediately reported, as an impasse continues in negotiations between the central government and the SDF over merging its thousands of fighters into the national army.

The Syrian army earlier declared an area east of Aleppo as a “closed military zone". Eastern Aleppo province has been a tense frontline dividing areas under the Syrian government and large swaths of northeastern Syria under the SDF.

In a statement, the SDF said government forces have started shelling Deir Hafer district. The group later said government troops launched exploding drones, artillery and rockets to a village south of Deir Hafer.

Syrian state television later said the SDF targeted the village of Homeima on the other side of the Deir Hafer frontline with exploding drones.

Several days of deadly clashes in Aleppo last week displaced tens of thousands of people. They ended over the weekend with the evacuation of Kurdish fighters from the contested neighbourhood of Sheikh Maqsud. Aleppo Governor Azzam Ghareeb said Damascus now has full control of Sheikh Maqsud and Achrafieh, where clashes took place.

Syrian officials have accused the SDF of building up its forces near the towns of Maskana and Deir Hafer, about 60 kilometers (37 miles) east of Aleppo city. SANA, the state news agency, reported that the army had declared the area a closed military zone because of “continued mobilisation” by the SDF, and accused the group of using the area as a launchpad for drone attacks in Aleppo city.

The army statement said the armed groups should withdraw east of the Euphrates River.

A drone hit the Aleppo governorate building on Saturday shortly after two Cabinet ministers and a local official held a news conference on the developments in the city.

The SDF have denied mobilising in the area or being behind the attack.

The leadership in Damascus, under interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa , signed a deal in March with the SDF, which controls much of the northeast, for it to merge with the Syrian army by the end of 2025. There have been disagreements on how it would happen.

Some of the factions that make up the new Syrian army, which was formed after the fall of former President Bashar Assad in a rebel offensive in December 2024, were previously Turkey-backed insurgent groups that have a long history of clashing with Kurdish forces.

The SDF for years has been the main US partner in Syria in fighting against the Islamic State group, but Turkey considers the SDF a terrorist organisation because of its association with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK , which has waged a long-running insurgency in Turkey. A peace process is now under way.

Despite the long-running US support for the SDF, the Trump administration has also developed close ties with al-Sharaa’s government and has pushed the Kurds to implement the March deal.

The recent developments have left the SDF and the autonomous administration that runs northeastern Syria frustrated with Washington and accusing Damascus of not implementing its end of the deal.

“The American government needs to clarify its position of the Syrian government which is committing massacres,” the administration's foreign relations official, Elham Ahmad, told journalists Tuesday. She accused government forces of committing “horrific violations” and alleged that forces affiliated with IS and foreign fighters took part in the clashes.

Shams TV, a broadcaster based in Irbil – the seat of northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region – had been set to air an interview with al-Sharaa on Monday but later announced it had been postponed for “technical” reasons, without giving a new date for broadcast.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:27:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9ac74310-f0f3-11f0-bfb0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/bdecc1cf24ae2da14305316c8277f383faa866ee.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Singapore parliament to debate removing Leader of the Opposition after lying conviction</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-parliament-debate-removing-leader-opposition-after-lying-conviction-2026-01-14/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Singapore's parliament will debate whether to remove opposition chief Pritam Singh from his post as Leader of the Opposition on Wednesday after he was convicted of lying to parliament.

Leader of the House and ruling People's Action Party MP Indranee Rajah tabled a motion to declare Singh, the leader of the Workers' Party, unsuitable to continue as Leader of the Opposition given his "dishonourable and unbecoming" conduct.

In December, Indranee said that the conduct of Workers' Party chair Sylvia Lim and vice-chair Faisal Manap would also be discussed and that there would be "implications" for them from Singh's case.

Singh, 49, is Singapore's first official Leader of the Opposition since the city state gained independence in 1965. He was appointed after the 2020 general election, when his party gained five seats in parliament, bringing its total to 10.

In 2025, the ruling PAP won its 14th successive election to extend its unbroken six-decade rule, winning 87 of the 97 seats up for grabs. The Workers' Party won the remainder, having contested a total of 26.

A Singapore court found Singh guilty of two counts of lying to parliament in February last year, handing down fines that spared him the loss of his seat and a ban from the 2025 general election.

He was found guilty of giving false testimony to a parliamentary committee in 2021 about a fellow party member, Raeesah Khan, who also admitted lying to parliament.

Singh's appeal failed in December, and Indranee said in a media statement that Parliament must deliberate on an "appropriate response" to Singh's actions and convictions.

"Lying under oath is a serious matter. In some countries, leaders who have lied, cheated or flagrantly broken the law still escape any legal or political consequences. We cannot accept such standards in Singapore," she said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:47:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/66F4CUMYKVK5RNANCIG4RKEIE4.jpg?auth=bdee0435189d78145246ca3b9d5527b631d27890faf343d954885dfb2d55ebea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>George Vassiliou, 'eternal optimist' president who led Cyprus into the EU, dies at 94</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/george-vassiliou-eternal-optimist-president-who-led-cyprus-into-eu-dies-94-2026-01-14/</link><description>NICOSIA, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Former Cyprus President George Vassiliou, who died on Wednesday aged 94, once risked arrest in Cold War Hungary smuggling a banned political manifesto past the Iron Curtain.

In 1956, as Soviet tanks crushed a popular uprising in Budapest, he agreed to carry to the West the document, one of the anonymous "Hungaricus" pamphlets that gave the outside world its first uncensored accounts of the crackdown.

"I read it, agreed with what was written, and said I would gladly take it," Vassiliou, who was president of Cyprus between 1988 and 1993, later recalled.

"And I was lucky because nobody noticed I took it."

That early act of defiance helped shape the reformer who would later lead Cyprus toward Europe’s political mainstream and out of post-colonial uncertainty, helping to turn the former British island colony into a member of the European Union.

Vassiliou died in hospital aged 94, his wife Androulla said on X on Wednesday, adding, "He passed away peacefully in our arms." The couple had been married for 59 years.

Vassiliou was born in Cyprus in 1931 to parents who were both doctors and die-hard Communists who went wherever their cause would take them.

He initially enrolled in medical school in Geneva, and then Austria. But funds ran out when his father left a lucrative practice in Cyprus to join the communists in the Greek civil war that ran from 1946 to 1949.

Vassiliou moved to Budapest to be closer to his mother and younger sister, who were caught up in the tumult after that war, which stranded tens of thousands of partisans in Eastern Europe, barred from returning to Greece.

His father found himself in Albania, with the route through then-Yugoslavia shut after a fallout between Josip Tito, its prime minister at the time, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin.

In Hungary, Vassiliou became an interpreter for Greek political refugees, got a part-time job in an aluminium factory and gave up on medicine, to his father's chagrin. He enrolled instead at the capital's Karl Marx University of Economics.

"I was a handsome young man who had lived in the West, a Cypriot (thus a British subject) who spoke French, German, English — an interesting fellow," Vassiliou reminisced to Hungary's Oral History Archive.

"The communists befriended me because I was a Greek refugee; the aristocrats because I was a British subject; the (women) because I was good-looking and well dressed."

Vassiliou chose to study economics because he wanted to "be a planner to design the new world".

He moved among activists disillusioned with Stalinism and attended lectures by philosopher Gyorgy Lukacs, whose reading of Marxism departed from rigid Soviet philosophy.

Vassiliou was present during the 1956 Hungarian uprising, a nationwide revolt against Soviet-backed communist rule sparked by student protests and calls for political reform.

It was crushed within weeks when Soviet tanks entered Budapest, killing hundreds and forcing about 200,000 people to flee the country.

Vassiliou brought the confidential pamphlet to Paris at his friends' request.

The risks were high.

Historians drawing on secret police files, court records and survivor testimony have shown that the underground networks behind such documents were met with harsh reprisals.

Hundreds of people involved in illegal printing and information smuggling were jailed, with many more arrested, interrogated, or subjected to long-term surveillance.

Vassiliou was held for two days when he returned to Hungary in 1959, and not allowed to leave the country for a year.

He later surmised that he escaped jail because he was a foreigner, or because authorities mistook him for the son of a high-ranking party official.

"The crushing of my youthful idealism by the tanks taught me that what was preached, and what was done, diverged," Vassiliou said, reflecting on the events of 1956. "Since then I have never been a member of any party."

A liberal who founded market research firm MEMRB in Cyprus in 1971 and grew it into one of the biggest in the Middle East, Vassiliou was a lone figure when he declared his bid for the presidency of the eastern Mediterranean island in 1987.

A year later, he won unexpected support from Cyprus's influential communist AKEL party.

His credentials, as the son of Communists, helped. Yet it was known that Vassiliou did not subscribe to that ideology.

Two internal reports compiled by AKEL addressed to sister Communist parties in Greece and then-Czechoslovakia labelled him an "anticommunist, anti-Soviet and a revisionist", Cyprus's Alithia newspaper said in 1994, citing a former AKEL official.

In his memoir "Reflections on the Past and Future", Vassiliou wrote that AKEL threw its weight behind him after its leadership found pictures of their preferred candidate wearing the garments of Freemasons.

That dealt a blow to the Communists, who viewed Freemasons as classists.

In the 1988 election, Vassiliou inched to victory over conservative-backed Glafcos Clerides, although the latter would go on to defeat him in an election runoff in 1993.

In later life, Vassiliou would rue his arrogance: "I was sure I would be re-elected ... it turned on me in the end because too much self-confidence isn't always good," he told Greece's Kathimerini newspaper in 2017.

His election to the presidency shook up the stale world of Cypriot politics, ushering in more scrutiny and accountability.

He travelled widely to meet any prominent personality who would hear him out over Cyprus's division between Greek and Turkish Cypriots.

A marketing man through and through, he became known for his brisk, two-handed handshake, which Cypriots nicknamed "kappakoti" ("to cup") in their vernacular.

At home, he cut taxes to stamp out tax evasion and sent in police to demolish illegal shacks along the pristine coastline, along which he later built a palatial mansion, for use as a private residence.

He also clashed with entrenched bias. In his failed bid for re-election in 1993, Vassiliou said he and his wife would be honoured to return to the office. Opponents said it was inappropriate to have mentioned her.

A politician in her own right, his wife Androulla Vassiliou was an EU Commissioner for health, then education and youth from 2008 to 2014. They had three children.

Under his watch, Cyprus was the first non-EU member state to apply and peg its currency, the Cyprus pound, to the precursor of the euro, the European Currency Unit (ECU), in 1992.

It was Vassiliou's administration that applied for Cyprus's membership in the EU in 1990, and he was chief negotiator for joining the bloc between 1998 and 2003. Cyprus eventually entered the EU in 2004, and adopted the euro in 2008.

As president, Vassiliou created the island's first state university. Upon leaving the presidency, he launched the liberal United Democrats party, which fared poorly in elections, however.

Unlike other Greek Cypriot politicians, Vassiliou was steadfast in his support of a United Nations reunification blueprint for Cyprus in 2004. But that plan was rejected by fellow Greek Cypriots in a referendum.

A self-proclaimed "eternal optimist", he died never having fulfilled his ambition of ending the division of Cyprus between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations, a simmering conflict that is a permanent drag on ties between NATO partners Greece and Turkey.

"The tragedy of Cyprus is between what is desired and what is possible," he once said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:48:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AQDIMOX3SBJM7D6BFD4FPWNYFI.jpg?auth=d3ee15be23d5c305e62598f9c25c7b1d68e4abf16a6e897d96989286dc19c2e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisian journalist Chatha Belhaj Mubarak freed after sentence cut</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/tunisian-journalist-chatha-belhaj-mubarak-freed-after-sentence-cut-2026-01-14/</link><description>TUNIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - A Tunisian appeal court on Wednesday ordered the release of journalist Chatha Belhaj Mubarak, jailed since 2023 in a conspiracy case, after reducing her prison sentence, her family said.

The court cut her sentence from five years to two, making her eligible for immediate release, her brother told Reuters.

She was convicted in the so-called "Instalingo" case, which involved politicians, media figures and other defendants accused of conspiracy and financial crimes. Belhaj Mubarak denied the charges.

"Chatha is free and leaving prison," her brother, Amen Belhaj Mubarak, said.

He said her health had severely deteriorated during her time in prison. She suffered serious complications, including significant hearing loss, and was diagnosed with cancer in detention, he added.

Tunisian authorities have said the case stems from judicial investigations into alleged financial and security-related offences, and have rejected accusations by opposition groups that the prosecutions were politically motivated.

Tunisian prosecutors are pursuing a number of high-profile conspiracy cases involving politicians, journalists and activists. Several opposition leaders have received lengthy prison terms.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 07:48:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelans regain access to X, a year after Maduro blocked network</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260114-venezuelans-regain-access-to-x-a-year-after-maduro-blocked-network</link><description>The social network X was once again accessible in Venezuela on Tuesday, more than a year after users were blocked by deposed president Nicolas Maduro , who was captured by US forces last week.

Interim president Delcy Rodriguez updated her bio – she served as vice president under Maduro – and wrote: "Let us stay united, moving towards economic stability, social justice, and the welfare state we deserve to aspire to."

Access remained spotty to the social media network owned by billionaire Elon Musk , who engaged in heated online exchanges with the ousted Venezuelan leader, until Maduro lashed out in retaliation for criticism of his contested 2024 election and shut X down.

After the July 2024 election, Maduro was declared the winner amid allegations of fraud and suspended the platform in August.

Prior to that, X had been a prominent social media network for Venezuelans, but the blockade meant ministers, lawmakers and government institutions stopped updating their pages.

Rodriguez assumed power after Maduro was captured by US military forces on January 3 along with his wife, during attacks that left more than 100 dead, according to official figures.

The couple faces US charges of alleged drug trafficking.

Maduro's X account was also updated with a photo of the deposed leader and his wife, Cilia Flores.

According to an Israeli assessment, Trump has decided to intervene but the scope and timing of this action remains unclear, an Israeli official said.

A second Israeli source, a government official, said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet was briefed late on Tuesday about the chances of regime collapse and the chances of U.S. intervention in Iran, an arch-foe with which it fought a 12-day war last year.

The protests which began on December 28 in response to soaring inflation have spiralled into one of the biggest challenges to Iran's clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

In an interview with CBS News on Tuesday, Trump vowed "very strong action" if Iran started hanging protesters, but didn't elaborate. "If they hang them, you're going to see some things," he said. He also urged Iranians on Tuesday to keep protesting and take over institutions, declaring "help is on the way" but without giving details.

Iranian state media reported that the head of Iran's top security body, Ali Larijani, had spoken to the foreign minister of Qatar and that Iran's foreign minister had spoken to his Emirati and Turkish counterparts. The countries are all U.S. allies.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed that "calm has prevailed" and that Iranians were determined to defend their sovereignty and security from any foreign interference, state media reported.

The flow of information from Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout. Holistic Resilience, a U.S. organization that works to expand information access in repressive or closed societies, said on Tuesday that billionaire Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet service was now available for free in Iran.

U.S.-based HRANA rights group said it had so far verified the deaths of 2,403 protesters and 147 government-affiliated individuals. An Iranian official told Reuters on Tuesday that about 2,000 people had been killed.

Iranian authorities have accused the United States and Israel of fomenting the unrest, blaming violence on people it calls terrorists who have attacked security forces, mosques and public property.

Visiting a Tehran prison where arrested protesters are being held, Iran's chief justice said that speed in judging and penalizing those "who beheaded or burned people" was critical to ensuring such events do not happen again.

HRANA reported 18,137 arrests so far.

State TV said that a funeral procession will take place on Wednesday in Tehran for more than 100 civilians and security personnel killed in the unrest.

Hengaw, an Iranian Kurdish rights group, has reported that a 26-year-old man, Erfan Soltani, arrested in connection with protests in the city of Karaj, was to be executed on Wednesday.

Hengaw told Reuters on Wednesday it had not been able to confirm whether Soltani's sentence had been carried out due to the internet and communications shutdown. Reuters could not independently confirm the report.

Pro-government rallies were held in Iran on Monday, a show of loyalist support for the clerical Iranian establishment. So far, there have been no signs of fracture in the security forces that have quelled other bouts of protest over the years.

While Iranian authorities have weathered previous protests, the latest unrest is taking place with Tehran still recovering from last year's war and with its regional position weakened by blows to allies such as Lebanon's Hezbollah since the October 7, 2023 Hamas-led attacks against Israel.

Asked what he meant by "help is on its way", Trump told reporters on Tuesday they would have to figure that out. Trump has said military action is among the options he is weighing to punish Iran over the crackdown.

"The killing looks like it's significant, but we don't know yet for certain," said Trump upon returning to the Washington area from Detroit, adding he would know more after receiving a report on Tuesday evening.

"We'll act accordingly," he said.

Trump on Monday announced 25% import tariffs on products from any country doing business with Iran - a major oil exporter.

The U.S. State Department on Tuesday urged American citizens to leave Iran now, including by land through Turkey or Armenia.

In response to Trump's social media post that "help is on the way," Iran’s U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani said the U.S. president was inciting violence, threatening the country’s sovereignty and security and seeking to destabilize the government.

Russia on Tuesday condemned "subversive external interference" in Iran's internal politics, saying any repeat of last year's U.S. strikes would have "disastrous consequences" for the Middle East and international security.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:29:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EKWD6AHQNVO5BFZ5DXGMCOF54Y.jpg?auth=2df6dd8a9397d7731cbabc20c9bfb2d81a3f2684d1cd7da91f85fc8ea02d935d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria asks Lebanon to hand over Assad-era officers after Reuters report</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-asks-lebanon-hand-over-assad-era-officers-after-reuters-report-2026-01-14/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Syrian authorities have asked Lebanese security forces to hand over more than 200 senior officers who fled to Lebanon after the fall of Bashar al-Assad, following a Reuters investigation that showed how the neighboring country was a hub for insurgent plotting.

On December 18, a top Syrian security official, Brig. Abdul Rahman al-Dabbagh, met with his Lebanese counterparts in Beirut to discuss the exiled Assad-era officers, according to three senior Syrian sources, two Lebanese security officials, and a diplomat with knowledge of the visit.

The meetings came days after a Reuters investigation detailed rival plots being pursued by Rami Makhlouf, the billionaire cousin of the ousted president, and Maj. Gen. Kamal Hassan, former head of military intelligence, both living in exile in Moscow, to finance potential Alawite militant groups in Lebanon and along the Syrian coast. Syria and Lebanon share a 375-kilometer border.

The two rival camps aim to undermine the new Syrian government under President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Reuters found they are sending money to intermediaries in Lebanon to try and stir uprisings that would divide Syria and allow the plotters to regain control over the coastal areas. The population of those areas is dominated by Alawites, the minority sect associated with the Assad family and the dictatorship’s ruling elite.

Al-Dabbagh, an aide to the head of internal security in Syria’s Latakia province, an Alawite stronghold, met with Lebanese intelligence chief Tony Kahwaji and Major General Hassan Choucair, head of the General Security Directorate, and presented them with the list of senior officers wanted by Syria.

The visit focused on gathering information about the whereabouts and legal status of the officers, as well as trying to find ways to prosecute or extradite them to Syria, according to the Syrian sources. They described it as a direct request from one security agency to another, rather than a demand for extradition.

Three senior Lebanese security officials confirmed the meetings. One of the Lebanese officials denied receiving any demands from the Syrians to hand over the officers. Two others acknowledged receiving a list of names but said none were senior officers.

One of the Lebanese security officials said there is no evidence of any insurgency being planned, despite the threats against Syria’s new government detailed in the Reuters reporting.

All the officials spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal details of a highly sensitive cross-border issue.

Among the names handed over by Syrian officials to Lebanon were several high-ranking figures acting as intermediaries for Makhlouf or Hassan in Lebanon, according to a Syrian source who saw the list.

A Lebanese judicial official said Syria had not made a formal extradition request to Lebanon, typically done through the two countries’ justice and foreign ministries.

Accompanying Dabbagh on his Beirut visit was Khaled al-Ahmad, a former Assad advisor and childhood friend of Sharaa, who is leading the government’s efforts to win over the Alawite community through development projects and aid, according to two witnesses who saw the men together on that mid-December day.

According to the two witnesses, who are both ex-Assad officers, al-Ahmad and Dabbagh went together to Azmi, an upscale Beirut restaurant that is popular among Assad’s men. The two witnesses said they and others interpreted the outing as a warning to those trying to influence Alawites to rise up against Syria’s new leaders that Lebanon is no longer a haven. A manager at Azmi declined to comment on the visit.

In a January 2 post on X, Lebanese Deputy Prime Minister Tarek Mitri called on his government’s security agencies to verify the information circulating in the media and take action against the Lebanon-based agents for Assad’s former insiders, Makhlouf and Hassan.

“It is incumbent upon them, and upon all of us, to avert the dangers of any actions that undermine Syria’s unity or threaten its security and stability, whether in Lebanon or originating from it,” the tweet read.

In response to questions from Reuters, Lebanon’s General Security referred to January 11 remarks by Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, who said Lebanon’s military intelligence and other security agencies had carried out raids in several areas of the country’s north and east. Aoun said the raids did not produce evidence of the presence of officers linked to the Assad dictatorship and said Lebanon was continuing to coordinate with Syria on the issue.

Syrian government officials did not respond to requests for comment.

From January 3 to January 6, Lebanese soldiers raided locations and shelters housing displaced Syrians. The Lebanese Army said 38 Syrians were arrested during the raids on different charges such as possession of drugs or weapons, or entering the country illegally. A senior Lebanese security official told Reuters those raids were linked to the exiles’ plots.

Another senior Lebanese security official emphasized that there was no arrest warrant for the Syrian officers in Lebanon, nor Interpol requests for them.

“We can't do anything against them,” the official added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QXSUPJQDHBIHDFCNTI5PP3M2ZU.jpg?auth=f6e6fb3d9f7ac9eaaffb35f67309014a6e1efa0fbbba0559e15f9acbe90c5167&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greek airspace blackout linked to old systems, not cyberattack, report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/greek-airspace-blackout-linked-old-systems-not-cyberattack-report-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - An eight-hour radio outage at Greek airports last week that forced authorities to clear the country's airspace and divert dozens of incoming flights was in part due to an outdated communications system, investigators said in a report.

Flights were suspended into and over Greece on January 4 when air traffic controllers lost contact with most planes, including dozens heading for Greek airports, as radio frequencies went down and were replaced by static.

Aviation experts said the incident was unprecedented in the southern European country.

The exact cause of the outage, which occurred when multiple systems fell out of sync, causing a scramble in communications between airport towers and planes, remains unclear, the report from a five-member investigating committee commissioned by the government found.

It ranked the incident as "low risk" regarding flight safety, ruled out a cyberattack and said that pilots and air traffic controllers responded effectively.

However, the Civil Aviation Authority's voice communication system and critical supporting telecommunications infrastructure are based on outdated technology that is no longer supported by manufacturers and lacks operational guarantees, according to the report, which was submitted to Greece's transport ministry and published late on Tuesday.

The report said that Greek telecommunications provider OTE had since 2019 warned the civil aviation authority that its systems needed new circuits. The report called for upgraded transceivers and other changes. It also recommended the creation of a crisis-response mechanism between the civil aviation authority and OTE.

Greece's systems are in line with EU standards, a transport ministry official said in reaction to the report, although the ministry has implemented an upgrade plan expected to be completed in 2028.

But unions, who have been calling for upgrades for years, say the system is dangerous, especially amid a tourism boom with millions of tourists flying to Greece every year. On Wednesday, they said that the report "fully vindicates" their protests.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LCUCKJJUBRP67BXIGFFKWQJO5I.jpg?auth=70579dfdae71a310b9ccfd0089cca5ae2158eabcd8d7fa2182dad852d852442c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark and Greenland to face Vance in high-stakes meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-greenland-face-vance-high-stakes-meeting-2026-01-14/</link><description>NUUK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers will meet with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the White House on Wednesday following weeks of threats by President Donald Trump to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark .

Trump has said the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to U.S. security and the United States must own it to prevent Russia or China occupying it.

Greenland and Denmark say the island is not for sale, threats of force are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies. Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark.

Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenland counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt were expected to show a united front in the meeting with Vance and other U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

"We choose the Greenland we know today – as part of the Kingdom of Denmark," Motzfeldt said in a statement released by the Danish ambassador to the U.S. on Tuesday.

Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen also reiterated Greenland's commitment to Denmark, calling the situation "a geopolitical crisis" and rejecting the prospect of becoming a U.S. territory.

Trump, when asked by reporters late on Tuesday, dismissed Nielsen's statement that Greenland prefers to remain part of Denmark.

"That's their problem. I disagree with them. I don't know who he is. Don't know anything about him, but that's going to be a big problem for him," Trump said.

White House officials have been discussing various plans to bring Greenland under U.S. control, including potential use of the U.S. military and lump-sum payments to Greenlanders to convince them.

Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said the hardest part in the dispute over Greenland's future may lie ahead.

Denmark and Greenland had originally sought a meeting with Rubio, hoping to have a discussion among top diplomats on resolving the crisis between the two NATO allies.

But Denmark's Rasmussen said Vance had also wanted to participate and that the vice president would host the meeting himself, at the White House.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GGYX2XFSBFMQHELP5VMQR6JJJM.jpg?auth=a76d63f834eabba356329e8ae09fed1127e34469b9dff70263ce78a7175ca401&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hezbollah warns Lebanese state against expanding disarmament push</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hezbollah-warns-lebanese-state-against-expanding-disarmament-push-2026-01-14/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 14 (Reuters) - A senior Hezbollah official has warned Lebanon's government that pressing on with efforts to disarm the group throughout the country would trigger chaos and possibly civil war, according to comments circulated by the armed group on Wednesday.

Lebanon has pledged to bring all arms in the country under state control, in line with a 2024 agreement that ended a devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel.

Hezbollah insists that deal only applies to the southernmost region of Lebanon that borders Israel and has refused to relinquish its arsenal elsewhere.

In an interview with Russian state media outlet RT, senior Hezbollah political official Mahmoud Qmati said pursuing a state monopoly on arms further north would be "the biggest crime committed by the state".

"The path taken by the Lebanese government and state institutions will lead Lebanon to instability, chaos and perhaps even civil war," Qmati said, though he added that Hezbollah would not be dragged into a confrontation with Lebanon's army.

The Lebanese army said last week that it had taken operational control in the area between the Litani River and Israel's border. The Lebanese cabinet has asked the army to brief it in early February on how it would pursue disarmament in other parts of the country.

Hezbollah has said that Israeli troops must withdraw from five hilltop positions they occupy in southern Lebanon, halt near-daily airstrikes on Lebanon and release detained Lebanese before any further disarmament is discussed.

"There will be no talk or dialogue about any situation north of the Litani River before Israel withdraws from all Lebanese territory, liberates the South and the prisoners, and stops its violations against Lebanon," said Qmati.

Israel says that efforts to disarm Hezbollah fighters have been insufficient, raising pressure on Lebanese leaders who fear Israel could escalate strikes.

The war in Gaza that erupted in October 2023 triggered months of cross-border hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, with near-daily exchanges of fire along the Lebanon-Israel frontier.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PKZ4MFFURZJ4XKYUQN34TLOKSU.jpg?auth=e29c2084f14be440e57728d307f3de995204544135a8857ff01194585f041e1f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump son-in-law Kushner, envoy Witkoff plan to meet Putin in Moscow, Bloomberg reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-son-in-law-kushner-envoy-witkoff-plan-meet-putin-moscow-bloomberg-news-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - White House envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are seeking to travel to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the matter.

The meeting could happen this month, though plans are not final and timing may slip due to unrest in Iran, the report said.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

A White House official told Bloomberg no such meeting was currently scheduled.

The U.S. officials will present the latest draft peace proposals to Putin and his team, the report said, adding that the talks were expected to cover security guarantees from the U.S. and Europe to uphold any agreement, and Ukraine's post-war reconstruction.

This follows Trump's comments earlier this month expressing frustration with Putin over the continued war in Ukraine, repeating that he had initially believed ending the conflict would be easy.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:30:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ILM4X7FH2FMETNOGGUYDWVRJFE.jpg?auth=dd4d6582ee98b276cf04f0136b56c84685f3c360a6419a9136bb9c12cf1c9ab0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Benin offers citizenship to African diaspora, with help from Spike Lee</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/benin-offers-citizenship-african-diaspora-with-help-spike-lee-2026-01-14/</link><description>OUIDAH, Benin, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Isaline Attelly, a native of the Caribbean island of Martinique, had been living in Benin for nearly a year before she learned that her family's connection to the West African country went back much further.

Genealogical records confirmed her great-grandmother on her mother's side was born in what is now Benin and, at the height of transatlantic slavery, was trafficked across the Atlantic Ocean.

The discovery last year prompted Attelly, a 28-year-old content creator, to enrol in a new programme offering Beninese citizenship to people of African descent.

The "My Afro Origins" programme is an important piece of President Patrice Talon's plan to raise his country's profile, including among prospective tourists, by highlighting its prominent role in the transatlantic trafficking of enslaved people.

"For me, it's a source of pride. It feels like my journey has come full circle," Attelly told Reuters after her naturalisation ceremony. "I am proud and very happy to be able to represent my ancestors."

The first naturalisation ceremonies have coincided with the unveiling of projects intended to bring that history to life, including a new "Door of No Return" in Ouidah, a common departure point for transatlantic trafficking, and a replica of an 18th-century ship that transported enslaved people with sculptures inside representing nearly 300 captives. Both are still under construction.

The government also plans to open this year a new International Museum of Memory and Slavery at the former residence of Francisco Felix de Souza, a prominent trafficker of enslaved people in the 18th and 19th centuries.

Talon, who survived a coup attempt last month and is expected to end his 10-year tenure after a presidential election in April, has recruited star power to publicise his vision.
Filmmaker Spike Lee and his wife Tonya Lee Lewis were last year named ambassadors for the programme to the African-American community.

"Our brothers and sisters in Benin are telling us: come home, welcome us home, come back to the motherland. Come back (to) where your roots are," Lee told France 24 last year.

In July 2025 American R&amp;B star Ciara became one of the first beneficiaries of Beninese citizenship. She performed last week at a concert in Ouidah as part of an annual festival devoted to voodoo, playing hits such as "Level Up" during a set that ran until 3 a.m.

Her husband, American football quarterback Russell Wilson, attended and said he was hoping to become a citizen himself "real soon".

Around 50 people have received Beninese citizenship since the "My Afro Origins" programme launched last year, according to the Justice Ministry, which is sorting through thousands of applications and receives about 100 more each day.

To qualify, applicants need to be 18 years old and produce documents or a DNA test proving their ties to the continent, and they cannot be citizens of another African country, Foreign Minister Olushegun Adjadi Bakari told Reuters.

At the naturalisation ceremony on December 27 in Cotonou, Benin's biggest city and economic capital, Attelly and nine others received their citizenship certificates and posed for pictures next to the Beninese flag.

Benin's programme is similar to an initiative in Ghana that, since 2016, has granted citizenship to 684 members of the African diaspora, according to Kofi Okyere Darko, presidential adviser on diaspora affairs.

CARICOM, the regional bloc of the Caribbean, has endorsed a "right of return" for descendants of enslaved people, as part of a reparations plan adopted in 2014.

Resettlement should be funded by "those states that are responsible for the forced movement and enslavement" of millions of people, CARICOM says, meaning European states and governments.

Though no significant progress has been made towards such a comprehensive effort, Benin's government hopes the programme can nevertheless strengthen ties between Africans and the diaspora while showcasing the country's history, said Bakari, the foreign minister.

"We believe that Africa cannot develop without a strong involvement of its diaspora," he said.

"What we are looking for is people who will definitely recognise themselves as African, having the proof that they are part of this continent."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:31:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S3SOVWFYGRLRJGBNA7RRGWOJ3A.jpg?auth=260d290b4200dba2a86bc111b46c8046353758f65e6bb52ad90e19ec6322aa23&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to open consulate in Greenland in a ‘political signal’ amid Trump threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260114-france-to-open-consulate-in-greenland-in-a-political-signal-amid-trump-threats</link><description>France will open a consulate in Greenland on February 6, Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said Wednesday, calling the move a "political signal" over the strategic Danish territory, which US President Donald Trump has vowed to seize.

The comments came as the Danish and ‍Greenlandic foreign ministers are set to ​meet with US Vice President JD Vance at the White House later Wednesday

Since returning to office nearly a year ago, Trump has repeatedly mused about taking over Greenland from longtime ally and European Union member Denmark.

Barrot on Wednesday told French RTL broadcaster that the decision to open the consulate was taken last summer, when President Emmanuel Macron visited Greenland in a show of support.

"For my part, I went there at the end of August to plan the consulate, which will open on February 6," he said.

"It's a political signal that's associated with a desire to be more present in Greenland, including in the scientific field."

"Greenland does not want to be owned, governed ... or integrated into the United States. Greenland has made the choice of Denmark, NATO, (European) Union," he said.

Greenland's leader has said that the island would choose to remain an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Trump has said the United States needs Greenland due to the threat of a takeover by Russia or China.

The two rival powers have both stepped up activity in the Arctic, where ice is melting due to climate change, but neither claims Greenland, where the United States has long had a military base.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:32:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2379b5c4-f123-11f0-9145-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26013723586602.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Some personnel were advised to leave U.S. military base in Qatar, diplomats tell Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/some-personnel-were-advised-leave-us-military-base-qatar-diplomats-tell-reuters-2026-01-14/</link><description>DOHA, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Some personnel were advised to leave the U.S. military's Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar by Wednesday evening, three diplomats told Reuters.

Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov's coalition government, backed by GERB-SDS, resigned last month after weeks of street protests against state corruption and a new budget that would have increased some taxes.

In line with the constitution, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev on Monday had formally asked the conservative GERB-SDS to form the government which they rejected. On Wednesday PP-DB, which seeks closer relations with the European Union, also rejected the mandate, BTA agency reported.

Radev is now expected to offer a chance to govern to another party and then if they refuse he will have to call a snap vote, Bulgaria's eighth in just four years.

Despite such uncertainty, Bulgaria joined the euro zone on January 1 as scheduled. But it needs political stability to speed the uptake of EU funds into its creaking infrastructure, encourage foreign investment and root out endemic state corruption.

The GERB-SDS coalition won the last election in October 2024 but only took power in January 2025 after months of talks and needed the support of other parties in the divided legislature.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:55:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BK5VL5TJM5IYDGVGQOIR6LTX3Y.jpg?auth=047ff1a5dd4ffc606693883f8fa3fe9c9d8bbc907debe8d3f8cb8bccbc61d447&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>2025, third hottest year on record</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/2025-third-hottest-year-on-record</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 09:56:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4fd4b200-f12c-11f0-963f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-102130-102659-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gaza: Hypothermia kills 5 as blockade hinders aid</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/gaza-hypothermia-kills-5-as-blockade-hinders-aid</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e31a3d06-f12b-11f0-8cd8-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-101642-101818-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland: Meeting set in Washington as Trump mulls taking the island</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenland-meeting-set-in-washington-as-trump-mulls-taking-the-island</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/61cfa0d8-f12b-11f0-bc9d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-100833-101617-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>JD Vance, Rubio to meet Greenland officials</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/jd-vance-rubio-to-meet-greenland-officials</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/107e2880-f12b-11f0-b65e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-100646-100833-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Donald Trump warns of "very strong action" if Iran hangs protesters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/donald-trump-warns-of-very-strong-action-if-iran-hangs-protesters</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/afc69f90-f12a-11f0-8cc5-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-100435-100613-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran: Activists report more than 2,500 dead after brutal crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-activists-report-more-than-2-500-dead-after-brutal-crackdown</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 10:55:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/82185052-f12a-11f0-86e4-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-100154-100415-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Economic confrontation replaces armed conflict as top risk in WEF survey</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/economic-confrontation-replaces-armed-conflict-top-risk-wef-survey-2026-01-14/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Economic confrontation between nations and its consequences topped the World Economic Forum's (WEF) annual risks perception survey released on Wednesday, replacing armed conflict as the number one concern of 1,300-plus experts surveyed worldwide.

The survey also showed perceptions of environmental risk slipping down the rankings while other concerns came to the fore - notably fears over the long-term consequences of weak governance of artificial intelligence.

Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the WEF annual gathering in Davos due to start next week, cited rising tariffs, checks on foreign investment and tighter supply controls on resources like critical minerals as examples of "geoeconomic confrontation", which ranked as the top risk.

"(It is) when economic policy tools become essentially weaponry rather than a basis of cooperation," she told an online press conference.

U.S. President Donald Trump's "America first" policies have led to a sharp rise in U.S. trading tariffs across the world and fed into tensions between the U.S. and China, which is dominant in critical minerals and the world's second largest economy.

Perceived risks around extreme weather over the next two years dropped from 2nd to 4th place and pollution from 6th to 9th. Anxiety over critical change to earth systems and biodiversity loss fell seven and five positions respectively.

However, when asked what their sharpest concerns were over a longer, 10-year period, those same respondents ranked such environmental concerns in the top three spots.

Anxiety about "adverse outcomes of AI technologies" ranked 30th place in the two-year horizon but 5th place in the 10-year horizon.

Zahidi said the survey revealed that most of the concerns focused on how insufficient governance around AI could harm jobs, society and mental health while seeing it increasingly being used as a weapon in warfare.

The WEF said its annual survey draws on responses from "over 1,300 global leaders and experts from academia, business, government, international organizations and civil society".</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:23:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TH57VPJPWNNWPAZQY6M2LGDOII.jpg?auth=9bc8d43ff4500d48cd2ee0f942a3411a19b8f44a8789d36953222fc46d0de2dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU to split Ukraine financial support with 30 bln euros for budget, 60 bln for military</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-split-ukraine-financial-support-with-30-bln-euros-budget-60-bln-military-2026-01-14/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday the EU intends to split the 90 billion euro ($104.89 billion) financial support approved for Ukraine into one third for its general budget and two thirds for military supplies.

"We take really a next step in our support to build a stronger and more stable Ukraine," she said in a news conference in Brussels.

The 60 billion euros to be spent on military gears will be used mainly to buy equipment from the EU and EFTA countries, she said.

Finland and other European Union and NATO members bordering Russia - Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland - decided to leave the Ottawa treaty amid concerns over the military threat posed by Russia.

Russia has used landmines in its invasion of Ukraine, and in July accused Ukraine of doing so too, after Ukraine announced its withdrawal from the Ottawa Convention.

In Finland, talks with the domestic defence industry and anti-personnel landmine training for military personnel will start early this year.

"The goal is to have the first new mines and their exercise equipment available in the course of 2027," the country's Defence Forces said in a statement.

"New anti-personnel mines are intended to be developed in cooperation with the domestic defence industry with a further goal of manufacturing them in Finland."

Finland does not plan to lay anti-personnel mines on the ground in peacetime.

"We will use mines only in emergency conditions," said Colonel Riku Mikkonen, Inspector of Engineers for the Army Command.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:24:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P2Y7AJ7HSBPJZJHMY4NO3HBHGA.jpg?auth=f896226513b783b7dd1353f025223136e710d7055935ccf7c366f9d34781e694&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Just one in five Americans support Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/just-one-five-americans-support-trumps-efforts-acquire-greenland-reutersipsos-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Just 17% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, and substantial majorities of Democrats and Republicans oppose using military force to annex the island, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

The two-day poll, which concluded on Tuesday, showed widespread concerns over Trump's threats to NATO ally Denmark over Greenland, which has been a Danish territory for centuries .

U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are due to meet the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers at the White House on Wednesday, the day after Greenland's prime minister said his nation would prefer to remain part of Denmark .

Trump has said Greenland is vital to U.S. security and that Washington must own it to prevent Russia or China occupying the strategically located territory - which is rich in mineral wealth - in the future.

White House officials have discussed various plans to bring Greenland under U.S. control, including using military force or issuing lump-sum payments to Greenlanders as part of a bid to convince them to secede from Denmark.

Some 47% of respondents to the Reuters/Ipsos poll disapproved of U.S. efforts to acquire Greenland, while 35% said they were unsure.

About one in five respondents in the poll said they had not heard of the plans to acquire Greenland. The effort has come to the fore as Trump has stepped up efforts to dominate affairs in the Western Hemisphere. Earlier this month, he vowed to "run" Venezuela after ordering a military raid that captured the country's president.

Only 4% of Americans - including just one in 10 Republicans and almost no Democrats - said it would be a "good idea" for the U.S. to use military force to take possession of Greenland from Denmark. Some 71% thought it would be a bad idea, including nine in 10 Democrats and six in 10 Republicans. About one in three Republicans said they weren't sure if it was a good or bad idea.

Denmark has warned that using military force would mark the end of NATO, the transatlantic defense treaty that has been a key plank in the world order since 1949.

Some 66% of respondents, including 91% of Democrats and 40% of Republicans, said they were worried U.S. efforts to acquire Greenland will damage the NATO alliance and U.S. relationships with European allies.

Trump campaigned on promises to avoid war, helping shore up support for him among Americans tired of decades of foreign military conflicts such as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Appetite for foreign conflict, including attempts to expand U.S. territory, has been low throughout Trump's second term.

Some 10% of respondents agreed with a statement that the U.S. "should use military force to obtain new territory, like Greenland and the Panama Canal," largely unchanged from 9% in a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted January 20-21 of last year, shortly after Trump returned to power.

Some Republican lawmakers have also expressed skepticism over Trump's Greenland ambitions, particularly when it comes to threats against Denmark, though others support legislation that would give Trump the power to annex Greenland.

Besides Denmark, Trump has also threatened action against Iran if authorities there mistreat protesters in the country. Trump last year ordered U.S. strikes in support of Israel in its short-lived war against Iran. The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll showed 33% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of Iran, while 43% disapproved.

The new Reuters/Ipsos poll, which was conducted online and nationwide, gathered responses from 1,217 U.S. adults and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:24:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7O5AAB6PGJL45KE3WSUNM2X4H4.jpg?auth=3249739d42dda3975a8cd27765727b9da3679073b8e79460da66ebe9dda42d7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's Revolutionary Guards point to battle readiness and increased missile stockpiles, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-revolutionary-guards-point-battle-readiness-increased-missile-stockpiles-2026-01-14/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Iran's stockpile of missiles has increased since a 12-day war with Israel last year, Revolutionary Guards' Aerospace Commander Majid Mousavi said on Wednesday according to state media, following U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of intervention amid anti-government protests in Iran.

Israel and Hamas in October signed off on Trump's 20-point plan which says that a technocratic Palestinian body overseen by an international "Board of Peace" is meant to govern Gaza for a transitional period. It is not to include Hamas representation.

The 14-member Palestinian body will be headed by Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister in the Western-backed Palestinian Authority who had been in charge of developing industrial zones, the Palestinian sources said.

Other members tapped by Nickolay Mladenov, the former U.N. Middle East envoy who is expected to represent the Board of Peace on the ground, include people from the private sector and NGOS, according a list of the names obtained by Reuters.

The first phase of Trump's plan, which included a ceasefire and hostage release deal, has been shaken by issues including Israeli airstrikes in Gaza that have killed hundreds of people, a refusal by Hamas to disarm, the remains of one last Israeli hostage still not having been returned and Israeli delays in reopening Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt.

Although the two sides accuse each other of breaching the deal, Trump says he wants to move on to the second phase, a progression that would entail the establishment of the Board of Peace and a yet-to-be-agreed deployment of peacekeeping forces.

Hamas leaders and other Palestinian factions are in Cairo for talks on the second phase, the group said. Egyptian sources said talks with Hamas would now focus on the group's disarmament.

Hamas has so far not agreed to lay down its weapons, saying it will only give up its weapons once there is a Palestinian state. Further Israeli withdrawals within Gaza are tied to disarmament.

Members of the technocratic Palestinian committee were expected to meet with Mladenov in Cairo on Wednesday. Hamas and its rival Fatah group, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, have both endorsed the list of members, Egyptian and Palestinian sources said.

It will also include the head of the Gaza Chamber of Commerce Ayed Abu Ramadan and Omar Shamali, who has worked for the Palestinian Telecommunication Group PALTEL, the Palestinian sources said.

Israeli officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:44:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CUFFLM3DEJLDXG6UM7FJUYWWF4.jpg?auth=f4028b3aac023f8114c37733ff42a51e5d2c30d8ed556b7c48a7bc2b4492dc1d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why Japan's Takaichi is gambling on an early election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/why-japans-takaichi-is-gambling-an-early-election-2026-01-14/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi plans to dissolve parliament's lower house next week, triggering a national election to decide all 465 seats in her first major election test since taking office in October .

She will announce details of the election on Monday, ruling Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Shunichi Suzuki said.

Japan's first female premier inherited a battered government, with the LDP having lost its majority in both houses of parliament after disgruntled voters punished it over rising prices and a funding scandal.

By calling a snap election now, she hopes to capitalise on a surge in public support for a new leader who has promised to spur economic growth, tackle cost-of-living concerns and tighten immigration rules.

Some media polls have put the LDP's support at more than 60%, giving Takaichi an opportunity to restore its majority in the more powerful lower chamber.

A poll of 1,213 people published by public broadcaster NHK on January 13 showed she had the backing of 62% of voters.

Even if she bags a lower-house majority, however, Takaichi will still have to govern with a minority in the upper house, which she cannot dissolve. Voters elect half of its members every three years and the next election is not due until 2028.

A decisive victory would strengthen her hand within the LDP and reduce her reliance on smaller political parties to pass key legislation.

That, in turn, could allow her to push ahead with plans to boost government spending to revive economic growth and sharply increase defence outlays under a revised national security strategy amid heightened tension with Japan's powerful neighbour China .

The shift could mark a further step from Japan’s post-war pacifist constraints, including a long-standing principle that bars nuclear weapons from the country's territory.

With prices still rising and the yen's value against the U.S. dollar sliding , the cost of living is likely to dominate the election campaign. In the NHK poll 45% of respondents said that was their main concern, followed by diplomacy and national security at 16%.

Her government has proposed record spending of $770 billion for the next fiscal year, a move that has unnerved investors in one of the world's most indebted industrial economies.

All 465 seats in the lower house will be contested, 289 in single-member districts and 176 through proportional representation. A simple majority requires 233 seats.

The LDP currently controls 199 seats in the chamber and governs with the support of its coalition partner the Japan Innovation Party, known as Ishin, which has 34 seats.

The main opposition party, the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), has 148 seats in the house, followed by the Democratic Party for the People (DPP) with 27. Komeito, which quit its 26-year coalition with the LDP after Takaichi became leader, has 24 seats.

Attention may also focus on how Takaichi fares against the far-right Sanseito Party , whose calls for tighter immigration controls siphoned votes from the LDP in last July's upper house election, where it won 14 seats.

By dissolving the lower house on January 23, Takaichi will trigger an official campaign period of around two weeks before voting day. If the LDP and Ishin secure a majority, she would be confirmed as prime minister in a special parliamentary session.

If not, she may be forced to seek new coalition partners or the support of other smaller parties, a setback that would weaken her authority.

In open , opens new tab letters , opens new tab published on Wednesday, the coalition accused the Elon Musk-owned apps of generating illegal content that violates both companies' terms of service.

The push, whose backers include the feminist group UltraViolet, the National Organization for Women, the liberal group MoveOn, and the parent advocacy group ParentsTogether Action, is aimed at piling pressure on Musk after Grok began generating sexually charged, degrading, or violent images of women and children.

"We are really imploring Apple and Google to take this extremely seriously," Jenna Sherman, UltraViolet's campaign director, told Reuters ahead of the letter's release. "They are enabling a system in which thousands, if not tens of thousands, of people, particularly women and children, are being sexually abused through the help of their own app stores."

X did not return a message seeking comment on the letter. Its parent company, xAI, which powers Grok, responded with the words, "Legacy Media Lies." Google and Apple have not returned repeated messages seeking comment about X and Grok.

Scrutiny continues to build after X was flooded with hyper-realistic images of women and minors in skimpy clothing at the turn of the new year.

Malaysia and Indonesia have already banned Grok over the explicit content, while authorities in Europe and the United Kingdom have announced investigations or demanded answers.

Separately, some organizations and leaders are pulling back from X. On Tuesday, the American Federation of Teachers announced it was quitting the social network over indecent images of children produced by Grok.

While X has adjusted the chatbot's behavior so that images Grok generates or edits are not posted to the public timeline, a Reuters test of Grok on Tuesday showed it was still generating bikini-clad versions of people's photographs on demand.

Sherman said while Apple and Google both claim to take child protection seriously, their treatment of X would reveal "what their values actually are in practice."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 11:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VU3G4YSWZ5IXNEEIEXVW57Q4PY.jpg?auth=2447f678233cef3c084f4db8550947448bcf93a719c4d2a91806742d3df320ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU's von der Leyen: Greenlanders can count on us</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eus-von-der-leyen-greenlanders-can-count-us-2026-01-14/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The European Commission's President Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday there is a strong relationship between the EU and Greenland and that Greenlanders could rely on the EU's support.

Unidentified drones struck at least two oil tankers in the Black Sea on Tuesday, including one chartered by U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab , as they sailed toward a terminal on the Russian coast to load oil from Kazakhstan.

Kazakhstan's foreign ministry said in a statement that three tankers were hit en route to the marine terminal of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) in the Black Sea.

On November 29, drones also attacked CPC's exporting equipment, resulting in a fall in oil exports via the outlet.

"The increasing frequency of such incidents highlights the growing risks to the functioning of international energy infrastructure," the ministry said in a statement.

"We therefore call upon our partners to engage in close cooperation to develop joint measures aimed at preventing similar incidents in the future," it added.

Russian defence ministry said on Wednesday that the Matilda tanker, sailing under the Maltese flag, came under attack by two Ukrainian strike drones at a distance of about 100 kilometres (62 miles) from the city of Anapa in Russia's Krasnodar region.

Ukraine did not comment on the incident.

Shareholders in CPC's 1,500-km (930-mile) pipeline include Kazakhstan's state-owned oil company KazMunayGas, Russia's Lukoil (LKOH.MM) , opens new tab and units of U.S. oil giants Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab and ExxonMobil .

Russian terminals on the Black Sea handle more than 2% of global crude. Its waters, which are shared by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and Turkey, as well as Russia and Ukraine, are also crucial for the shipment of grain.

CPC alone accounts for around 80% of oil exports from Kazakhstan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3YBDRZHSNOQFCQAHTYFEP6LII.jpg?auth=7c19cb11265289de0e5f9bcee1026d479f634ac1b59a5e84e86932df652c4285&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK prosecutors try to reinstate terrorism charge against Kneecap rapper</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/uk-prosecutors-try-reinstate-terrorism-charge-against-kneecap-rapper-2026-01-14/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - British prosecutors sought to reinstate a terrorism charge against a member of Irish rap group Kneecap on Wednesday for displaying a flag of Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah at a London gig, after a court threw out the case last year.

Liam Óg Ó hAnnaidh, whose stage name is Mo Chara, was accused of having waved the flag of the banned militant group Hezbollah during a November 2024 gig.

The charge was thrown out in September after a court ruled it had originally been brought without the permission of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General, and also one day outside the six-month statutory limit.

But the Crown Prosecution Service said it would challenge the ruling and its lawyer Paul Jarvis told London's High Court on Wednesday that permission was only required by the time Ó hAnnaidh first appeared in court, meaning the case can proceed.

Kneecap – known for their politically charged lyrics and support for the Palestinian cause – have said the case is an attempt to distract from what they described as British complicity in Israel's genocide in Gaza. Israel strongly denies committing a genocide in the tiny coastal territory.

J.J. Ó Dochartaigh, who goes by DJ Próvaí, was in court but Ó hAnnaidh was not required to attend and was not present.

Ó hAnnaidh was charged in May with displaying the Hezbollah flag in such a way that aroused reasonable suspicion that he supported the banned group, after footage emerged of him holding the flag on stage while saying "Up Hamas, up Hezbollah".

Kneecap have previously said the flag was thrown on stage during their performance and that they "do not, and have never, supported Hamas or Hezbollah".

The group, who rap about Irish identity and support the republican cause of uniting Northern Ireland with the Republic of Ireland, have become increasingly vocal about the war in Gaza, particularly after Ó hAnnaidh was charged in May .

During their performance at June's Glastonbury Festival in England, Ó hAnnaidh accused Israel of committing war crimes, after Kneecap displayed pro-Palestinian messages during their set at the Coachella Festival in California in April.

Kneecap have since been banned from Hungary and Canada , also cancelling a tour of the United States due to a clash with Ó hAnnaidh's court appearances.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BNAVQFT7CBP6TLE2EB4XN7W2YU.jpg?auth=f15023533f57c9ef9ac1488583b99f5e54b01a57d0894789343ec2c4d34238ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says attack on oil tanker near CPC was carried out by Ukrainian drones</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-says-attack-oil-tanker-near-cpc-was-carried-out-by-ukrainian-drones-2026-01-14/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry said on Wednesday that an attack on the oil tanker Matilda in the Black Sea on January 13 was carried out by two Ukrainian strike UAVs about 100 km from the city of Anapa in Russia's Krasnodar region.

The no-confidence motions, filed by the far-right National Rally (RN) and hard-left France Unbowed (LFI), aim to protest the European Union's trade agreement with the Mercosur bloc.

Despite French opposition, EU member states last week approved the signing of the long-debated deal with Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The RN and LFI accuse the government of not doing enough to block it.

“The French executive never really gave itself the means to prevent the adoption of this agreement,” LFI said.

The two motions will be examined by the lower house of parliament in the afternoon.

The Socialist Party has ruled out backing them and the conservative The Republicans said they would not vote to censure the government over Mercosur.

“A motion of censure in France achieves nothing. It’s now in the European Parliament that the battle will take place,” The Republicans leader Bruno Retailleau told Europe 1/CNews.

Government insiders said Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu will let the no-confidence motions run their course before returning to the fraught budget talks.

NEXT ON THE AGENDA: TOUGH BUDGET TALKS

One of several options regarding the country's 2026 budget would be for the prime minister to invoke Article 49.3 of the Constitution to push through the finance bill without a vote, after negotiating a text with all groups except the RN and LFI, one government source said. That would almost certainly lead to more motions of no confidence.

Lawmakers are eager to end weeks of wrangling over the budget, even if it means the country's deficit remains near 5%, sources said.

President Emmanuel Macron, according to his entourage, wants a budget adopted in January and is "neutral" on how to achieve that.

Government spokeswoman Maud Bregeon said on Tuesday that "nothing is excluded" to pass the budget. Lecornu, who last week warned of a possible dissolution of parliament if his government fell, later softened his tone: "I want neither censure nor dissolution. My fight is for stability and against disorder," he told Le Parisien.

France's political situation has been fragile since 2022, when Macron lost his majority in parliament.

His problems worsened when he unexpectedly called early legislative elections in mid-2024, only to deliver a hung parliament split between three distinct ideological blocs: his centre-right alliance, the left, and the far-right RN.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CERWTDWCLNNL3OQVVJM6UMMCPA.jpg?auth=737bd1f6e0fa9f30a9f53926e4deefc782efdc4e2b9d62f2c7e9056749c25218&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine lawmakers appoints former PM Shmyhal as energy minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-lawmakers-appoints-former-pm-shmyhal-energy-minister-2026-01-14/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Ukrainian lawmakers appointed former prime minister Denys Shmyhal as energy minister and first deputy prime minister on Wednesday amid escalating Russian strikes on the power sector.

The activists, identified as members of a group called "Raise the Colours" that was involved in a national flag-raising campaign, seek to find and destroy boats used to carry migrants and spread propaganda on France's northern coast calling on the British public to join the movement to stop migration, according to the French interior ministry.

"Our rule of law is non-negotiable, violent or hate-inciting actions have no place on our territory," French Interior Minister Laurent Nunez wrote on social media platform X on Wednesday.

The ministry said in a statement it had been informed of the group's activities in December last year and that it had referred the matter to the relevant authorities, as the actions were likely to cause "serious disturbances" to public order.

"Raise the Colours" describes itself as a grassroots movement that began in the central English city of Birmingham, when a small group started tying national flags to lampposts in a show of national pride. It says the effort has since spread across the UK.

The widespread display of the red-and-white St George's Cross for England and the Union Jack for Britain has prompted concern among some migrant communities as a reflection of rising anti‑immigration sentiment in the country, coinciding with a wave of protests outside hotels housing asylum seekers last year.

Neither the group nor the British Foreign Office immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment.

Immigration and the crossings of small boats carrying migrants from France have become a focal point for British voters and has helped propel Nigel Farage's right-wing, anti-immigration Reform UK party, into a commanding opinion poll lead.

Farage last year in London met the leader of French far-right National Rally (RN) party, Jordan Bardella, who has accused France of being too soft on immigration.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U5NSDG5SL5KYJMZG33XCGMR2WU.jpg?auth=1cd8d047e96c4fb76c5645f72a2a9b40fb2f914947f5322f2dee0a465d137117&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Lavrov says the U.S. is smashing the world around with its raid on Venezuela and threats to Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russias-lavrov-says-us-is-smashing-world-around-with-its-raid-on-venezuela-2026-01-14/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday that the United States was fragmenting the very international system which Washington helped to create by undertaking what he said was an illegal operation to topple Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and by threatening Iran with attack.

"We are talking about a gross violation of international law," Lavrov said of the U.S. operation to capture Maduro. He added that Russia remained committed to its agreements with Venezuela, a Russian ally.

"In general, this and other actions in the international arena indicate the line of our American colleagues to break the entire system that has been created for many years with their participation," he said.

Lavrov, who has served as foreign minister since 2004, said the entire international order - along with globalisation - had been "flushed down the drain" and was now fragmenting.

When asked about U.S. threats against Iran, Lavrov said that Moscow needed to keep working with Tehran to implement their bilateral agreements and that no other country could change the nature of ties between Russia and Iran.

Lavrov suggested that the United States, by abandoning the principles it had promoted for so long, was damaging its own image.

"Our American colleagues look unreliable when they act in this way," Lavrov told a news conference with his Namibian counterpart in Moscow.

Asked about a Bloomberg report that White House envoy Steve Witkoff and U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner are seeking to travel to Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin, Lavrov said that Putin had repeatedly said that he is open to serious discussions about peace in Ukraine.

It would, Lavrov said, be helpful if Washington briefed Moscow on the latest peace proposals for Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 12:47:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IVRR47ZN3NPO3BEA5ZTID4XXDM.jpg?auth=8348685653ad5e74ab5bcae42f248b247f44cedbc73512d0001bbff7ecca01bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron on Greenland: If sovereignty of an ally is affected, knock-on effects would be unprecedented</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-greenland-if-sovereignty-an-ally-is-affected-knock-on-effects-would-be-2026-01-14/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - If the sovereignty of a European country and ally was affected, the knock-on effects would be unprecedented, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday during a cabinet meeting, referring to the U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take control of the Arctic territory .

"We do not underestimate statements on Greenland," Macron said, quoted by French government spokesperson Maud Bregeon.

"If the sovereignty of a European country and ally were to be affected, the knock-on effects would be unprecedented. France is monitoring the situation very closely and will act in full solidarity with Denmark and its sovereignty." he added.

Immigration has become a central political issue in the United Kingdom, as the government seeks to stem a wave of undocumented migrants arriving on English shores after paying smugglers to cross the Channel.

The arrivals have fuelled rising anger on the British far right, and since last year videos have circulated of anti-migrant activists visiting France to take matters into their own hands.

France's interior ministry said it took action following reports that members of the "Raise the Colours" movement had conducted anti-migrant activities in France.

On Tuesday, "territorial bans were issued against 10 British nationals, identified as activists within the movement and having carried out actions on French soil", it said.

It did not immediately name the 10 people, or the exact nature of their actions in France.

But French authorities have opened an investigation over an alleged "aggravated assault" on migrants in September in a coastal area near the northern city of Dunkirk.

Four men carrying British and English flags verbally and physically assaulted a group of migrants in Grand-Fort-Philippe on the night on September 9 to 10, telling them they were not welcome in England, a charity working with migrants told AFP.

"Raise the Colours" denounced the ban as "absolutely disgraceful" in a post to X.

Another of its social media accounts, this one on Instagram, whose profile logo includes the words "Operation France", late last year posted videos of anti-immigration activists on France's northern coastline.

In one video posted in November, a man filmed himself on a French beach, saying he had found a small inflatable boat buried in the sand and had slashed it.

"That is not going to England," said the man, who elsewhere has called himself Ryan Bridge.

In another post published earlier the same month, he waded into the sea shouting at what appeared to be dozens of undocumented migrants boarding an inflatable dinghy on their way to England.

"You're not welcome in our country," he said, calling the passengers "potential rapists, murderers and child abusers".

The debate about immigration in the United Kingdom last year triggered a new trend of flying English and British flags.

Russian national Vladimir Motin, captain of the Solong that hit the anchored Stena Immaculate tanker in March 2025, tried to take his vessel off autopilot shortly before the crash but was unsuccessful, his lawyer said.

Motin, 59, is on trial at the Old Bailey charged with the gross negligence manslaughter of Solong crew member Mark Pernia, 38, whose body has never been found but is presumed dead. Motin has pleaded not guilty.

His lawyer James Leonard said Motin had a duty to avoid the collision and that there was "no doubt that the collision caused the sad death of Mr Pernia".

"On the simple basis of failing to avoid a collision with the Stena Immaculate, there is no doubt that the defendant was at fault," Leonard added.

But he told the jury they would have to consider whether any fault by Motin actually caused the collision and whether it was "grossly negligent as compared with something less than that".

Motin was aware of the Stena Immaculate from the Solong's radar from "at least nine nautical miles (16.7 kilometers) away" while the Solong was controlled by autopilot, Leonard said.

He added that, when the Solong was around one nautical mile away from the Stena Immaculate, Motin tried to take the Solong out of autopilot to manually change course.

"There is no dispute that, had he changed course in the way he intended, there would have been no collision," Leonard said.

He told the jury that they would have to consider why Motin waited until the Solong was one nautical mile away and whether that was reasonable.

Prosecutor Tom Little said on Tuesday that Motin, who has pleaded not guilty to gross negligence manslaughter, did "absolutely nothing" to prevent the collision.

The trial is expected to conclude next month.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ND3S3PQ7RFKBPFGXAHRYVBEPGU.jpg?auth=20f4982773f8d2fef38e28f407c491572753b18a75017a117e1b35577023a982&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU assembly weighs freezing US trade deal over Trump's Greenland threats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-assembly-weighs-freezing-us-trade-deal-over-trumps-greenland-threats-2026-01-14/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The European Parliament is considering putting on hold the European Union's implementation of the trade deal struck with the United States in protest over threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to seize Greenland .

The European Parliament has been debating legislative proposals to remove many of the EU's import duties on U.S. goods - the bulk of the trade deal with the U.S. - and to continue zero duties for U.S. lobsters , initially agreed with Trump in 2020. It was due to set its position in votes on January 26-27, which the MEPs said should now be postponed.

Leading members of the cross-parliamentary trade committee met to discuss the issue on Wednesday morning and decide whether to postpone the vote. In the end, they took no decision and settled on reconvening next week. A parliamentary source said left-leaning and centrist groups favoured taking action, such as a postponement.

A group of 23 lawmakers also urged the EU assembly's president Roberta Metsola on Wednesday to freeze work on the agreement as long as the U.S. administration continued its threats to take control of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark .

"If we go through and approve a deal that Trump has seen as a personal victory, while he makes claims for Greenland and refuses to rule out any manner in which to achieve this, it will be easily seen as rewarding him and his actions," the letter drafted by Danish lawmaker Per Clausen said.

Signatories were mainly fellow members of Clausen's Left Group, but also included centre-left Social Democrats and Greens.

Greens lawmaker Anna Cavazzini said the only argument in favour of the deal was to bring stability.

"Trump's actions show again and again that chaos is his only offer," she said.

French lawmaker Valerie Hayer, head of the centrist Renew Europe group, said on Tuesday the EU should consider holding off a vote if Trump's threats continued.

Many lawmakers have complained that the U.S. trade deal is lopsided, with the EU required to cut most import duties while the U.S. sticks to a broad rate of 15%.

However, freezing the deal risks angering Trump, which could lead to higher U.S. tariffs. The Trump administration has also ruled out any concessions, such as cutting tariffs on spirits or steel, until the deal is in place.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:42:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XJZ2JZ66XJOA5I3ZP4X5ARC5DU.jpg?auth=559fd50e1182c4ebe0a32462afa6ce1fce5172470529692b1ee5a59cae5dce2f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US withdrawing troops from key Middle East bases as precaution, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-withdrawing-troops-key-middle-east-bases-precaution-us-official-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The United States is withdrawing personnel from key bases in the region as a precaution given heightened regional tensions, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"I have been informed this morning that X is acting to ensure full compliance with UK law," Starmer told parliament, adding that the government would take further measures if needed.

Ofcom launched an investigation into the social media platform on Monday over concerns Grok was creating sexually intimate deepfake images in violation of its duty to protect people in the UK from illegal content.

Technology minister Liz Kendall said a new law making it an offence to create sexual deepfakes would come into force this week to tackle the images, which she called "weapons of abuse".

X did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It said earlier in January that it has restricted requests to undress people in images to paying users.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:42:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDOW7TR7MJKTBLPPD54L5VE5K4.jpg?auth=6d5c604c05b951d67005d290dbec73597e21d7ae1b87f413576fc814ae93b7b2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians arrive in Turkey through border gate as crackdown persists</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranians-arrive-turkey-through-border-gate-crackdown-persists-2026-01-14/</link><description>KAPIKOY, Turkey, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Dozens of Iranians crossed the border into Turkey on Wednesday, as authorities in Iran crack down on one of the biggest ever waves of protest against the Islamic Republic's clerical rule.

U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iranians on Tuesday to keep protesting, saying help is on the way. A rights group said 2,600 people have been killed in Iran as the clerical rulers try to quash the major wave of dissent.

Iranian families and individuals arrived in Turkey's eastern province of Van through the Kapikoy border gate, pulling luggage and other belongings with them as they made their way through the border gate and got on vehicles heading for nearby towns.

Those asked to speak to media declined to do so, expressing fear of repercussions in Iran when they return.

Two diplomats have told Reuters there has been an increase in the numbers of people crossing from Iran to Turkey after several countries advised their citizens to leave.

However, a Turkish security official at the border said that the situation at the gate was not extraordinary, with no notable increase in the numbers arriving, but that developments there were being closely monitored.

The U.S. has urged its citizens to leave Iran immediately, and advised them to consider departing by land to Turkey or Armenia, according to a notice released on Tuesday by the U.S. virtual embassy in Tehran.

Tehran has warned neighbouring countries hosting U.S. troops that it would retaliate against American bases if Washington carries out threats to intervene in protests in Iran, a senior Iranian official told Reuters on Wednesday.

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan stressed the need for talks to resolve current regional tensions in a call with his Iranian counterpart, Abbas Araqchi, on Wednesday, a Turkish Foreign Ministry source said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:42:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDLSGGUSWBLNHI4G2RTY34KMHU.jpg?auth=532908ee98a8b306e1f000efc524dc3dc045c6fb1b626f17174de71c4b2227bd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's main opposition widens lead over PM Orban's Fidesz, two surveys show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hungarys-main-opposition-widens-lead-over-pm-orbans-fidesz-two-surveys-show-2026-01-14/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Hungary's main opposition Tisza party has widened its lead over Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz, two polls showed on Wednesday, ahead of an April election in which the veteran nationalist is seeking to retain his 16-year grip on power.

Orban, in power since 2010, is facing a strong challenger for the first time in the April 12 parliamentary vote , with the outcome having major implications not only for Hungary but for Europe and its far-right political forces.

The polls show Fidesz is still struggling to recoup ground despite numerous voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation.

Tisza, a centre-right party led by former government insider Peter Magyar, has extended its lead over Fidesz to 12 percentage points, up from a 10-point lead in a November survey, pollster Median said in an article published by news website hvg.hu.

Magyar's party, which was only launched in 2024, had the support of 51% of decided voters, up from 50% in November.

Support for Fidesz dropped to 39% from 40% two months ago, according to the survey conducted between January 7 and 13.

Median researchers said Tisza was mostly luring away voters from other opposition parties, not Fidesz, but the ruling party was failing to lure new voters despite fiscal giveaways and efforts to tap into voter fears about the Ukraine war.

Apart from the two main parties, only the far-right Our Homeland (Mi Hazank) party has a chance to reach the 5% threshold for getting into parliament, the Median survey showed.

A second poll published on Wednesday, conducted by Idea Institute, put support for Tisza at 48% among decided voters, 10 points ahead of Fidesz. That survey was conducted between December 31 and January 6.

Magyar has said he would keep Hungary firmly anchored in the European Union and NATO and seek "pragmatic relations" with Russia, in contrast to Orban, who counts U.S. President Donald Trump among his allies, has maintained cordial ties with Moscow and has often clashed with Brussels.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:42:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HEIZLLXTZNMC5LTRGXR7NUKNTY.jpg?auth=fd7dec66e706622476e4713238b33813cc2b39129003f30c9c7582aa7c805aef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France studying possible transfer of Eutelsat terminals to Iran, foreign minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-studying-possible-transfer-eutelsat-terminals-iran-foreign-minister-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - France's foreign minister said on Wednesday that Paris was looking at the possibility of sending Eutelsat satellite terminals to Iran to help provide internet services after the recent communications blackout imposed by the Iranian authorities.

U.S. President Donald Trump redesignated Nigeria "a country of particular concern" in November and promised military action if it failed to crack down on the killing of Christians.

The Nigerian government says it is working hard to tackle Islamist and other groups which have attacked both Muslim and Christian civilians and that there is no systematic persecution.

It hired Washington-based consulting firm DCI Group for an initial six months for $4.5 million, with a similar amount due for another six months, a filing with the U.S. Department of Justice dated December 18 and posted on the DOJ website showed.

DCI and the Nigerian presidency did not immediately comment on the filing, which appeared in Nigerian media on Wednesday.

The agreement says DCI would help the Nigerian government "in communicating its actions to protect Nigerian's (sic) Christian communities and maintaining U.S support in countering West African jihadist groups and other destabilizing elements".

Nigeria has faced a long-running Islamist insurgency in the northeast, armed kidnapping gangs in the northwest and clashes between largely Muslim cattle herders and mostly Christian farmers in the middle belt of the country.

The U.S. military carried out an airstrike in northwest Nigeria on Christmas Day, which Trump said had killed multiple Islamic State militants. Trump said in an interview with the New York Times published last week that there could be more strikes if Christians are killed.

On Tuesday, the U.S. military's Africa Command said it had delivered critical military supplies to Nigeria to bolster the West African country's operations, in a sign of increased cooperation between Washington and Abuja.

On its website, DCI says "we are seasoned political operatives, communication strategists" and "experts at re-framing external narratives, and in delivering the right message to the right audience."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:43:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VNQQIB3TF5IE7GT65BA3PLM55I.jpg?auth=c054701426f305509128eab9230e153023caef0cb25effe670882058ad859e88&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Major construction-linked accidents in Thailand</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/major-construction-linked-accidents-thailand-2026-01-14/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Dozens of people were killed on Wednesday after a crane collapsed onto a moving train in northeastern Thailand, in the latest in a series of construction accidents in recent years.

Here are some other fatal incidents involving construction in Thailand:

March 28, 2025 - A partially built 30-storey tower in the capital Bangkok collapsed during a 7.7 magnitude quake that struck central Myanmar, killing at least 89 people .

The construction was being carried out by a joint venture including Italian Thai Development PCL (ITD.BK) , opens new tab , a major construction company which was also involved in building the rail link in Wednesday's crane accident.

The president of ITD was charged in August along with 21 other suspects for breaching construction regulations and causing death through negligence. The case is still pending and he denied the charges when arrested.

March 15, 2025 - At least five people were killed and 27 injured after an under-construction bridge on the Rama III–Dao Khanong Expressway Project collapsed in Bangkok. The highway project also involved ITD in a joint venture.

Authorities launched an investigation and the contractors promised compensation to the victims. The incident prompted the national government to roll out a "contractor report card" system in August, to boost oversight of companies working on public infrastructure projects.

August 24, 2024 - Three workers, two Chinese nationals and one from Myanmar, were killed when a tunnel collapsed in Nakhon Ratchasima province in northeastern Thailand that is part of the same railway project where Wednesday's incident took place. The collapse occurred during heavy rain in the region.

November 29, 2024 - Four Myanmar and two Thai workers were killed in Samut Sakhon province, south of the capital Bangkok, in an accident at a construction site of an elevated motorway. Six people were also injured in the incident when a concrete segment and crane collapsed during construction of the highway.

The spokesperson added that Berlin is closely monitoring the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo , where deadly clashes broke out recently, also in close consultation with Damascus.

"The situation in Syria is such that it needs to be reassessed almost daily," the spokesperson said on Wednesday.

"I wouldn't want to give a new assessment of a specific situation at this moment. But I think we will have the opportunity to discuss this in more detail in the coming days."

"The German government is, of course, open to deepening relations and a fresh start with the new Syrian government," said the spokesperson at regular government press conference.

The spokesperson added that Berlin is closely monitoring the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo , where deadly clashes broke out recently, also in close consultation with Damascus.

"The situation in Syria is such that it needs to be reassessed almost daily," the spokesperson said on Wednesday.

"I wouldn't want to give a new assessment of a specific situation at this moment. But I think we will have the opportunity to discuss this in more detail in the coming days."

Germany's Bild newspaper, citing security and government source, reported on Tuesday that Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa is expected to visit Berlin early next week.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:44:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RFXNHNONARIGLEWYC53SBQCEII.jpg?auth=b85f526e41a7f3507a0a06d7c6312a1fcca548ba902661b7f6d2f8d3d8e1f5ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US control of Greenland ‘vital’ for Golden Dome</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260114-trump-says-us-control-of-greenland-vital-for-golden-dome</link><description>President Donald Trump said Wednesday that US control of Greenland was "vital" for his planned Golden Dome air and missile defence system.

"The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security. It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building," Trump, who has vowed to seize the Arctic island from ally Denmark, wrote on social media.

" NATO becomes far more formidable and effective with Greenland in the hands of the UNITED STATES. Anything less than that is unacceptable."

Trump's post came early on a day when top Danish and Greenlandic diplomats were to visit the White House for talks on Greenland with Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio .

Hours before the meeting was due to start, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen sought to ease US concerns about security in Greenland, telling AFP that Denmark was boosting its military presence there and was in talks with allies on "an increased NATO presence in the Arctic".

Trump for his part said that NATO "should be leading the way" in building the multi-layer missile defence system.

"IF WE DON'T, RUSSIA OR CHINA WILL, AND THAT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN!" Trump wrote.

The US leader has repeatedly threatened to take over the vast, strategic and sparsely populated Arctic island, and he has sounded emboldened since ordering a deadly January 3 attack in Venezuela that removed its president.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 13:47:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2af79eea-f148-11f0-a393-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25140745248832.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says 'much broader changes' needed to Ukraine's mobilisation system</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/zelenskiy-says-much-broader-changes-needed-ukraines-mobilisation-system-2026-01-14/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday that "much broader changes" were needed in the country's system for mobilising troops for the war with Russia.

Speaking at a lecture at the German Institute for Economic Research DIW Berlin on Wednesday, Lars Klingbeil said Europe must fundamentally rethink its approach as traditional alliances dissolve and trade becomes increasingly weaponized.

"We need more European patriotism," Klingbeil said. "That means when we make public investments, we use goods produced in Europe."

"The transatlantic alliance as we knew it is dissolving," Klingbeil said, noting the Trump administration's National Security Strategy shows the U.S. is "turning away from Europe politically and culturally".

The finance minister argued that trade is increasingly weaponized through subsidies, overcapacity, tariffs and export controls, putting pressure on Germany's export-oriented economy.

"We must become stronger and more sovereign so we don't become pawns of the great powers," Klingbeil said. "Those who believe we can simply export our way out of the current situation underestimate the upheavals taking place."

Klingbeil outlined a strategy centered on strengthening European unity, diversifying trade partnerships beyond the U.S., and protecting European markets from unfair competition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:27:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBOORRBXWBJ27HQYDL3D6P7L5Q.jpg?auth=c47a803347e4618cc940e1cdb193bf6b66b535afbf2f5d781cec5e1658f41e48&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK interior minister has no confidence in police chief after Israeli soccer fan ban</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-interior-minister-has-no-confidence-police-chief-after-israeli-soccer-fan-ban-2026-01-14/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - British interior minister Shabana Mahmood said on Wednesday she no longer had confidence in one of Britain's top police officers after his force recommended Israeli fans be barred from attending an Aston Villa soccer game last year.

The ban, imposed on security grounds, was condemned by both the British and Israeli governments, while Jewish community leaders accused the force of misrepresenting intelligence and undermining public confidence.

"We have witnessed a failure of leadership that has harmed the reputation and eroded public confidence in West Midlands Police and policing more broadly," Mahmood told parliament.

Craig Guildford, West Midlands chief constable, has offered his "profound apology" after admitting that an erroneous reference to a fictitious West Ham-Maccabi Tel Aviv match in a report about the decision was generated by Microsoft's Copilot artificial intelligence tool. He had previously said AI was not used in the report.

His police force has been accused of misrepresenting the threat from Maccabi's fans to justify the ban recommendation, raising questions about its priorities to different groups in the local diverse community.

"I must declare today that the chief constable of West Midlands Police no longer has my confidence," Mahmood said, after citing a report that highlighted shortcomings in the force's decision.

At a parliamentary hearing earlier in January, West Midlands Police said its recommendation was driven by public safety concerns, citing intelligence that some local residents were planning to "arm themselves" against visiting supporters.

However, lawmakers expressed frustration that no contemporaneous documentation was provided and the information only surfaced via a media report on the day of the hearing on January 6.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:27:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D3EQEU6SBZNU3HSDLRYV3WCYVA.jpg?auth=2699c91d4825a993bcb4b6f4048978b7caf40ee34a61e1037bdb18ce4ebf0cbe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who are the Greenland and Denmark foreign ministers meeting Trump's team?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/who-are-greenland-denmark-foreign-ministers-meeting-trumps-team-2026-01-14/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt and her Danish counterpart Lars Lokke Rasmussen are meeting U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday, amid President Donald Trump's repeated threats to seize control of Greenland .

Analysts have described it as the most important meeting in modern Danish history . These are the two ministers working to navigate the crisis on behalf of the Kingdom of Denmark:

Vivian Motzfeldt, 53, grew up as a sheep farmer's daughter in southern Greenland . At seven years old she moved to a boarding school and when she was 17 she went to the United States on a student exchange programme, according to an interview she gave to daily Sermitsiaq in 2019.

Her official resume shows she worked as a teacher at various Greenlandic schools from 1997-2014 before entering politics. She is married and has four children.

Motzfeldt has been serving as minister of foreign affairs since 2022 and previously served as speaker of Inatsisartut, the parliament of Greenland and as the chair of Greenland's constitutional committee.

"She appears to be a pragmatic politician who understands the power game," Mette Marie Staehr Harder, assistant professor at the University of Copenhagen who has analysed Motzfeldt's social media posts, told Reuters.

Motzfeldt has not hesitated to publicly criticise Denmark when she believes Greenlandic interests are sidelined.

"If she has a case, she is not afraid to challenge whoever it may be," Harder said.

Motzfeldt has repeatedly made clear that Greenland does not want to be part of the United States but is open to more cooperation.

"My greatest hope is that the meeting will lead to a normalisation of our relationship," Sermitsiaq quoted her as saying on Wednesday.

Lars Lokke Rasmussen, 61, a two-time prime minister and a former finance minister, is the ultimate veteran of Danish politics, serving as the Nordic country's foreign minister since 2022.

A law degree holder and widely regarded as a skilled negotiator, he led a centre-right coalition government from 2009 to 2011 and again from 2015 to 2019 as head of Denmark's Liberal Party.

He eventually resigned from the Liberals after his government lost the 2019 election, forming a new centrist group, the Moderate Party, of which he is now the leader.

A strong advocate for the rule of law at home and abroad, Rasmussen adheres to a "pragmatic idealism" in foreign policy, meaning that Denmark should approach the world as it is, realistically and pragmatically, while maintaining principles of democracy and human rights.

He has weathered controversies during his decades in politics, including over the spending of party money on drinks, taxis and underwear, but bouncing back each time with a down-to-earth image appreciated by many Danes.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:28:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VVP5BKV34JII7JTNILK7ZBOCUM.jpg?auth=70c52481d8437d9435dcd59c355bfac6dcdd48bafffba37650cc7ced5b883e50&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's comments on Greenland to be taken seriously, French Prime Minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trumps-comments-greenland-be-taken-seriously-french-prime-minister-says-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 14:28:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hungary sets parliamentary election date</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/hungary-sets-parliamentary-election-date</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:00:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fb6ed93a-f14d-11f0-a91d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-131609-131751-CS-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deaths outnumber births in France</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/deaths-outnumber-births-in-france</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:00:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c4d79722-f14d-11f0-918f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-131937-132122-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran tops Netanyahu's many challenges as Israeli elections loom</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-tops-netanyahus-many-challenges-israeli-elections-loom-2026-01-14/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will face voters this year for the first time since the 2023 Hamas attack shook his security credentials, with the outcome of the latest crisis in Iran likely to be key to salvaging his legacy, analysts say.

Successive polls since late 2023, including all those by the three main news channels in Israel over the past month, have shown Netanyahu losing the election, due in October.

Israel's longest-serving prime minister is facing disagreements within his right-wing coalition over a military conscription law. He is on trial for corruption and has been blamed for security failures over the Hamas attack , the single deadliest day in Israel's history.

The unrest in Iran, where U.S. President Donald Trump is wielding the threat of strikes, may support Netanyahu's fortunes, analysts say.

His top goal, said Udi Sommer, a political scientist at Tel Aviv University, "would be to make sure that this regime is gone either by the time this term is over, or if not then, then in the next term."

"So if you think about it as a legacy-defining term certainly for somebody who thinks of himself as the person who is going to be remembered in history as the one who secured the country, then you might want another one just to make sure that this is really set in stone," he said.

Trump's threats against Iran have drawn warnings of retaliation, prompting Netanyahu to warn of "horrible consequences" for Tehran if it strikes Israel.

Netanyahu's security cabinet was briefed on Tuesday about the chances of the Iranian government collapsing and the prospect of U.S. intervention, an Israeli government official said.

The assessment, according to another Israeli official, is that Trump has decided to intervene but the scope and timing of this action remains unclear.

For now, Netanyahu, who has warned Iran against rebuilding its nuclear and ballistic capabilities after a 12-day Israel-Iran war in June, has not signalled an imminent desire to get involved.

"Israel supports their struggle for freedom and strongly condemns the mass killings of innocent civilians," Netanyahu said on Sunday. "We all hope that the Persian nation will soon be liberated from the yoke of tyranny."

Netanyahu's security credentials were hit hard by the surprise October 7 attack by Hamas militants on southern Israel, which killed 1,200 people and triggered the war in Gaza that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and laid waste to the enclave.

The Israeli leader has rejected responsibility for any security failures and has pointed to Israel's gains in weakening Iran's proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Their ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria has also been ousted.

However, public mistrust has been heightened by Netanyahu's push to form a government-empowered inquiry into any security lapses, rather than the expected independent investigation demanded by families of the victims and supported by a majority of Israelis.

On the domestic front, Netanyahu's governing coalition is also struggling to push through a new military conscription law .

Military service is mandatory in Israel but Netanyahu's ultra-Orthodox allies are seeking exemptions within their community.

However, a law that will satisfy the ultra-Orthodox leaders is likely to be unpopular among mainstream Israelis, all the more so after the Gaza war, which has exacted the highest Israeli military death toll in decades.

Without support from the ultra-Orthodox, Netanyahu's coalition may soon face an early election.

Netanyahu's government must get parliament's approval for the state budget by the end of March . If it cannot garner enough votes, a snap election will be held approximately 90 days later.

Without the ultra-Orthodox parties, which quit the government last year over the military conscription issue, Netanyahu controls less than half the seats in Israel's 120-member parliament.

Many Israeli political commentators see an early election likely in June.

"We're working under the assumption that the elections will be before October," said one official familiar with the matter.

LEGAL BATTLES: PARDON, PROBES, PROTESTS

Netanyahu's corruption trial , on charges of fraud, bribery and breach of trust, which he denies, is still ongoing. In November, he appealed to Israel's President Isaac Herzog for a pardon , a request backed by Trump.

Still under legal examination, the request if granted would be unprecedented and will likely draw strong backlash, adding fuel to protests against Netanyahu's government, which has partly resumed its contentious pre-war plan to overhaul Israel's judicial system .

Netanyahu is also dealing with a state probe into suspected wrongdoing in government purchases of submarines and missile boats from Germany, in which he denies any wrongdoing.

And he faces scrutiny over investigations into his aides' security leaks and alleged dealings with Qatar during the war. Though Netanyahu has not been named as a suspect, the probes have cast a shadow over his wartime conduct.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NWC322W7ONP4XD3QOTOLCRRZUE.jpg?auth=378e8adb640cab2ad61d7dc473a55e328cc6bff88d5942039ba80510a0637bb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Supreme Court does not issue ruling on Trump's tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/supreme-court-set-issue-rulings-with-trump-tariffs-case-still-pending-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court issued three decisions on Wednesday but did not decide the closely watched dispute over the legality of President Donald Trump 's global tariffs.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:28:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4P3MG2CF7NN43H2YKNRXCVAHVU.jpg?auth=6cd9b01cb607b7e72bf77c868c122aa27527f3fe74069f96bae25dbfcd32dbe9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italian judge acquits influencer Chiara Ferragni over charity fraud claims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italian-judge-acquits-influencer-chiara-ferragni-over-charity-fraud-claims-2026-01-14/</link><description>MILAN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - An Italian judge on Wednesday acquitted Italian fashion influencer Chiara Ferragni on charges of fraud over allegedly misleading claims linked to charity sales of a Christmas cake and Easter eggs, judicial and legal sources said.

The trial, held in a Milan court under a fast-track procedure, took place behind closed doors.

Prosecutors had requested a sentence of one year and eight months for aggravated fraud.

"The nightmare is over," Ferragni told reporters.

"I am very happy to take control of my life and get my life back. It has been a very difficult two years. I had faith in justice, and justice has been done," she added.

During a hearing in November, the influencer took the stand and stated that she had acted "in good faith", while her lawyer, Giuseppe Iannaccone, reiterated in his closing argument in December that "Chiara is innocent from every angle of this case. There is no crime."

Ferragni, who has some 28 million followers on Instagram, was fined almost 1.1 million euros ($1.14 million) in 2023 by Italy's competition authority (AGCM) over sales of Ferragni-branded Pandoro Christmas cakes with packaging mentioning a children's hospital.

She also agreed in 2024 to pay at least 1.2 million euros to a children's charity to settle the case concerning sales of Ferragni-branded Easter eggs.

"We remain firmly convinced that this matter has no criminal relevance and that every controversial element has already been addressed and resolved before the AGCM," her lawyers Iannaccone and Marcello Bana said in a statement at the time of her indictment last year.

In the case of the Ferragni-branded Pandoro, the allegation was that consumers had been duped into thinking that by buying those cakes they were contributing to charity for a children's hospital, the Turin-based Regina Margherita paediatric hospital.

Pandoro is an alternative to the more famous panettone.

In the Easter eggs case, the influencer is charged with misleading buyers into thinking they were supporting the "I Bambini delle Fate" children's charity.

Ferragni, who faced a slew of negative publicity and cancelled partnerships with other firms, admitted in December 2023 to "a communications error", while Italy's government, in direct response to the controversy, tightened rules on charity giving.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:28:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZGROKYJRNIULP3KDDVZB2YNFA.jpg?auth=4c6ab6d6d0e4106b1297372c89977103e7b4120c6e0575e01c2c6d73b5900f9d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Armed Kurdish groups sought to cross into Iran from Iraq, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/armed-kurdish-groups-sought-cross-into-iran-iraq-sources-say-2026-01-14/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Armed Kurdish separatist groups sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, in a sign of foreign entities potentially seeking to take advantage of instability after days of crackdown on protests against Tehran .

The three sources, who included a senior Iranian official and who all spoke on condition of anonymity, said neighbouring Turkey's intelligence agency had warned Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) of the Kurdish fighters crossing the frontier in recent days.

The Iranian official said the IRGC had clashed with the Kurdish fighters, who the official said sought to create instability and take advantage of the protests. The Guards are an elite force that has suppressed previous bouts of unrest in Iran.

The Turkish intelligence agency MIT did not immediately comment on the issue, nor did the presidency in Ankara. Turkey, which deems Kurdish militants in northern Iraq terrorists, has warned in recent days that any foreign intervention in Iran would escalate regional crises.

The fighters had been dispatched from Iraq and Turkey, the Iranian official said, adding that Tehran has asked those countries to halt any transfer of fighters or weapons to Iran.

A rights group said 2,600 people have been killed in recent days in a crackdown on Iranian protesters opposing clerical rule and who have been urged on by the United States, which has threatened to intervene.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:28:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to suspend visa processing for 75 nations next week, Fox News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-suspend-visa-processing-75-nations-next-week-fox-news-reports-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is suspending all visa processing for visitors from 75 countries starting January 21, Fox News reported on Wednesday, citing a memo from the U.S. State Department.

Representatives for the State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reported memo, which Fox News said directs U.S. embassies to refuse visas under existing law while the department reassesses its procedures. No time frame was provided.

The reported pause comes amid the sweeping immigration crackdown pursued by Republican U.S. President Donald Trump since taking office last January.

In November, Trump had vowed to "permanently pause" migration from all "Third World Countries" following a shooting near the White House by an Afghan national that killed a National Guard member.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NK4Y4IOFCBN2BMXOTQQRE7MONU.jpg?auth=7dce5b750329b1d4a59f8cec8445ac6c6ed80e59cd722c83d0d40a79830098ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal presidential race wide open with far-right just ahead, rare runoff vote is likely</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/portugal-presidential-race-wide-open-with-far-right-just-ahead-rare-runoff-vote-2026-01-14/</link><description>LISBON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Portugal's presidential election on Sunday is all but guaranteed to require a runoff vote for the first time in 40 years amid growing political fragmentation, and the race for a place in the second round is still wide open, a new opinion poll showed.

The presidency is a largely ceremonial role in Portugal but wields some key powers, including in some circumstances to dissolve parliament, to call a snap parliamentary election, and to veto legislation.

Andre Ventura, the far-right, anti-establishment leader of the main opposition party Chega, is marginally ahead on 24% of voting intentions, closely followed by Socialist Antonio Jose Seguro on 23%, according to the survey by Catolica University pollsters published by Publico daily on Wednesday.

Joao Cotrim de Figueiredo, a member of the European Parliament from the pro-business Liberal Initiative party, is also within striking range with 19%, given a 2.2% margin of error in the poll, which surveyed 1,770 voters.

Two other candidates, including Luis Marques Mendes backed by the ruling centre-right Social Democrats (PSD), have 14% each, the poll showed.

Smaller tracking polls in the past week showed even tighter distances between the top five presidential candidates.

In the five decades since Portugal threw off its right-wing dictatorship, a presidential election has only once before - in 1986 - required a runoff, highlighting how complex the political landscape has become with the rise of the far-right and voter disenchantment with the mainstream PSD and Socialist parties.

"Fragmentation of the electorate continues, making it likely that candidates from the two traditional parties will receive fewer votes than their parties secured" in last year's parliamentary election, which saw Chega overtake the Socialists, said political scientist Antonio Costa Pinto.

While Ventura led the latest survey, analysts point to his high rejection rate of more than 60% of voters in all recent opinion polls, which suggest that he would lose a runoff against any of the top four contenders.

But reaching the second round will likely be "a victory in itself" for Ventura, Costa Pinto said, giving Chega greater leverage with the minority centre-right government.

Jose Castello Branco of Lisbon's Catolica University said one thing appeared certain in what is "a completely open race" - that Ventura "is cementing his position in the Portuguese political spectrum" as the leader of the opposition.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4Y6WRLQQLBKVLG3A3P2ZO7CXBY.jpg?auth=58240267d9a8072af229035c368b937d55221469e4d9ca386d35a1815e77ef0b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What you need to know about Portugal's presidential election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/what-you-need-know-about-portugals-presidential-election-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:29:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>What you need to know about Portugal's presidential election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/what-you-need-know-about-portugals-presidential-election-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:29:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Thousands of Nigerians flee after gang leader threatens to kill them</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/thousands-nigerians-flee-after-gang-leader-threatens-kill-them-2026-01-14/</link><description>KANO, Nigeria, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Thousands of people fled their homes in northwestern Nigeria this week after the leader of one of the armed gangs in the region ordered them out in retaliation for a security raid, officials and residents said on Wednesday.

Officials say Bello Turji leads one of many armed gangs which terrorise predominantly Muslim northwest Nigeria, killing and abducting residents, farmers, students and motorists for ransom.

Violence in Africa's most populous country has attracted the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused the government of failing to prevent the killing of Christians. Nigeria says gangs and militants target both Christians and Muslims and that Christians are not systematically persecuted .

Residents of the northwestern Tidibale community say Turji suspects a tip-off from the community to security forces led to recent military operations that killed one of his men.

Turji visited Tidibale three days ago and killed three people to enforce his order to the community to leave, said Basharu Altine Guyawa, Sokoto state coordinator of the Movement for Social Justice and Good Governance.

"He told them if anyone remains when he returns, they will be killed. He said he will not spare even a chicken," Guyawa said.

Islamist militants from Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) and Boko Haram are also active in the region, where insurgency has persisted for 15 years. Last month, the United States carried out a strike against Islamic State militants in the northwest.

The Sokoto police spokesperson said residents were fleeing Tidibale community for fear of attack and that more police had been deployed to the area.

Local authorities have been evacuating people by truck to Isa, about 50 km (30 miles) away. Muhammad Ibrahim, secretary of the community security committee in Isa, said more than 3,000 people have been moved, including into the town's schools.

"There is a humanitarian crisis. Educational activities have stopped," Ibrahim said.

Tidibale lies about 100 km east of the state capital Sokoto. Local activists warn that dozens of villages have been abandoned as violence by armed gangs escalates in Nigeria's northwest.

"The past three weeks were horrific. Killings and abductions have persisted," said Usman Musa, a father of 15 who fled to Isa. "The government has ignored us. I want them to flush these bandits out."</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:49:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela journalist group says politician Roland Carreno freed in prisoner release</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-journalist-group-says-politician-roland-carreno-freed-prisoner-release-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - Venezuelan journalist union SNTP said on Wednesday that politician and journalist Roland Carreno has been freed in an ongoing prisoner release, as families continue to anxiously await an unknown number of releases promised by the government and hailed by the United States.

The releases, announced last week, are moving slowly, according to advocacy groups and families. Human rights organizations count some 800 political prisoners currently in the country, but so far just dozens have been freed.

Some of those released so far are Americans, the U.S. State Department said on Tuesday, without confirming how many were released nor their identities.

The release of political prisoners in the South American country is a long-running demand of rights groups, international bodies and opposition figures, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, who has several close allies imprisoned.

Both Venezuela's top lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez, the brother of acting President Delcy Rodriguez, and U.S. President Donald Trump have said the releases are a gesture of peace. Trump said he has canceled a second wave of attacks

For years, Venezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said the government uses detentions to stamp out dissent, a charge authorities have consistently denied. There is no official list of exactly how many prisoners will be released nor who they are.

The releases come after the U.S. capture of President Nicolas Maduro , his arraignment in a New York court on narcoterrorism charges, swearing-in of interim President Delcy Rodriguez and announcement that the U.S. would refine and sell up to 50 million barrels of crude oil stuck in Venezuela under U.S. sanctions.

Carreno is a former operations director for opposition party Voluntad Popular who was detained in October 2020, released in 2023 and then arrested again in 2024.

The families of both prominent and little-known detainees have anxiously awaited news, with many gathering outside prisons or visiting multiple detention centers in an attempt to discover where loved ones are held.

Among prominent detained figures are opposition politician Juan Pablo Guanipa and lawyer Perkins Rocha, both close allies of Machado, Rafael Tudares, son-in-law of the opposition's former presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez, opposition Voluntad Popular party leader Freddy Superlano and Javier Tarazona, director of an NGO which tracks alleged abuses by Colombian armed groups and the Venezuelan military.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 15:50:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U4IN2UAFE5P2NPHTBJL3MZNA4I.jpg?auth=5c5a4be004618fc42b160b80b02f4f21707fa013c8dea74be41be454d47cbf10&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>FBI searches home of Washington Post reporter, US attorney general says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/fbi-searches-home-washington-post-reporter-us-attorney-general-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - FBI agents searched a Washington Post reporter's home on Wednesday as part of an investigation into sharing secret government information, officials said, in a move that advocates said threatened press freedom.

The reporter, Hannah Natanson, has covered U.S. President Donald Trump 's campaign to fire hundreds of thousands of federal workers and shift remaining workers to implementing his agenda.

Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal agents had executed the search at the request of the Defense Department. Trump's Justice Department last year reversed a policy that had barred prosecutors from seizing records from reporters in most circumstances.

Natanson wrote a story in December about her personal experience covering the effort titled "I am The Post's 'federal government whisperer.' It's been brutal." In it, Natanson related the relentless pace of calls and messages she received from former and current federal employees frustrated by the changes.

The Washington Post said on X that investigators told Natanson she was not a focus of the probe. Natanson could not immediately be reached for comment.

The newspaper reported that Natanson was present for the search of her Virginia home on Wednesday. It reported that the search was linked to the case against Aurelio Perez-Lugones, a technology specialist for a U.S. government contractor who was charged last week with unlawful retention of national defense information.

Prosecutors alleged that Perez-Lugones took screenshots of classified intelligence reports and printed those documents, according to a criminal complaint.

Investigators also found documents marked "secret" in a lunchbox in Perez-Lugones' car and in his basement, according to an FBI affidavit.

"The Trump Administration will not tolerate illegal leaks of classified information that, when reported, pose a grave risk to our Nation’s national security," Bondi said on X.

Press-freedom advocates said the search was a dramatic escalation in the administration's ongoing attacks on news media.

"Searches of newsrooms and journalists are hallmarks of illiberal regimes, and we must ensure that these practices are not normalized here," said Jameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute.

Trump has often taken an antagonistic approach toward the news media and has filed lawsuits against the BBC, the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal and a newspaper in Iowa. All four outlets are fighting Trump in court. Others, including CBS and ABC, have paid millions of dollars to settle lawsuits by Trump alleging unfair coverage.

Under owner Jeff Bezos, the world's fourth-richest person, the Washington Post has shifted its formerly left-leaning opinion section to the right, but its news coverage remains nonpartisan.

The number of small boats arriving in the Canaries from the Gambia, south of Mauritania, more than doubled to 22 in 2025 from nine in 2024, according to the data.

Three boats from Guinea, further south still, also arrived in 2025, with one boat departing from its capital Conakry more than 2,000 kilometres (1,243 miles) from the Spanish archipelago, a journey that took 11 days.

Migrants and human rights groups say that police began clamping down on immigrants in Mauritania in March last year. It followed the signing of a pact with the European Union in 2024 aimed a curbing irregular migration.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez made three visits to Nouakchott in the past two years after arrivals to the Canaries reached a record 46,843 in 2024 and Mauritania became the main point of departure .

The European Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Red Cross data - gathered through interviews with arrivals in the Canaries - showed that departures from Mauritania fell by 89% to 23 between April 1 and December 31 last year compared to 216 in the same period of 2024.

Arrivals on the Canaries from West Africa were down 59% in 2025 through to October from a year earlier, Spain’s Interior Ministry says.

"The fact that people are leaving farther south on that route means that they have longer to travel, they need to get farther on supplies, they need money for fuel, all of which means that it's riskier still. The most lethal crossing to (Europe) is sadly set to become more lethal still," said Hassan Ould Moctar, a lecturer in the anthropology of migration at SOAS University of London.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:34:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RH6C34FQRZLZ3IBQW6KXVTT7WY.jpg?auth=3642ccf49c84ede4631002b58735fb3f9374c07a0af3c2834aabccecfc38b0bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Marine Le Pen changes her defence strategy</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/marine-le-pen-changes-her-defence-strategy</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:34:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/01000402-f165-11f0-8d17-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-161602-162031-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What do Greenlanders want amid rising political tensions?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/what-do-greenlanders-want-amid-rising-political-tensions</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:34:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/86914ece-f164-11f0-822f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-160758-160951-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Most Iranians realise that any US military action puts a further target on their backs'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/most-iranians-realise-that-any-us-military-action-puts-a-further-target-on-their-backs</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 16:34:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f7999dd8-f15a-11f0-ad2b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260114-130444-131108-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia taunts US: UN should monitor ship attacks in Caribbean, not Red Sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-taunts-us-un-should-monitor-ship-attacks-caribbean-not-red-sea-2026-01-14/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The U.N. Security Council on Wednesday asked U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to continue providing monthly reports on any further attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Yemen's Houthis, spurring Russia to taunt the United States.

"We believe that amid present-day realities, the Security Council would be well advised to monitor attacks on commercial transport in the Caribbean, not the Red Sea," Russia's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Anna Evstigneeva told the 15-member body.

Since September, the United States has carried out a campaign of strikes against suspected drug traffickers off the coast of Venezuela. There have been around 20 strikes that have killed more than 80 people. The U.S. has also seized five tankers as it stepped up efforts to curb Venezuelan oil exports.

The United States, speaking after Russia in the Security Council, did not respond to the Russian gibe.

Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Jennifer Locetta said the resolution adopted "reaffirms the council's responsibility for continued vigilance against the Houthi terrorist threat to the freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and surrounding waterways."

"The defense of freedom of navigation is a crucial element of international peace and security," she said.

Guterres has been reporting monthly to the Security Council for the past two years on attacks by the Iran-aligned Houthi group. The resolution adopted on Wednesday asked him to continue reporting for another six months.

The Security Council took action in January 2024 as Houthi attacks disrupted maritime commerce, prompting some shipping lines to divert vessels from the Red Sea to longer routes, threatening to increase energy and food prices.

The Houthis had vowed to attack ships linked to Israel or bound for Israeli ports to show support for Palestinian militants Hamas at war with Israel in Gaza . However, many of the targeted ships had no links to Israel. There have been no attacks in recent months.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:28:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XAMWCOWVNZN4RBNMVWZMQJJZHM.jpg?auth=85c5c869fe630bd7a6bc4fc2fe50e24ac37f3191e7e60b924fc84da3cdc8ee56&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French government survives second no-confidence vote over Mercosur trade deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-government-survives-second-no-confidence-vote-over-mercosur-trade-deal-2026-01-14/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's government on Wednesday survived a second vote of no confidence in the National Assembly that had been called in protest against the EU-Mercosur trade deal.

The gang was on the run and the value of their haul was not known. Italian media reported that a getaway car had been found close to Cortina, a town situated in the Dolomites in northern Italy.

The shop assistant was not injured during the raid.

Cortina, which has a resident population of only around 5,000 people, will be in the spotlight next month when it co-hosts the Winter Olympics with Milan.

For weeks now, his name has been shouted in the protests sweeping Iran . Reza Pahlavi , the son of the last shah of Iran overthrown in the 1979 revolution, has planted himself firmly in the spotlight – especially on social media – and clearly sees himself as the saviour Iran needs to move beyond the Islamic Republic.

Pahlavi has frequently addressed the protesters from his home in the US, where he has lived in exile for almost half a century. In regular video messages, he has urged the demonstrators to hold firm and build barricades in the streets, claiming that “victory is near”.

As demonstrations sparked by a worsening cost-of-living crisis set off nationwide protests against the government last week, Pahlavi called for Iranians to gather and chant together at 8pm for two nights straight. When Thursday night came, it became clear that his first "call to action" had not fallen on deaf ears.

“Several groups of young people began to gather in various neighbourhoods of Tehran,” FRANCE 24 correspondent Siavosh Ghazi reported from the Iranian capital in the early evening. “They chanted slogans against the government. We heard ‘Death to the dictator’ and ‘Prince, Iran is ready, we are waiting for you.’”

Videos later released on social media showed large crowds not only in Tehran, but in Shiraz, Babol, Arak, Tabriz and other cities across the country.

Since then, widespread demonstrations have been met with fierce reprisals from security forces . While the government’s internet blackout has made it difficult to judge the true toll, rights groups abroad have said that thousands of demonstrators and scores of security forces have been killed in the protests and the government’s brutal crackdown.

Pahlavi has continued to appear on US news channels, urging US President Donald Trump to intervene on the protesters’ behalf and saying that the struggle with the government is a question of life and death.

“This is a war, and war has casualties,” he told CBS News .

As images of morgues overflowing with body-bags began to circulate , Trump on Tuesday called on the Iranian demonstrators to “take over” government institutions, claiming that unspecified “help” was “on its way” . US news site Axios reported that Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff had met with Pahlavi to discuss the situation.

Pahlavi has repeatedly called on the government’s security forces to throw their support behind the protests. In one video released Sunday, he stood before the flag that flew over Iran prior to the Islamic Revolution , bearing the Shir-o-Khorshid – the lion and the sun – and called on the government’s supporters to break ranks.

“Employees of state institutions, as well as members of the armed and security forces, you have a choice,” he said. “Stand with the people and become allies of the nation or choose complicity with the murderers of the people and bear the nation’s lasting shame and condemnation.”

But despite the fact that his name is increasingly called out in street protests, his popularity – doubtless increased these past three years – remains hard to gauge.

“These calls for the shah do exist, but we must be cautious,” said Jonathan Piron, a historian specialising in Iran at the Brussels-based Etopia research centre. “The monarchists have a well-oiled political communication machine – and it is impossible to properly verify the extent of their slogans on the ground, since we cannot go see for ourselves.”

Most of these videos are posted on X – a social media platform owned by US-based tech billionaire Elon Musk , and run according to an opaque algorithm that Piron warned could distort reality like a “funhouse mirror”.

Armin Arefi, a journalist with French daily Le Point, also pointed out that slogans calling for Pahlavi’s return were “amplified by some of the Farsi-language opposition channels [Editor’s note: such as Iran International and Manoto] based overseas and committed to his cause”.

Pahlavi has for years been preparing his dynasty’s return from his home in the US, where he moved at the age of 17 for fighter pilot training just months before his father was overthrown by a popular revolution. His mother Farah Diba, the last empress of Iran, said in 2007 that her son had been “raised to take over as the crown prince”.

Pahlavi has only grown more self-assured with each crisis that shakes the Islamic Republic – crises that have become more frequent in recent years.

In 2009, as the country was swept by demonstrations protesting the contested re-election of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , the shah’s son called on the population to “keep on fighting with discipline” and urged security forces to remain neutral or engage in acts of civil disobedience.

But it was in 2023 with the outbreak of the “Woman, Life, Freedom” protests sparked by the death in custody of Mahsa Amini that Pahlavi began to make himself known. Alongside opposition figures including Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi and journalist Masih Alinejad, he pushed for a common front against the government.

As the protests grew in scale, his supporters launched a vast online petition named “Prince Reza Pahlavi is my representative”. Speaking to Manoto TV, a royalist Iranian station based in London, Pahlavi called for the organisation of free elections and the creation of a constituent assembly.

Building on his growing momentum, Pahlavi began to flit between foreign ministries to try to secure support – and to push the message that he was ready to take the reins of power. His entreaties have found the most support in Israel , where he stood side-by-side with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in April 2023 following a trip to “re-establish the historic relationship between Iran and Israel”.

Israel’s lethal missile strikes on Iran in June 2025 would bear the name “Operation Rising Lion” – a reference to the animal that rears on the crest of the Pahlavi dynasty.

Pahlavi did little to hide his ambitions during the 12-Day War , in which hundreds of civilians were killed in Israeli strikes. He described the bombardment as an “opportunity” and maintained that the Israeli government was not intentionally targeting civilians.

His wife Yasmine was less restrained, publishing a photo to Instagram showing graffiti that read “Hit them Israel , Iranians are behind you”. The Pahlavis’ open support for the deadly bombing campaign won disapproval even among a part of their support base.

According to the Israeli daily Haaretz, Israel was orchestrating a vast Farsi-language influence operation throughout the short-lived war that sought to portray Pahlavi as the legitimate face of Iran post-Islamic Republic. At the same time, the Israeli bombardment pushed the government closer to possible collapse.

The man who calls himself “prince” during his public appearances is impatiently waiting his moment. He has even proposed “a plan for Iran’s future”, a document laying out the first 100 days following the eventual fall of the Iranian government.

During an interview in July with German daily Bild , Pahlavi said that “the regime’s fall is no longer a question of ‘if’ but ‘when’.” In September, he celebrated the re-establishment of UN sanctions against Iran, describing the measure as a “victory for all those who have long been calling for maximum pressure on this regime” – even as the nation’s economy slipped deeper into crisis.

His media appearances have only increased following this latest wave of protests. In the Washington Post, Pahlavi spoke of a “coordinated opposition” and cheered Trump’s stated support for the Iranian people. The US president has threatened to hit Iran “very, very hard where it hurts” if more civilians were killed.

Presenting himself as “a steward of a national transition to democracy”, Pahlavi argued that the moment of the regime’s collapse was drawing near.

“Protesters are chanting my name alongside calls for freedom and national unity,” he wrote. “I do not interpret this as an invitation to claim power. I bear it as a profound responsibility.”

On Fox News , he proposed a referendum on the future democratic form of the government before saying he was ready to return to the country “at the first possible opportunity”.

But despite his attempt to sell himself as a unifying figure, support for Pahlavi is far from universal. Alongside chants of support for the shah’s son come other slogans, calling for “no shahs, no mullahs” – particularly in Iran’s universities.

“The circumstances surrounding his return raise questions,” Piron said. “If it is due to foreign intervention, he could be perceived as an imported figure.”

And while his name carries an inherited prestige for some, the memory of his father – who finished his reign a much-hated dictator – has also weighed heavily on Pahlavi. Despite this, the self-proclaimed crown prince has never truly denounced the tyranny of his father’s reign, marked by the frequent arrest, torture and killing of political opponents by the SAVAK secret police .

Some of the most feared military and security figures of this regime still number among Pahlavi’s staunchest supporters, including Parviz Sabeti , the former intelligence chief responsible for the torture and killing of the shah’s political opponents.

While his political programme remains vague, Pahlavi has long rubbed shoulders with American neo-conservatives and figures from the European far right . In 2025, invited to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference in the US , he spoke alongside right-wing personalities including Javier Milei , Nigel Farage , Giorgia Meloni , Steve Bannon , Elon Musk and Trump himself.

His supporters have even begun to roll out the slogan “MIGA” – “Make Iran Great Again” – a rallying cry echoed by the US president himself on multiple occasions.

This cosiness with the Trumpist right has not been shared by all of Pahlavi’s supporters.

“I’m not MIGA,” a recent Pahlavi supporter based in Tehran said last week. “Pahlavism isn’t the support of Reza Pahlavi as an individual, and it’s not a desire for a new monarchy. For me, it’s a synonym of nationalism , modernity and secularism .”

More broadly, Le Point journalist Arefi said, many of the protesters were motivated by a sense of the situation’s urgency rather than any deep attachment to Pahlavi.

“Today, their primary goal is to get rid of the mullahs at any cost,” he said. “For those chanting his name, Reza Pahlavi is the most legitimate figure, and that's why they support him.”

In this context, the shah’s son appears to many supporters as the figure best placed to give form to an alternative to the Islamic Republic. Not for who he is, but for what he has come to symbolise: the possibility, at last, of regime change.

The Eternal City's new limit of 30 kph (19 mph) throughout the historic centre takes effect from Thursday, almost halving the previous 50 kph limit in streets overwhelmed by residents, tourists and cars.

"These roads reflect a city built for cars that no longer exists," Rome's transport chief Eugenio Patane told daily Corriere della Sera.

"Lower speeds save lives," he added, citing data suggesting that speeding plays a role in 7.5% of the city's road accidents.

Rome's lower limit follows the example of European capitals such as London, Brussels, Paris and Helsinki which have already embraced slower, safer streets, in some cases overriding strong opposition from motorists.

The northern Italian city of Bologna saw road accidents fall by 13% and fatalities decline by around 50% in the year after it became the country's first major centre to impose a 30 kph speed limit in January 2024.

Rome's Mayor Roberto Gualtieri has increased the installation of speed cameras and urged residents to reduce their reliance on private cars since his election in 2021, amid growing concerns over safety and emissions.

Italy's Supreme Court ruled in November that people living on the city's congested ring road were entitled to 10,000 euros ($11,655) in compensation for their exposure to excessive noise and fine-particle pollution.

The lower speed limit is expected to reduce noise pollution by around 2 decibels in Rome's city centre, local authorities said.

The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) said it had served charges of bribery to an opposition party chief after exposing several other lawmakers last month as members of a "systemic" plot to receive payments in exchange for votes.

While the bureau did not identify Tymoshenko by name, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters she was the subject of the probe.

Tymoshenko, who rose to prominence two decades ago as a leader of the pro-democratic Orange Revolution, denied "all accusations" but didn't specifically address the probe.

In a Facebook post, she pledged to clear her name in court.

"This concerned not one-off arrangements, but a regular cooperation mechanism that envisaged advance payments and was designed for a long-term period," NABU said on Wednesday.

"Lawmakers were to receive instructions on how to vote," or not to vote at all.

Eradicating corruption is critical to Ukraine's effort to join the European Union, though recent revelations of graft have drawn attention to the scale of this endeavour .

NABU and anti-corruption prosecutors shocked Ukrainians last November by unveiling an alleged $100 million kickback scheme in the energy sector involving a former associate of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

The probe into Tymoshenko, a sharp-elbowed populist who launched her career in the 1990s, broadens an anti-graft campaign that has ensnared senior ministers and opposition lawmakers.

Tymoshenko served as prime minister in 2005 and again from 2007-2010. Her political influence in recent years has significantly diminished, with her Fatherland party holding around two dozen seats in Ukraine's 450-seat legislature.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:52:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SCIZLCVOTJNWBGURY2XH4AJ7YU.jpg?auth=77cb7927b894f433a72bb9bd789de86f75fa1ae1f70e838a6f7c8851c9389b17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Consensus reached on Gaza's post-war governance committee, Egypt says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260114-consensus-reached-on-gaza-post-war-governance-committee-egypt-says</link><description>Egypt said Wednesday that all the members of a 15-person Palestinian technocratic committee meant to administer post-war Gaza had been agreed upon by all Palestinian factions, who swiftly offered their support.

Under a 20-point Gaza truce plan brokered by US President Donald Trump in October, the Palestinian territory would be governed by the committee operating under the supervision of a so-called "Board of Peace", to be chaired by Trump himself.

Meanwhile, Trump's envoy said Wednesday that the plan to end the Gaza war was now moving to Phase Two with a goal of disarming Hamas , despite a number of Israeli strikes during the ceasefire .

"We are announcing the launch of Phase Two of the President's 20-Point Plan to End the Gaza Conflict, moving from ceasefire to demilitarization, technocratic governance, and reconstruction," envoy Steve Witkoff wrote on X.

Phase Two "begins the full demilitarisation and reconstruction of Gaza, primarily the disarmament of all unauthorised personnel".

"The US expects Hamas to comply fully with its obligations, including the immediate return of the final deceased hostage. Failure to do so will bring serious consequences," he said.

Hamas officials said earlier in the day that the group had opened talks with Egyptian mediators in Cairo on the committee.

"We hope that following this agreement, the committee will be announced soon... and will then be deployed to the Gaza Strip to manage daily life and essential services," Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said.

The majority of the Palestinian factions offered their support to the committee after Abdelatty's announcement.

In a statement, the factions including Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had agreed "to support the mediators' efforts in forming the Palestinian National Transitional Committee to administer the Gaza Strip, while providing the appropriate environment" for it to begin its work.

The Ramallah-based Palestinian presidency also announced its support in official media, with a source from the office telling AFP the statement "reflects the position of the Fatah movement because President (Mahmud) Abbas is also the head of Fatah".

The Cairo meeting aimed to address the formation of the committee and its operational mechanisms, a senior Hamas official had previously told AFP on condition of anonymity.

Separately, the Hamas delegation was also to hold talks in Cairo with leaders of other Palestinian factions on "political, national and field developments" and the state of the Gaza ceasefire, the official added.

Hamas has repeatedly said it does not seek a role in any future governing authority in the Palestinian territory, and would limit its role to monitoring governance to ensure stability and facilitate reconstruction.

Talks with Egyptian mediators were also focused on the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, the reopening of the Rafah crossing, the entry of aid currently stockpiled on the Egyptian side of the border, and preparations for launching the second phase of the ceasefire plan, the official said.

Abdelatty did not name any of the agreed-upon committee members.

But two names circulating as potential heads were Ali Shaath, a former deputy minister of planning in the Palestinian Authority , and Majed Abu Ramadan, the current minister of health, the second official said.

The Trump proposed Board of Peace is expected to be led on the ground by Bulgarian diplomat and politician Nickolay Mladenov, who has recently held talks with Israeli and Palestinian officials.

Mladenov previously served as the United Nations envoy for the Middle East peace process from early 2015 until the end of 2020.

Media reports say Trump is expected to announce the members of the Board of Peace in the coming days, with the body set to include around 15 world leaders.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 17:53:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5e21da2e-f161-11f0-9be2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26013378545543.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy to declare state of emergency for energy after Russian attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-zelenskiy-declare-state-emergency-energy-after-russian-attac-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday he would declare a state of emergency in the energy sector to tackle issues with disrupted power supplies following sustained Russian attacks on infrastructure.

Zelenskiy acted as emergency crews proceeded with round-the-clock efforts to restore power and heating supplies thrown into disarray, particularly in Kyiv, by a Russian attack last week. Repairs have been compounded by frigid weather, with night-time temperatures dipping close to -20 Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).

"The consequences of Russian strikes and deteriorating weather conditions are severe," Zelenskiy wrote in English on the X social media platform.

"Overall, a state of emergency will be declared for Ukraine’s energy sector ... Many issues require urgent resolution."

Zelenskiy said a permanent coordination headquarters would be set up in Kyiv, with Denys Shmyhal, first deputy prime minister and newly appointed energy minister, overseeing the work.

He said work was underway "to significantly increase the volume of electricity imports into Ukraine".</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 18:35:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MQS75TTA7FNHTLPDO5SNVRXWQ4.jpg?auth=9cdf4932da9ab4cabe2cb1fe93f898cfab544dd38ba171b4ff4ef4a8bad7ee18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German general 'shaken' by abuse cases in elite paratroop unit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/german-general-shaken-by-abuse-cases-elite-paratroop-unit-2026-01-14/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Germany's most senior general said on Wednesday he had been deeply shaken by a scandal over alleged sexual abuse, right-wing extremism and drug use at an elite paratroop unit and promised to strengthen leadership in the army.

"We do not tolerate sexualised violence, extremism, drug abuse or discrimination in the armed forces," the commander of Germany's military, General Carsten Breuer told reporters in Berlin, saying the incidents have "shaken me deeply".

"Soldiers who condone such behaviour cannot serve as officers in our armed forces," he said, after presenting a report on the affair to the parliamentary defence committee.

The scandal emerged after female soldiers in the 26th Parachute Regiment, whose missions have included helping the evacuation of Germans and other foreign nationals from Sudan, reported numerous cases of alleged abuse to the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Armed Forces, the military ombudsman.

The affair has piled pressure on the military as Germany begins registration of all 18-year-olds as part of a drive to increase the size of the armed forces - a response to U.S. demands for European NATO allies to shoulder more of the burden of defending their continent.

The opposition Green party accused Defence Minister Boris Pistorius of seeking to avoid responsibility for the alleged abuse, which the party's deputy parliamentary leader Agnieszka Brugger said had taken root under his conservative predecessors.

"This is not only a disastrous signal, but a real danger to increasing the personnel of the Bundeswehr and thus to the security of us all," she said in a statement.

The military says a series of disciplinary measures has already been taken, including dismissal of a number of soldiers, and 16 cases had been handed over to civil prosecutors.

"We have certainly gained the impression that the investigations were in some cases not conducted with the necessary depth," General Christian Freuding, the senior army general, said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 18:35:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GYAERY7WWZLUVBJHKXVZKPR7FU.jpg?auth=a6ddd5033a28ed5df4bfa87a915a3b11eba05bee6e742660ec4fcb357f71a2fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens funding for states over sanctuary cities as clashes intensify in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-threatens-funding-states-over-sanctuary-cities-clashes-intensify-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would cut off federal funding next month for any state that includes sanctuary cities, expanding his attacks on mostly Democratic-run cities following days of clashes in Minneapolis.

Trump's vow, which he made on social media, repeated comments he first made during a speech in Detroit on Tuesday, when he said he would halt payments starting on February 1 to any state that had sanctuary cities, which limit local authorities' cooperation with federal immigration officers.

Any such effort would undoubtedly be challenged in court. A federal judge in August blocked a previous attempt to freeze funding for more than 30 sanctuary jurisdictions unless they cooperated with his immigration crackdown.

Trump's declaration came amid escalating tensions in Minneapolis, a week after a U.S. immigration officer fatally shot 37-year-old Renee Good, a U.S. citizen, in her car.

The shooting has sparked protests in the city and elsewhere, while the Trump administration has responded by surging hundreds of additional federal agents to Minneapolis despite objections from Democratic Mayor Jacob Frey.

There are nearly 3,000 federal officers in the Minneapolis area, according to state officials, a total that dwarfs the city's 600 sworn police officers.

Cellphone video shared on social media, as well as video from Reuters and other news outlets, have captured chaotic clashes between federal agents sweeping the city for immigrants living in the country illegally and residents shouting obscenities and blowing whistles.

In some instances, officers have responded to protesters with pepper balls and pepper spray.

City and state officials have accused federal officers of indiscriminate street stops based on residents' apparent ethnicity or race.

The head of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota called on the U.S. government to release three tribal members detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Minneapolis.

The tribal members were homeless and living under a bridge when they were detained by ICE last week, according to a Tuesday letter from Oglala Sioux President Frank Star Comes Out to federal officials.

Star Comes Out said the tribal members were U.S. citizens and their detention was a violation of treaties the tribe entered into with the United States.

Trump and other administration officials have defended the Good shooting as self-defense and said she was trying to run the officer over with her car, despite video showing she was turning her wheels away from him as she drove forward.

Minnesota authorities have opened a criminal investigation into whether the agent who killed Good broke state law after they said the federal government withdrew from a joint investigation. At least six federal prosecutors resigned over a request from Justice Department leaders to investigate Good's widow, Reuters has reported, deepening scrutiny of the way the department is conducting the investigation.

Trump did not specify which states would face funding cuts under his threatened action, but the U.S. Justice Department published a list of "sanctuary jurisdictions" in August that are located in 19 states and the District of Columbia. Nearly 160 million people live in those states, just under half of the U.S. population.

On Wednesday morning, the Minnesota attorney general's office asked U.S. District Judge Kate Menendez to issue a temporary order halting the Trump administration's dramatic surge in immigration agents being sent into Minneapolis and the surrounding areas.

Brian Carter, a lawyer for Minnesota, told the judge that Trump had sent about 2,800 "masked, heavily armed agents" into the area, exceeding the number of police officers in Minneapolis and neighboring Saint Paul combined, who the state says are engaged in a "pattern of unlawful, violent conduct," including racial profiling and warrantless forced entry into residents' homes.

"The harm here is ongoing, your honor, and it is intolerable," he said.

Andrew Warden, a Justice Department lawyer representing the Trump administration, said the federal government would fight any state efforts to restrain federal law enforcement activities.

The judge set deadlines for responses from both sides next week ahead of deciding how to rule.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 18:36:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZEKOBWIO5ZKFZH7H4F3E6SPTBA.jpg?auth=32345590e9882ed42019ccff5175b2936777407dd15dc8e369b60b790ade1cb0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens funding for states over sanctuary cities as clashes intensify in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-threatens-funding-states-over-sanctuary-cities-clashes-intensify-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 18:36:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France's government survives two no-confidence votes over Mercosur deal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260114-france-government-survives-two-no-confidence-votes-over-mercosur-deal</link><description>‍French Prime ​Minister Sébastien Lecornu 's ⁠government on Wednesday survived a second vote of no ​confidence ‍in the National Assembly ​that had been called in ​protest against the EU-Mercosur trade deal .

The motion, filed by the far-right National Rally (RN) party, was ‍backed by 142 ​members of parliament's lower house. 288 votes were needed ‌for the motion to pass.

An ‍earlier no-confidence motion filed by the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) on the same matter had also failed.

Despite French opposition , EU member states last week approved the signing of the long-debated deal with Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay .

French farmers have been protesting for months against the deal they say threatens local ​agriculture by creating unfair competition with cheaper South American imports.

The RN and LFI ​accused the government of not doing enough to block it.

"Inside the country, you are a government ​of vassals serving the rich. Outside, you are humiliating our nation before the European Commission and the US empire," chief LFI lawmaker Mathilde Panot told the government, speaking in parliament ahead of Wednesday's no-confidence motion votes.

The Socialist Party had ruled out backing the no-confidence motions and the conservative Les Républicains also said they would not vote to censure the government over Mercosur .

As a result, both motions failed. The one tabled by LFI received only 256 votes in favour, 32 votes short of what was needed for the ‍motion to pass. The second motion, put forward by the far right , received 142 votes in favour and also failed.

Lecornu said time spent on the no-confidence ​votes was further delaying fraught debates on the country's 2026 budget, which he said political leaders should instead focus on.

"You are acting like snipers lying in wait, firing into the executive’s back at the very moment when we ‌must confront international disruptions," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 18:37:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5677a1d4-f164-11f0-af36-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92NK6JE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany to send reconnaissance troops to Greenland, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/germany-send-reconnaissance-troops-greenland-government-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Germany will send its first soldiers to Greenland on Thursday, a government spokesperson said on Wednesday, after Sweden and Norway announced similar moves following demands by President Donald Trump for Washington to have control of the island.

Over a dozen reconnaissance troops will be deployed on Thursday, the spokesperson told Reuters.

The Bild newspaper was first to report the deployment.

Trump has repeatedly said in recent weeks that the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to U.S. security, and that the United States must own it to prevent Russia or China from occupying it.

He has said all options are on the table for securing the territory, rhetoric that has severely strained relations between Europe and the U.S.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:19:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GBS5YMNYPRNNTBODLFKDIAOLQM.jpg?auth=7753dad84559131a7624cad1014ea08adf2f67c3de00e1050893228e911f0979&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish prosecutors to hear testimony of Julio Iglesias accusers, rights group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spanish-prosecutors-hear-testimony-julio-iglesias-accusers-rights-group-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Two women who say they were sexually assaulted by singer Julio Iglesias will provide testimony to Spanish prosecutors, the women's rights group that filed a complaint on their behalf said on Wednesday.

Attempts by Reuters to contact representatives of Iglesias, 82, on Tuesday and Wednesday by email and phone went unanswered. The star's record label, Sony, declined to comment.

Women's Link Worldwide said the complaint, which it filed at Spain's High Court on January 5, accused Iglesias of human trafficking for forced labour and servitude, alongside sexual abuse and violations of workers' rights.

The group's executive director, Jovana Rios, told an online press conference that the High Court prosecutor's office would take statements from the two women as protected witnesses, adding that no date had yet been set and the court had yet to formally assert jurisdiction over the case.

The prosecutor's office declined to comment, citing the secret nature of the preliminary inquiry.

"Being heard by prosecutors is a very important step in (the victims') quest for justice, and we appreciate that authorities are being agile in their handling of the case," Rios added.

Iglesias is one of the world's best-selling Latin artists, with more than 300 million records sold in 14 languages.

Rios described the two complainants as young Latin American women "in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions".

Criminal probes into alleged offences by Spanish citizens committed abroad are usually handled by the High Court, a recent example being the sexual assault trial of former Spanish soccer chief Luis Rubiales for kissing a player in Sydney, Australia.

Rios said Women's Link had also been contacted by other women who said they had worked for Iglesias, but declined to provide further details, citing safety concerns.

She quoted one of the two complainants as saying she had decided to come forward for herself, for other women working for Iglesias and for her country, the Dominican Republic.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:20:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/77H3CQBRCZPBTGFKJSI62EHKVI.jpg?auth=7919f56bcdbb5599e8698e9c99af48c3a2a982a02ef9f0b724b0a06887a727a7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan envoys head to Washington for trade, investment talks, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-envoys-head-washington-trade-investment-talks-source-says-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - Senior Taiwanese officials are travelling to Washington to advance talks on reducing U.S. tariffs on the island's exports and strengthening investment, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.

Taiwan's vice premier Cheng Li-chiun and trade envoy Yang Jen-ni are due to arrive in Washington late on Wednesday or early on Thursday for meetings with Trump administration officials in the coming days, the source told Reuters.

It was unclear which U.S. officials will attend, whether U.S. President Donald Trump will be involved or if the visit will produce a deal, the source added.

Taiwan is aiming to achieve cut tariffs on its exports to the U.S. to 15% from 20%, the government said in December.

Taipei said on Tuesday it had reached a "broad consensus" with Washington on the talks and was discussing a timetable for a concluding meeting.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment on the meetings, which were first reported by Bloomberg News.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:20:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What is the Minnesota social welfare scandal that has drawn Trump's ire?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/what-is-minnesota-social-welfare-scandal-that-has-drawn-trumps-ire-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into the Midwest state.

Here is how Trump, a Republican, has sought to connect a scandal that began during the COVID-19 pandemic to his recent efforts to vilify the state's large communities of Somali Americans and Somali immigrants:

In September 2022 under the administration of Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, then U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the indictment , opens new tab of 47 people accused of defrauding $250 million from a state-run, federally funded child nutrition program during the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in 2020.

Some of the defendants worked for Feeding Our Future, a nonprofit. Others were their associates who ran restaurants or similar companies that claimed to have served hundreds of thousands of free meals to children when they had not.

The founder and executive director of Feeding Our Future was Aimee Bock, a white American woman, who was accused of overseeing the fraud scheme. Most of her employees, associates and co-defendants were Somali Americans, according to local news reports.

Minnesota has the largest number of people of Somali origin of any U.S. state, an estimated 76,000 in 2024, according to U.S. Census estimates. About half are U.S. citizens by birth or by naturalization, but thousands of Somalis have fled to the state in the last few years to escape Somalia's civil war.

Trump accused Somalians collectively of "ripping off" Minnesota, said they "contribute nothing" and referred to them as "garbage."

"I don't want them in our country, I'll be honest with you, somebody will say, 'Oh, that's not politically correct,' I don't care," Trump told reporters at the White House in December.

The prosecutions were pursued throughout Biden's presidency and have continued into Trump's second term, resulting in more indictments and charges of defrauding other federal funds, including some intended to benefit children with autism.

A jury found Bock guilty , opens new tab last March on all counts. Last September, the Justice Department said at least 56 defendants had pleaded guilty, avoiding trials.

Minnesota's government began investigating Feeding Our Future in 2020. The state's Department of Education relayed its concerns about fraud to the FBI, leading to the federal indictments.

The state has also investigated Feeding Our Future for fraud around state funding and for violating Minnesota's charity laws, and recently set up a new state-wide fraud-fighting unit.

Governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, and state lawmakers have announced new measures to detect and prevent the theft of both state and federal funds.

Walz expressed regret about how the state has handled the scandal, saying he "should have been keeping Minnesotans more up to speed on what was happening," and earlier this month announced he was abandoning his bid for a third term as governor, citing his need to keep his attention on fighting fraud.

Several agencies overseen by Trump have announced greater scrutiny of Minnesota or threatened to end federal funding. One of the agencies, the Health and Human Services Department, said its actions were spurred by a viral video in December by a right-wing online influencer, Nick Shirley, which made some unsubstantiated or incorrect claims about his visits to federally funded childcare centers.

In January, Trump sent more than 2,000 of immigration agents into the streets of Minneapolis to arrest and deport migrants, and said he is ending a special protected status, which includes work permits, for Somali asylum seekers in the U.S., affecting about 1,100 people across the country. The White House says immigration agents also are identifying potential fraud cases.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:20:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JAS2QHNI6FJYBALNZMLXYLTYJA.jpg?auth=baf1d82dfaefef375c2a1d21b0eb7641b14ed07493ec2d39883088d687efa413&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Watch live: Greenland, Denmark ‘agree to disagree’ with US after White House meeting</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260114-watch-live-denmark-greenland-fms-give-press-conference-after-white-house-meeting</link><description>Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers met with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the White House for roughly an hour on Wednesday after Trump ramped up threats to seize Greenland by force.

Trump says the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to US security and the United States must own it to prevent Russia or China from occupying it. He says all ​options are on the table for securing the territory.

"It is vital for the Golden Dome that we are building," he said in a social media post just hours before the meeting ‍was due to start, referring to a proposed missile defence system.

Greenland and Denmark say the island is not ​for sale, threats of force are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies. Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark.

Ahead of the meeting, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun to increase their military presence in and around Greenland in close cooperation with NATO allies, as part of their promise to beef up Arctic defence.

Denmark and Greenland had originally sought a meeting with Rubio, hoping to have a discussion among top diplomats on resolving the crisis between the two NATO allies.

But Denmark's Rasmussen said Vance had also wanted to participate and that the vice president would ‌host the meeting himself at the White House.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 19:20:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2e893128-f15b-11f0-b7ed-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-14T145029Z-1523883606-RC221JA20R53-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-GREENLAND-DENMARK.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ugandans, Iranians turn to Dorsey's messaging app Bitchat in web crackdowns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/ugandans-iranians-turn-dorseys-messaging-app-bitchat-web-crackdowns-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - A little-known offline messaging app launched by Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has emerged as a key lifeline for Ugandans cut off from the internet ahead of a contentious election that could extend President Yoweri Museveni's four-decade rule.

Bitchat has surged to the top of Apple and Google app stores in the African country after clocking more than 28,000 downloads this year, according to research firm Apptopia. That marks a nearly fourfold increase over the previous two months combined.

Its usage has also jumped more than three times in Iran as internet shutdowns by the country's clerical rulers aimed at quelling nationwide protests force people to look for workarounds, the data showed.

Dorsey, who has said he is "partially to blame" for the centralization of the internet and regrets it, launched Bitchat last year after what he said was a week of coding in July.

The app has a minimal user interface and requires no log-in - its surge in popularity is reminiscent of the amplifying role Twitter played in the Arab Spring by allowing activists to broadcast real-time footage of protests and police brutality.

Unlike Twitter, which is now called X, Bitchat does not require internet or cellular connectivity. It uses Bluetooth mesh technology to create a decentralized, offline network where a message from one person uses another person's phone as a stepping stone to hop the text along until it reaches the destination.

While not as popular as messaging services like WhatsApp or Apple's iMessage, Bluetooth-based messaging services have over the years become a go-to option for protestors as governments increasingly impose internet shutdowns.

Activists during Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests in 2020 turned to apps like Bridgefy, which is powered by the same technology. Bridgefy was also downloaded over 1 million times in Myanmar in 2021 after the country's military seized power.

Bobi Wine, a Ugandan pop star and main opposition candidate, urged people in the country late last month to download Bitchat, saying the government was planning a web shutdown soon to ensure citizens "do not organise, verify their election results".

"HAVE YOU DOWNLOADED BITCHAT YET?" he said in a post on X that was reposted nearly 2,000 times.

On Tuesday, Ugandan authorities cut internet access and limited mobile services across the country to curb what it said were "misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud and related risks", according to a letter seen by Reuters.

Security forces have detained hundreds of opposition supporters ahead of Thursday's election and repeatedly fired live bullets and tear gas at campaign events in support of Wine.

Several experts and human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, urged Uganda to end the shutdown and said that instead of curbing misinformation, web blackouts can increase the spread of rumors.

"Internet shutdowns violate fundamental human rights and have become a familiar tool used by governments during moments of political or electoral stress," said Aditya Vashistha, assistant professor at Cornell University. "They mainly reduce coordination and information sharing, with little credible evidence that they reduce misinformation or electoral risk."

In 2024, digital rights watchdogs Access Now and the #KeepItOn coalition documented 296 shutdowns in 54 countries.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:23:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K5C6QY7LQRPD7CE2M3BIUOWJ5I.jpg?auth=607f0ab50f3d6a62df31c989b7fe878289684bbbc1db6b97d0089bc3210717e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy urges its citizens to leave Iran because of security concerns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-urges-its-citizens-leave-iran-because-security-concerns-2026-01-14/</link><description>ROME, Jan 14 (Reuters) - Italy has strongly renewed an appeal to its citizens to leave Iran because of the security situation in the country, the foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

There are around 600 Italians in Iran, most of them in the Tehran area, it added.

With Iran's leadership trying to quell the worst domestic unrest the Islamic Republic has ever faced, Tehran is seeking to deter U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to intervene on behalf of anti-government protesters.

"There are more than 900 members of the Italian Armed Forces in the region, including about 500 personnel in Iraq and 400 in Kuwait, where precautionary measures are being adopted to protect military personnel," the Italian Foreign Ministry said.

Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani chaired a meeting on Wednesday with a group of Italian ambassadors and representatives of the Defence Ministry and the intelligence services.

"In this context, Italy’s position of firm condemnation of the violent repression of demonstrations and of the serious violations of human rights was reaffirmed," the ministry said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 20:45:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SLLYDLFCLRP45KYIGDME2B32ZA.jpg?auth=2d9b023e2906b41e018f036f7a8d38566bbcd00585f1b3ac0f4404e3be712280&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain temporarily closes embassy in Tehran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/britain-temporarily-closes-embassy-tehran-politico-reports-2026-01-14/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The British embassy in Tehran has been temporarily closed, the government said on Wednesday.

"We have temporarily closed the British Embassy in Tehran, this will now operate remotely. Foreign Office travel advice has now been updated to reflect this consular change," a government spokesperson said.

Britain's ambassador and all consular staff were evacuated based on a security assessment and a decision to prioritise staff safety, a British official said.

The move comes as Iran's leadership tries to quell the worst domestic unrest the Islamic Republic has ever faced, and with U.S. President Donald Trump threatening to intervene.

Asked who told him that the killings stopped, Trump described them as "very important sources on the other side."

The president did not rule out potential U.S. military action, saying "we are going to watch what the process is" before noting the U.S. administration received a "very good statement" from Iran.

Trump's comments appeared meant to signal a cautious easing of fears that the crisis in Iran could escalate into a broader regional confrontation. In a televised interview on Monday, Trump had warned that the United States would take "very strong action" if Iran's authorities went ahead with executing protesters they had detained during widespread unrest.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 21:23:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5G723T74DNLNHIG3YVKJA4TGFQ.jpg?auth=475b0a14384d6a466c677be9d01e183c49680e1205d1c971ae0b554fbf4469a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US suspends immigrant visa processing for 75 countries</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260114-us-suspends-immigrant-visa-processing-for-75-countries</link><description>The United States said Wednesday it was suspending the processing of immigrant visas from 75 countries, President Donald Trump 's latest move against foreigners seeking to come to America.

The United States has long rejected visas from people who appear likely to end up needing government welfare, but the State Department said it would now use the same authority for a blanket suspension of immigrant visas based on nationality.

"The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America's immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people," State Department spokesman Tommy Pigott said.

"Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassesses immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits," he said.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt posted on X that the countries affected would include Somalia – whose people Trump has attacked in heated terms after immigrants were involved in a funding scandal in Minnesota – as well as Russia and Iran .

A US official said that the other countries affected would include a number of countries with friendly relations with the United States, including Brazil, Egypt and Thailand.

Other countries to face the pause include Nigeria – Africa's most populous country – as well as Iraq and Yemen, the official said.

The State Department did not immediately release a full list of countries.

The freeze will begin on January 21 with no set time for it to end, the US official, who was not authorised to speak to the press, said on condition of anonymity.

Trump has made no secret of his desire to reduce immigration by people who are not of European descent. He has described Somalis as "garbage" who should "go back to where they came from" and instead said he was open to Scandinavians moving to the United States.

The State Department said Monday that it has revoked more than 100,000 visas since Trump's return, a one-year record.

The Department of Homeland Security last month said that the Trump administration has deported more than 605,000 people, and that 2.5 million others left on their own.

The latest move does not affect tourist, business or other visas , including for soccer fans seeking to visit for this year's World Cup, although the Trump administration has vowed to vet all applicants' social media histories .</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 21:24:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/80f78626-f183-11f0-b8f0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014617945882.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How Iran jammed Starlink (and how Iranians are trying to get around it)</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-jammed-starlink-get-around-it</link><description>Iranian authorities cut the public's access to the internet and telephone communications on January 8. The networks were later partially reinstated , but with severe restrictions. The Iranian regime has been facing a series of protests since late December . In an attempt to crush the movement, the Iranian government also tried to break the last international communication link available to Iranians: Starlink.

Starlink, which provides internet access through a constellation of satellites, was thought to be out of the Iranian authorities' reach for censorship. However, in recent days, Starlink has been subject to a jamming campaign that has seriously impaired its use.

GPS interference was observed in Tehran and surrounding regions on January 8, the day that the internet more widely was cut across Iran , according to the monitoring site gpsjam.org . Though we don’t know with certainty why this jamming occurred, it did partially affect Starlink’s service.

A Starlink terminal usually needs GPS in order to establish a geographic location so as to communicate with the network’s satellites.

"[Starlink uses] the GPS position of the terminals to point their antennas towards the satellites," the people behind the X account @giammaiot2 , a group of telecommunications researchers, told our team.

"Jamming GPS signals was the classic way to jam Starlink," Kave Salamatian, a professor at the University of Savoie in France , who specialises in the geopolitics of the internet, told our team. "But a Starlink update, which was added after Russia jammed signals in Ukraine and in the Black Sea, [now] enables users to bypass a GPS signal by relying on Starlink’s own satellites to identify a location using triangulation.”

This solution, which enables users to get around GPS interference, does have some limits, says Radim Badsi, CEO of the French company Ground Space, which specialises in satellite constellation surveillance. This can make Starlink users less mobile: “Starlink’s alternate [to establishing locations using GPS] constantly sweeps the sky to try to find a satellite that is passing by.”

But in this mode, the civilian version of a Starlink terminal can’t be used on the move, Badsi says.

The worsening of the Starlink connection observed in Iran in recent days has resulted in a data "packet loss of 30 to 80 percent", according to Victoria Samson, the Chief Director of Space Security and Stability at the Secure World Foundation, a Washington-based think tank. Savoie professor Kave Salamatian says that this loss likely comes from a more sophisticated form of jamming, an “active interference”.

Active interference involves saturating a satellite’s transmission channel. If you send “noise” or a fake signal to a satellite for long enough, then it is possible to disconnect its associated terminals.

"In theory, this could render the satellite unusable [for the terminal]. So you can just jam, one after another, all of the visible [Starlink] satellites," says Badsi.

But it is “technically quite difficult to jam Starlink’s main channel because the Starlink network is made up of multiple moving satellites”, says Oleg Kutkov, a Ukrainian engineer who is an expert in the Starlink network. He says, “directing a powerful noise beam directly to the satellite in the sky requires multiple large-dish antennas constantly tracking satellites. Russians tried this approach [in Ukraine], but the jammers were destroyed because it's hard to hide them.”

So how were Iranian authorities able to set up this level of interference?

The specialists who spoke to our team had a number of theories.

Iran does have in its arsenal Russian military jammers like the Murmansk-BN , which is able to interfere with GPS signals.

The experts behind the account @giammaiot2 think that the Cobra-V8 , an Iranian electronic warfare system which is similar to the Russian-made 1RL257E Krasukha-4, might have been used to jam the transmission frequencies from Starlink terminals.

The Starlink interference may also have been created using civilian technology that is not necessarily foreign.

"The simplest explanation is that they did it internally. The Iranians have the skills to jam Starlink. All the more so because the interference we are currently seeing in Iran is different to what we saw in the war in Ukraine,” says Salamatian. "Iran has very good universities that are specialised in telecom like Imam Hossein University, which is the university for the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, as well as Sharif University.”

How exactly is this jamming impacting Starlink service in Iran?

Speaking to our team on condition of anonymity, a representative for Nasnet, the largest Starlink community in Iran, described a partial degradation of service:

“It is important to note first that disruptions to this service are not a new phenomenon. Similar issues were observed in Tehran approximately one month prior to the outbreak of the war between Iran and Israel in June 2025. Following that period, service remained stable until the past few days.

[...] What users are experiencing is better described as intermittent and non-persistent interference rather than a complete service outage. Connectivity remains available; however, at its peak, packet loss reached approximately 35 percent, resulting in frequent short disconnections and a noticeable degradation in user experience. Despite these conditions, the service has remained usable.

Based on our field assessments, these disruptions are geographically limited to Tehran. Starlink service in other parts of Iran has remained unaffected and continues to operate normally.”

The NasNet representative said Starlink users were able to temporarily bypass the jamming, thanks in part to the technical support provided by Starlink:

“A [Starlink] software update released on the second day of the disruptions [Editor’s note: on January 10] significantly reduced packet loss to approximately 10 percent. That said, network conditions remain unstable, with periodic fluctuations and occasional deterioration. This reflects an ongoing ‘cat-and-mouse’ dynamic in which both sides continuously adjust their technical approaches.”

To display this content from X (Twitter), you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

Thanks to this update of the firmware (the software powering Starlink terminals), Salamatian explains that "Starlink now has the ability, if a satellite is being jammed, to transfer the signal to another satellite. This allows internet traffic to be rerouted from a jammed satellite to another satellite. By doing so, they have successfully mitigated the impact of the jamming. Signal loss previously reached 70 percent due to jamming; it has now been reduced to 30 percent."

However, the Starlink network is no silver bullet for bypassing the regime’s orchestrated blackouts. According to Amir Rashidi , an Iranian digital rights expert, there are only 50,000 Starlink terminals in Iran, serving only a tiny fraction of the country’s 90 million inhabitants.

With Iran's leadership trying to quell the worst domestic unrest the Islamic Republic has ever faced, Tehran is seeking to deter U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to intervene on behalf of anti-government protesters.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States was pulling some personnel from key bases in the region as a precaution given heightened regional tensions.

"All the signals are that a U.S. attack is imminent, but that is also how this administration behaves to keep everyone on their toes. Unpredictability is part of the strategy," a Western military official told Reuters later on Wednesday.

At the White House, however, Trump suggested he was adopting a wait-and-see posture toward the crisis.

Trump told reporters that he has been told that killings in the Iranian regime's crackdown on the protests were subsiding and that he believes there is currently no plan for large-scale executions.

Asked who told him that the killings had stopped, Trump described them as "very important sources on the other side."

The president did not rule out potential U.S. military action, saying "we are going to watch what the process is" before noting that his administration had received a "very good statement" from Iran.

Two European officials said U.S. military intervention could come in the next 24 hours. An Israeli official also said it appeared Trump had decided to intervene, though the scope and timing remained unclear.

Qatar said drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base , the biggest U.S. base in the Middle East, were "being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions".

Three diplomats said some personnel had been told to leave the base, though there were no immediate signs of large numbers of troops being bussed out to a soccer stadium and shopping mall as took place hours before an Iranian missile strike last year.

Britain was also withdrawing some personnel from an air base in Qatar ahead of possible U.S. strikes, The I Paper newspaper reported. The British defence ministry had no immediate comment.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the unrest against clerical rule .

Iran and its Western foes have both described the unrest, which began two weeks ago as demonstrations against dire economic conditions and rapidly escalated in recent days, as the most violent since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installed Iran's system of Shi'ite clerical rule.

An Iranian official has said more than 2,000 people have died. A rights group put the toll at more than 2,600.

Iran has "never faced this volume of destruction", Armed Forces Chief of Staff Abdolrahim Mousavi said on Wednesday, blaming foreign enemies.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot described "the most violent repression in Iran's contemporary history".

Iranian authorities have accused the U.S. and Israel of fomenting the unrest, carried out by people it calls armed terrorists.

Trump has openly threatened to intervene in Iran for days, without giving specifics. In an interview with CBS News on Tuesday, he vowed "very strong action" if Iran executes protesters. He also urged Iranians to keep protesting and take over institutions, declaring "help is on the way".

The senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tehran had asked U.S. allies in the region to prevent Washington from attacking Iran.

"Tehran has told regional countries, from Saudi Arabia and UAE to Turkey, that U.S. bases in those countries will be attacked" if the U.S. targets Iran, the official said.

Direct contacts between Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi and U.S. Special Envoy Steve Witkoff have been suspended, the official added.

The United States has forces across the region including the forward headquarters of its Central Command at Al Udeid in Qatar and the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet in Bahrain.

The flow of information from inside Iran has been hampered by an internet blackout.

The U.S.-based HRANA rights group said it had so far verified the deaths of 2,403 protesters and 147 government-affiliated individuals, dwarfing tolls from previous waves of protests crushed by the authorities in 2022 and 2009.

The government's prestige was hammered by a 12-day Israeli bombing campaign last June - joined by the U.S. - that followed setbacks for Iran's regional allies in Lebanon and Syria. European powers restored U.N. sanctions over Iran's nuclear programme, compounding the economic crisis there.

The unrest on such a scale caught the authorities off guard at a vulnerable time, but it does not appear that the government faces imminent collapse, and its security apparatus still appears to be in control, one Western official said.

The authorities have sought to project images showing they retain public support. Iranian state TV broadcast footage of large funeral processions for people killed in the unrest in Tehran, Isfahan, Bushehr and other cities.

People waved flags and pictures of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and held aloft signs with anti-riot slogans.

President Masoud Pezeshkian, an elected figure whose power is subordinate to that of Khamenei, told a cabinet meeting that as long as the government had popular support, "all the enemies' efforts against the country will come to nothing".

State media reported that the head of Iran's top security body, Ali Larijani, had spoken to the foreign minister of Qatar, while Iran's top diplomat Araqchi had spoken to his Emirati and Turkish counterparts. Araqchi told UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed that "calm has prevailed".

HRANA reported 18,137 arrests so far.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 22:48:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EKWD6AHQNVO5BFZ5DXGMCOF54Y.jpg?auth=2df6dd8a9397d7731cbabc20c9bfb2d81a3f2684d1cd7da91f85fc8ea02d935d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump and Venezuelan leader Rodriguez tout positive phone call</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-venezuelan-leader-rodriguez-tout-positive-phone-call-2026-01-14/</link><description>Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodriguez by phone on Wednesday, with the two leaders each separately describing the call as positive.

Rodriguez took over the presidency on an interim basis earlier this month after the U.S. military captured President Nicolas Maduro and flew him to the U.S. to stand trial for drug charges.

Rodriguez, Maduro's former vice president, called the call long, productive and courteous and said the two discussed a bilateral agenda in benefit of both countries.

Trump called Rodriguez a "terrific person" in his own remarks about the call.

"She's somebody that we've worked with very well. Marco Rubio is dealing with her, I dealt with her this morning," Trump said at the White House, referring in his comments to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio. "We had a call, a long call.

The Crew Dragon capsule carrying two U.S. NASA astronauts, a Japanese crewmate and a Russian cosmonaut undocked from the space station and began its descent from orbit at about 5:20 p.m. EST (2220 GMT) headed for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the California coast early on Thursday.

Live video from a NASA webcast of the departure showed the capsule separating from the ISS and drifting away from the orbiting laboratory as the two vehicles soared some 260 miles (418 km) over the Earth south of Australia.

The astronauts were seen strapped into the Crew Dragon cabin, seated side by side and wearing their helmeted white and black space suits as the undocking proceeded.

The plan to bring all four members of Crew-11 home a few weeks ahead of schedule was announced January 8, with NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman saying one of the astronauts faced a "serious medical condition" that required immediate medical attention on the ground.

NASA officials have not identified which of the four crew members was experiencing a medical issue or described its nature, citing privacy concerns.

The crew consists of U.S. astronauts Zena Cardman and Mike Fincke, Japanese astronaut Kimiya Yui and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Platonov. They arrived at the space station following a launch to orbit from Florida in August.

Fincke, the station's designated commander, and Cardman, assigned as flight engineer, had been scheduled to conduct a six-hour-plus spacewalk last week to install hardware outside the station. The spacewalk was canceled on January 7 over what NASA then characterized as a "medical concern" with an astronaut.

NASA Chief Health and Medical Officer James Polk later said the medical emergency did not involve "an injury that occurred in the pursuit of operations."

If all goes as planned, Thursday's splashdown will conclude what ended up being a 167-day mission.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 22:50:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GXMZHNBUW5KKJHHJLD2M4W2HNQ.jpg?auth=97a44471d67d4ab2b461241b973222fd6a9d83c25d2423c298978b837df43a5e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Astronauts begin early return flight from space station with ailing crew member</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/science/astronauts-begin-early-return-flight-space-station-with-ailing-crew-member-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 22:50:55 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Greenlanders watch nervously for signs from White House talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenlanders-watch-nervously-signs-white-house-talks-2026-01-14/</link><description>NUUK, Jan 14 (Reuters) - In a blue wooden house perched above Nuuk's sprawling fjord, Liv Aurora Jensen sat in her living room surrounded by the trappings of Greenlandic life — handmade cutting boards and ceramics, and Greenland's red and white flags tucked in beside a potted plant.

With her husband Peter Jensen and their son Inuk, she waited in near silence in front of the television as a meeting between U.S. Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the foreign ministers of Greenland and Denmark got under way in the White House, some 2,000 miles away.

Like many in Greenland, which has a population of around 57,000, Jensen, 62, hoped to the high-stakes meeting could help quell President Donald Trump's ambition of taking over the Danish overseas territory.

"I have been sleeping very, very badly, really," Liv said, describing the anxiety shared by many of her neighbours in recent weeks as Trump ups pressure on Denmark over the island.

"I was talking to my sister yesterday and I told her: 'I'm trying not to get a panic attack.' I really have to control myself not to start crying or panicking, and not to let all my thoughts spin out of control."

She paused, looking out toward the fjord visible through her window. "It's really frightening."

As the meeting concluded and cameras showed the Danish foreign minister emerging from the White House, Liv leaned forward. "What was his facial expression?" she asked aloud, referring to Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen.

"She smiled when she exited the car," Inuk, 22, said to his mother, referring to Vivian Motzfeldt, Greenland's top diplomat.

When the broadcast showed the Danish minister giving a fist bump to the Danish ambassador, Liv and Peter stood arm in arm in front of the television. "It's a good sign," Liv said.

Relief was visible on both their faces. "I think it's a good sign for future communication with the United States," Peter, 63, said. "I hope the outcome will be that we continue, as we have done before, that Greenland is not taken over by the United States, but we have cooperation with the other countries such as the European Union, Denmark, and of course the United States."

"We want to be a people and country as we always have been. I think it's possible," he said.

But despite the talks, Trump reiterated his views later on Wednesday that the U.S. needs Greenland and that Denmark cannot be relied upon to protect the island, even as he said that "something will work out" with respect to the future governance of the Danish territory.

"I don't think they will come here with military," Liv said, then added quietly: "It would take them five minutes."

The past weeks have shifted how she views America. "I have lost some respect for the Americans. And I have lost all respect for President Trump because his rhetoric is like a 14-year-old boy who is bullying everybody," she said.

Greenland's government said on Monday it will increase efforts to ensure the defence of the Arctic territory takes place under the auspices of NATO, and again rejected Trump's ambition to take over the island.

Their son Inuk, sitting on the sofa in front of the TV, had been following the crisis closely with his friends.

"When Trump first started saying he wanted Greenland years ago, we were like, 'This guy's crazy.' But as the time went on and things got more serious, we were down. Yesterday we were really scared of what might happen today," he said. "Some of my friends say we are cooked."

What his mother fears is change.

"We are afraid that he can take us like that," she said, snapping her fingers. "Our culture will disappear, our language will disappear, and the whole way of living in Greenland will disappear, and we will become American," Liv continued.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 23:18:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F734QBK4DFKP5EK7DO5GA2ST3A.jpg?auth=931396e7d0aacbd64837eba3b3a7399baad48f4d1214f1e1ed4eb52e2adc2b2e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration accused of 'slow-walking' help to Pacific island veterans</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-accused-slow-walking-help-pacific-island-veterans-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The Trump administration was accused on Wednesday of dragging its feet in delivering congressionally agreed benefits to Pacific island nations being courted by China to try to woo them away from the U.S. strategic orbit.

The ambassadors of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia as well as Democratic lawmakers told a congressional hearing that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) had yet to implement extended benefits to veterans from the island nations who served with the U.S. armed forces.

The benefits are provided for as part of new 20-year programs the United States agreed to with the so-called Freely Associated States during the Biden administration, under which Washington provides the islands with economic assistance and other benefits, while gaining exclusive military access to strategic swaths of the Pacific China covets.

Citizens from the remote islands can live, study, and work in the U.S. and serve in the armed forces, and congressional legislation granted the VA authority to provide FAS veterans with enhanced access to care, such as telehealth visits, beneficiary travel, and mail-order pharmacy services.

"Unfortunately, the VA has yet to implement these authorities," Micronesia's ambassador, Jackson Soram, said in testimony to the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs, which deals with FAS relations.

"Sadly, when our veterans return home, they face significant cost and access barriers to VA health care," he said, adding that those who traveled for treatment not available locally were forced to pay for expensive tickets in hopes of reimbursement.

"Sometimes they get reimbursed, sometimes not," he said.

Soram said the islanders held productive talks with the VA after the last congressional oversight hearing in September 2024, but these were suspended in April 2025.

"We stand ready to restart talks and finalize the agreement as soon as possible," he said.

VA Press Secretary Pete Kasperowicz said 2024 legislation gave VA the option to provide direct medical care to FAS veterans, "but did not provide the funding for that care."

He said VA provided FAS veterans with the same benefits available to other eligible veterans living abroad and "continues to work with the U.S. Congress to consider options for improved care for all Veterans, including those in the Freely Associated States."

Anton Greubel, head of the State Department office responsible for the Pacific islands, told the hearing the senior U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Michael DeSombre, would visit the Marshall Islands and Micronesia next week for talks on ensuring effective implementation of the agreements with the islands, known as the Compacts of Free Association (COFA).

He called the FAS states "essential partners" and added: "Their trust and cooperation are vital to our national security and economic interests ... We are committed to doing even more for the FAS in the year ahead."

Democratic Representative Jared Huffman said it was vital to fully implement the agreements and added: "Many of us are concerned that President Trump has seemed to be slow-walking delivery of our end of that bargain."

Republican Representative Jeff Hurd said China was seeking to undermine U.S. regional leadership and to exert influence over the FAS through coercion.

"Now more than ever, it is essential that the COFA agreements are faithfully implemented as Congress intended," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 23:19:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration accused of 'slow-walking' help to Pacific island veterans</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-accused-slow-walking-help-pacific-island-veterans-2026-01-14/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 23:19:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump calls Venezuela’s interim president 'a terrific person' after phone call</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260114-trump-calls-venezuela-interim-president-terrific-person</link><description>US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he had held a “long call” with Venezuela’s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez , the first known contact between the two leaders since the ouster of Nicolás Maduro .

“We just had a great conversation today, and she’s a terrific person,” Trump told reporters in the Oval Office.

He later said on social media that he and Rodriguez had discussed “many topics”, including oil, minerals, trade and national security.

“We are making tremendous progress,” Trump said.

After Maduro’s capture in a deadly US special forces operation on January 3, Trump said he was content to let his former deputy Rodriguez take over — as long as she granted the United States access to Venezuelan oil.

He has suggested the United States could maintain oversight of the Caribbean country for years.

Rodriguez has been walking a diplomatic tightrope, seeking to meet Trump’s demands without alienating Maduro loyalists, who control Venezuela’s security forces and feared paramilitaries.

Writing on Telegram, she described her call with the US leader as “productive and courteous” and characterised by “mutual respect”.

The 56-year-old added that she and Trump, 79, had discussed a “bilateral work agenda for the benefit of our people, as well as outstanding issues in relations between our governments”.

Earlier, at her first press conference as interim president, Rodriguez said Venezuela was entering a “new political era” marked by greater tolerance for “ideological and political diversity”.

Under pressure from Washington, Venezuela has released dozens of political prisoners in the past week, but hundreds remain behind bars.

Rodriguez claimed that a total of 406 political prisoners had been released since December in a process that “has not yet concluded”.

The Foro Penal legal rights NGO, which represents many detainees, gave a much smaller figure of around 180 freed.

An AFP count, based on data from NGOs and opposition parties, showed 70 people released since the fall of Maduro, who was taken to the United States to face trial on alleged drug trafficking charges.

Trump has so far sidelined opposition leader Maria Corina Machado from Venezuela’s post-Maduro transition, claiming the Nobel Peace Prize laureate does not command enough “respect” in the country.

Machado, who is currently living outside Venezuela, is due to meet Trump on Thursday at the White House to press for the opposition to be given a pre-eminent role.

The trickle of prisoner releases continued on Wednesday with the freeing of 17 journalists and media workers.

Roland Carreño, a journalist and prominent opposition activist detained in August 2024 during post-election protests , was among those released.

A leading member of the Popular Will party, he was previously imprisoned between 2020 and 2023 on terrorism charges — an accusation frequently used to jail opposition figures in Venezuela.

In a video shared by another freed journalist, Carreño called for “peace and reconciliation”.

To avoid scenes of jubilant opposition activists celebrating their release, authorities have been freeing detainees quietly at alternative locations, far from television cameras and relatives waiting outside detention centres.

Carreño was released at a shopping mall.

Former presidential candidate Enrique Márquez, one of the first to be freed, was driven home in a patrol car.

A US State Department official confirmed on Tuesday that Americans had been released, without specifying how many or from where.</description><pubDate>Wed, 14 Jan 2026 23:19:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d2ea03c4-f18c-11f0-93a6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-14T183136Z-2126935180-RC211JA1C0IY-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-RODRIGUEZ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to send troops for European security mission to Greenland amid Trump threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260114-france-to-send-troops-for-european-security-mission-to-greenland-amid-trump-threats</link><description>France and Germany on Wednesday said they will send troops to Greenland along with other European countries, as US President Donald Trump ramped up threats to conquer the Arctic island.

The deployment of a 13-strong Bundeswehr reconnaissance team to the Greenlandic capital Nuuk from Thursday was at Denmark 's invitation, the German Defence Ministry said.

According to Berlin, the mission aims to "explore the framework conditions for possible military contributions to support Denmark in ensuring security in the region".

France, the European Union 's only nuclear power, also confirmed that it would send troops to Greenland, after a high-stakes meeting between US, Danish and Greenlandic officials in Washington.

After meeting US officials including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said it was "clear that the president has this wish of conquering Greenland", which he argued was "absolutely not necessary".

In an exclusive Reuters interview in the Oval Office, Trump said there is a chance Iran's clerical government could collapse, blamed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy for the stalemate in negotiations with Russia over the war in Ukraine, and dismissed Republican criticism of a Justice Department probe of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the unrest against clerical rule . But he was reluctant on Wednesday to lend his full support to Pahlavi, the son of the late shah of Iran, who was ousted from power in 1979.

"He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country," Trump said. "And we really aren't up to that point yet.

"I don't know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me."

Trump's comments went further in questioning Pahlavi's ability to lead Iran after saying last week that he had no plans to meet with him.

The U.S.-based Pahlavi, 65, has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution and has become a prominent voice in the protests. Iran's opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions - including the monarchists who back Pahlavi - and appears to have little organized presence inside the Islamic Republic.

Trump said it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests but that in truth "any regime can fail."

"Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time," he said.

Trump, who is closing out the first year of his second term in office, sat behind his massive Resolute Desk and sipped a Diet Coke during the 30-minute interview. At one point, he held up a thick binder of papers he said contained his achievements since being sworn into office on January 20, 2025.

But he sought to manage expectations for Republicans in November's congressional midterm elections, noting that the party in power frequently loses seats two years after a presidential election.

"When you win the presidency, you don't win the midterms," he said. "But we're going to try very hard to win the midterms."

Trump , who has struggled throughout his presidency to end Russia's war in Ukraine despite campaign boasts that he could end it in a day, said Zelenskiy is the main impediment to resolving the four-year-old war.

Trump has frequently criticized both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy but seemed more downbeat once again on the Ukrainian president.

Trump said Putin is "ready to make a deal." Asked what the hold up is, Trump said simply: "Zelenskiy."

“We have to get President Zelenskiy to go along with it," he said.

Trump dismissed Senate Republicans who have vowed to block his Fed nominees over concerns that Trump's Justice Department is interfering with the central bank's traditional independence with its probe into Powell.

"I don't care. There's nothing to say. They should be loyal," he said of his party's lawmakers.

Trump also rejected criticism from JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon that Trump's meddling into the Fed could spike inflation.

"I don't care what he says," Trump said.

Trump is to meet on Thursday with Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado at the White House, their first in-person meeting since Trump directed the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and seized control of the country earlier this month.

"She's a very nice woman," Trump said of Machado. "I've seen her on television. I think we're just going to talk basics."

Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year and dedicated it to Trump. She has offered to give him her prize, but the Nobel Committee said the peace prize cannot be transferred.

He praised the acting president of Venezuela , Delcy Rodriguez, who was vice president to Maduro when he was ousted. Trump said he had a "fascinating talk" with Rodriguez earlier on Wednesday and "she's been very good to deal with."

Trump frequently extolled the strength of the U.S. economy during the interview despite lingering worries among Americans about prices. He said he will carry that message with him next week to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he will stress "how great our economy is, how strong our job numbers are, how good we're doing."

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Reuters that Trump will have bilateral meetings with the leaders of Switzerland, Poland and Egypt while at the Davos event.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:46:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6MY43SYMOVLEPC5SY7SKVPAVYQ.jpg?auth=8d2fd7ffa949c67fbfc6d05f65baf905b874afcbffe466f1d59994cf6f20da6e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Zelenskiy, not Putin, is holding up a Ukraine peace deal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-zelenskiy-not-putin-is-holding-up-ukraine-peace-deal-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters that Ukraine - not Russia - is holding up a potential peace deal, rhetoric that stands in marked contrast to that of European allies, who have consistently argued Moscow has little interest in ending its war in Ukraine.

In an exclusive interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday, Trump said Russian President Vladimir Putin is ready to wrap up his nearly four-year-old invasion of Ukraine. Zelenskiy, the U.S. president said, was more reticent.

"I think he's ready to make a deal," Trump said of the Russian president. "I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal."

Asked why U.S.-led negotiations had not yet resolved Europe's largest land conflict since World War Two, Trump responded: "Zelenskiy."

Trump's comments suggested renewed frustration with the Ukrainian leader. The two presidents have long had a volatile relationship, though their interactions seem to have improved over Trump's first year back in office.

At times, Trump has been more willing to accept Putin's assurances at face value than the leaders of some U.S. allies, frustrating Kyiv, European capitals and U.S. lawmakers, including some Republicans.

In December, Reuters reported that U.S. intelligence reports continued to warn that Putin had not abandoned his aims of capturing all of Ukraine and reclaiming parts of Europe that belonged to the former Soviet empire. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard disputed that report at the time.

After several fits and starts, U.S.-led negotiations have been centered in recent weeks on security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine to ensure that Russia does not invade it again after a potential peace deal. In broad terms, U.S. negotiators have pushed Ukraine to abandon its eastern Donbas region as part of any accord with Russia.

Ukrainian officials have been deeply involved in recent talks, which have been led on the U.S. side by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law. Some European officials have cast doubt on the likelihood of Putin agreeing to some terms recently hashed out by Kyiv, Washington and European leaders.

Trump told Reuters he was not aware of a potential upcoming trip to Moscow by Witkoff and Kushner, which Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday.

Asked if he would meet Zelenskiy at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week, Trump said he would but implied no plans were set.

"I would - if he's there," Trump said. "I'm going to be there."

Asked why he believed Zelenskiy was holding back on negotiations, Trump did not elaborate, saying only: "I just think he's, you know, having a hard time getting there."

Zelenskiy has publicly ruled out any territorial concessions to Moscow, saying Kyiv has no right under the country's constitution to give up any land.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:46:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OY3N4ZJSX5LKNO3RVMBW2X7C5I.jpg?auth=c0fe39a2282e91a8d1bbaec11ba2264e7e4b2b289592c298f1d8093ec6c03793&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Senate narrowly blocks effort to rein in Trump's Venezuela war powers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senate-blocks-effort-rein-trumps-venezuela-war-powers-2026-01-14/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans blocked a resolution on Wednesday that would have barred President Donald Trump from further military action in Venezuela without Congress' authorization, after the Republican president put pressure on party members who had supported it.

The vote was 51-50 for a Republican point of order to dismiss the war powers resolution, as just three of Trump's Republicans voted with every Democrat in favor of moving ahead and Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol to break the tie.

Opponents had argued that the resolution should not move ahead because the U.S. does not currently have troops on the ground in Venezuela, after U.S. forces swept into Caracas on January 3 and captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro .

"We're not currently conducting military operations there," Republican Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota said, as he opened the Senate on Wednesday. "Democrats are taking up this bill because their anti-Trump hysteria knows no bounds."

The Trump administration argues that Maduro's capture was a judicial operation to bring him to trial in the U.S. on drug charges, not a military operation.

Backers of the war powers resolution disagreed, noting that a large flotilla of U.S. ships is blockading Venezuela, and has spent months firing on boats in the southern Caribbean and Pacific. Trump also has threatened further military action.

"An argument that the Venezuela campaign is not imminent hostilities within the meaning of the war powers resolution is a violation of every reasonable meaning of that term," Democratic Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a lead sponsor of the resolution, said in a speech before the vote.

The close votes reflected concern in Congress, including from some Republicans, about Trump's foreign policy and growing support for the argument that Congress, not the president, should have the power to send U.S. troops to war, as spelled out in the U.S. Constitution.

Trump recently has said the U.S. will run Venezuela for years, told Iranians protesting against their government that "help is on the way" and threatened military action to take Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.

Wednesday's vote demonstrated Trump's hold over his party. It came less than a week after the Senate voted on January 8 to advance the resolution. In that vote, five Republicans joined every Democrat in favor of moving forward, a rare rebuke of the party leader in the Republican-majority chamber.

Trump responded furiously, saying the five Republicans should never be elected to office again. The five were Rand Paul of Kentucky, Susan Collins of Maine, Josh Hawley of Missouri, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Todd Young of Indiana. Trump's party holds a 53-47 majority in the Senate.

Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other administration officials launched an intense campaign to encourage the Republicans to flip their positions and oppose the resolution, calling them repeatedly.

Hawley and Young did so on Wednesday.

In a statement, Young said he had received assurances from "senior national security officials" that there are no U.S. troops in Venezuela. "I've also received a commitment that if President Trump were to determine American forces are needed in major military operations in Venezuela, the Administration will come to Congress in advance to ask for an authorization of force," he said.

Even if it passed the Senate, to become law the measure would have had to pass the Republican-led House of Representatives and garner two-thirds majorities in both the House and Senate to survive an expected Trump veto.

Trump's Republicans blocked two previous attempts to advance similar resolutions in the Senate last year.

After Maduro's capture, some lawmakers, including Democrats publicly and some Republicans behind the scenes, accused the administration of misleading Congress by having insisted they did not plan to force Venezuela to change its government.

In recent days, Trump has posted a meme online showing him as "Acting President of Venezuela" and told the New York Times the U.S. involvement in the South American country would last for years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:46:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3PAIOKTWPBKXFDLV7D2NALWOJ4.jpg?auth=7728e4a2532fa009cce75d4f91701ff575bcfd2e330ae4544f21fe82668b5d44&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Key quotes from President Trump's interview with Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/key-quotes-president-trumps-interview-with-reuters-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump sat for an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Here are some key quotes:

"A president should have something to say" about Fed policy, Trump said. "I made a lot of money with business, so I think I have a better understanding of it ​than Too Late Jerome Powell."

Asked if he will remove Powell, Trump said, "I don't have any plan to do that."

On the pushback ‌by some Republican senators against the Justice Department probe, Trump said, "I don't care. There's nothing to say. They should be loyal. That's what I say."

On his pick for the next Fed chair: "The two Kevins are very good ... You have some other good people too, but I'll be announcing something over the next couple of weeks."

Trump was referring to White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh.

TRUMP UNSURE IF ZELENSKIY WANTS A PEACE DEAL
"We have to get President Zelenskiy to go along ‌with it," Trump said about a deal with Russia to end its war in Ukraine .

Asked if he supported the idea of ​U.S. security guarantees to protect Ukraine through intelligence sharing, Trump said, "If we can get something done, we'd help. They're losing 30,000 soldiers a month between them and Russia. Now, Europe is going to help us with that."

On Putin : "I think he’s ready to make a deal. I think Ukraine is less ready to make a ‍deal," Trump said. Asked what the holdup is, Trump responded, "Zelenskiy."

"He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country. And we really aren’t up to that point yet, we're looking and studying a lot of things. But it's very early - too soon to say. I don't know how he gets ⁠along with his country."

"I don't know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with ‍me," Trump said, noting he has not spoken with Pahlavi.

"I think we're just going to talk. And I haven't met her. She's a very ‌nice woman. ‌I think we're just going to talk basics," Trump said about Venezuela's opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

Asked if he wanted Machado to give him her Nobel Peace Prize, Trump said, "No, I didn't say that. She won the Nobel Peace Prize."

What if she brings the prize? "Well, that's what I'm hearing. I don't know, but I shouldn't be the one to say," Trump said.

The president also said he had "a very good talk" on Wednesday with Delcy Rodriguez, the interim president of Venezuela. "She's ⁠been very good to deal with."

"I think ⁠she's (Delcy) going to come, you know, ​eventually she's going to... not quite yet, but eventually she'll come and I'll go to their country too."
MIDTERMS

Trump said Republicans should do well "but if you go by the past, only three presidents have won out of 65 years, or whatever the number is. What is that number? The crazy number almost doesn't make sense, right? Even if they ‍had a successful presidency, yeah, there's almost like there's a latch on it."

Asked if the Cuban regime is more likely to fall after the U.S. military actions in Venezuela, Trump said, "Probably, yeah, I think so."

"Because they don’t get money anymore from Venezuela. They don’t get money, they don’t get oil, they don’t get gold from Venezuela. It’s cut off entirely. So you know ​it’s more likely it’s going to fall," Trump added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:46:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZNQTKHCZYFPWRBPBZ6ER6H7OH4.jpg?auth=da374bec8010d3910ea40a2659352408cd03cc9fe53d24c7e8841d0d9bdae5b2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump calls Minnesota ICE shooting 'sad to see on both sides'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-calls-minnesota-ice-shooting-sad-see-both-sides-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump struck a more conciliatory tone regarding an ICE officer's fatal shooting of a Minnesota mother, saying on Wednesday that it was "sad to see on both sides."

During a wide-ranging interview with Reuters in the Oval Office, Trump called the shooting "unfortunate," a more moderate response than earlier remarks by Vice President JD Vance and Trump's own social media post.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Jonathan Ross, fatally shot U.S. citizen Renee Good , a mother of three, on January 7 in Minneapolis after Trump surged more than 2,000 federal officers to Minnesota to ramp up immigration enforcement.

Videos reviewed by Reuters showed Ross fired the first of three shots as the car began moving past him.

In a post on Truth Social shortly after the shooting, Trump called Good "a professional agitator" who "violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer," saying it appeared the officer shot her in self-defense.

When Reuters asked on Wednesday if he believed the ICE officer did the right thing, the Republican president struck a more cautious tone.

"I don't get into right or wrong. I know that it was a tough situation to be in," Trump said of the officer's involvement. "There was very little respect shown to the police, in this case, the ICE officers."

"It's so sad to see on both sides," he added.

When asked if he would pardon Ross if he was charged and convicted in the shooting, Trump said he would wait to see how the process played out.

"I think that we're gonna have to see what happens. That was a very unfortunate incident. We're just going to see what happens," Trump said.

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties although local officials have rejected the idea that the shooting was in self-defense.

Trump said he would continue to send ICE officers into U.S. cities, saying it was needed to combat crime, even as the surges have led to violent confrontations .

ICE data shows many of those arrested in Trump's crackdown have no criminal charges or prior convictions.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:47:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HFVY3L2NZJMAJLD5ASBTYIJ36Y.jpg?auth=1810355bc5798a082644c73590ea55d700b136b1c7832b92ae172f3a49fcce04&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Costa Rica, weeks before election, hosts El Salvador President Bukele to inaugurate new mega-prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/costa-rica-weeks-before-election-hosts-el-salvador-president-bukele-inaugurate-2026-01-15/</link><description>SAN JOSE, Jan 14 (Reuters) - El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele inaugurated a new maximum-security prison in nearby Costa Rica on Wednesday, less than three weeks before Costa Ricans elect a new president in an election that has put crime front and center in campaigns.

Bukele's government is helping build the prison, which Costa Rican President Rodrigo Chaves announced last year as part of a crackdown on violence fueled by drug trafficking.

The model for the new prison, El Salvador's 40,000-inmate Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), is the centerpiece of Bukele's war on gangs. The Salvadoran government is also providing technical assistance for the project.

"Everything we did in CECOT will be replicated in the Costa Rican version," Bukele said on Wednesday, after describing how he took on a "dictatorship of organized crime" in his country.

While Bukele's crackdown is credited with a sharp drop in El Salvador's murder rate, human rights organizations report abuses within CECOT, describing inhumane conditions and deaths within the prison - allegations El Salvador's government denies.

The new Costa Rican facility, named the Center for High Containment of Organized Crime (CACCO) and located about 11 miles (18 km) outside the capital San Jose, will have a capacity for 5,100 inmates and will increase Costa Rica's prison capacity by 40%.

Costa Rica, long considered to be the safest nation in Central America, is grappling with a wave of homicides tied to drug trafficking groups fighting over territories and markets. Opinion polls rank insecurity as the public's top concern ahead of general elections on February 1.

Chaves leaves office on May 8, before the CACCO's mid-year completion target. His party's candidate, Laura Fernandez, leads polls to succeed him.

The ruling party is aiming to win in the first round, needing at least 40% of the votes, and hopes for a big enough legislative majority to be able to push through reforms similar to Bukele's in El Salvador, especially in the judiciary.

"This CACCO will be empty if our laws don't change and if the judiciary doesn't change," said Chaves, who has criticized Costa Rica's justice system, saying it has worked against his government and been responsible for homicide rates that have hit record highs during his administration.

Chaves, who is facing corruption charges which he rejects, says the judiciary is politicised and corrupt. He is pushing for tougher penalties, restricting the possibility of alternative sentences, replacing judges and magistrates and making gang membership a crime.

Opposition groups criticized Bukele's visit as potential interference in Costa Rica's election. The Supreme Electoral Tribunal said on Monday that there were no laws preventing Bukele's visit, though it warned him not to express support or opposition for political parties.

Chaves called this "a lack of respect" toward his guest and apologized to Bukele.

With a homicide rate of almost 17 per 100,000 inhabitants, less than a fifth of El Salvador's figure a decade ago, Costa Rica needs to take measures soon to prevent the escalation of criminal gang control, Bukele said.

"If not, [crime] will continue to grow, and more Costa Ricans will die, and people won't be able to go out on the streets at certain hours due to curfews," he said, before admitting that the problems in both countries are different in nature, possibly alluding to the weight of the drug trafficking industry in the Costa Rican case.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:47:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UO4MT44N2JK4HHGX3RWVNX5WCM.jpg?auth=e7c52c6b36d59e6a33fcf804af4976da50fe172f8956ae9b9784094f290cee32&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda to vote in tense election clouded by succession questions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-vote-tense-election-clouded-by-succession-questions-2026-01-15/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni is seeking to extend his rule into a fifth decade in an election on Thursday with internet restricted across the country following an often violent campaign.

Museveni is expected to fend off a challenge from the popular singer Bobi Wine , but the vote will be a test of the 81-year-old leader's political strength and ability to avoid the kind of unrest that has rocked neighbours Tanzania and Kenya.

The longtime leader has campaigned on a slogan of "protecting the gains", vowing to maintain peace and lift the country into middle-income status.

Wine, a 43-year-old pop star nicknamed the "Ghetto President" for his humble origins, has promised to end what he calls Museveni's "dictatorship" and has appealed to young people angry about scarce economic opportunities. More than 70% of Uganda's population is under the age of 30.

Security forces have repeatedly opened fire at Wine's campaign events, killing at least one person, and have arrested hundreds of his supporters. Museveni's government has defended the security forces' actions as a justified response to what it called lawless conduct by opposition supporters.

The military has deployed heavily on the streets of the capital Kampala and authorities cut internet access and limited mobile access across the country on Tuesday to curb what they called "misinformation" about the vote.

The U.N. Human Rights Office said last week that the elections were taking place amid "widespread repression and intimidation".

Besides Wine, six other opposition candidates are challenging Museveni - Africa's third-longest-ruling head of state. Voters will also choose more than 500 members of parliament. Polls are due to close at 4 p.m. (1300 GMT) with results expected to be announced within 48 hours, i.e. by Saturday afternoon.

Museveni came to power at the head of a rebellion in 1986. He has changed the constitution twice to remove age and term limits, and his dominance of Ugandan institutions means there is little prospect of an election upset, political analysts say.

As president, he has positioned Uganda as a strategic partner of Western nations, sending troops to regional hotspots like Somalia and taking millions of refugees.

Economic growth, traditionally reliant on agriculture and tourism, is expected to surge into double digits when crude oil production from fields run by France's TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA) , opens new tab and China's CNOOC (600938.SS) , opens new tab begins later this year.

Museveni has faced criticism for alleged human rights abuses and unfair elections, charges his government has always denied.

The United States denounced his last election victory in 2021 - in which he defeated Wine with 58% of the vote - as neither free nor fair. Security forces killed more than 50 opposition supporters in the lead-up to that vote.

Similar criticism from President Donald Trump's administration is unlikely this time after U.S. diplomats were instructed in July not to comment on the integrity of foreign elections.

Museveni is widely believed to favour his son, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, as his successor, though the president has denied grooming him for the role.

Kainerugaba, a prolific social media presence who often posts threats of violence against opposition leaders, has openly declared his presidential ambitions, but his status as heir apparent is not universally accepted within the ruling party, analysts say.

"While bringing stability, another term for the 81-year-old President Museveni will heighten succession risks, effectively kicking the can down the road on leadership transition," said Jervin Naidoo, a political analyst at Oxford Economics.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:47:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YLHTGCIN4BMCTETPGNZSUEE5YE.jpg?auth=c97488df888431c9ce46caa8ae81bcf5e544c2f06f6d35e0e275c330d0a0dcbf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Haiti drone operation strikes home of gang leader 'Barbecue'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/haiti-operation-destroys-homes-gang-leader-barbecue-local-media-reports-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:47:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says Iran executions ‘stopping’ as Tehran signals fast trials and hangings</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260115-trump-says-iran-executions-stopping-as-tehran-signals-fast-trials-and-hangings</link><description>President Donald Trump made a vague statement on Wednesday saying he had been told “on good authority” that plans for executions in Iran had stopped, even as Tehran indicated that fast trials and executions lay ahead as part of its crackdown on protesters.

The US president’s claims, made with few details, came as he has told protesting Iranians in recent days that “help is on the way” and that his administration would “act accordingly” in response to the Iranian government. Trump has not offered specifics on how the United States might respond, and it was unclear whether his comments on Wednesday suggested he would hold off on any action.

“We’ve been told that the killing in Iran is stopping — it’s stopped — it’s stopping,” Trump said at the White House while signing executive orders and legislation. “And there’s no plan for executions, or an execution, or executions — so I’ve been told that on good authority.”

Trump did not specify the source of the information, describing it only as coming from “very important sources on the other side”.

He said he would “find out” later whether it was true, without explaining how.

“I hope it’s true,” he said. “Who knows?”

Asked whether that meant he was not planning to take action against the Iranian government, Trump said: “We’re going to watch it and see what the process is. But we were given a very good statement by people that are aware of what’s going on.”

The president on Tuesday consulted his national security team about next steps after telling reporters he believed the killing in Iran was “significant”.

Vice President JD Vance , Secretary of State Marco Rubio and key White House National Security Council officials began meeting last Friday to develop options for Trump, ranging from a diplomatic approach to military strikes.

The Iranian security forces’ crackdown on demonstrations has killed at least 2,586 people, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency.

On Wednesday, Iranian officials signalled that suspects detained in nationwide protests would face fast trials and executions, while the Islamic Republic promised a “decisive response” if the United States or Israel intervened in the domestic unrest.

The threats emerged as some personnel at a key US military base in Qatar were advised to evacuate by Wednesday evening, following Trump’s escalated warnings of potential military action over the killing of peaceful demonstrators .

Mohammad Pakpour, commander of Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, reiterated claims — without providing evidence — that the United States and Israel had instigated the protests and were responsible for the deaths of protesters and security forces during the turmoil, according to Iran’s semi-official Tasnim news agency.

He added that those countries would “receive the response at the appropriate time”.

Earlier on Wednesday, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, Iran’s judiciary chief, said the government must act quickly to punish more than 18,000 people detained during the protests through rapid trials and executions. His comments were made in a video shared online by Iranian state television.

“If we want to do a job, we should do it now. If we want to do something, we have to do it quickly,” he said. “If it becomes late — two months, three months later — it doesn’t have the same effect. If we want to do something, we have to do that fast.”

The remarks appeared to directly challenge Trump, who warned Iran about carrying out executions in an interview with CBS aired on Tuesday.

“If they do such a thing, we will take very strong action,” Trump said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 01:47:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3ded3d62-f192-11f0-bc63-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25173084754540.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man shot in Minneapolis during federal immigration operation, local media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/man-shot-minneapolis-during-federal-immigration-operation-local-media-reports-2026-01-15/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 14 (Reuters) - A man was shot in the leg on Wednesday night during a federal immigration enforcement operation in north Minneapolis, the Minnesota Star Tribune reported, citing multiple sources with knowledge of the situation.

According to the Star Tribune, eye witnesses said a series of gunshots followed a car chase involving federal agents.

No official information from law enforcement agencies was immediately available, but the city of Minneapolis said on the social media platform X that it was "aware of reports of a shooting involving federal law enforcement in north Minneapolis."

The shooting report surfaced one week after a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent shot and killed a 37-year-old woman behind the wheel of her car in a residential neighborhood of Minneapolis during a major deportation operation ordered in the city by U.S. President Donald Trump.

The killing of Renee Good, who was part of a volunteer neighborhood patrol network tracking and monitoring ICE activities in the city touched off a wave of protests in Minneapolis and across the country.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the latest report of a shooting.

Earlier on Wednesday, Trump said he would cut off federal funding next month for any state that includes sanctuary cities where officials have prohibited local law enforcement from cooperating in federal immigration enforcement operations.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:42:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Another crane collapses in Thailand killing 2 people, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/another-crane-collapses-thailand-killing-2-people-police-say-2026-01-15/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A crane collapsed in Thailand on Thursday, crushing two vehicles and killing two people, police said, a day after a crane accident in the northeast caused the deaths of 32 train passengers.

It was the latest in a series of fatal accidents caused by construction projects in Thailand, and comes after a train was derailed on Wednesday in northeastern Nakhon Ratchasima province by the collapse of a crane involved an elevated high-speed rail project.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has recalled Parliament from its summer break to sit next Monday and Tuesday with the hope that a combined bill that authorises a gun buyback and lowers the bar for hate speech prosecutions can be passed.

On Thursday, Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley said the bill was "unsalvageable" after prominent conservative lawmakers said it threatened free speech and religious freedom.

The December 14 shooting in Sydney that killed 15 people at a Hanukkah celebration sparked nationwide calls to tackle antisemitism. Police say the alleged gunmen were inspired by the Islamic State militant group.

Ley criticised the bill for not targeting "radical Islamic extremist hate preaching without impinging on free speech."

The bill exempts preachers who quote from or discuss religious texts, which the Executive Council of Australian Jewry said could pose a loophole that allows antisemitism.

The National Party, which partners with the Liberals in a conservative coalition, has also criticised the government for combining gun control measures, which it opposed, and hate speech in the same bill.

"This should have been a moment of national unity," Albanese said in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio interview on Thursday.

The government is prepared to consider amendments to the bill, he added.

Labor holds a majority in the lower house of Parliament and is likely to negotiate with the Greens party for support for the bill in the Senate.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said since the draft law was released, a neo-Nazi group that was flagged as a concern by intelligence agencies disbanded this week to avoid prosecution, which he said showed the effectiveness of the bill. In addition, a Muslim prayer hall in Sydney linked to a cleric who was found by a court to have made intimidating statements about Jewish people said it would shut down.

An expert in constitutional law, Anne Twomey, said the proposed law could be challenged in the High Court for impinging on political communication.

The proposed offence of promoting racial hatred carries a five-year prison sentence.

Daniel Aghion, president of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, said the reform would make it easier to prosecute hate crimes because incitement of an audience would no longer need to be proved in court.

In a statement, the council said the bill should be passed, even though it had "serious shortcomings."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:43:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UMFMN7RKQVJGVPIJ2GTEJEEQUM.jpg?auth=753347fab66d97e2f6c3ce6ea825ecdb53ddaba1fe1decaa2979e6bdd711cdf5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>xAI restricts Grok chatbot after sexualised AI images spark global concern</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260115-xai-restricts-grok-chatbot-after-sexualised-ai-images-spark-global-concern</link><description>Elon Musk 's artificial intelligence company xAI said late on Wednesday that it had imposed restrictions on all users of its Grok AI chatbot that limit image editing after the service produced sexualised images that sparked concerns among global regulators.

"We have implemented technological measures to prevent the Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis. This restriction applies to all users, including paid subscribers," the company said in an X post.

Hyper-realistic images of women manipulated to look like they were in microscopic bikinis, in degrading poses or covered in bruises began flooding social media platform X this month. In some cases, minors were digitally stripped down to swimwear, sparking broad criticism.

Grok last week began allowing only paying subscribers to use its image generation and editing features. X last week curtailed Grok's ability to generate or edit images publicly for many of its users, but the chatbot still privately produced sexually charged images on demand on Wednesday before xAI's announcement, Reuters found.

Billionaire Musk owns xAI, which in turn owns X, formerly known as Twitter .

xAI added on Wednesday that it blocks users based on their location from generating images of people in skimpy attire in "jurisdictions where it's illegal". It did not name those jurisdictions.

California 's governor and attorney general said earlier on Wednesday that they were demanding answers from xAI after Musk said he was not aware of any "naked underage images" generated by Grok.

"We’re demanding immediate answers from xAI on their plan to stop the creation &amp; spread of this content," California Attorney General Rob Bonta wrote on X. Governor Gavin Newsom called on Bonta "to immediately investigate the company and hold xAI accountable."

The comments from Newsom and Bonta were the most serious so far by US officials addressing the explosion of AI-generated non-consensual sexualised imagery on X.

The California move added to the pressure Musk is facing in the US and around the world. Lawmakers and advocacy groups have called for Apple and Google to drop Grok from app stores.

Government officials have threatened action in Europe and the United Kingdom . Indonesia temporarily blocked access to Grok.

At first, Musk publicly laughed off the controversy, posting humorous emojis in response to other users' comments about the influx of sexualised photos. More recently, X has said it treats reports of child sexual abuse material seriously and polices it vigorously.

Musk said earlier on Wednesday he was "not aware of any naked underage images generated by Grok. Literally zero."

X did not immediately respond to questions about the California announcement and Musk's comments.

xAI did not respond directly to an emailed request for comment on California officials' statements or Musk's post that he was unaware of sexualised imagery of minors. Reuters received its generic autoreply message for inquiries: "Legacy Media Lies."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:44:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d2a0b280-f0a8-11f0-b267-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-10T071240Z-1643871076-RC2PVCA7FSED-RTRMADP-3-XAI-GROK-INDONESIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NASA conducts first-ever medical evacuation from space station</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260115-nasa-conducts-first-ever-medical-evacuation-from-space-station</link><description>An astronaut in need of doctors' care departed the International Space Station with three crewmates on Wednesday in NASA's first medical evacuation.

The four returning astronauts — from the US , Russia and Japan — are aiming for an early Thursday morning splashdown in the Pacific near San Diego with SpaceX. The decision cuts short their mission by over a month.

“Our timing of this departure is unexpected,” NASA astronaut Zena Cardman said before the return trip, “but what was not surprising to me was how well this crew came together as a family to help each other and just take care of each other.”

Officials refused to identify the astronaut who needed care last week and would not divulge the health concerns.

The ailing astronaut is “stable, safe and well cared for,” outgoing space station commander Mike Fincke said earlier this week via social media. “This was a deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists."

Launched in August, Cardman, Fincke, Japan ’s Kimiya Yui and Russia ’s Oleg Platonov should have remained on the space station until late February. But on Jan. 7, NASA abruptly canceled the next day’s spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke and later announced the crew’s early return. Officials said the health problem was unrelated to spacewalk preparations or other station operations, but offered no other details, citing medical privacy. They stressed it was not an emergency situation.

NASA said it would stick to the same entry and splashdown procedures at flight’s end, with the usual assortment of medical experts aboard the recovery ship in the Pacific. It was another middle-of-the-night crew return for SpaceX, coming less than 11 hours after undocking from the space station. NASA said it was not yet known how quickly all four would be flown from California to Houston, home to Johnson Space Center and the base for astronauts.

One US and two Russian astronauts remain aboard the orbiting lab, just 1 1/2 months into an eight-month mission that began with a Soyuz rocket liftoff from Kazakhstan. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the launch of a fresh four-person crew from Florida, currently targeted for mid-February.

Computer modeling predicted a medical evacuation from the space station every three years, but NASA hasn't had one in its 65 years of human spaceflight. The Russians have not been as fortunate. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin came down with a serious infection or related illness aboard his country’s Salyut 7 space station, prompting an early return. A few other Soviet cosmonauts encountered less serious health issues that shortened their flights.

It was the first spaceflight for Cardman, a 38, biologist and polar explorer who missed out on spacewalking, as well as Platonov, 39, a former fighter pilot with the Russian air force who had to wait a few extra years to get to space because of an undisclosed health issue. Cardman should have launched last year but was bumped to make room on the way down for NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were stuck nearly a year at the space station because of Boeing’s capsule problems.

Fincke, 58, a retired Air Force colonel, and Yui, 55, a retired fighter pilot with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, were repeat space fliers. Finke has spent 1 1/2 years in orbit over four missions and conducted nine spacewalks on previous flights, making him one of NASA’s top performers. Last week, Yui celebrated his 300th day in space over two station stays, sharing stunning views of Earth, including Japan’s Mount Fuji and breathtaking auroras.

“I want to burn it firmly into my eyes, and even more so, into my heart,” Yui said on the social platform X. “Soon, I too will become one of those small lights on the ground.”

NASA officials had said it was riskier to leave the astronaut in space without proper medical attention for another month than to temporarily reduce the size of the space station crew by more than half. Until SpaceX delivers another crew, NASA said it will have to stand down from any routine or even emergency spacewalks, a two-person job requiring backup help from crew inside the orbiting complex.

The medical evacuation was the first major decision by NASA’s new administrator Jared Isaacman. The billionaire founder of a payment processing company and two-time space flier assumed the agency’s top job in December.

“The health and the well-being of our astronauts is always and will be our highest priority,” Isaacman said in announcing the decision last week.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 03:44:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e1b885f0-ece7-11f0-ac0a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/e6a95665bbf8d84d5f8596b8902630bd8ab89129.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesian forces rescue 18 Freeport workers from rebel siege in Papua</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesian-forces-rescue-18-freeport-workers-rebel-siege-papua-2026-01-15/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Indonesian military rescued 18 workers at gold and copper miner Freeport Indonesia that had been surrounded by armed rebels for three days at a company outpost in the insurgency-plagued Papua region, officials said on Thursday.

The rebel group - the Free Papua Movement - says it is fighting for secession of the region from Indonesia, which has controlled half of the resource-rich island since 1969 after decades of Dutch control. The other half of the massive Pacific island - one of the largest in the world - is the independent state of Papua New Guinea, north of Australia.

The workers were fixing one of Freeport's electric towers in Tembagapura district in the mountainous Central Papua province, when rebels surrounded them last week, Indonesia defence ministry spokesperson Rico Ricardo Sirait told Reuters.

"They intimidated the workers, fired shots to frighten or trouble them psychologically," Sirait said.

The military used drones to deliver food and medicine to the stranded workers, before evacuating them to safety after three days, he added.

Freeport Indonesia and the spokesperson of Papuan separatists did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The military did not provide details on the operation to extricate the workers, but said no shots were fired.

"The rescue operation was carried out in extremely difficult terrain with a high level of threat and time constraints as crucial factors," the operation commander Major General Lucky Avianto said in a statement.

Footage shared by the military on YouTube showed two dozen armed soldiers passing through a forest and river at night, apparently near the site. Another photo showed the soldiers with the rescued workers.

Papua is one of Indonesia's poorest regions, despite being resource rich. It is home to Freeport's Grasberg mine , which is one of the world's largest gold and copper mines.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 04:41:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: UN Security Council to meet for 'a briefing on the situation in Iran'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260115-live-un-security-council-to-meet-for-a-briefing-on-the-situation-in-iran</link><description>India’s foreign ministry has urged its citizens to leave Iran, where rights groups say a crackdown on mass protests has killed and led to the arrest of thousands of people.

The ministry estimates there are usually around 10,000 Indian citizens in Iran.

“Indian nationals who are currently in Iran (students, pilgrims, businesspersons and tourists) are advised to leave Iran by available means of transport,” the Indian embassy in Tehran said in a social media post late on Wednesday.

Iran reopened its airspace after a near five-hour closure amid concerns over possible military action between the United States and Iran, which forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay some flights.

Iran closed its airspace to all flights except international services to and from the country with official permission at 5:15 p.m. ET (2215 GMT) on Wednesday, according to a notice on the US Federal Aviation Administration website.

The notice was removed shortly before 10 p.m. ET, or 0300 GMT, according to tracking service Flightradar24, which showed five flights from Iranian carriers Mahan Air, Yazd Airways and AVA Airlines among the first to resume flying over the country.

The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet on Thursday afternoon for “a briefing on the situation in Iran,” according to a spokesperson for the Somali presidency.

The scheduling note said the briefing was requested by the United States.

Welcome to today's liveblog on the situation in Iran. Follow along to see how the day's events unfold.

The head of Iran’s judiciary signaled that there would be fast trials and executions ahead for those detained in nationwide protests despite a warning from US President Donald Trump.

The nationwide shutdown of the internet by authorities in Iran, which activists fear is aimed at masking the true scale of a crackdown on protests, has now lasted over 132 hours, according to a monitor.

Iranian security forces have killed at least 3,428 protesters in a crackdown on demonstrations, the Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) NGO said on Wednesday, adding that more than 10,000 people had also been arrested.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 04:41:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/315708e6-f1ae-11f0-8a24-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014593926628.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan, Philippines sign new security pacts as regional tensions rise</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japan-philippines-sign-new-security-pacts-regional-tensions-rise-2026-01-15/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The Philippines and Japan signed two defence pacts on Thursday, including a deal allowing their forces to exchange supplies and services, with both countries seeking to strengthen security cooperation in response to rising regional tensions.

The Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement, designed to enable the swift provision of supplies and services between their militaries, comes months after a landmark Reciprocal Access Agreement between two of Washington's closest Asian allies took effect.

Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi signed the deals in Manila during a nine‑day Middle East and Asia tour, with stops in Israel, the Palestinian territories, Qatar and India, reflecting Tokyo's growing strategic footprint.

Motegi and his Philippine counterpart Theresa Lazaro, also announced a $6 million Official Security Assistance from Tokyo to fund the building of facilities to house rigid‑hulled inflatable boats donated by Japan to boost Manila's naval capabilities.

Japan has voiced concerns about rising maritime tensions in East Asia, opposing any unilateral attempt to change the status quo and backing Philippine maritime security as part of a broader trilateral framework with the United States.

"The Secretary and I also confirmed the importance of the Japan, Philippines, U.S. trilateral cooperation in the face of an increasingly severe strategic environment," Motegi said in a joint press conference with Lazaro.

Japan has supported the 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague rejecting China's expansive South China Sea claims, a decision Beijing has rejected.

Lazaro said both nations recognise the value of promoting the rule of law, including the freedom of navigation and overflight, adding that Japan remained a vital strategic partner.

Motegi's visit comes as the Philippines takes over the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and as tensions rise in the Taiwan Strait.

Japan has warned that peace and stability around Taiwan are vital to global security, and remarks by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi in November that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger Japanese military action drew a furious response from Beijing, including a travel boycott and an export ban on dual-use items.

China claims sovereignty over Taiwan, which sits just over 100 km (60 miles) from Japanese territory, and has not ruled out using force to take control of the island. Taiwan rejects Beijing's claim and says only Taiwan's people can decide their future.

Japan has embarked on a historic military build-up to counter Beijing's growing might and assertiveness in the region.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:26:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SI43QO5PM5PY3KYD4XTCMU2WUI.jpg?auth=c8e0cfcf608ea6f3db296c76cdbb49b81a7ff9646767cb163b8f23246f54b99b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: IMF chief Georgieva arrives in Kyiv for first visit since 2023</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/imf-chief-georgieva-arrives-kyiv-first-visit-since-2023-2026-01-15/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 15 (Reuters) - International Monetary Fund chief Kristalina Georgieva arrived in Kyiv early on Thursday for high-level talks, two sources familiar with the matter said, as Ukraine prepares to mark the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion on February 24.

The IMF managing director is expected to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko, and central bank chief Andriy Pyshnyi, as well as business executives during her trip, one of the sources said.

Details of Georgieva's visit to Ukraine were tightly held given security concerns. The IMF chief, who has close family ties to Ukraine, last visited the country in February 2023. Georgieva's brother is married to a woman from Ukraine and was in Kharkiv, the second-largest city, when Russia invaded.

Ukraine and the IMF reached a preliminary agreement on an $8.2 billion, four-year lending program in November, contingent on several actions, including passage of a budget and shoring up donor financing assurances. IMF officials say Ukraine has made progress and expect board consideration in several weeks.

Approval of the funding is critical, since it will unlock additional external investments needed to close Ukraine’s financing gaps, which the IMF has calculated at around $136.5 billion for the period through 2029, given the ongoing war.

The war - soon to enter its fifth year - has hit the Ukrainian economy hard, with the country slated to spend the bulk of state revenues - 2.8 trillion hryvnias or around 27.2% of GDP - to fund its defense efforts in 2026.

Georgieva will review Ukraine's progress on several actions, including passage of a 2026 budget , taking steps to boost domestic revenues by broadening its tax base, and ensuring large-scale external donor financing on grant-like terms.

When it announced the preliminary deal, the IMF said Ukrainian authorities had also agreed to accelerate efforts to prevent tax evasion and avoidance, including by taxing income earned through digital platforms, closing customs loopholes for certain imports and removing exemptions for value-added tax.

The IMF expects Ukraine to introduce some of these measures in parliament, but isn't counting on higher revenues until 2027.

In addition to working to "de-shadow" the economy, which has a high level of informal businesses that lack balance sheets, Ukraine also vowed to keep anti-corruption institutions independent, and fix loopholes in the current labor code.

Ukraine passed a big milestone toward closing financing gaps last month when European Union leaders agreed to lend it 90 billion euros ($105 billion) for two years. Ukraine must only service the loan if Russia pays reparations after the war ends, which means it won't pose a burden on the budget.

It also completed restructuring of $2.6 billion in growth-linked debt , easing pressure on Kyiv, which had warned that the instruments could have cost as much as $20 billion through 2041.

The new IMF program will replace its current four-year $15.5 billion program, of which some $10.6 billion has been disbursed, which had assumed the war would end in 2025.

The new preliminary agreement assumes the war will end this year, but includes a "downside scenario" that the war winds down slowly and does not end until 2028.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:28:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7VXD27ZI35LYZEMNJW7HRZEF2M.jpg?auth=78dda6fd74417f0a600b58edb3e56ab66a29ce7026169981b8e380fdf6444f20&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China, Canada move to reset ties as Carney visits</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-canada-move-reset-ties-carney-visits-2026-01-15/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 15 (Reuters) - China is willing to deepen cooperation with Canada while eliminating "interference", Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Canadian counterpart at a meeting in Beijing on Thursday.

The comments came after Prime Minister Mark Carney's arrival in the Chinese capital on a four-day state visit, the first by a Canadian head of government in nearly a decade.

Carney is set to meet Premier Li Qiang later on Thursday and President Xi Jinping on Friday.

"China is willing to enhance communication with Canada, foster mutual trust, eliminate interference and deepen cooperation," Wang, China's top diplomat, told Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand, who was part of Carney's delegation.

That would ensure two-way ties keep steady, substantive and robust, the Canadian prime minister's office cited Wang as telling Anand.

"We'll make sure that we continue to make progress together in the short and the long term for the benefit of the peoples of both of our countries," Anand told Wang.

Since a positive encounter in October between Carney and Xi in South Korea, the countries have shown a common desire to turn the page and reset ties following periods of tension in relations since 2017.

The most recent instance of fraught ties was after former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government set tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles in 2024, following similar U.S. curbs.

China retaliated last March with tariffs on more than $2.6 billion of Canadian farm and food products, such as canola oil and meal, leading to a slump of 10.4% in Chinese imports of Canadian goods in 2025, shown in customs data on Wednesday.

Re-engagement with China has also been fuelled by a push to diversify export markets after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canada last year and suggested the longtime U.S. ally could become his country's 51st state.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:28:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7G7QJOAVYZIYXNXAWDTD7DKXDU.jpg?auth=4982001d384be3f44d0074a94277b191407e9fe9b1b25086404521ba452805bf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan says more US arms sales are in the pipeline</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-says-more-us-arms-sales-are-pipeline-2026-01-15/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - More U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are in the pipeline with four deals yet to be notified to Congress, a senior Taiwanese defence official said on Thursday, following the announcement of an $11 billion package last month, the largest ever for the island.

The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier, despite the lack of formal diplomatic ties. China, which claims Taiwan as its territory, held war games around the island in late December after the latest deal was announced.

Speaking to reporters in Taipei following a weekly cabinet meeting, Vice Defence Minister Hsu Szu-chien said that four additional packages for Taiwan had yet to be formally notified to the U.S. Congress, the usual process for approval of such sales.

"Don't ask me what four these are, I cannot say, but there are still four cases yet to be notified to Congress," Hsu said, adding he could not say more for legal reasons.

The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside Washington business hours.

The announced December arms sales cover eight items, including Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab HIMARS rocket systems and Altius loitering munition drones.

In November, President Lai Ching-te unveiled an extra $40 billion in defence spending to 2033 to underscore Taiwan's determination to defend itself in the face of the rising threat from China.

But Taiwan's opposition, which has the most seats in parliament, has not let the measure progress to the committee stage for review, arguing that the spending details are vague and that they want more details.

Defence Minister Wellington Koo will give lawmakers a confidential briefing on Monday, and the ministry is happy to give more details, Hsu said.

"It is not that we are unwilling to explain - give us an opportunity to explain, a legal opportunity," Hsu added. "This is not a 'black box'."

The Trump administration has strongly backed Taiwan's plans to ramp up military spending, something it has been pushing its allies in Europe in particular to do.

Hsu said Taiwan had to spend more given the threat. "Everyone knows the threat we are facing is growing and growing," he said.

Taiwan's democratically elected government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, saying only the island's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 05:28:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O57CF3KIIRIKREROIQMKDAYRBM.jpg?auth=3159f2c0f31bcb2525b78de1f96895603e2585cbd7e48e08521b4ae51e7ae9d3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Five takeaways from the Reuters interview of President Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/five-takeaways-reuters-interview-president-trump-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Reuters sat down with U.S. President Donald Trump for an interview in the Oval Office on Wednesday. Here are some takeaways from the 30-minute exchange:

Trump repeatedly dismissed concerns by the public, business leaders and even his fellow Republicans on issues ranging from the future of Greenland and the criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, to the state of the economy.

When told that a Reuters/Ipsos poll found tepid support among Americans for taking control of Greenland, Trump called the poll “fake.”

"I don't care," he responded when asked about the pushback by some Senate Republicans against the investigation into Powell. "I don't care," he said again, when reminded of JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon’s concerns that White House interference in the Fed could harm the economy.

When asked about Americans' worries about high prices, Trump reiterated that the economy was the strongest “in history” and said he had to do a better job of promoting his achievements. (He referred to a specially prepared thick binder that listed his accomplishments in office.)

The president suggested that he follows his own compass. “A lot of times, you can't convince a voter,” he said. “You have to just do what's right. And then a lot of the things I did were not really politically popular. They turned out to be when it worked out so well.”

A HOLDING PATTERN ON IRAN

Earlier in the day, Trump told reporters he believed the crackdown on protesters in Iran was easing, although he declined to cite his source for the information. It remained unclear whether he was still considering ordering a U.S. military strike on the country.

Despite his stream of threats toward the Iranian regime, Trump was noncommittal in the interview about what he wants to see happen in Iran, refusing to call for the ouster of the country's rulers. He also declined to offer support to the exiled crown prince of Iran, Reza Pahlavi , as a potential future leader.

“I don't know how he'd play within his own country, and we really aren't up to that point yet,” Trump said. “We have to play it day by day.”

PEACE IS HARD

Trump discussed two of his signature peace initiatives: the ceasefire in Gaza and his attempts to end Russia's war in Ukraine . Both efforts have hit rough patches.

Despite his claim that he had brought peace to the Middle East, Trump conceded that Hamas had still not disarmed – a condition of the ceasefire agreement – and it was unclear whether they would. “They were born with a gun in the hand,” he said. “So, we're gonna have to find out whether or not we're gonna be able to get it done.”

With regard to Ukraine, Trump again suggested that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ready to strike a deal. Asked directly what the hold-up was, Trump answered: “Zelenskiy,” referring to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who has maintained his country won’t seek peace at any cost.

Trump appeared to express some sympathy for the death of Renee Nicole Good, after an ICE agent shot and killed her last week in Minneapolis, calling it “a very unfortunate incident.” Trump’s homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, labeled Good a domestic terrorist.

But even so, he made clear he was standing behind his choice to send militarized officers into American cities.

“I know that it was a tough situation to be in. There was very little respect shown to the police, in this case, the ICE officers,” Trump said.

He said he would continue sending armed agents into cities, claiming that his efforts had taken “thousands of murderers out of our country.” There is no evidence to support that assertion.

The president expressed frustration that his Republican Party could lose control of the U.S. House of Representatives or the Senate in this year’s midterm elections, citing historical trends that have seen the party in power lose seats in the second year of a presidency.

“It's some deep psychological thing, but when you win the presidency, you don't win the midterms,” Trump said. He boasted that he had accomplished so much that “when you think of it, we shouldn't even have an election.”</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 06:37:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D6GKLPZLHFOFVKDYVS25GHT47E.jpg?auth=09cfb484865c191342927d3f9ddcfb0bc16970f733e7ba2f39ce028e67dc1222&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>For Syria’s new rulers, Sunni clans hold the key to stability  – and ending sectarian strife</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260115-syria-sunni-clans-hold-key-to-stability-ending-sectarian-strife-sharaa</link><description>Renewed clashes between Syrian security forces and Kurdish fighters in the Aleppo region are a reminder of the volatile communal and sectarian tensions that continue to roil the country more than a year after the fall of the Assad dynasty.

The latest violence follows weeks of deadly clashes last summer pitting Bedouin tribesmen against Druze militias in the country’s south, and after the massacre of Alawite civilians in their western heartland in March and April of last year.

Each bout of violence underscores the daunting challenge facing Syria’s new rulers as they grapple with the complex, fragile ethnoreligious mosaic of a country ravaged by more than a decade of civil war and riven with bitter divides.

While the focus is on Syria’s vulnerable minorities, the country’s Sunni majority  –  itself divided along tribal lines and past opposition or allegiance to the Assads – holds the key to stabilising the country and staving off further sectarian strife.

With that aim in mind, the Syrian presidency set up an “Office of Tribes and Clans” in September headed by Jihad Issa al-Sheikh, also known by his nom de guerre Abu Ahmed Zakour, a longtime fellow traveller of Syria's rebel-turned-president Ahmed al-Sharaa .

FRANCE 24’s Wassim Nasr was able to meet with al-Sheikh and other members of the office at its three regional branches in Aleppo, Hama and Idlib, gaining exclusive insight into a body that aims to play a key role in the Syrian reconciliation process.

Strategically placed alongside Aleppo's Bureau of political affairs, the local branch of the Office of Tribes and Clans has moved into the former premises of the Baath party that ruled Syria for decades under the Assads.

Its task is to maintain the non-aggression pact between Syria’s former rebels and the Sunni militias that had previously backed the Assad regime, before switching sides during the lightening offensive led by Sharaa’s Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in November 2024.

It was their change of allegiance that led to the fall of Aleppo, Syria’s economic capital, in just three days, hastening the end of Assad rule.

The largest of these militias, the al-Baqir Brigade, had previously received funding from the Iranian Revolutionary Guards and was entrusted with conscripts from the Syrian regular army. This effectively gave them the power of life and death over local inhabitants.

“The rebels in Aleppo came from the same (Sunni) neighbourhoods (as the militiamen),” said a witness from the early days of the Syrian revolution in 2011, who traced existing rancours to a notorious incident involving a family accused of siding with the Assads.

“The discord began when the head of the Meraai family and one of his sons were executed and their mutilated bodies displayed in public for several days,” added the witness, describing their killing as a response to the shooting of anti-Assad demonstrators.

A lynchpin of the al-Baqir Brigade, the Meraai family was widely seen as a tool of the Assad regime to suppress opponents – not necessarily acting on direct orders from Damascus, but rather to preserve its financial interests and the favours granted by the regime.

Sitting on a plastic chair amid the ruins, a Meraai family member who was imprisoned at the time had a different take on the incident. He said the executions “were unjustified because we simply don’t know who fired at demonstrators from the rooftops”.

Fifteen years on from that fateful incident, his brothers Khaled and Hamza would play a key role in the liberation of Aleppo by Sharaa’s rebel coalition. After more than two years of negotiations and a visit to Sharaa’s bastion in Idlib, Khaled al-Meraai was persuaded by his fellow Bagara clansman Jihad Issa al-Sheikh that the time had come to abandon the Assads.

Seeing the tide turning, Khaled al-Meraai agreed to secretly harbour an HTS commando unit that would attack a strategic command centre of the Syrian army in Aleppo. Months before the battle, scouts had infiltrated the city to prepare the ground, including Jihad Issa al-Sheikh's own brother, Abu Omar.

But this crucial role in the liberation of Aleppo has not erased, at least in the eyes of the early rebels, the Sunni family’s earlier participation in the Assad regime’s repressive apparatus. As the former inmate put it, “our relatives will flee the city, fearing revenge, if they don't see me sitting in my chair here every day”.

While the Meraais still own valuable properties, including a stud farm for purebred Arabian horses, they have been forced to return some of the assets that were confiscated from former rebels. The new Syrian authorities are protecting the family, but without publicly acknowledging the deal that helped bring about the capture of Aleppo  –  even though Hamza al-Meraai was recently photographed with an interior ministry spokesperson in Damascus.

In addition to Sunni reconciliation, the sprawling multi-faith city faces formidable security challenges. On New Year's Day, a member of the internal security forces was killed while preventing a suicide bomber from attacking a Christian celebration. His funeral was attended by senior officials including the interior minister  as well as representatives of Aleppo’s Christian churches.

A few kilometres north of the city, residents of the Shiite villages of Nubl and Zahra live under heavy protection from the Syrian army. As soon as Aleppo was captured in late 2024, the villages sent representatives to the city to obtain security guarantees. Once again, Jihad Issa al-Sheikh, the presidential adviser, acted as mediator. Since then, “there has been only one murder”, said a local representative in Nubl.  “In the early days, the local (HTS) commander slept here on the floor to ensure that there would be no abuses.”

But the situation remains precarious for the Shiite villagers, who are mindful that nearby Sunni villages are still in ruins. “Our [Sunni] neighbours see that we are protected, while they are unable to rebuild their villages and are still living in tents,” said the Nubl resident. “One can imagine and understand what they are going through.”

On December 9, the Damascus home of Sheikh Abdel Menaam al-Nassif hosted a high-level meeting of clan representatives from across Syria, presenting the Office of Clans and Tribes with an ideal platform to send a message.

Addressing the assembly of senior clansmen, Jihad Issa al-Sheikh said the office was “not designed to command you or replace you, but rather to serve as a direct line to President Sharaa”. He then issued an advice to clans tarnished by collaboration with the deposed regime.

“Those clans that were on Assad’s side should keep a low profile and put forward figures who have not been compromised. We need everyone,” he added. “We must turn the page on old quarrels once and for all by supporting the state and not being a source of destabilisation.”

Referring to recent sectarian classes, the top Sharaa aide said it was “unacceptable for clans to take up arms at the slightest incident or to join the ranks of our enemies for one reason or another”.

He added: “We must rise to the challenges we have faced since the liberation of the country.”

General Hamza al-Hmidi, the head of operations for the Syrian armed forces, then spoke of the deadly summer clashes in Sweida, which saw Bedouin tribesmen converge on the southern province to fight local Druze militias, and led Israel to intervene militarily with strikes on security forces deployed to quell the bloodshed.

“We were faced with militiamen firing at us at the front and with killers and looters in our wake. These actions, which do not reflect our values, gave (the Israelis) a pretext to bomb us, forcing us to leave the city in the hands of (Druze) militiamen,” lamented the young general.

The meeting touched on the sensitive subject of cronyism and political appointments, with clan leaders urged to present qualified candidates for administration jobs and the future National Assembly – and to refrain from promoting themselves or their relatives. The message was that the Baath party ways of coopting tribal and clan leaders through clientelism would no longer be accepted.

The meeting, attended by two representatives of Syria’s new political bureau, led to animated debate. The idea of a "Council of Elders" composed of clan leaders was put forward – a means to preserve their status and influence while separating their role from that of political institutions.

It’s a delicate balance for Syria’s new rulers, for whom gaining the support of clans necessarily means making concessions, including material ones, particularly in areas that are still outside Damascus’s control.

The office’s Hama branch had its baptism of fire in the wake of two particularly grisly murders in nearby Homs, which kicked off attacks on Alawite neighbourhoods. Its primary mission was clear: to ease tensions in Syria’s third most populous city.

In the days following the murders, representatives of various clans acted quickly to prevent an escalation, under the coordination of Sharaa’s adviser al-Sheikh. The investigation revealed that the murders of a married couple, initially presented as sectarian, were in fact an internal family affair. A joint letter from community leaders helped to tamp down reprisals and narrowly avert bloodshed.

Sheikh Abu Jaafar Khaldoun, head of the Hama office, stressed the importance of inter-community dialogue. “We need to start from scratch and rebuild neighbourly relations,” he said. “This involves simple gestures, such as attending funerals.”

Khaldoun said interactions with the Alawite, Ismaili and Christian communities helped to defuse tensions after rebel forces took over Hama and then Homs.

‘We wasted no time after liberation, for fear of reprisals between communities, and even within each community,” he explained. “The first few months were tense, and some people took advantage of the situation to settle old scores.”

A rebel bastion and launchpad for the lighting offensive that toppled Assad, northwestern Idlib province has also served as a model for the type of conflict resolution advocated by Syria's new leaders.

Starting in 2017, Sharaa’s HTS began to work with local clans with a pragmatic goal:  to resolve conflicts between rival factions in areas outside the regime's control, drawing on clan ties shared both by residents and the province’s large number of internally displaced people. After a series of military setbacks in 2019, the clans were gradually integrated as a supporting force for HTS and the "Syrian Salvation Government" that administered the rebel holdout.

This dual experience, both military and mediatory, is the foundation of the new Office of Clans and Tribes, whose leaders are largely drawn from the ranks of Idlib’s displaced population.

A key role of the office’s local branch is to maintain a link between the new Syrian authorities and displaced people from eastern Syria. The latter include both the clans based in areas controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and displaced people from Raqqa, Hassaka or Deir ez-Zor – populations often buffeted by war, forced displacement and shifting alliances.

Efforts to tilt the tribal balance have weighed heavily in recent military realignments. Most recently in Aleppo and months before in nearby Manbij, shifts in clan alliances have facilitated the recapture of entire neighbourhoods previously held by Kurdish forces, illustrating the decisive role played by Jihad Issa al-Sheikh and his office in reshaping the balance of power on the ground.

For the new regime, the stakes are primarily political and security-related. The eastern provinces provide most of the SDF's recruits while at the same time constituting a potential breeding ground for jihadist groups. To alienate them once more would be to repeat the mistakes that in the past pushed certain clans into the arms of the Assad regime, Kurdish forces or the Islamic State (IS) group .

Reassuring the Sunni majority and healing the deep divides left by years of war is a matter of survival for the new Syrian authorities. Lasting stability can only come from internal dynamics, driven by Syrians themselves. In this context, the Office of Tribes and Clans holds a key place at the intersection of community tensions and the most sensitive security issues. The stated objective is not to marginalise the clans, but to integrate them as actors of stabilisation.

The authorities are claiming a number of results since the office’s creation, including de-escalation in Homs, the management of protests in coastal areas home to many Alawites, and a gradual decline in assassinations targeting former members of the Assad regime. Despite the recent deadly clashes in Aleppo, the ability to prevent a major escalation in fighting over sensitive neighbourhoods previously held by Kurdish factions is also presented as concrete illustration of this new approach.

In an overnight message on X, Macron said a first group of French military personnel were already headed to Greenland to participate in an exercise organised by Denmark and Greenland, an overseas Danish territory.

The crisis meeting, confirmed by a French official, was scheduled to begin at 0700 GMT. The meeting was first reported by French news agency AFP.

Allied nations including Germany, Norway and Sweden have begun deploying troops to Greenland in a show of support to Copenhagen and Nuuk.

The deployment started as a high-stakes meeting between U.S., Danish and Greenlandic officials, indicated that there were still fundamental, if not intractable, differences between how Washington, Copenhagen and Nuuk see the island's future.

"At Denmark's request, I have decided that France will participate in the joint exercises organised by Denmark in Greenland," Macron said in his X post. "The first French military elements are already en route. Others will follow."

A French military official told Reuters on Wednesday the personnel heading to Greenland were specialists in cold and mountain environments.

Macron is due to deliver a New Year’s address to the armed forces later on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 07:46:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GVMJJW3PYZN6RHFRPL5HG4GT3M.jpg?auth=eb50688f25ef28e2c40956f20748b99c22b6e85a93d0bdf8e2b4185ea91e143d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia expels British diplomat for spying</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-expels-british-diplomat-spying-agencies-say-2026-01-15/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday that a British diplomat was being expelled after being identified as a British spy by the Federal Security Service.

The FSB, the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, named the British diplomat and said he was working undercover for Britain's spy service.

The diplomat has been given two weeks to leave Russia.

Russia's foreign ministry summoned Britain's Charge d'affaires in Russia to protest about the situation.

"It was again stressed that Moscow would not tolerate the activities of undeclared British intelligence officers in Russia," the foreign ministry said.

"A warning was also issued that if London escalates the situation, the Russian side will give a decisive 'mirror' response," the ministry said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 07:48:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump sees Iranian crackdown easing, Tehran denies man to be executed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-sees-iranian-crackdown-easing-tehran-denies-man-be-executed-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON/DUBAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he had been told that killings in Iran’s crackdown on protests were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions, adopting a wait‑and‑see posture after earlier threatening intervention.

Iranian state media on Thursday reported that a 26-year-old man arrested during the protests in the city of Karaj would not be given the death sentence, after a rights group reported earlier this week that he was due to be executed on Wednesday.

Trump's comments at the White House on Wednesday led oil prices to retreat from multi-month highs and gold eased from a record peak on Thursday.

Trump's comments came after fears grew in the Middle East that Washington could launch strikes, following his repeated threats to intervene on behalf of Iranian protesters. Trump did not rule out possible U.S. military action, however.

In separate comments, Trump told Reuters in an exclusive interview that Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi "seems very nice" but expressed uncertainty over whether Pahlavi would be able to muster support within Iran to eventually take over.

Trump said it is possible the government in Tehran could fall due to the protests, but that in truth "any regime can fail."

"Whether or not it falls or not, it's going to be an interesting period of time," he said.

Tensions escalated on Wednesday , as Iran said it had warned neighbours it would hit American bases in the region in the event of U.S. strikes, and a U.S. official said the United States was withdrawing some personnel from bases in the region.

On Wednesday, several Western officials said U.S. military intervention could be imminent.

Qatar said drawdowns from its Al Udeid air base, the biggest U.S. base in the Middle East, were "being undertaken in response to the current regional tensions".

Iran launched missiles at Al Udeid last year in response to U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear installations during the 12-day war between Tehran and its arch-foe Israel.

The clerical establishment has cracked down hard on one of the biggest challenges to its rule since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. More than 2,500 people have been reported killed in the unrest that spiralled out of protests over soaring prices.

People that Reuters have reached inside the country said the protests appear to have abated since Monday. Information flows have been hampered by an internet blackout for a week.

The death toll has dwarfed that of previous bouts of unrest crushed by the Iranian authorities, such as the 2022 "Woman, Life, Freedom" protests and unrest sparked by a disputed election in 2009.

Trump, speaking at the White House, said he has been told that killings in the crackdown were subsiding. Asked who told him that the killings had stopped, Trump described them as "very important sources on the other side."

The president did not rule out potential U.S. military action, saying "we are going to watch what the process is" before noting that his administration had received a "very good statement" from Iran.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Wednesday "there is no plan" by Iran to hang people, when asked about the protests. "There is no plan for hanging at all," he told Fox News in an interview on the "Special Report with Bret Baier" show. "Hanging is out of the question," he said.

Earlier this week, rights organisation Hengaw reported that 26-year-old Essam Soltani, arrested in connection with protests in the city of Karaj, was due to be executed on Wednesday.

However, on Thursday Iranian state media said that while Soltani was being charged with "colluding against the country's internal security and propaganda activities against the regime", the death penalty does not apply to such charges if they are confirmed by a court.

Iran and its Western foes have both described the unrest as the most violent since the 1979 Islamic Revolution that installed Iran's system of Shi'ite clerical rule.

Iranian authorities said the demonstrations turned from legitimate protest at economic grievances into unrest fomented by its foreign enemies, accusing people it described as terrorists of attacking the security forces and public property.

In a fragmented Iranian opposition, Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent voice during the unrest. The U.S.-based Pahlavi, 65, has lived outside Iran since before his father, the last Shah of Iran, was toppled.

"He seems very nice, but I don't know how he'd play within his own country," Trump told Reuters. "And we really aren't up to that point yet.

"I don't know whether or not his country would accept his leadership, and certainly if they would, that would be fine with me."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 08:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4IY4XWJ735CKTINPFBOC2BLP24.JPG?auth=dfb65d5cd5b8557e4479330412dee47ece3fe57bad476e876c98541a4a3b5888&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Singapore PM removes opposition chief from post, local media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/singapore-pm-removes-opposition-chief-post-local-media-reports-2026-01-15/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong stripped Pritam Singh of his post as Leader of the Opposition on Thursday, saying his position had become untenable after his conviction for lying to parliament.

The move, the first of it's kind in Singapore, comes after parliament decided in a vote that Singh of the opposition Workers' Party was unsuitable to continue in the post given his "dishonourable and unbecoming" conduct after a lying conviction.

Wong in a statement said this decision was necessary to uphold the rule of law, as well as the dignity and integrity of parliament.

"Having considered the matter carefully, I have decided that Mr. Singh’s criminal convictions, taken together with Parliament’s considered view of his unsuitability, make it no longer tenable for him to continue... Mr. Singh’s designation as the LO will therefore cease with immediate effect," Wong said.

The Leader of the Opposition is designated by the head of government and not provided for in the constitution or parliament's standing orders.

Singh will remain a lawmaker. The Workers' Party said it would study Wong's statement.

"We will deliberate on its contents carefully through our internal processes and respond in due course," it said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 08:34:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/66F4CUMYKVK5RNANCIG4RKEIE4.jpg?auth=bdee0435189d78145246ca3b9d5527b631d27890faf343d954885dfb2d55ebea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ugandans vote amid internet blackout and police repression</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260115-ugandans-vote-amid-internet-blackout-and-police-repression</link><description>Voting began Thursday in Uganda ’s presidential election despite a days-long internet shutdown that has been criticised as an anti-democratic tactic in a country where the president has held office since 1986.

Crowds gathered and long lines formed in some areas as polling station openings were delayed and voting materials were seen being delivered after the scheduled 7am opening time.

President Yoweri Museveni , 81, faces seven other candidates, including Robert Kyagulanyi, a musician-turned-politician best known as Bobi Wine , who is calling for political change.

The East African country of roughly 45 million people has 21.6 million registered voters.

Polls are expected to close at 4pm Thursday, according to the electoral commission. Results are constitutionally required to be announced in 48 hours.

Impatient crowds gathered outside polling stations expressing concerns over the delays Thursday morning. Umaru Mutyaba, a polling agent for a parliamentary candidate, said it was “frustrating” to be waiting outside a station in the capital Kampala.

“We can’t be standing here waiting to vote as if we have nothing else to do," he said.

There have been concerns about transparency, the possibility of hereditary rule, military interference and opposition strategies to prevent vote tampering at polling stations.

Uganda's internet was shut down Tuesday by the government communications agency, which cited misinformation, electoral fraud and incitement of violence. The shutdown has affected the public and disrupted critical sectors such as banking.

There has been heavy security leading up to voting, including military units deployed on the streets this week.

Amnesty International said security forces are engaging in a “brutal campaign of repression", citing a November 28 opposition rally in eastern Uganda where the military blocked exits and opened fire on supporters, killing one person.

Museveni urged voters to come out in large numbers during his final rally Tuesday.

“You go and vote, anybody who tries to interfere with your freedom will be crushed. I am telling you this. We are ready to put an end to this indiscipline,” he said.

The national electoral commission chairperson, Simon Byabakama, urged tolerance among Ugandans as they vote.

“Let us keep the peace that we have,” Byabakama said late Wednesday. “Let us be civil. Let us be courteous. Let’s be tolerant. Even if you know that this person does not support (your) candidate, please give him or her room or opportunity to go and exercise his or her constitutional right."

Authorities also suspended the activities of several civic groups during the campaign season. That Group, a prominent media watchdog, closed its office Wednesday after the interior ministry alleged in a letter that the group was involved in activities “prejudicial to the security and laws of Uganda".

The move signals an increasingly assertive posture by the Gulf Arab kingdom in Yemen in a row with the UAE . The separatist Southern Transitional Council swept through parts of the south last year and advanced to within reach of the Saudi border. Riyadh declared the move a threat to its national security, called on the UAE to withdraw and backed an offensive that swept the STC from power.

On Wednesday, Saudi Defence Minister Khalid bin Salman met with the head of the internationally recognized government and several members of the country's Presidential Leadership Council to affirm the kingdom's support, according to a post on his official account on X.

The same post announced aid and projects across 10 provinces, including the construction of hospitals, schools and roads and the donation of fuel to increase power production.

It also announced the construction of a mosque on the island of Socotra named "The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques", a reference to the official title of the Saudi king. The strategic island had been held by the UAE for years until recently.

"This support embodies the kingdom's keenness to enhance security and stability, and to contribute to building a better future for Yemen and its brotherly people," the post said.

Saudi Arabia and the UAE previously worked together in a coalition battling the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen's civil war, which caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.

Turkey plans to conduct a four-month deployment in Estonia between August and November 2026, followed by another rotation in Romania from December 2026 to March 2027, the ministry said in its weekly press briefing.

Turkey has contributed significantly to NATO’s air policing operations aimed at protecting allied airspace during peacetime, the ministry added.

It previously carried out enhanced air policing missions in Poland between July and September 2021, and in Romania between November 2023 and April 2024, the ministry added.

The planned deployments come as NATO steps up air defences following what the alliance says are repeated Russian violations of allied airspace.

Turkey is also set to host the next NATO summit in July.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:30:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TXRHS663BVIOHAFY5CXAFA37JQ.jpg?auth=4c1f66f148eb947fa6ec01056fd0ab0ac410e6dcb4a8519faba998ab8c5a803b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>SpaceX capsule with ailing astronaut, three crewmates splashes down off California</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-capsule-with-ailing-astronaut-three-crewmates-splashes-down-off-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:30:44 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran: Donald Trump says killings have halted after anti-government protests</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-donald-trump-says-killings-have-halted-after-anti-government-protests</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 09:53:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b26cd4b6-f1f3-11f0-b232-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-100140-100327-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New IMF mission chief to visit to Senegal next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/new-imf-mission-chief-visit-senegal-next-week-2026-01-15/</link><description>DAKAR, Jan 15 - The International Monetary Fund's new mission chief for Senegal will make a short trip to the West African nation early next week, an IMF spokesperson said, but no substantive negotiations are expected.

Senegal is grappling with a debt burden that the Fund said hit 132% of gross domestic product at the end of 2024 after the country's current leadership uncovered billions of dollars in borrowing not reported by the previous administration.

The IMF froze a $1.8 billion lending programme over the controversy, forcing Senegal to rely heavily on regional debt auctions to meet its financing needs. The government has for months been in talks with the Fund to establish a new programme.

Mission Chief Mercedes Vera Martin will visit Senegal with her predecessor, Edward Gemayel, for a "primary introductory visit" early next week, the spokesperson said late on Wednesday.

Both are expected to meet with Senegalese authorities, but no substantive negotiations are expected in the immediate future, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.

Spokespeople for Senegal's finance and economy ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Vera Martin oversaw Zambia's debt restructuring as head of mission there from 2023 to 2025. Gemayel will take over from her as Zambia mission chief.

Senegalese authorities have repeatedly ruled out a debt restructuring but have said they hope to finalise a loan programme with the IMF quickly.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:26:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MIEIEHSD2ZIR7NB4IZE6S74UOA.jpg?auth=cbd5f7c5a66f74dc656b1dfe55564a686e3bbfa997033b5ecc16f077c6bf4072&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European military heads to Greenland as Trump's ambitions for island undeterred by talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/european-military-heads-greenland-trumps-ambitions-island-undeterred-by-talks-2026-01-15/</link><description>NUUK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Military personnel from France and Germany headed to Greenland on Thursday as Denmark and its allies prepared for exercises to try to assure U.S. President Donald Trump over its security as he pushes to acquire the island.

A meeting of officials from the United States, Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday avoided the public humiliation meted out to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last year, but also produced no quick fix for the dispute.

Trump has said the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to U.S. security and the United States must own it to prevent Russia or China occupying it. He has said all options are on the table for securing the territory , which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

He says Denmark is not capable of warding off Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic region.

Greenland and Denmark say the island is not for sale, that threats of force are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies.

Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark with many leaders warning a U.S. military seizure of the island could in effect spell the end of NATO.

Ahead of the meeting, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun to increase their military presence in and around Greenland in close cooperation with NATO allies, as part of their promise to beef up Arctic defence.

European allies including Germany, France, Sweden and Norway have said they are sending military staff to Greenland to begin preparations for larger drills later this year.

"The Danish Armed Forces, together with a number of Arctic and European allies, will explore in the coming weeks how an increased presence and exercise activity in the Arctic can be implemented in practice," the Danish Ministry of Defence said.

So far the scale of the planned military build up has not been made public, but the initial deployments appeared to be small. The German Armed Forces were deploying a reconnaissance team of 13 personnel to Nuuk on Thursday morning aboard an Airbus A400M transport aircraft, the German Defence Ministry said.

Nonetheless, the European military increase to Greenland was a message to the U.S. administration, Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told Reuters.

"There are two messages ... one is to deter, is to show that 'if you decide to do something militarily, we're ready to defend Greenland'," he said.

"And the other purpose is to say: 'Well, we take your critique seriously, we increase our presence, take care of our sovereignty, and improve surveillance over Greenland'."

After the talks at the White House with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt said the U.S. and Denmark would form a working group to discuss a broad array of concerns regarding the island.

But they also acknowledged that Washington had not budged on its position that it must acquire Greenland, an outcome they said would represent an unacceptable breach of sovereignty.

Late on Wednesday, a Danish Air Force plane landed at Nuuk airport and personnel in military fatigues disembarked for the exercises, footage showed.

France was also joining the deployment. "The first French military elements are already en route. Others will follow," President Emmanuel Macron said on X.

Olivier Poivre d’Arvor, France’s ambassador to the Poles, told France Info radio: "We will show the United States that NATO is there, that Denmark has dramatically increased its surveillance capabilities in Greenland and that the European Union is contributing to ensure the national security of the region as a whole."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:26:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GUIBGYLIRZNRBNLYX25LGBRDNI.jpg?auth=7635a56c9a916382824fbc46ec0b91b40cacdb4ec849344ee503a238bbb2052f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran protests show bitter schism among exiled opposition factions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/iran-protests-show-bitter-schism-among-exiled-opposition-factions-2026-01-15/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Huge protests in Iran have galvanised exiled foes of the authorities but despite their hatred of the ruling clerics, a bitter schism dating to before the 1979 Islamic Revolution still afflicts the leading opposition factions.

That split, between monarchists supporting Reza Pahlavi , son of the ousted shah, and a more organised leftist group, the Mujahedin-e Khalq , has played out online and even in angry arguments in street protests in Europe and North America.

How far either faction has support inside Iran, or might be able to shape events there in the future, is hard to gauge, though analysts and diplomats have for decades regarded both as being far more popular among emigres than inside the country.

Many other Iranians outside Iran are also deeply sceptical of both the monarchists and MEK, but have no organised opposition network comparable to those factions.

The lack of a universally accepted opposition movement or figurehead has complicated international approaches towards the deadly unrest sweeping Iran, with U.S. President Donald Trump questioning Pahlavi's support even as he weighed air strikes.

"What's problematic is there has been no inclusive organisation that has been built that can bring together Iranians of all walks of life: religious, ethnic, socioeconomic," said Sanam Vakil, Middle East head at the Chatham House think tank in London.

During the past two weeks of violent unrest, videos in Iranian cities have shown some demonstrators chanting in support of the ousted monarchy and the late shah's son, who has encouraged the protests.

Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled into exile in 1979 and died a year later, was a close Western ally who harked back to ancient Persian heritage in framing his rule as a national leader and moderniser. But he resisted democratic change as increasing economic disparities destabilised the country.

His 65-year-old son, who is based in the U.S., says he wants democracy for Iran and has not specified any role he would seek if the current system collapsed. His supporters run one of the main Persian-language satellite television stations broadcasting into Iran.

Reza Pahlavi's supporters in the West have pointed to the videos of protesters in Iran chanting his name as evidence his popularity is growing, saying he is the only figure able to unite the country if the Islamic Republic implodes.

Among foreign officials and diplomats following Iran there are mixed views as to whether the latest protests show that Pahlavi's role is growing.

A Western diplomat said Pahlavi's name may have been used by street protesters because there were few other recognisable opposition figures, but that there was no sign he commanded the sort of domestic support that could make him a future leader.

A European official said a big spike in protest numbers after a call for street action by foreign opponents of the government, including Pahlavi, showed his stature may be broader than was previously understood.

However, any role he played would need to be in the context of a wider democratic movement, said Iranian analyst and former diplomat Mehrdad Khonsari. "You need a coalition of people who believe in democratic values in order to sort of lighten the weight and give greater confidence to people," he said.

The idea that Pahlavi may have popularity inside Iran is not shared by the MEK, whose supporters regard the pre-revolution monarchy as comparable to the current Shi'ite theocracy.

Its supporters online often use the slogan "No Monarchy, No Supreme Leader".

The MEK is a movement fusing leftist and Islamist ideas whose cadres carried out bombings inside Iran before and after the revolution, even as mass support was growing for rival factions on the streets.

The ruling clerics banished the MEK in 1981 and it established military bases in Iraq that it used to launch attacks on Iranian troops during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war, something many Iranians remember with fury.

It was listed as a terrorist organisation in the United States until 2012, but some Western politicians have voiced backing for the group including former U.S. secretary of state Mike Pompeo.

However, the European official described the MEK as widely despised inside Iran, partly because of its conduct during the Iran-Iraq war, and analysts say it has had little presence in the country for decades.

The group's official leader Massoud Rajavi has not been seen since 2002 and is widely thought to be dead, though the MEK has not acknowledged that. His wife, Maryam Rajavi, runs the organisation and its affiliate, the National Council for Resistance in Iran.

Group officials say their supporters are widespread in Iran and active, though there has been no public sign of support for the MEK seen by Reuters during the protests.

Monarchists - along with many other Iranian dissidents and Iran's current rulers - regard the MEK with intense suspicion, pointing to its history of violence and enforcement of ideological purity within its ranks.

For many Iranians, the arguments between the Islamic Republic's theocratic establishment, monarchists voicing nostalgia for the 1970s, and a revolutionary group that lost out in the early 1980s may seem outdated.

Even as monarchist and MEK supporters remained prominent among émigrés and as the same faces revolved through the upper echelons of the Islamic Republic, Iran's population was doubling in size and growing more urban and educated.

Most major political movements inside Iran after 1979 sought to either bolster or reform the Islamic Republic, rather than sweep it away entirely, until successive waves of protest in recent years demanding more comprehensive change.

"Iranians inside Iran are, I think, not just looking to the diaspora for their future," said Vakil.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:26:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OIZVJYGYZJJKLJHVLIPD5RB4XQ.jpg?auth=44375e3beec083299c806757ce4cee7062da00ee34e03c39af4cc61d8c4ef626&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US pressing Mexico to allow US forces to fight cartels, NYT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pressing-mexico-allow-us-forces-fight-cartels-nyt-reports-2026-01-15/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - The United States is intensifying pressure on Mexico to allow U.S. military forces to conduct joint operations to dismantle fentanyl labs inside the country, the New York Times reported on Thursday, citing U.S. officials.

Russia's statement follows increasingly strident talk from U.S. President Donald Trump who has said he wants the U.S., which already has military facilities on Greenland, to take control of the Danish overseas territory for national security reasons.

Trump argues that Denmark, whose troops are responsible for Greenland's defence, are not up to the job, something Copenhagen rejects.

Some European countries, including France, Germany, Norway and Sweden have begun deploying troops to Greenland in a show of support to Nuuk and Copenhagen which is organising a military exercise there.

Russia, which has moved to re-open and modernise a sprawling network of military bases in the Arctic in recent years, said in a statement on Thursday that it was watching the situation developing around Greenland with serious concern and called for the wider Arctic region to remain peaceful and stable.

"NATO has embarked on a course of accelerated militarisation of the North, building up its military presence there under the fictitious pretext of a growing threat from Moscow and Beijing," Russia's embassy in Belgium, where the U.S.-led military alliance is based, said in a statement to the Izvestia newspaper.

"We can see that the alliance is using high-profile statements from Washington on the Greenland issue solely to promote an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese agenda," it said, listing recent European statements on Greenland's defence.

"The instigators of these bellicose plans appeal to mythical challenges that they themselves generate," the embassy said, noting that even Western diplomats with access to NATO intelligence briefings cited in the media had acknowledged that no Russian or Chinese submarines had been spotted near Greenland in recent years.

"This exposes the artificiality of the hysteria that is being whipped up," it said.

The statement did not directly criticise Trump, however, at a time when he remains a key interlocutor for Moscow in efforts to reach a peace deal in Ukraine . It turned its fire instead on NATO as an institution and on its European member states, which it also accuses of blocking peace efforts in Ukraine.

"We consider the alliance's policy of escalating confrontation in the Arctic to be counterproductive and extremely dangerous," the embassy said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:51:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JTOW373RFZP7JOE4PDHQZIUYJM.jpg?auth=d182b39e8d326ff890d8586add17674e164672181795f7aa0114915b2b453d1e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Trump is right about Zelenskiy holding up a peace deal in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kremlin-says-trump-is-right-about-zelenskiy-holding-up-peace-deal-ukraine-2026-01-15/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday that Russia agreed with U.S. President Donald Trump that it was Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, not Russia, who was holding up a potential peace deal to end the war in Ukraine.

Trump's assessment in an interview with Reuters contrasted to that of European allies, who have consistently argued that Moscow has little interest in ending the fighting and wants to take as much territory as it can while seeking to stave off further Western sanctions.

"I think he's ready to make a deal," Trump said of Putin when speaking to Reuters in the Oval Office on Wednesday. "I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal."

Asked why U.S.-led negotiations had not yet resolved Europe's largest land conflict since World War Two, Trump responded: "Zelenskiy."

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters when asked that he concurred with Trump: "I agree, that is indeed the case. President Putin and the Russian side remain open (to talks). The Russian position is well known. It is well known to the American negotiators, to President Trump, and to the leadership of the Kyiv regime."

Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula, which it annexed in 2014. Moscow wants Kyiv to withdraw its troops from parts of the Donetsk region that Russia does not control but has claimed as its own. Ukraine - which has rejected the idea of gifting territory to Moscow - wants the fighting halted along the current front lines. The U.S. has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine pulls its troops back.

U.S.-led negotiations have been centred in recent weeks on security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine after a potential peace deal, though some European officials have cautioned Putin is highly unlikely to accept some of the terms.

The talks have been further set back after Russia accused Ukraine last month of trying to attack a residence of Putin, an allegation Kyiv called a lie.

Peskov said that Moscow would welcome Trump envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to the Kremlin for additional talks on Ukraine once a date for a visit had been agreed upon.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:51:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QIVGL4FYTBIXDBP4E7ABOZIN4A.jpg?auth=20e20d103161ffb9d9e31fb53529498e8f30704ad608e1bd846e8586a95e6033&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine: Zelensky declares energy emergency after Russian strikes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ukraine-zelensky-declares-energy-emergency-after-russian-strikes</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:52:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/963711b2-f1f8-11f0-8c4e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-081659-081848-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda votes for a new president under internet blackout and police crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uganda-votes-for-a-new-president-under-internet-blackout-and-police-crackdown</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:52:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dd111674-f1f7-11f0-9880-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-080116-080500-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO allies move troops to Greenland in European military mission</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/nato-allies-move-troops-to-greenland-in-european-military-mission</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:52:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/72d46ca2-f1f7-11f0-8449-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-100857-101443-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Another ICE shooting fuels chaos in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/another-ice-shooting-fuels-chaos-in-minneapolis</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:52:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9c057cb6-f1f6-11f0-a288-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-101507-101635-CS-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NATO at a 'crossroads': Does the IGO military alliance need to 'reinvent' itself?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/nato-at-a-crossroads-does-the-igo-military-alliance-need-to-reinvent-itself</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 10:52:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d48e1396-f1fa-11f0-8f99-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-080941-081632-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Macron delivers his New Year's address to the French army</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260115-live-macron-delivers-his-new-year-s-address-to-the-french-army</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:21:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21ad66fa-ea25-11f0-8685-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25349479964109.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Republicans split on Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown, Reuters/Ipsos poll finds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/republicans-split-trumps-aggressive-immigration-crackdown-reutersipsos-poll-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's Republicans are divided over whether federal immigration officers should try harder to avoid hurting people following the shooting death of a community activist during an immigration raid, according to a Reuters/Ipsos survey.

While 95% of Republicans continue to approve of Trump's performance as president, the poll conducted on Monday and Tuesday suggests a significant slice of Trump's backers are wary of his administration's aggressive approach to immigration enforcement. The poll found American approval of Trump's approach to immigration at its lowest point since he returned to office a year ago.

Poll respondents were asked to pick whether immigration officers should prioritize reducing harm to people even if this limits the number of arrests, or if they should be willing to use force even if there is a risk of serious injury or death.

Some 59% of Republicans favored a policy prioritizing arrests even if people get hurt, while 39% said officers should focus on reducing harm to people even if it means fewer arrests. Democrats were unified, with 96% focused on avoiding injuries and 4% saying immigration officers should focus on arrests. A handful of respondents did not answer the question.

Americans are following the matter closely. Trump's campaign to deport unauthorized immigrants has become the signature issue of his administration. Masked immigration officers, often in tactical military-style gear, have become a common sight across the country. T he Reuters/Ipsos poll showed nine in 10 Americans have heard at least a little about the January 7 shooting death in Minneapolis of 37-year-old Renee Good , who was filmed criticizing immigration officers from her car before an officer fatally shot her in what Trump administration officials have described as an act of self-defense.

The Trump administration has called Good a "domestic terrorist" who tried to run the Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer over with her vehicle. Local leaders and protesters across the country have condemned the shooting, saying the fact that Good turned her wheels away from the ICE officer as she drove past him proved her peaceful intentions.

Jason Cabel Roe, a Republican political strategist who has been critical of Trump, said Good's killing put a human face on the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

"Someone died in an altercation with ICE. That is not what anyone wants to see happening."

The controversy has sparked protests across the country , adding to the ongoing conflicts between demonstrators and immigration officers outside of government buildings. On Tuesday, small bands of protesters near a federal building in Minneapolis shouted obscenities at ICE officers, who used tear gas and flash-bang devices against demonstrators, with officers wrestling some of them to the ground, Reuters photos and video of the clashes show.

Immigration policy has been a regular bright spot among Trump's approval ratings since he returned to the White House. He campaigned ahead of the 2024 presidential election on promises to enact the biggest deportation drive in decades, and his approval rating on immigration touched as high as 50% in February 2025, compared to his highest overall approval rating of 47% in the first days of his administration.

Trump's overall approval rating in the latest poll slipped to 41%, down from 42% in a poll conducted earlier in January, while his approval on immigration slipped to a record low of 40%, from 41% when that question was last asked in December. Even with the decline, however, Trump's approval on immigration remains higher than the ratings Americans gave his predecessor, Joe Biden, during most of the Democrat's 2021-2025 administration.

The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll gathered responses from 1,217 U.S. adults nationwide and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:43:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OFG7VXWLKVI6BAUCQTJWU7ZDYI.jpg?auth=a7cd188bd9d339d9af7d98bb25402d7e142cdc6d21144491e23b9e7758626b12&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia social media ban hits 4.7 million teen accounts in first month</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-social-media-ban-hits-47-million-teen-accounts-first-month-2026-01-15/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Social media companies have collectively deactivated nearly five million accounts belonging to Australian teenagers just a month after a world-first ban on under‑16s took effect, the country's internet regulator said, a sign the measure has had a swift and sweeping impact.

The eSafety Commissioner said platforms had so far removed about 4.7 million accounts held by under-16s to comply with a law that went live on December 10. Some platforms had said they would start closing affected accounts in the weeks before the deadline.

The figures represent the first government data on compliance and suggest platforms are taking significant steps to adhere to a law that could see them fined up to A$49.5 million ($33 million) for non-compliance, but does not hold children or their parents liable.

The tally is far higher than estimates circulated before the law and equates to more than two accounts for every Australian aged 10 to 16, based on population data. Meta (META.O) , opens new tab previously said it took down some 550,000 underage accounts from its Instagram, Facebook and Threads.

The minimum age rule also applies to Google's (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab YouTube, TikTok, Snapchat (SNAP.N) , opens new tab , and Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter. Reddit (RDDT.N) , opens new tab has said it is complying but is suing the government seeking to overturn the ban. The government says it will defend itself.

"It is clear that eSafety's regulatory guidance and engagement with platforms is already delivering significant outcomes," Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said in a statement.

Some underage accounts remain active and it was too early to declare full compliance, she added. All companies that were initially covered by the ban said they would comply.

Inman Grant said effective age checks would take time to bed down but feedback from age-assurance providers - typically third-party software vendors hired by the platforms - indicated Australia's rollout had been smooth, aided by public education ahead of the ban.

Some smaller social media applications reported a surge of downloads in Australia in the run-up to the December rollout, and eSafety said it would monitor what it called migration trends. But it said the initial download spikes had not translated into sustained usage.

A study with mental health experts will track the ban's long-term impact for several years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:43:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3DKUC6UDKBOY3ELORJBHG4OB7U.jpg?auth=747d07b81e4ea2a6c58f4901ea4bc511e303cc6797b855ea7247bff3f51932e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Airlines continue to avoid Iran and Iraq despite airspace reopening</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/airlines-continue-avoid-iran-iraq-despite-airspace-reopening-2026-01-15/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - European airlines like Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) , opens new tab , Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) , opens new tab and British Airways (ICAG.L) , opens new tab dodged Iraqi and Iranian airspace on Thursday, according to flight tracking websites, opting instead for routes over Afghanistan and central Asia in an effort to mitigate risks associated with the ongoing geopolitical turmoil in Iran and the Middle East.

Iran closed , then reopened its airspace after nearly five hours on Wednesday amid concerns about possible military action between the U.S. and Iran that forced airlines to cancel, reroute or delay flights. Despite the airspace reopening, many airlines, including Singapore Airlines and TUI (TUI1n.DE) , opens new tab , continued to use alternative routes, according to FlightRadar24.

In the last two years, many Western airlines have changed their routing in the Middle East, with many flying over Afghanistan more often despite ongoing Taliban rule, in an effort to avoid other more turbulent conflict zones.

Earlier on Wednesday, Germany issued a new directive cautioning the country's airlines against entering Iranian airspace, shortly after Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) , opens new tab rejigged its flight operations across the Middle East amid escalating tensions in the region.

"We avoid Iraqi and Iranian airspaces, therefore some westbound flights from Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports will have to make (refuelling and crew change) stops in Larnaca, Cyprus or Thessaloniki, Greece," a Wizz Air spokesperson said on Thursday.

The New START treaty is due to expire in three weeks, and President Donald Trump has not formally responded to the offer that Putin made last September.

"No, we have not received a response. We are certainly awaiting a response to Putin's initiative; we consider this a very important topic," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.

New START, which was signed by presidents Barack Obama and Dmitry Medvedev in 2010, sets limits on the strategic weapons that each side would use to target the other's critical political and military centres in the event of a nuclear war. It caps the number of deployed strategic warheads at 1,550 on each side, with no more than 700 deployed ground- or submarine-launched missiles and bomber planes to deliver them.

It is the last in a series of treaties dating back to the early 1970s that have enabled Moscow and Washington to maintain a stable nuclear balance even at times of acute international tension.

Trump told the New York Times this month that "if it expires, it expires", and that he wanted to replace it with a more ambitious treaty including China.

China, whose arsenal is growing fast but remains a fraction of the size of Moscow's or Washington's, says it is unreasonable and unrealistic to ask it to join three-way disarmament talks.

Asked about Trump's comments on a successor treaty, Peskov said this would be good for everyone but would involve a "very complex and drawn-out process".

"As for our Chinese friends, their position is well known, and we respect it."

Peskov reasserted Russia's position that any discussion of strategic stability and security must take into account the nuclear arsenals of Britain and France.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:45:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DG3MZTAHBNJLHIJNKJICVXSYV4.jpg?auth=fb62b8485d07307559d2a24cd06a07152e37f198c629781303f97a23549c2661&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland will not send soldiers to Greenland, Polish PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-will-not-send-soldiers-greenland-polish-pm-says-2026-01-15/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Poland will not send soldiers to Greenland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday, adding an attack by one NATO country on the territory of another would be "the end of the world as we know it".

United States President Donald Trump has said Greenland is vital to U.S. security and the U.S. must own it to prevent Russia or China occupying it. He has said all options are on the table for securing Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Military personnel from France and Germany headed to Greenland on Thursday as Denmark and its allies prepared for exercises to try to assure Trump over its security.

"An attempt to take over (part of) a NATO member state by another NATO member state would be a political disaster," Tusk told a press conference.

"It would be the end of the world as we know it, which guaranteed a world based on NATO solidarity, which held back the evil forces associated with communist terror or other forms of aggression."

He said that he would do everything he could to ensure that Europe remained united on the issue of Greenland.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:45:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JILINH2B75PVTKYYGWDHVLTH4A.jpg?auth=6cda89ecdaff085474d8db7b38549a94437d9524a30128ba24f57b4d7f0fedf2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Reasons to believe Russia behind cyberattack on Polish power system, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/reasons-believe-russia-behind-cyberattack-polish-power-system-pm-says-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:45:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Uganda: Africa’s longest-serving leader, Yoweri Museveni, seeks to extend 40-year rule</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uganda-africa-s-longest-serving-leader-yoweri-museveni-seeks-to-extend-40-year-rule</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:45:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f8fd3956-f1fe-11f0-ad40-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-084017-084225-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US says Gaza truce enters phase two, after forming Palestinian committee</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-says-gaza-truce-enters-phase-two-after-forming-palestinian-committee</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 11:45:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4dcd9a26-f1fe-11f0-95fc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-083643-083818-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Prince Harry to give evidence in lawsuit against Daily Mail next week</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/prince-harry-give-evidence-lawsuit-against-daily-mail-next-week-2026-01-15/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry is due to give evidence at London's High Court next Thursday in his and other high-profile British figures' privacy lawsuits against the publisher of the Daily Mail, his lawyers said on Thursday.

It will be the prince's second such court date in three years, having become the first British royal to give evidence in 130 years in 2023 in another lawsuit against Mirror Group Newspapers.

In next week's case, Harry, the younger son of King Charles, and six others including singer Elton John, are suing Associated Newspapers over alleged unlawful information gathering dating back 30 years.

Associated rejects any wrongdoing by its titles, saying there is no basis to any of what it describes as the claimants' "preposterous smears" against its journalists.

The nine-week trial starts on Monday and will see Harry, John and the other claimants – including John's husband David Furnish and actors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost – give evidence as they seek to prove their case against Associated.

Harry will be in the witness box on January 22, according to a draft trial timetable made public on Thursday. John and Furnish are due to give evidence in February but will seek to do so remotely, their lawyers said.

The case against Associated is the last outstanding case brought by Harry and his U.S. wife Meghan against media organisations since 2019, in what he has described as his mission to rid the British press of senior executives and editors he accuses of abusing their power.

Associated unsuccessfully applied to throw out Harry and the cases because they had been brought too late, with the High Court ruling in 2023 that the lawsuit should proceed to trial. However, that issue is still likely to form part of the arguments at the trial.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:48:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ESUOCLY76BIRVBR5662G35P77M.jpg?auth=80eaf3adbf7c17af580eb3435be28503a10aba1ecdd25c298ce24cf3a04909f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The Trump-backed Palestinian who wants to push Gaza's rubble into the sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-backed-palestinian-who-wants-push-gazas-rubble-into-sea-2026-01-15/</link><description>JERUSALEM/CAIRO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Ali Shaath, the Palestinian former government official chosen to administer Gaza under a U.S.-backed deal, has an ambitious plan that includes pushing war debris into the Mediterranean Sea and rebuilding destroyed infrastructure within three years.

The appointment of the civil engineer and former deputy planning minister on Thursday marked the start of the next phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end Israel's war in Gaza .

Shaath will chair a group of 15 Palestinian technocrats tasked with governing the Palestinian enclave after years of rule by Hamas militants.

Under Trump's plan , Israel has withdrawn from nearly half of Gaza but its troops remain in control of the other half, a wasteland where nearly all buildings have been destroyed. Trump has floated turning Gaza into the "Riviera of the Middle East".

Shaath will face the uncertain task of rebuilding the territory's shattered infrastructure and clearing an estimated 68 million tonnes of rubble and unexploded ordnance even as Israel and Hamas continue to trade fire.

After past rounds of fighting with Israel, Palestinians in Gaza used war rubble as foundational material for the historic marina in Gaza City and for other projects. In an interview with a Palestinian radio station on Thursday, Shaath suggested a similar approach.

"If I brought bulldozers and pushed the rubble into the sea, and made new islands, new land, I can win new land for Gaza and at the same time clear the rubble," Shaath said, suggesting the debris could be removed in three years.

He said his immediate priority was the provision of urgent relief, including forging temporary housing for displaced Palestinians. His second priority would be rehabilitating "essential and vital infrastructure," he said, followed by reconstruction of homes and buildings.

"Gaza will return and be better than it used to be within seven years," he said.

According to a 2024 U.N. report, rebuilding Gaza's shattered homes will take until at least 2040 , but could drag on for many decades.

Shaath, born in 1958, is originally from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. He previously served as the deputy minister of planning in the Palestinian Authority in the occupied West Bank, where he currently resides.

In that role and others, he oversaw the development of several industrial zones in the West Bank and Gaza. He holds a PhD in Civil Engineering from Queen's University Belfast.

Shaath's upbeat assessment of the timeline for rebuilding Gaza is almost certain to face challenges as mediators struggle to agree terms on disarming Hamas, which refuses to give up its weapons, and deploying peacekeepers in the enclave.

It was unclear how Shaath's committee would proceed with rebuilding and gaining permissions for the import and use of heavy machinery and equipment - generally banned by Israel.

Israel, which cites security concerns for restricting the entry of such equipment into Gaza, did not respond to requests for comment on Shaath's appointment and plans.

Shaath said the Palestinian committee's area of jurisdiction would begin with Hamas-controlled territory and gradually increase as Israel's military withdraws further, as called for in Trump's plan.

"Ultimately, the (committee's) authority will encompass the entire Gaza Strip — 365 square kilometres — from the sea to the eastern border," Shaath said in the radio interview.

The formation of Shaath's committee has won support from Hamas, which is holding talks on Gaza's future with other Palestinian factions in Cairo.

Senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said the "ball is now in the court of the mediators, the American guarantor and the international community to empower the committee".

Israel and Hamas agreed in October to Trump's phased plan, which included a complete ceasefire, the exchange of hostages living and deceased for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

The deal has been shaken by issues including Israeli airstrikes that have killed hundreds in Gaza, the failure to retrieve the remains of one last Israeli hostage and Israeli delays in reopening Gaza's border crossing with Egypt.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:48:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey says it opposes military intervention in Iran, priority is avoiding destabilisation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-says-it-opposes-military-intervention-iran-priority-is-avoiding-2026-01-15/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Turkey is opposed to any military intervention in Iran and its priority is to avoid destabilisation there, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said on Thursday, as Tehran continues its crackdown on protests.

With Iran's leadership trying to quell the worst domestic unrest the Islamic Republic has ever faced, and with U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to intervene on behalf of the protesters, Tehran has warned its neighbours including Turkey that it would hit American bases if Washington were to strike.

Fidan has held two calls with his Iranian counterpart Abbas Araqchi in recent days, stressing the need for talks to resolve regional tensions, while a Turkish diplomatic source said Turkey was also in touch with U.S. officials, as direct communications between Tehran and Washington were suspended.

Speaking at a press conference in Istanbul, Fidan said that Turkey would continue its diplomatic initiatives to help solve the issue, and added that Ankara hoped Iran and the United States could find a solution to the conflict.

"We are against a military intervention against Iran. Iran needs to solve its authentic internal problems on its own," he said, and added that Turkey's priority was to avoid destabilisation in Iran.

"This is why our priority is to totally avoid any situation that would cause force to be used," he said, adding Ankara "did not condone" the possibility of renewed violence between Tehran and Israel or the United States.

"We definitely want problems to be solved through dialogue. I think widespread destabilisation in Iran is too much for the region to handle."

Fidan also said there was no U.S. presidential decision yet that would require Turkey to "realistically" consider a U.S. move to impose a 25% tariff on countries doing business with Iran.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:49:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WGRVKWPVNNOH7LO5QFXWNJCOJE.jpg?auth=b66ab765f3362c7e4144a2614e024e17b70d633283ec89634c334defd4964a75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkish Airlines flight makes emergency landing in Barcelona after threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkish-airlines-flight-makes-emergency-landing-barcelona-after-threat-2026-01-15/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A Turkish Airlines flight from Istanbul made an emergency landing at Barcelona-El Prat Airport on Thursday after an unspecified threat on board, Spanish airports operator AENA said, adding that the airport was operating normally.

A meeting of officials from the US, Denmark and Greenland on Wednesday avoided the public humiliation meted out to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky last year, but also produced no quick fix for the dispute.

Trump ​has said the strategically located and mineral-rich island is vital to US security and the US must own it to prevent Russia or ‍China occupying it. He has said all options are on the table for securing the territory, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

He says Denmark is not capable of warding off Russian and Chinese influence in the ​Arctic region.

Greenland and Denmark say the island is not for sale, that threats of force ​are reckless and security concerns should be resolved among allies.

Prominent EU countries have backed Denmark with many leaders warning a US military seizure of the island could in effect spell the end of NATO.

Ahead of the meeting, Greenland and Denmark said they had begun to increase their military presence in and around Greenland in close cooperation with NATO allies, as part of their promise to beef up Arctic defence.

European allies including Germany, France, Sweden and Norway have said they are sending military staff to Greenland to begin preparations for larger drills later this year.

"The Danish Armed Forces, together with a number of Arctic and European allies, will explore in the coming weeks how an increased presence and exercise activity in the Arctic ‍can be implemented in practice," the Danish Ministry of Defence said.

So far the scale of the planned military build up has not been made public, but the initial deployments appeared to be small. The German Armed Forces ​were deploying a reconnaissance team of 13 personnel to Nuuk on Thursday morning aboard an Airbus A400M transport aircraft, the German Defence Ministry said.

Nonetheless, the European military increase to Greenland was a message to the US administration, Marc Jacobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told Reuters.

"There are two ‌messages ... one is to deter, is to show that 'if you decide to do something militarily, we're ready to defend Greenland'," he said.

"And the other purpose is to say: 'Well, we take your critique seriously, we increase our presence, take care of our sovereignty, and ‍improve surveillance over Greenland'."

After the talks at the White House with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance , Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and his Greenlandic counterpart Vivian Motzfeldt said the US and Denmark would form a working group to discuss a broad array of concerns regarding the island.

But they also acknowledged that Washington had not budged on its position that it must acquire Greenland, an outcome they said would represent an unacceptable breach of sovereignty.

Late on Wednesday, a Danish Air Force plane landed at Nuuk airport and personnel in military fatigues disembarked for the exercises, footage showed.

France was also joining the deployment. "The first French military elements are already en route. ‍Others will follow," President Emmanuel Macron said on X.

Olivier Poivre d’Arvor, France’s ambassador to the Poles, told France Info radio: "We will show the United States that NATO is there, that Denmark has ‌dramatically increased its surveillance capabilities in ​Greenland and that the European Union is contributing to ensure the national security of the region as a whole."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:50:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d03adbe-f157-11f0-a7b7-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-22T103551Z-318025142-RC2STGAO4BK9-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-GREENLAND.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran protests: The biggest challenge to the Islamic Republic since its founding</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-protests-the-biggest-challenge-to-the-islamic-republic-since-its-founding</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cb202a8c-f205-11f0-98a8-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-090527-090718-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran: Death toll soars in protests after brutal crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-death-toll-soars-in-protests-after-brutal-crackdown</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 12:50:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a3013e5e-f202-11f0-b75b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-090314-090458-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK presses on with Grok deepfake probe despite Musk's climbdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/uk-regulator-says-its-x-deepfake-probe-will-continue-2026-01-15/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Britain welcomed a U-turn by xAI to stop its Grok AI chatbot making non-consensual sexually explicit deepfakes, but said its investigation into how Elon Musk's company ever allowed it to happen would continue.

Musk's artificial intelligence company xAI late on Wednesday imposed restrictions on all Grok users, limiting image editing following global concerns from regulators.

"This is a welcome development," Britain's media regulator Ofcom said on Thursday.

"However, our formal investigation remains ongoing. We are working round the clock to progress this and get answers into what went wrong and what's being done to fix it."

Britain is one of a growing list of countries cracking down on explicit content generated by Grok, imposing bans and demanding safeguards in a global push to curb illegal material.

GOVERNMENT TOUTS ONLINE SAFETY ACT SUCCESS

xAI, owned by billionaire Musk, said it had implemented tech fixes to stop the Grok account on its X platform editing images of real people in revealing clothing such as bikinis.

It had previously limited the feature to paying users, but the change did nothing to quell criticism.

Britain's Technology Secretary Liz Kendall claimed the U-turn as a victory in the government's fight to rein in the powers of big tech.

"Our Online Safety Act is and always has been about keeping people safe on social media - especially children - and it has given us the tools to hold X to account in recent days," she said.

Kendall, who said earlier this week that the Ofcom probe into X must not take months and months , added on Thursday that she would not rest until all social media platforms provided a service that is safe and age appropriate to users.

Separately Ofcom said on Thursday that Snapchat (SNAP.N) , opens new tab had "materially improved" its illegal content risk assessment, helping to protect the UK public.

CALIFORNIA DEMANDS ANSWERS AS CRITICISM MOUNTS

xAI said it had blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal". It did not identify those jurisdictions.

California joined the critics on Wednesday, when its governor and attorney general demanded answers from xAI after Musk said he was not aware of any "naked underage images" generated by Grok.

At first, Musk publicly laughed off the controversy, posting humorous emojis in response to users' comments about the influx of sexualized photos.

More recently, X has said it treats reports of child sexual abuse material seriously and polices it vigorously.

The company is facing regulatory scrutiny around the world, from France to India.

On Thursday, the Philippines said it was moving to block Grok amid concerns about its ability to generate sexualised images, including content that could pose child safety risks.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 13:41:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QL4EUNGOCFNRHAHXTWPXVAUZII.jpg?auth=d272d0adb7a40dba1d7f1fdcf052a970ce079c5300a5074bbd8af420a0a9eeff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chinese-linked hackers target US entities with Venezuelan-themed malware</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/chinese-linked-hackers-target-us-entities-with-venezuelan-themed-malware-2026-01-15/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - A Chinese-linked cyberespionage group targeted U.S. government and policy-related officials with Venezuela-themed phishing emails in the days after the U.S. operation to topple Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, cybersecurity researchers said Thursday.

The previously unreported campaign is the latest example of a long-running Chinese cyberespionage group known as "Mustang Panda" using headlines or key issues in a given country as a means to steal data and establish footholds in U.S. government entities.

In this case, the group referenced the U.S. seizure of Maduro and his wife, according to cybersecurity firm Acronis’ Threat Research Unit.

It uncovered the campaign after spotting a zip file “US now deciding what’s next for Venezuela” that was uploaded on January 5 to a publicly-accessible malware analysis service.

The file contained malware revealing code and infrastructure overlapped with prior cyberespionage campaigns carried out by a group tracked by industry researchers as Mustang Panda, the researchers said in a report on their findings. , opens new tab

The specific targets of the hacking campaign were not clear, according to the researchers, and it was not clear if any of them were compromised. If implanted, the malware would allow its operators to steal data from targeted computers and enable persistence for ongoing access, according to the analysis.

The researchers suspect the malware targeted U.S. government entities and unnamed policy-related entities based on technical indicators associated with the sample that was uploaded for analysis, and the types of organizations historically targeted by Mustang Panda.

The malware included in the zip file was compiled at 0655 GMT January 3, according to the analysis, just hours after the U.S. operation to seize Maduro began. A sample of the malware was uploaded to the sandbox at 0827 GMT January 5, the researchers said, the same day Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores pleaded not guilty to narcotics and weapons charges in a Manhattan courtroom.

Subhajeet Singha, a reverse engineer and malware analyst with Acronis and one of the authors of the analysis, said in an interview that the hackers in this case appeared to be moving quickly to take advantage of a rapidly-developing geopolitical situation of high interest, leaving some artifacts that helped link the malware to prior Mustang Panda operations.

“These guys were in haste,” Singha said, adding that the hackers' work was not of the same quality as previous efforts.

The U.S. Department of Justice said in a January 2025 statement that Mustang Panda was a “group of hackers sponsored by the People’s Republic of China,” that has been paid to develop spying malware and penetrate target networks.

A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy in Washington said in an email: "China has consistently opposed and legally combated all forms of hacking activities, and will never encourage, support or condone cyberattacks. China firmly opposes the dissemination of false information about so-called 'Chinese cyber threats' for political purposes."

Since Trump revived his ambition to claim the semi-autonomous Danish territory after the U.S. military operation to capture the Venezuelan president , NATO members have been scrambling for ideas to counter U.S. criticism that Greenland is under-protected as Russia and China take a greater interest in the Arctic and its mineral riches.

Any forcible U.S. takeover of Greenland would be an unprecedented seizure of one NATO ally’s territory by another - the nuclear-armed superpower that is meant to provide the ultimate security guarantee for all members.

Many politicians, diplomats and analysts on both sides of the Atlantic say that would mean the end of the alliance , or at least severely weaken it. That, in turn, could have devastating consequences for European security, leaving the continent much more vulnerable to a Russian attack.

“I cannot think of other cases where NATO has been really on the line, and especially not where the culprit has been the United States,” said Sten Rynning, a professor at the University of Southern Denmark and author of several books on NATO.

Discussions on what NATO could do about Greenland are at an early stage, diplomats say, but could include additional air surveillance, maritime patrols and greater use of technology to monitor the region.

To act quickly rather than wait for a collective NATO decision, Denmark and some allies including Germany, France, Sweden and Norway on Wednesday announced small but symbolic troop deployments to Greenland for exercises to show commitment to Arctic security.

That announcement came as the Danish and Greenlandic foreign ministers met U.S. Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington and found no resolution to the standoff .

NATO members’ strategy of bolstering Arctic security will only succeed in keeping the alliance together if Trump accepts it as an alternative - or part of an alternative - to U.S. ownership.

But he has repeatedly insisted that nothing less than ownership will do, leading many European officials to conclude that he is motivated more by a desire to expand U.S. territory than security concerns.

“NATO can help be part of the solution by fleshing out a serious Arctic surveillance and deterrence strategy,” said Fabrice Pothier, a former NATO director of policy planning and current CEO of Rasmussen Global, a geopolitical consultancy founded by former NATO boss Anders Fogh Rasmussen.

“But its credibility is also collateral damage of the tension so far. With his claims, Trump has introduced a doubt about U.S. commitment to NATO that will be seldom forgotten.”

Trump said last week the U.S. remained committed to NATO and that Russia and China only feared the alliance as long as the United States was a member. He said NATO would become far more formidable with Greenland in the hands of the United States.

For its part, Russia says NATO's talk of Russia and China being a threat to Greenland is a myth designed to artificially whip up hysteria and that what it called the Western alliance's policy of escalating confrontation in the Arctic was extremely dangerous.

For many NATO members, the latest blow-up over Greenland is an unwelcome and dangerous distraction. Since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine brought war to NATO’s borders, the alliance has been intensely focused on bolstering its eastern flank over fears that one of its members could be Russian President Vladimir Putin’s next target.

Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have insisted the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States. European leaders have rallied to support them in recent days.

Many European diplomats see a U.S. military takeover of Greenland as unlikely, although Trump has repeatedly floated that scenario or refused to exclude it. But they acknowledge it would have huge repercussions. One Eastern European official said it would be “an earthquake situation with a risk of destroying NATO”.

Danish and other European officials have pointed out that as Greenland is part of NATO, it is already covered by the alliance’s Article 5 collective security pact. So if Russia or China were to try to take the territory - as Trump has suggested they might - they would be risking war with the entire alliance, including the United States.

Officials have also stressed that the United States already has a military base, Pituffik Space Base, in Greenland, with around 200 troops, and can deploy as many more forces as it wants under a 1951 agreement.

However, diplomats say NATO allies agree the alliance as a whole should do more for Arctic security, which until now has largely been handled by countries in the region such as Denmark, Norway, Finland and Canada.

Denmark has a Joint Arctic Command on Greenland, with about 150 military and civilian personnel.

“When it comes to the Arctic region, we have to work together as an alliance,” NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in Brussels on Tuesday. “And we are now putting more details to the next steps, to make sure that we indeed can do that as a collective alliance.”

Rutte said Trump was right to highlight the need for greater Arctic security. He also pointed out that Denmark was investing more in Boeing B-8 surveillance aircraft, long-range drones, F-35 fighters, air-to-air refuelling, and other capabilities to better protect the region.

However, as NATO operates by consensus, any major change to the alliance's Arctic security posture would need sign-off from all 32 members - including the U.S.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:26:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DL42V4SRCVI7XI2N6NAOI5VAQE.jpg?auth=d1148574e6251fbe6c96859a1b341d370a48b7aec76d213493d73948aaa9007e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens to use military over Minnesota anti-ICE protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-threatens-use-insurrection-act-minnesota-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to use the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy military forces, in Minnesota amid escalating tension over a deployment of federal agents in the state's most populous city, which has become the focus of daily clashes.

"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.

Trump's threat on social media came on the heels of the shooting by a U.S. immigration officer of a Venezuelan man fleeing a traffic stop in Minneapolis on Wednesday, one week after the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which is overseeing Trump's immigration crackdown, said that during Wednesday's incident two people attacked the federal officer with a broomstick and snow shovel as he wrestled with the Venezuelan, who the DHS said was in the U.S. illegally.

The seizure marks the sixth vessel targeted in recent weeks that was either carrying Venezuelan oil or had done so in the past. The officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the seizure took place in the Caribbean.

The U.S. military's Southern Command confirmed the pre-dawn operation, saying U.S. forces apprehended Motor/Tanker Veronica "without incident." It said the Veronica was "operating in defiance of President Trump’s established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean."

"The only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully," Southern Command said in a statement.

The seizures began as part of Trump's campaign to force Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro out of power, which culminated in U.S. forces swooping into the country to grab him and his wife on January 3.

Since then, Trump has said the United States plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry.

The vessels intercepted so far have been either under U.S. sanctions or part of a "shadow fleet" of unregulated ships that disguise their origins to move oil from major sanctioned producers -- Iran, Russia or Venezuela.

Last week, the U.S. seized a Russian-flagged oil tanker that was being shadowed by a Russian submarine after pursuing it for more than two weeks across the Atlantic.

The move was condemned by Moscow.

The latest seizure came ahead of Thursday's meeting between Trump and Machado , in their first face-to-face meeting since the U.S. ousted her long-time foe, Maduro.

Trump has previously called her a "freedom fighter" but dismissed the idea of installing her to lead Venezuela after ousting Maduro, saying she did not have enough domestic support.

A classified CIA assessment presented to Trump concluded that Maduro loyalists, including Rodriguez, were best positioned to maintain stability.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:26:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U3YCBUBBKVLGBJUC5UP4D3GB3A.jpg?auth=a17ee0bc60c100d39cd5059836b9579a812204465083c9bdbab9c4b92476dd28&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece warns shipping fleet of risks after Black Sea drone attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/greece-warns-shipping-fleet-risks-after-black-sea-drone-attacks-2026-01-15/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Greece has warned its shipping fleet to review their security measures when sailing to Russian Black Sea ports after drone attacks on two Greek-operated tankers this week, according to shipping ministry advisories.

Drones struck two oil tankers on Tuesday, including one chartered by U.S. oil major Chevron, as they sailed toward a Black Sea terminal on Russia's Black Sea coast.

Greek-operated ships are among the world's largest fleets of tankers and are pivotal for trade across the Black Sea region, whose waters are shared by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania and Turkey, as well as warring Russia and Ukraine.

"It is recommended that the security managers of shipping companies, the masters and the security officers of Greek ships proceed with an updated threat assessment for commercial ships located in the Black Sea and the maritime areas close to it," the shipping ministry said in one of the documents seen by Reuters that were issued after the attacks.

War insurance costs for ships sailing to the Black Sea have jumped this week, reflecting the worsening risk environment.

One of the tankers targeted on Tuesday was Matilda, which was managed by Greece's Thenamaris and hit by two drones.

While there were no injuries or serious damage to the vessel, a Thenamaris official said that the company had since then stepped up additional precautionary security measures and advised crew on their vessels to increase vigilance and avoid unnecessary exposure, mainly movement on the deck.

The ministry referred shipping companies to an earlier document published in April 2022 that recommended that additional protective security measures be maintained for a certain period as a result of increased risk for the Russian Black Sea ports of Novorossiysk, Taman, Tuapse and Kavkaz.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:26:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OXNRVL6TPFM5XJG44XATRIJ7OI.jpg?auth=bfa15af1f56345006592440e9d58925b36673521de9753a6e65eb19ab43ea64a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says 'blackmail and threats' against Cuba are unacceptable</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-says-blackmail-threats-against-cuba-are-unacceptable-2026-01-15/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday that using the language of blackmail and threats against Cuba was unacceptable after U.S. President Donald Trump told Havana to make a deal before it was too late.

Here are details:

Prince Harry, King Charles' younger son and the Duke of Sussex, music legend Elton John, John's husband David Furnish, actors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, campaigner Doreen Lawrence and former British lawmaker Simon Hughes are suing Associated Newspapers Limited alleging unlawful information gathering.

They launched the action at the High Court against Associated, the publisher of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, in October 2020.

The seven claimants say that journalists working for the titles commissioned private investigators to commit a series of unlawful acts between 1993 and 2011.

These included hacking voicemail messages on their mobile phones, tapping their landline phones and obtaining confidential information, such as flight details and medical records, by deception – known as "blagging".

Among those named as being involved are some senior current and former journalists, including editors.

Associated denies all the allegations, calling them "preposterous smears".

Numerous hearings, with often heated argument, have been held: firstly to decide whether the case should proceed and then what allegations the court could and should consider.

In November 2023, Judge Matthew Nicklin ruled the case should go to trial, rejecting Associated's argument it should be dismissed because it had been brought outside a six-year time limit.

The following year, the British government gave permission for the claimants' legal team to use documents submitted to a 2011-12 public inquiry into press standards, held in the wake of public anger over revelations of phone-hacking by journalists on the Rupert Murdoch-owned title, the News of the World.

However, Nicklin in October ruled Harry's lawyers could not use allegations about Kate, the Princess of Wales and wife of his older brother Prince William, as part of their case, and rejected many of their other applications.

The claimants have also had more wide-ranging parts of their case, referring to phone-hacking at separate media organisations, cut from their lawsuits.

Harry and all the other claimants will appear to give evidence and face questions from ANL's lawyers. John and his husband are likely to give their evidence remotely.

For Harry, it will be the second time he has appeared in a witness box, having become the first royal , opens new tab to do so for more than 130 years during his successful phone-hacking lawsuit against the publisher of the Daily Mirror newspaper in June 2023.

Among those due to appear to give evidence for ANL are current and former editors, senior journalists, and most notably Paul Dacre, the Mail's longstanding former editor and now the editor-in-chief of DMG Media, the publishing arm of Daily Mail and General Trust.

He is set to be their initial witness as Associated's lawyers said they would send senior figures "over the top" first.

Nicklin has been clear throughout the preliminary hearings that the trial should focus solely on a number of specific articles which the claimants say were based on unlawfully-obtained information, and should not become a second wide-ranging public inquiry into the behaviour of the newspapers.

The claimants' lawyer is David Sherborne, who has represented Harry in other cases and was one of the most prominent lawyers in the public inquiry.

He will need to persuade Nicklin that Associated used unlawful means to get stories about Harry, John and the others. Associated's team will argue that the reports were legitimately obtained and private detectives were not paid to hack phones as the claimants allege.

Associated have cast the whole case as being manufactured by opponents of the press including actor Hugh Grant, the late motor racing boss and privacy campaigner Max Mosley, and other figures, some of whom are now part of a "research team" assisting Harry's lawyers.

They say a "Daily Mail Plan" was hatched years before, meaning that some of the lawsuits should fail on time limitation.

One of the key factors will be how the judge views evidence given by one of the key witnesses, private investigator Gavin Burrows, who is central to many of the allegations.

He gave the claimants' legal team a witness statement in August 2021 in which he said his work for Associated had included bugging landlines.

But he has since provided further declarations to Associated's lawyers, denying these claims and saying that he believed the statement given to Harry's lawyers had been "prepared by others without my knowledge", was "substantially untrue", and that his signature had been forged.

In January, Harry settled a lawsuit against Rupert Murdoch's UK newspaper group (NGN) just as a 10-week trial was due to start.

He won an apology from the group and an admission for the first time that private investigators working for the Sun newspaper had acted unlawfully.

NGN had previously paid out millions to around 1,000 victims of phone-hacking over activities by staff at its defunct News of the World title.

A similar deal would be trickier for Associated, though, as it has always stated its titles have not been involved in any unlawful newsgathering.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:52:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I33IY7EWG5NNXE7SCQNIHZ7CBQ.jpg?auth=0506929c22a3f2e18983d8bfddaa8c2f9df018cda1e6df9909290b370041a64b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's polarised politics stymies government's regional funding plan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/spains-polarised-politics-stymies-governments-regional-funding-plan-2026-01-15/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 15 (Reuters) - A new fiscal model proposed by Spain's finance minister for its regional governments has faced a heavy backlash from regional leaders, who accuse the central government of toying with public finances to win political favours as it struggles to hold its fragile coalition together.

The Socialists, who head a minority coalition government, struck a bilateral deal with Catalonia at the behest of separatist party ERC that guarantees the region will receive the same amount in services as it pays in taxes, while other governments receive varying amounts.

That has infuriated the country's other regions, with some threatening to take the state to court for, they claim, contravening the constitutional principle that no territory should be given a financial advantage over another by the central government.

Economists and ratings agencies have also expressed concern over an additional 21 billion euros promised in the model by the state to regional governments, worsening Spain's fiscal position when it is already buckling under the strain of higher pensions and pressure to boost defence spending.

Nuria Bosch, economics professor at Barcelona University, said the deal was on paper better for all the regions.

"But it bears the stamp of having been put forward by the separatists, which creates resentment in many autonomous communities."

The standoff comes as disputes with splinter parties across the political spectrum from hard-left Sumar to separatist Junts have crippled the Socialists' ability to pass policy, leaving Congress in a deadlock with a year to go until scheduled national elections.

Spain's central budget is still being rolled over this year from its 2023 version after it failed last November to secure backing from the conservative opposition People's Party, hard-right Vox and hard-left Podemos for a new proposal.

Finance Minister Maria Jesus Montero admonished the opposition for critiquing the model without presenting an alternative, accusing its leaders of playing "infantile politics" and lying about the benefits of the new system.

Still, all but one of the country's 17 autonomous communities, including those run by the same Socialist party leading the central government, remained staunchly opposed after lengthy talks with Montero on Wednesday. She will now begin a round of bilateral talks with each government in a bid to change their minds.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:53:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X2ZO5DSNXBN2RMPO7OSMN4FA5U.jpg?auth=c1a9fb8af013d1217ce49b1f69ffc1238e83e6544e38d815e927790744d80157&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan-Saudi-Turkey defence deal in pipeline, Pakistani minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-saudi-turkey-defence-deal-pipeline-pakistani-minister-says-2026-01-15/</link><description>ISLAMABAD/ISTANBUL, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have prepared a draft defence agreement after nearly a year of talks, Pakistan's Minister for Defence Production said, a signal they could be seeking a bulwark against a flare-up of regional violence in the last two years.

Raza Hayat Harraj told Reuters on Wednesday the potential deal between the three regional powers was separate from a bilateral Saudi-Pakistani accord announced last year. A final consensus between the three states is needed to complete the deal, he said.

"The Pakistan-Saudi Arabia-Turkey trilateral agreement is something that is already in pipeline," Harraj said in an interview.

"The draft agreement is already available with us. The draft agreement is already with Saudi Arabia. The draft agreement is already available with Turkey. And all three countries are deliberating. And this agreement has been there for the last 10 months."

Asked at a press conference in Istanbul on Thursday about media reports on negotiations between the three sides, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said talks had been held but that no agreement had been signed.

Fidan pointed to a need for broader regional cooperation and trust to overcome distrust that creates "cracks and problems" that led to the emergence of external hegemonies, or wars and instability stemming from terrorism, in the region.

"At the end of all of these, we have a proposal like this: all regional nations must come together to create a cooperation platform on the issue of security," Fidan said. Regional issues could be resolved if relevant countries would "be sure of each other," he added.

"At the moment, there are meetings, talks, but we have not signed any agreement. Our President (Tayyip Erdogan)'s vision is for an inclusive platform that creates wider, bigger cooperation and stability," Fidan said, without naming Pakistan or Saudi Arabia directly.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:53:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's polarised politics stymies government's regional funding plan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/spains-polarised-politics-stymies-governments-regional-funding-plan-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:59:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Pakistan-Saudi-Turkey defence deal in pipeline, Pakistani minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-saudi-turkey-defence-deal-pipeline-pakistani-minister-says-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 14:59:36 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia says the West should stop claiming Moscow wants to occupy Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-says-west-should-stop-claiming-moscow-wants-occupy-greenland-2026-01-15/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday that its was unacceptable for the West to keep claiming that Russia and China threatened Greenland, and said the crisis over the territory showed the double-standards of Western powers which claimed moral superiority.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said that the United States will take Greenland because unless it does so then Russia and China will - and that the United States does not want them as neighbours.

Since Trump's threats, Western European leaders have repeatedly said, without citing specific evidence, that Russia and China have designs on Greenland - and used that to argue that NATO needs to defend the Arctic against Moscow and Beijing.

"First they came up with the idea that there were some aggressors, and then that they were ready to protect someone from these aggressors," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said of the West's actions on Greenland.

"Neither Russia nor China has announced any such plans," she said, adding that no facts had been presented to support the claim that Russia and China threatened Greenland.

When asked directly by Reuters if Russia had designs on Greenland, Zakharova said: "Why don't you ask Trump?"

"There are no facts indicating the aggressive plans of Russia and China, nor can there be any," Zakharova said.

China on Monday urged the United States not to use other countries as an excuse to pursue its own interests, and said China's activities in the Arctic aim to promote peace, stability, and sustainable development in the region.

The current situation, Zakharova said, "demonstrates with particular acuteness the inconsistency of the so-called 'rules-based world order' being built by the West," Zakharova said.

"Take a bite of what you have prepared - but just don't choke," Zakharova said with a smile.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:26:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BIMEI26A7FKNXI7SZT6TOAMSXY.jpg?auth=c7e8b6b0c1a61d2889344d42f5edfa002957141569da7efab33be5ec989c2652&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba mourns 32 soldiers killed in US attack on Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-mourns-32-soldiers-killed-us-attack-venezuela-2026-01-15/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Cuba received on Thursday the remains of its 32 soldiers killed in combat during the U.S. attack on Venezuela and stunning capture of its president, Nicolas Maduro, paying homage to the troops as national "heroes."

The remains of the soldiers, members of Cuba's armed forces and intelligence agencies, arrived early on Thursday at Havana's international airport, in caskets draped in the Cuban flag.

Cuba has provided some security for Maduro since he came to power. It was not clear how many of the fallen Cubans were guarding the Venezuelan president when they died, or how many may have perished elsewhere.

The communist government of Cuba earlier this month said 32 of its citizens had died during the U.S. raid on the Venezuelan capital Caracas.

A military band in white uniforms played the Cuban national anthem on the tarmac during a ceremony overseen by President Miguel Diaz-Canel, 94-year-old former leader Raul Castro and top military officials.

General Lazaro Alberto Alvarez said the fallen troops represented Cuba's unwavering commitment to its homeland and allies.

"If this painful chapter of history has demonstrated anything, it is that imperialism may possess the most sophisticated weapons, may impose immense material wealth, may buy the minds of the wavering, but there is one thing it will never be able to buy: the dignity of the Cuban people," he said.

A motorcade later transferred the bodies to the armed forces ministry along one of the capital's main boulevards, lined by thousands paying their respects, waving flags and saluting.

Maduro, 63, and his wife Cilia Flores were seized by U.S. forces in Caracas on Saturday and flown to the United States. Maduro is being held in a New York detention center on drug charges.

Tensions between the U.S. and Cuba spiraled this week after U.S. President Donald Trump told Cuba he would cut off Venezuelan oil and money from reaching the island, warning Havana to make a deal before it's "too late."

Trump's comment prompted a defiant response from Diaz-Canel, who said Cuba would defend its homeland "to the last drop of blood."

Cuba has planned a march on Friday in front of the U.S. embassy to protest U.S. aggression in Venezuela.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:27:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Back from Iran, Pakistani students say they heard gunshots while confined to campus</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/back-iran-pakistani-students-say-they-heard-gunshots-while-confined-campus-2026-01-15/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Pakistani students returning from Iran on Thursday said they heard gunshots and stories of rioting and violence while being confined to campus and not allowed out of their dormitories in the evening.

Iran's leadership is trying to quell the worst domestic unrest since its 1979 revolution, with a rights group putting the death toll over 2,600.

As the protests swell, Tehran is seeking to deter U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated threats to intervene on behalf of anti-government protesters.

"During nighttime, we would sit inside and we would hear gunshots," Shahanshah Abbas, a fourth-year student at Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, said at the Islamabad airport.

"The situation down there is that riots have been happening everywhere. People are dying. Force is being used."

Abbas said students at the university were not allowed to leave campus and told to stay in their dormitories after 4 p.m.

"There was nothing happening on campus," Abbas said, but in his interactions with Iranians, he heard stories of violence and chaos.

"The surrounding areas, like banks, mosques, they were damaged, set on fire ... so things were really bad."

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran but adopted a wait-and-see posture on Thursday after protests appeared to have abated. Information flows have been hampered by an internet blackout for a week.

"We were not allowed to go out of the university," said Arslan Haider, a student in his final year. "The riots would mostly start later in the day."

Haider said he was unable to contact his family due to the blackout but "now that they opened international calls, the students are getting back because their parents were concerned".

A Pakistani diplomat in Tehran said the embassy was getting calls from many of the 3,500 students in Iran to send messages to their families back home.

"Since they don't have internet connections to make WhatsApp and other social network calls, what they do is they contact the embassy from local phone numbers and tell us to inform their families."

Rimsha Akbar, who was in the middle of her final year exams at Isfahan, said international students were kept safe.

"Iranians would tell us if we are talking on Snapchat or if we were riding in a cab ... that shelling had happened, tear gas had happened, and that a lot of people were killed."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:28:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z3AV6BUETBPTLNZKVILL7APNOE.jpg?auth=f5d1d87c77a5a7842688b5bfbc0b8f39fd3442f044190fb36729f72c07811a36&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fitch warns of mass eastern European downgrade if Greenland strife cracks NATO</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/fitch-warns-mass-eastern-european-downgrade-if-greenland-strife-cracks-nato-2026-01-15/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Europe could face a wave of one-notch credit rating downgrades if tensions with the U.S. over Greenland fracture NATO, Fitch's top sovereign analyst said on Thursday.

Fitch already applies a one-notch "adjustment" to ratings in geopolitical hot spots such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea to reflect elevated risks. Its head of sovereign ratings, James Longsdon, told Reuters the agency may consider a similar approach in Europe if the defence alliance weakens.

"Clearly that's the one thing we'd have to look at for any of the sovereigns in Europe where structurally we need to think about that," Longsdon said in an interview.

Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who has warned a conflict with the U.S. over Greenland would spell the end of NATO , told Reuters on Thursday there remained a "fundamental disagreement" with the U.S. after President Donald Trump again insisted that the U.S. "needs" Greenland.

Longsdon stressed that Fitch would "have to see how these things play out first" and that any rating action would require careful assessment, though proximity to Russia would be a key factor.

"It could be where you felt the vulnerability to a geopolitical event would be most obvious," he said.

"That's the broad rule of thumb, so the further away you are from Russia, the least likely that is to be the case."

However, he said tensions over Greenland were unlikely to affect Denmark's triple-A rating. Denmark is among a small group of European countries with the top credit score, alongside Germany, Switzerland and Norway, and has one of the lowest debt levels in the shrinking global club of triple-A sovereigns.

"Greenland is a large land mass, but it's very small economically and fiscally for Denmark," Longsdon said. "It is a very solid triple-A sovereign rating, so I think just the size differential makes it very hard to see a situation that would be so consequential."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:28:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L5ZCMP35EVJN7LZDXMHZC4A6LU.jpg?auth=16bc41de0a37e594d85df03b4c31e6f0107afedd35105cf99069fb5d4ef4da63&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian dies in Iran at the hands of the authorities, says Ottawa</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-dies-iran-hands-authorities-says-ottawa-2026-01-15/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - A Canadian citizen has died in Iran at the hands of the Iranian authorities, Foreign Minister Anita Anand said in a social media post on Thursday, but did not give details of how or when.

An Israeli military spokesperson had earlier issued a warning to residents of certain buildings in the Lebanese village of Sohmor.

Israel and Lebanon agreed to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in 2024, ending more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah that had culminated in Israeli strikes that severely weakened the Iran-backed militant group. Since then, the sides have traded accusations over violations.

Lebanon has faced growing pressure from the U.S. and Israel to disarm Hezbollah, and its leaders fear that Israel could dramatically escalate strikes across the battered country to push Lebanon's leaders to confiscate Hezbollah's arsenal more quickly.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:29:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 21 migrant bodies found in Libya mass grave, security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-21-migrant-bodies-found-libya-mass-grave-security-sources-say-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:29:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Fitch warns of mass eastern European downgrade if Greenland strife cracks NATO</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/fitch-warns-mass-eastern-european-downgrade-if-greenland-strife-cracks-nato-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:29:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Canadian dies in Iran at the hands of the authorities, says Ottawa</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadian-dies-iran-hands-authorities-says-ottawa-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:29:39 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Israel says it is striking Hezbollah targets in several areas in Lebanon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-it-is-striking-hezbollah-targets-several-areas-lebanon-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:29:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Gazans sceptical of phase 2 of truce as strikes continue</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/gazans-sceptical-of-phase-2-of-truce-as-strikes-continue</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:30:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3893ffd0-f21f-11f0-b9f4-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-150137-150330-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US imposes sanctions on Iran over crackdown on protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-imposes-sanctions-iran-over-crackdown-protesters-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on five Iranian officials it accused of being behind the crackdown on protests and warned it was tracking Iranian leaders' funds being wired to banks around the world, as U.S. President Donald Trump's administration increases pressure on Tehran.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on the Secretary of the Supreme Council for National Security as well as Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and law enforcement forces commanders, accusing them of being architects of the crackdown.

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in a video on Thursday said Washington's message to Iran's leaders was clear: "U.S. Treasury knows, that like rats on a sinking ship, you are frantically wiring funds stolen from Iranian families to banks and financial institutions around the world. Rest assured, we will track them and you."

"But there's still time, if you choose to join us. As President Trump has said, stop the violence and stand with the people of Iran."

The unrest in Iran started with protests over soaring prices before turning into one of the biggest challenges to the clerical establishment since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The U.S.-based HRANA rights group says it has so far verified the deaths of 2,435 protesters and 153 government-affiliated individuals.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene on behalf of protesters in Iran, where the clerical establishment has cracked down hard on nationwide unrest since December 28.

"The United States stands firmly behind the Iranian people in their call for freedom and justice," Bessent said in the statement.

"Treasury will use every tool to target those behind the regime’s tyrannical oppression of human rights."

The Treasury also imposed sanctions on 18 people it accused of involvement in laundering the proceeds of Iranian petroleum and petrochemical sales to foreign markets as part of "shadow banking" networks of sanctioned Iranian financial institutions.

Thursday's action is the latest move targeting Tehran since Trump restored his "maximum pressure" campaign on Iran, which includes efforts to drive its oil exports to zero and help prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:56:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4X4WMN3PFNWZJ46HQSQYMWUCU.jpg?auth=613700e4aaef77a4559a23eb8aaa05ad01f407efcb0f2ceaad0fc9e006efeca5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration wins appeal of ruling releasing pro-Palestinian activist Khalil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-administration-wins-appeal-ruling-releasing-pro-palestinian-activist-2026-01-15/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court ruled on Thursday that a judge had no jurisdiction to order the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from immigration detention, delivering President Donald Trump's administration a victory in its efforts to deport the pro-Palestinian activist.

The 2-1 ruling by a panel of the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals opened the door to Khalil being re-arrested after it ordered , opens new tab the dismissal of a lawsuit he filed challenging his initial detention.

That holding came from U.S. Circuit Judges Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, both of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, who said that under the Immigration and Nationality Act, his claims needed to be instead heard through an appeal of a final order of removal from an immigration judge.

"The scheme Congress enacted governing immigration proceedings provides Khalil a meaningful forum in which to raise his claims later on—in a petition for review of a final order of removal," they wrote in an unsigned opinion.

Khalil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Khalil, a prominent figure in pro-Palestinian protests against Israel's war in Gaza, was arrested on March 8 by immigration agents in the lobby of his university residence in Manhattan.

President Donald Trump, a Republican, had called the protests antisemitic and vowed to deport foreign students who took part. Khalil became the first target of this policy.

Though Khalil was initially detained in New York, by the time his lawyer sued over his detention there, immigration officials had moved him to New Jersey, leading his case to be transferred to a judge there.

He walked out of a Louisiana immigrant detention center in June, after U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz of Newark, New Jersey, ordered the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to release him from custody.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:57:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6JE4UADGXRKIRICS77RRFI3LB4.jpg?auth=bf969d5204a4dd032b8d50b1f5ed3f5e01ce7aa4c2a2131cb80a33cf69628c7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US issues new Iran-related sanctions, US Treasury website shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-issues-new-iran-related-sanctions-us-treasury-website-shows-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday issued new Iran-related sanctions that target what appeared to be shipping, trading and energy companies, according to a post on the U.S. Treasury Department website on Thursday.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote Thursday on social media, “Motor Tanker Veronica had previously passed through Venezuelan waters, and was operating in defiance of President Trump’s established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean.”

A social media post from US Southern Command on the capture said that Marines and sailors launched from the aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford to make the capture while Noem’s post noted that, as in previous raids, a US Coast Guard tactical team conducted the boarding and seizure.

Noem posted a brief video that appeared to show part of the ship’s capture. The black-and-white footage showed helicopters hovering over the deck of a merchant vessel while armed troops dropped down on the deck by rope.

The Veronica is the sixth tanker that has been seized by US forces as part of the effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to control the production, refining and global distribution of Venezuela’s oil products, and the fourth since the US ouster of Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid almost two weeks ago .

Noem, in her social media post, said that the raid was carried out with “close coordination with our colleagues” in the military as well as the State and Justice departments.

“Our heroic Coast Guard men and women once again ensured a flawlessly executed operation, in accordance with international law,” Noem added.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 15:58:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5b97e994-f222-11f0-b28e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92U96G3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin says the world is getting more dangerous but is silent on Maduro and Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/putin-says-world-is-getting-more-dangerous-is-silent-maduro-iran-2026-01-15/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir said on Thursday that the international situation had deteriorated and that the world was getting more dangerous but he was silent on the situation in Venezuela and Iran.

Putin has yet to comment in public on the toppling of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro by the United States, the protests in Iran or U.S. President Donald Trump's threats against Greenland.

"The situation on the international stage is increasingly deteriorating - I don't think anyone would argue with that - long-standing conflicts are intensifying, and new serious flashpoints are emerging," Putin said with a smile.

In a speech to new ambassadors who had presented their credentials in the Kremlin, his first public remarks on foreign policy issues this year, Putin did not mention the United States or Trump explicitly.

"We hear a monologue from those who, by the right of might, consider it permissible to dictate their will, lecture others, and issue orders," Putin said. "Russia is sincerely committed to the ideals of a multipolar world."

Putin urged a discussion of Russia's proposals for a new security architecture in Europe.

"We hope that recognition of this need will come sooner or later. Until then, Russia will continue to consistently pursue its goals."

The war in Ukraine, Europe's deadliest since World War Two, has sparked the biggest confrontation between Russia and the West since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:37:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q22VXGBIWBMYFFDCFE5HD7QTPQ.jpg?auth=63aa06959030d98a3d18c1e548ddd48a9de8ba731f018318f7bd06be3b771293&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>IMF needs voting majority of members to recognize Venezuela government to restore ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/imf-needs-voting-majority-members-recognize-venezuela-government-restore-ties-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The International Monetary Fund said on Thursday that any re-engagement with Venezuela ​following the U.S. capture of Venezuelan ‌President Nicolas Maduro would depend on member governments representing a majority of IMF voting power recognizing a successor regime.

IMF spokesperson Julie Kozack ‌told a regular news briefing that the ​Fund would follow the same protocols on engagement with other countries that have had ‍irregular regime changes, and assess whether majority-voting countries recognize Venezuela's legitimate government.

The IMF has not had any ⁠engagement with Venezuela since 2019 due to ‍the lack of recognition of Maduro's government. The Fund ‌has ‌not performed an annual "Article IV" assessment of Venezuela's economy since 2004.

But Kozack described Venezuela's economic situation as "dire," with rising poverty.

"Since late ⁠2024 our ⁠assessment is ​that imbalances and vulnerabilities have re emerged, driven by lower oil revenue, a widening fiscal deficit, which ‍has prompted increased monetary financing for the fiscal deficit and a scarcity of US dollar liquidity," ​Kozack said. "Inflation is estimated to ‍be in the triple digits, and rapid currency depreciation ​is underway."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:38:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G5LOISSNFJOQBHB5UPOGU3ANL4.jpg?auth=fba2fea612b7543da9078a9c0681511756260aba632a219c7c3e74390bf5223e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Honduras to launch trade talks, USTR Greer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-honduras-launch-trade-talks-ustr-greer-says-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:38:46 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Britain to boost military reserves by raising maximum call-up age to 65</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britain-boost-military-reserves-by-raising-maximum-call-up-age-65-2026-01-15/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Britain said on Thursday it would strengthen its military reserve forces by raising the maximum age at which former personnel could be called up by a decade to 65.

European countries, including France and Germany , have taken steps to boost their reserves in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the United States' insistence that Europe take more responsibility for its own security.

Britain also said it would lower the threshold for which former personnel could be called upon to include "warlike preparations". Currently they can only be called upon for "national danger, great emergency or attack on the UK".

"These reforms will allow us to mobilise that talent rapidly when it matters most, strengthening our readiness and aligning with a similar approach many NATO forces are taking," said Paul Griffiths, the general leading the British effort.

The changes are expected to come into force from spring 2027.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:38:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MVUQOHTV2JJ4DMANYQVN2JX6LI.jpg?auth=3884eaca2d69402f0bb63f109e227972f888d50424d8c8a9d61e968ae1352aa4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia destroys large energy facility in Kharkiv, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-destroys-large-energy-facility-kharkiv-mayor-says-2026-01-15/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Russian forces have destroyed a large energy facility in Ukraine's second-biggest city Kharkiv, the mayor said on Thursday, the latest target of a winter air campaign by Moscow that has plunged millions of Ukrainians into darkness and cold.

Russia has attacked the power grid and other energy facilities while pressing a battlefield offensive that has left Kyiv on the back foot as it faces U.S. pressure to secure peace.

Ihor Terekhov, writing on the Telegram messaging app, did not specify what sort of facility had been hit, but said emergency crews were on the scene and working around the clock.

Kharkiv, just 25 km from the Russian border, has been regularly targeted by drones, missiles and glide bombs throughout the war, which enters its fifth year next month.

Regional governor Oleh Synehubov said officials were still trying to assess the extent of damage from Thursday's attack.

Power outages and cuts to heating and water in major cities have worsened over the past week as Ukraine struggles with a cold snap that has overwhelmed the already hobbled energy system.

Kyiv mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Thursday that around 300 apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital remain without heat after a January 9 attack knocked out heating to half the city's high-rises.

Russia has also stepped up attacks on ports in Ukraine's southern Odesa region. A missile strike on Thursday injured one person and damaged shipping containers in the city of Chornomorsk, said deputy prime minister Oleksiy Kuleba.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:38:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to meet Venezuela opposition leader Machado at White House</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-to-meet-venezuela-opposition-leader-machado-at-white-house</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:39:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/39e39730-f22c-11f0-972d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-161558-162210-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netanyahu says the announced start of Gaza ceasefire's next phase is a 'declarative move'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/netanyahu-says-the-announced-start-of-gaza-ceasefire-s-next-phase-is-a-declarative-move</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:39:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c62a6a76-f22b-11f0-ad33-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-161323-161554-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'US can't politically engineer a new status quo inside Iran, it must be self-sustaining'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-can-t-politically-engineer-a-new-status-quo-inside-iran-it-must-be-self-sustaining</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 16:39:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10736d10-f229-11f0-bb6a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-140543-141043-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cuba to accept US aid as Washington warns against interference</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cuba-accept-us-aid-washington-warns-against-interference-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON/HAVANA, Jan 15 - The U.S. State Department's top aid official warned Cuba's authorities on Thursday not to interfere with a humanitarian aid shipment and suggested President Donald Trump could take action if Cuba fails to comply.

In March 2025, Washington made the decision to suspend intelligence sharing with Ukraine as part of efforts to crank up pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to cooperate with President Donald Trump's bid to convene peace talks with Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

The relationship has had its ups and downs since, but there has been no indication that Washington has drastically cut its intelligence provision to Ukraine.

In a New Year's speech to the French military, Macron praised Europe's efforts over the last two years in taking over major strands of weapons support to Ukraine.

He said a coalition of some 35 countries was now providing all of the support, including financial, to Kyiv after Washington had decided to no longer fund or directly give weapons to Ukraine.

"Where Ukraine was extremely dependent on American intelligence capacity, huge majority (of it) a year ago, in (the space of) a year, two-thirds is today provided by France," Macron said.

The comments are in contrast to Kyrylo Budanov, who was appointed head of Zelenskiy's office and is the former chief of Ukraine's military intelligence, who said in December that Kyiv was critically dependent on Washington for intelligence ranging from satellite imagery to early warning systems after ballistic missile launches.

Ukraine's GUR military intelligence agency declined to comment.

A French defence ministry official declined to comment specifically on the president's assertions, but said much of the intelligence was of technical origin.

When Washington suspended intelligence in 2025, France's then Defence Minister Sebastien Lecornu said the U.S. halt to intelligence sharing would have a significant operational impact on Ukraine, but that France's own intelligence provided to Kyiv was not reliant on Washington.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:33:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JKLZV6GMGBLIPNR4OE2D6SWM4U.jpg?auth=06ccec5bf9d2474e1cf3e581f2d13b85d395fdc3bfe065516b9a778773945e7d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Senior Hamas figure reported killed in air strike in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-strikes-kill-five-gaza-say-local-health-authorities-2026-01-15/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Two Israeli airstrikes killed five people in Deir al-Balah in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, local health authorities said, and Palestinian media reported that one of those killed was a senior figure in the armed wing of Hamas.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the incident. Palestinian media identified him as Mohammed Al-Holy, describing him as a local Hamas commander in Deir Al-Balah. The militant group did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

More than 400 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since a fragile ceasefire took effect in October.

Israel has razed buildings and ordered residents out of more than half of Gaza where its troops remain. Nearly all of the territory's more than 2 million people now live in makeshift homes or damaged buildings in a sliver of territory where Israeli troops have withdrawn and Hamas has reasserted control.

The United Nations children agency said on Tuesday that over 100 children have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire, including victims of drone and quadcopter attacks.

Israel and Hamas have traded blame for violations of the ceasefire and remain far apart from each other on key issues, despite the United States announcing the second phase of the ceasefire on Wednesday.

Israel launched its operations in Gaza in the wake of an attack by Hamas-led fighters on October, 2023 which killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 people, according to health authorities in the strip, and left much of Gaza in ruins.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:34:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four Arab states urged against US-Iran escalation, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/four-arab-states-urged-against-us-iran-escalation-official-says-2026-01-15/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Four Arab states conducted intense diplomacy with the United States and Iran this week to prevent a threatened U.S. attack on Iran over Tehran's use of force against protesters that they feared would have impacts across the region, a Gulf official said.

Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman and Egypt were involved in the diplomacy over 48 hours before U.S. President Donald Trump signalled on Thursday that he had ultimately decided against an attack for now, saying the killings in Iran were easing.

The four countries had conveyed to Washington that any attack would have consequences for the wider region in terms of both security and economics that would ultimately impact the United States itself, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter.

They told Iran that any retaliatory attack it launched on U.S. facilities in the Gulf would have consequences for Tehran's relations with other countries in the region, the official added.

Saudi Arabia's international media office, Qatar's Foreign Ministry, Oman's Information Ministry and Egypt's Foreign Ministry spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Foreign Ministry of the United Arab Emirates, which was not involved in the diplomacy described by the official, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether it had engaged in any diplomacy on the issue.

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman had lobbied Washington against an attack.

The official said that the diplomatic efforts had focused on toning down the rhetoric and avoiding any military action that could spark wider regional instability and that this diplomacy could ultimately lead to talks on the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme.

While Oman and Qatar had mediated in disputes between Iran and the West, U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Egypt have had far more fraught relations with the revolutionary Shi'ite Muslim power.

However, after decades of Iranian-Saudi rivalry that fuelled conflict and political disputes across the region, the two countries agreed a detente in 2023, with Riyadh keen to focus on its economic priorities.

Gulf states are fearful that U.S. military facilities in their countries could be caught in any Iranian retaliation to U.S. attacks, and that the energy facilities underpinning the regional economy could also end up being targeted.

Saudi Arabia and Qatar have enjoyed strong relationships with the Trump administration. Qatar and Egypt were both closely involved with the U.S. in mediation over the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:34:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PL24T6PHR5L4FDGSU5YHTH2RP4.jpg?auth=233e775da801fb358c88d67afc885f25d178f24f5935df7434fba26c858b6f22&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion causes large fire in Dutch town of Utrecht</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/explosion-causes-large-fire-dutch-town-utrecht-2026-01-15/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Several people were injured after a major blast caused a fire in the center of Utrecht, one of the Netherlands' largest cities, on Thursday afternoon.

Machado, who fled Venezuela in a daring seaborne escape in December, finds herself competing for Trump's ear with members of Venezuela's government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.

The lunch marks the first time the two have met in person.

After the U.S. captured Venezuela's longtime leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a snatch-and-grab operation this month, various opposition figures, members of Venezuela's diaspora and politicians throughout the U.S. and Latin America have expressed hope that Venezuela will begin the process of democratization.

But for now, Trump has said he is focused on economically rebuilding Venezuela and securing U.S. access to the country's oil. The day after the January 3 operation, he expressed doubts that Machado had the backing needed to return to the country and govern, telling reporters, "She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country."

Trump has on several occasions praised Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's interim president, telling Reuters in an interview on Wednesday , "She's been very good to deal with."

Machado was banned from running in Venezuela's 2024 presidential election by a top court stacked with government allies. Maduro claimed victory, but outside observers widely believe Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition figure backed by Machado, in fact won more votes by a substantial margin.

While the current government has freed dozens of political prisoners in recent days, outside groups and advocates have said the scale of the releases has been exaggerated by Caracas.

One potential topic of conversation for Thursday's White House meeting will be the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to Machado last month, a snub to Trump, who has long sought the award. Machado has suggested she would give the prize to the U.S. president for having deposed Maduro, though the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.

Asked if he wanted Machado to give him the prize, Trump told Reuters on Wednesday: "No, I didn't say that. She won the Nobel Peace Prize."

Pressed on what he would do if she brought the prize nonetheless, he responded: "Well, that's what I'm hearing. I don't know, but I shouldn't be the one to say."

"I think we're just going to talk," Trump told Reuters. "And I haven't met her. She's a very ‌nice woman. ‌I think we're just going to talk basics."

After her visit with Trump, Machado will meet with a bipartisan group of senior senators on Capitol Hill in the afternoon. The opposition leader has generally found more enthusiastic allies in Congress than in the White House, with some lawmakers having expressed concerns about Trump's dismissals of her ability to govern.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:35:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GACLZVKZ7ZNLHCBGVPNUH5J5QY.jpg?auth=8f9ffaece40f3a8107ddb708bdb554c4015a20f66d32433403db18d77bb16685&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion causes large fire in Dutch town of Utrecht</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/explosion-causes-large-fire-dutch-town-utrecht-2026-01-15/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Several people were injured after a major blast caused a fire in the center of Utrecht, one of the Netherlands' largest cities, on Thursday afternoon.

Local authorities told broadcaster NOS at least four people were injured, and that an emergency hospital had been set up in the area.

"The cause is still unknown... this happened in a building... at the moment we have four people injured," said Sjaak Haasnoot, a firefighters' spokesperson

The fire was still raging around 1730 GMT. It was unclear if there were still people inside the impacted building, as it was not safe for firemen to enter it.

"We are not sure whether there are still people trapped under the rubble, which is definitely there... the police are working hard on the investigation," said Utrecht's mayor Sharon Dijksma.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:39:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to meet Venezuelan opposition leader Machado after praising its government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-meet-venezuelan-opposition-leader-machado-after-praising-its-government-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado arrived at the White House for lunch with Donald Trump on Thursday, a meeting that could affect how the U.S. president seeks to shape the South American country's political future.

Machado, who fled Venezuela in a daring seaborne escape in December, finds herself competing for Trump's ear with members of Venezuela's government and seeking to ensure she has a role in governing the nation going forward.

The lunch marks the first time the two have met in person.

After the U.S. captured Venezuela's longtime leader, Nicolas Maduro, in a snatch-and-grab operation this month, various opposition figures, members of Venezuela's diaspora and politicians throughout the U.S. and Latin America have expressed hope that Venezuela will begin the process of democratization.

But for now, Trump has said he is focused on economically rebuilding Venezuela and securing U.S. access to the country's oil. The day after the January 3 operation, he expressed doubts that Machado had the backing needed to return to the country and govern, telling reporters, "She doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country."

Trump has on several occasions praised Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's interim president, telling Reuters in an interview on Wednesday , "She's been very good to deal with."

Machado was banned from running in Venezuela's 2024 presidential election by a top court stacked with government allies. Maduro claimed victory, but outside observers widely believe Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition figure backed by Machado, in fact won more votes by a substantial margin.

While the current government has freed dozens of political prisoners in recent days, outside groups and advocates have said the scale of the releases has been exaggerated by Caracas.

One potential topic of conversation for Thursday's White House meeting will be the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to Machado last month, a snub to Trump, who has long sought the award. Machado has suggested she would give the prize to the U.S. president for having deposed Maduro, though the Norwegian Nobel Institute has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.

Asked if he wanted Machado to give him the prize, Trump told Reuters on Wednesday: "No, I didn't say that. She won the Nobel Peace Prize."

Pressed on what he would do if she brought the prize nonetheless, he responded: "Well, that's what I'm hearing. I don't know, but I shouldn't be the one to say."

"I think we're just going to talk," Trump told Reuters. "And I haven't met her. She's a very ‌nice woman. ‌I think we're just going to talk basics."

After her visit with Trump, Machado will meet with a bipartisan group of senior senators on Capitol Hill in the afternoon. The opposition leader has generally found more enthusiastic allies in Congress than in the White House, with some lawmakers having expressed concerns about Trump's dismissals of her ability to govern.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 17:40:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XXIFT3YG2NJYXBGAHN2TJKLQKU.jpg?auth=09c9b4ef5d9de100570e7dec3d02b76afdd3ff9e5b39a2e3c9dbffbb9ebb77e8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Will the US use cyberwarfare to ‘help’ Iranian protesters?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260115-will-the-us-use-cyberwarfare-help-iranian-protesters</link><description>On January 13, in response to the bloody demonstrations that have gripped Iran since December of last year, US President Donald Trump signalled that the US would intervene. Without giving any specific information, Trump said that that "help is on its way".

Despite vague remarks from Trump that executions in Iran have stopped, protestors show no sign of halting and Tehran shows no sign of limiting its crackdown in any way. So far, 3,428 have died since unrest began just over two weeks ago, according to Iran Human Rights .

Analysts and experts have been trying to ascertain if that intervention would come as physical strikes in the country , or as something more subtle. Restricting internet access to protesters has been a key tactic used by Iranian authorities to curb dissent and limit information flowing in and out of the country.

Iranian demonstrators’ ability to get details of the protests out to the world have been given a stronger boost in recent days after SpaceX 's Starlink satellite internet service dropped its fees to allow more people to circumvent Tehran's attempts at preventing the outflow of crucial information. But it may not be enough. Analysts say that cyber operations may be a potential path forward for the US.

Shahin Modarres, a specialist on Iran at the International Team for the Study of Security Verona, says attacking Iranian authorities' internet presence could be a probable tactic for the US. “The preferred solution would be a limited, precise intervention on the headquarters of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards so that people in the streets can continue to mobilise," Modarres says. Strikes could, for example, be focussed on depots holding the weapons used against protestors.

Targeted strikes don’t yet seem to be on the cards in Washington, with the White House on Tuesday saying that diplomacy "remains the first option". Beyond diplomatic pressure, the United States has also acknowledged that it is exploring other avenues, including cyber warfare.

According to Shahin Modarres, Trump has two reasons to favour cyber tactics. The first is to make sure not to alienate his own voters: “The main body of the electorate of Trump belongs to MAGA, and MAGA has an isolationist foreign policy doctrine. They do not want another endless war and bombing in the Middle East ."

The second reason Trump may choose cyber tactics over physical strikes is to maintain diplomacy with other nations in the region. “The countries of the Persian Gulf region, such as Qatar , Bahrain , the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia , are strictly and firmly asking the United States not to intervene because the Islamic Republic has threatened them by saying, 'we will attack you.'" In such a situation, Modarres says, focussed cyber operations would be a viable compromise.

Gérôme Billois, a cybersecurity expert at French firm Wavestone, says that cyberespionage is also a key tactic. "It’s very likely that the United States has been listening to Iranian communication networks, and considering intruding on those systems.”

Billois adds that it’s very likely the US has discovered so-called “zero-day” vulnerabilities – software security flaws that are unknown to developers, and have not yet been patched. These flaws can only be exploited at strategic moments because once exploited, the existence of these security flaws is no longer secret. “The question is whether it’s worth using this opportunity to support the protesters,” Billois says.

Some experts believe that the protesting Iranian people may not benefit at all from US directed cybersecurity attacks. "These are offensive weapons whose purpose is to destroy, disrupt, or degrade computer systems. I don't see how this could significantly help the protesters," says Eugenio Lilli, director of the master's programme in American Politics and Foreign Policy at University College Dublin.

“Allowing the protesters access to the internet to mobilise, organise more gatherings and share information with the outside world is what will really help.”

Iranian authorities have cut off internet access in the country in recent days and are hunting down anyone attempting to connect using Elon Musk's Starlink terminals, which authorities have declared illegal.

Billois believes that the US could help by allowing protesters access to hi-tech communication terminals. "Communication terminals of near-military quality that are difficult to jam will make the task of the Iranian authorities even more difficult," he says. However, he adds that it seems unlikely that the US will flood the country with ultra-sophisticated equipment. "It would more likely be used by the leaders of these protest movements to coordinate their actions," he says – meaning that the US may strategically provide such technology to a few key individuals it has identified.

The key to overthrowing Iranian power may not be in giving internet access to the protestors, but in a more offensive cyberattack on Iran’s internal operations.  "If the United States manages to sabotage communications between law enforcement agencies, it would make their coordination much more complicated," Billois says.

Iran has experienced something similar in the past. In 2010, its nuclear facilities were targeted by Stuxnet, an attack attributed to a joint operation between the US and Israel . Israel is particularly renowned for its expertise in cyberwarfare, and Billois says Iran “had to protect its critical infrastructure".

"Iran is good at cyber offence, not at cyber defence,” says Modarres. “The critical infrastructure within the country is prone to threats and interventions. With regards to defence, they are not that developed.”

In the event the US decides to disrupt air defences, cyber operations could be crucial in disrupting strikes and gathering intel, Lilli says. After all, Trump had already stated that the US had used its cyber arsenal to render Venezuelan air defences ineffective. Cyberattacks are a part of modern warfare; it is likely that the US will use its resources in some capacity to create a space for itself in the ongoing uprising.

Led by the veteran Brexit campaigner, the anti-immigration Reform UK party is currently leading the polls in Britain, positioning itself as a genuine threat to Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party, and the Conservatives, who lost a 2024 election after 14 years in power.

Should Reform UK's popularity translate into victory in the next election, likely in 2029, it would upend a political system dominated by Labour and the Conservatives for a century.

Here is a list of some former Conservatives who have joined Reform UK in the last year.

A current member of parliament, Jenrick came second to Kemi Badenoch in the 2024 race to lead the Conservatives. He joined Reform on Thursday, hours after she fired him , saying he was plotting to defect.

Before he switched sides, he had been the Conservatives' justice spokesperson, using that position to build a personal profile on key issues like immigration and crime that many saw as a platform for a future challenge to Badenoch's leadership.

Jenrick, 44, is a qualified lawyer who held several ministerial positions in governments in the late 2010s and early 2020s, including as housing minister from 2019-2021.

Nadhim Zahawi is a former UK finance minister who joined Reform in January 2026, when he was no longer a sitting member of parliament.

His two-month stint as chancellor came during a chaotic period for the Conservatives, and he is best known publicly for driving British efforts to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine.

Zahawi, 58, co-founded the polling company YouGov. He was born in Iraq and came to Britain as a refugee when he was a child.

Danny Kruger, a current member of parliament, had been a leading Conservative figure until September 2025 when he defected to Reform UK, becoming the first sitting member to do so.

The 51-year-old is a former aide to prime ministers Boris Johnson and David Cameron and had served as welfare spokesperson for the Conservatives until he quit the party.

"This is my tragic conclusion: the Conservative Party is over, over as a national party, over as the principal opposition," he said at the time of his defection.

Nadine Dorries, 68, was culture minister for a year in 2021-2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister. A best-selling author, she stepped down as a member of parliament in 2023.

She defected to Reform UK in September 2025, when she wrote that her decision had been based on the feeling that "a sense of dread" was spreading across British communities.

"I believe that the only politician who has the answers, the knowledge and the will to deliver is Nigel Farage," she said at the time.

Jake Berry lost his parliamentary seat to Labour in 2024. He had served as chair of the Conservative party for a short period in 2022 and had previously been a junior minister in the governments of Theresa May and Boris Johnson.

The 47-year-old defected to Reform in July 2025.

"I've always believed that change comes with challenging the old order, in shaking up the system when it isn't working," he said at the time.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 18:40:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CWOKJ5XMGVN4TMC63IVZX2JVBQ.jpg?auth=385319cffb9790c45854cf2e8cf09871cd2a0eb962ab780a8ddf5f78143c3a8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's shifting political scene: defections to Nigel Farage's Reform</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-shifting-political-scene-defections-nigel-farages-reform-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 18:40:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Mexico says trade pact with US will survive despite Trump's skepticism</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-says-trade-pact-with-us-will-survive-despite-trumps-skepticism-2026-01-15/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Amid persistent doubts over the future of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact, Mexico's Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard insisted on Thursday that the agreement remains firmly intact and that the three countries will close a deal to extend it.

"We're already in the treaty review phase, and we have to finish by July 1; that's our deadline," Ebrard said during Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum's daily morning press conference. "We have made good progress on all the points that concern each of the parties."

Ebrard's comments were his first on the topic since U.S. President Donald Trump again cast doubt on the treaty's future earlier this week.

"There's no real advantage to it, it's irrelevant," Trump said on Tuesday, as he toured a Ford (F.N) , opens new tab factory in Dearborn, Michigan.

The trilateral trade agreement, known as USMCA, replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement in 2020 and is a backbone of Mexico's economy.

The treaty, which was negotiated during Trump's first term, requires the three countries to hold a joint review this year to extend the pact. If extended, the treaty will remain in place another 16 years. If not, it is subject to annual reviews.

Technically, July 1 is a key date in the treaty's review process, but many analysts expect negotiations to extend late into 2026 and said Trump will likely avoid extending the treaty before the U.S. midterm elections in November.

Trump's recent threats to pursue military action against cartels have also added a new layer of uncertainty to U.S.-Mexico relations.

"I think Ebrard is betting on a best-case scenario, but the window for a July successful review is closing fast," said Alexia Bautista, a former Mexican diplomat and lead Mexico analyst at the political risk consultancy firm Horizon Engage.

"Given recent events and statements, the risk is that Trump injects security into the process, turning the trade review into a far more political negotiation."

Pedro Casas, chief executive of the American Chamber of Commerce of Mexico, said he expects the U.S. will continue imposing tariffs on a wide spectrum of Mexican exports, regardless of the treaty's future.

The Trump administration has imposed sweeping 50% duties on steel and aluminum exports to the U.S., along with a 25% tariff on cars shipped from Mexico, even when those vehicles comply with the terms of the trade deal.

"I think the most likely scenario is a positive review process where we agree to extend the treaty for another 16 years, but steep tariffs still remain on Mexican exports that undermine the strength of the agreement," Casas said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 19:24:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UUJEIOCKFFJRXFZ6Q6VNIKG6CQ.jpg?auth=9811795244ccafabe91da1072818fc189d48bb72621fdeb55ec1c657c93b80c1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's assessment of support for Venezuela's Machado stands, White House says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trumps-assessment-support-venezuelas-machado-stands-white-house-says-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The White House on Thursday said President Trump made a "realistic assessment" of popular support for Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado and gave no updated timetable for when elections might be held in the South American country.

"Spoke with @ZelenskyyUa about the energy situation in Ukraine, with Russia's attacks causing terrible human suffering, as well as on the ongoing efforts to bring an end to the war." wrote Rutte on X on Thursday.

"We're committed to ensuring that Ukraine continues to get the crucial support needed to defend today and ultimately secure a lasting peace."

In his account of the conversation, Zelenskiy said he discussed the "serious challenges" posed by the latest Russian strikes and the need to bolster Ukraine's air defences.

Writing on Telegram, Zelenskiy said he hoped supplies sent to Ukraine through its European allies by means of the PURL (Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List) programme would increase in January.

Zelenskiy said "considerable progress" had been achieved in diplomatic efforts with the United States and Europe in resolving the nearly four-year-old war and pledged not to "ease up on pace".</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 19:46:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4QHVZYO6HFLPBI3QL2GLKQMSZY.jpg?auth=48bd27dd1caa45ec3ce15b822e6f660e3c4ac1a42ffcb10593bcf3e133a23ef9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: IMF's Georgieva expects to send Ukraine program for board approval in weeks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/imfs-georgieva-expects-send-ukraine-program-board-approval-weeks-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 20:27:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>South Africa's Kruger National Park shuts after severe floods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/south-africas-kruger-national-park-shuts-after-severe-floods-2026-01-15/</link><description>KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa, Jan 15 (Reuters) - South African authorities shut Kruger National Park on Thursday to day visitors, after several rivers that run through it burst their banks as the result of days of heavy rains, they said.

Tourists already staying at lodges inside the park were permitted to stay, apart from areas around the Letaba river that were evacuated, South African National Parks said.

Reuters TV footage showed vast areas of the park submerged by fast-flowing water, with treetops poking out of the floods and hippos swimming between them. Signs announced that roads were closed.

Flooding in southeastern Africa has become more frequent and severe as climate change makes storms in the adjacent Indian Ocean more powerful.

"This water's moving very fast," Kruger spokesperson Reynold Thakhuli told Reuters on the scene, next to a road that had been closed and was half submerged by running water, adding that authorities had shut the Phalaborwa gate, near Kruger airport.

"We’ll close it for 24 hours and monitor what is happening."

He added: "we're not really worried about the animals," because they tended to move to higher ground in such situations.

South African tourist Gerhard Ackerman sat on the veranda of his lodge, overlooking the floods with a drink in his hand.

"It's God's way of putting water back into the earth," he said. "We're enjoying it."</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 20:29:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2SF2TSI7ZIF3LLJNZD5EQVE2Q.jpg?auth=6a45ce990b2dd289dd69102bf867c933f9b5495111d3c9558b2eadd1fb544d10&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czech PM Babis' government wins confidence vote as policies on budget, Ukraine shift</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/czech-pm-babis-government-wins-confidence-vote-policies-budget-ukraine-shift-2026-01-15/</link><description>PRAGUE, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis' populist right-wing government won a parliamentary confidence vote on Thursday, taking power with an agenda of scaling back support for Ukraine, opposing EU environment policies and pausing the previous administration's austerity drive.

Babis, a self-described Trumpist allied with Hungary's Viktor Orban and the far-right in the European Parliament, won an election in October and his ANO party formed a ruling coalition with a pro-Russian far-right party and another right-wing party.

Controlling 108 of the lower house's 200 seats, ruling party lawmakers approved the government in a 108-91 vote, a constitutional step required after the administration took office last month.

Babis campaigned to raise wages and cut taxes, in contrast to a budget consolidation drive during the previous centre-right government's term. The fiscal gap fell comfortably below the European Union's 3% of economic output ceiling in that time.

Babis has also stressed more money is needed at home as he seeks to reduce support for Ukraine, which has fought a Russian invasion since 2022.

The Czech Republic joined Slovakia and Hungary in December to opt out of the financial costs of an EU loan to Ukraine, agreed at Babis' first EU summit since returning to power.

Babis, who also ruled from 2017-2021, has said the country will also stop contributing to a Prague-led programme sourcing ammunition supplies for Ukraine, although last week he said it could continue to coordinate the initiative, which runs mainly on donations from countries like Germany.

Babis had previously sought to scrap the programme, which he calls non-transparent, and his decision to leave it running angered his coalition partner, the far-right SPD party.

The previous government started the programme, which has become a key supply tool for Kyiv. It brings donors together with Czech defence officials and arms traders and producers who purchase ammunition around the world for Ukraine to reduce its disadvantage on the battlefield.

In foreign policy, opposition parties have pushed the government to join European countries supporting Greenland, which U.S. President Donald Trump has sought to take over from Denmark. Babis' government has said that dialogue on the issue is needed.

Another urgent task for the government will be approving a 2026 budget plan this month. The state has started 2026 with a provisional budget, which limits monthly spending to one twelfth of last year's expenditure.

Security Council on Thursday.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the unrest against clerical rule .

But on Thursday, Trump adopted a wait‑and‑see posture, saying he had been told that the killings were easing and that he believed there was no current plan for large-scale executions.

"President Trump is a man of action, not endless talk like we see at the United Nations. He has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter," Waltz told the Security Council meeting, which Washington had requested.

He dismissed allegations by Iran that the protests are "a foreign plot to give a precursor to military action."

"Everyone in the world needs to know that the regime is weaker than ever before, and therefore is putting forward this lie because of the power of the Iranian people in the streets. They are afraid. They're afraid of their own people," Waltz said.

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urges “maximum restraint at this sensitive moment and calls on all actors to refrain from any actions that could lead to further loss of life or ignite a wider regional escalation,” senior U.N. official Martha Pobee told the council.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 21:44:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D65YRQ2TKVKZJLNZ7S4JKPPX3A.jpg?auth=85972956a6f40bae8e07846b92e3ba538cbe7a309bd9c8cd7affad3f1c3bc37f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy affirms Ukraine's commitment to peace after Trump's remarks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-affirms-ukraines-commitment-peace-after-trumps-remarks-2026-01-15/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday that Ukraine is not an obstacle to peace, pushing back against comments made a day earlier by U.S. President Donald Trump.

"We also talked about diplomatic work with America – Ukraine has never been and will never be an obstacle to peace," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address, referring to a telephone conversation with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.

Trump, interviewed by Reuters on Wednesday, said he believed Ukraine was less ready than Russia to clinch a deal. Asked why U.S.-led negotiations had not yet resolved the nearly four-year-old war, Trump responded: "Zelenskiy."

In his comments, Zelenskiy said Russia's continued attacks on Ukrainian energy sites and other targets demonstrated that Moscow did not want peace.

"It is precisely Russian missiles, Russian 'Shaheds,' (drones) and Russia's attempt to destroy Ukraine that are clear evidence that Russia is not interested in agreements at all," he said.

In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia agreed with Trump that Zelenskiy was holding up a deal, saying President Vladimir Putin and the Russian side remain open to talks.

Zelenskiy pledged that Ukraine would pursue diplomatic efforts more actively.

Trump told Reuters on Wednesday that he believed Putin was "ready to make a deal. I think Ukraine is less ready to make a deal."

Trump and Zelenskiy have had an up-and-down relationship in dealing with efforts to resolve Europe's largest land conflict since World War Two.

Trump and U.S. Vice President JD Vance became engaged in a shouting match with Zelenskiy in the Oval Office in February 2025, suggesting the Ukrainian leader was not showing gratitude for U.S. assistance.

Their interactions appeared to improve in subsequent meetings.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 21:44:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/34EBXJ5SU5PIZDOXH5RW3SB74U.jpg?auth=f75e4658f3f77c7ea1f627ce213e5ad06f7bbef0e9e721de6663d5b637882cde&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's Rodriguez proposes oil reform to facilitate investment</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-rodriguez-proposes-oil-reform-facilitate-investment-2026-01-15/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - Venezuela's interim President Delcy Rodriguez said on Thursday that she was submitting a proposal to reform the country's hydrocarbon law, as investors in the U.S. push for easier access to the South American country's oil industry.

Rodriguez said the reforms would "allow these investment flows to be incorporated into new fields, fields where no investment has ever been made and into fields where there is no infrastructure."

Rodriguez said funds from oil would go to workers and public services.

The U.S. says around $500 million has already been generated from oil sales under a deal with Caracas and this is being held in U.S.-controlled bank accounts . An industry source familiar with the plan said the main account was located in Qatar.

Rodriguez, who was sworn in ten days ago after the U.S. ouster of her predecessor, spoke in an annual presidential address to lawmakers.

She took over the presidency on an interim basis after the U.S. military captured President Nicolas Maduro and flew him to the U.S. to stand trial on drug charges, which he denies.

Rodriguez also called for diplomacy with the U.S., marking a shift in historically tense rhetoric between the two countries, and said should she need to travel to Washington, she would do so "walking on her feet, not dragged there."

Rodriguez said she had a plan for 2026 and would "forge a new politics in Venezuela". She also praised many long-standing members of the country's government.

The address came shortly after opposition leader Maria Corina Machado met U.S. President Donald Trump in the White House, while the press secretary told reporters Trump liked what he saw with Rodriguez and considered her extremely cooperative.

Trump has not changed his view that Machado is not a realistic alternative for Venezuela, the press secretary said.

Machado, who briefly spoke to reporters after the meeting, said that the meeting had gone well and that she and her supporters could count on Trump.</description><pubDate>Thu, 15 Jan 2026 21:45:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4HV2AFG5QVKOTLUHQAUKOLQRSI.jpg?auth=9cb8a23b74e72ea1f9eddd8becb2464c255bdd3a9ff113663f4d0b0d79ca182f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Senate Democratic leader Schumer urges Trump to pull ICE agents out of cities</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-senate-democratic-leader-schumer-urges-trump-pull-ice-agents-out-cities-2026-01-15/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday told President Donald Trump in a meeting that Immigration and Customs Enforcement activities in cities were "terrorizing communities" and that ICE agents should be pulled out.

Yoon could receive a sentence of up to 10 years in jail if he is convicted on charges that include obstructing officials from executing an arrest warrant against him in January when he barricaded himself inside his residential compound and ordered the security service to block investigators.

He was finally arrested in a second attempt involving more than 3,000 police officers. His arrest was the first ever for a sitting president in South Korea.

Yoon, who is currently being held in the Seoul Detention Center, also faces allegations of falsifying official documents when he declared martial law in December 2024, claiming he planned to restore democratic order to the country that was under siege from the majority opposition and "anti-state" forces.

Separately, Yoon faces a number of other trials, including on a charge of masterminding insurrection. Prosecutors have asked the court to give him the death sentence on this charge, with a ruling scheduled for February.

Parliament, joined by some members of Yoon's conservative party, voted within hours to overturn his surprise martial law decree and later impeached him, suspending his powers.

He was removed from office in April last year by the Constitutional Court that ruled he violated the duties of his office.

While his bid to impose martial law lasted only about six hours, it sent shockwaves through South Korea, which is Asia's fourth-largest economy, a key U.S. security ally and long considered one of the world's most-resilient democracies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:49:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NZG5SVQZNVPHLFAYIF3LHDMXIU.jpg?auth=ae0153e3ce138ab8a66bb8e04bac0a140419de82f1a6a32505a0635bd43e4aed&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Power outage halts Tokyo commuter train lines, disrupting thousands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/power-outage-halts-tokyo-commuter-train-lines-disrupting-thousands-2026-01-16/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A railway power outage in Tokyo disrupted the morning commute for thousands on Friday as two main lines with some of the world's busiest stations were halted after reports of a fire.

Trains on East Japan Railway's (9020.T) , opens new tab Yamanote and Keihin-Tohoku lines were halted in all directions with no timetable for resumption, the railway said.

A fire was reported on the tracks near Tamachi Station, where both lines stop, shortly before 8 a.m. (2300 GMT on Thursday), public broadcaster NHK said. Flames were coming from a transformer in the track area, and the fire was nearly extinguished about 30 minutes later, NHK said.

Passengers were seen disembarking from a Keihin-Tohoku train stranded between stations and walking along the tracks to evacuate, assisted by firefighters and railway staff, in footage broadcast by the NTV network.

The Yamanote Line passes through stations including Shinjuku, which handles about 3.5 million passengers daily. The Keihin-Tohoku Line serves major hubs such as Tokyo and Yokohama.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:49:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he is backing 'newly appointed Palestinian Technocratic Government' in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-he-is-backing-newly-appointed-palestinian-technocratic-government-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:49:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Major fire breaks out in slum area of South Korea's Gangnam district</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/major-fire-breaks-out-slum-area-south-koreas-gangnam-district-yonhap-reports-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:49:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump's foreign policy called imperialist by experts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trumps-foreign-policy-called-imperialist-by-experts-2026-01-15/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:49:49 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump threatens Insurrection Act as protests spread in Minnesota</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260116-trump-insurrection-minnesota-protests</link><description>US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to invoke an emergency law that allows domestic deployment of the military, as protests roiled Minnesota after two incidents of federal agents firing their weapons, injuring a man Wednesday and killing a woman last week.

Protesters denounced the violence of Trump's broad-reaching immigration raids in rallies in the frigid northern city, which is a Democratic stronghold.

On his social media platform Trump repeated his threat to invoke the Insurrection Act, a 19th-century law for quelling insurrection that has not been used in more than 30 years.

"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don't obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of ICE, who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT," Trump posted on social media Thursday.

Trump has reacted angrily to protests and court decisions blocking his drive to deploy the National Guard as he presses an anti- immigration agenda that has drawn accusations of authoritarian overreach and periodic mass rallies with the mantra "No Kings."

Democratic Minnesota Governor Tim Walz accused federal agents of waging "a campaign of organized brutality against the people of Minnesota," in a video posted to X Wednesday night, noting a broad array of violent incidents, including "breaking windows, dragging pregnant women down the street," and the January 7 killing of 37-year-old Renee Good.

"We must protest loudly, urgently, but also peacefully," Walz said, calling on Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to "end this occupation, you've done enough."

Walz called on Minnesotans to record every interaction with ICE for future prosecution.

When Noem addressed reporters outside the White House Thursday, she declined to say if she thinks Trump should invoke the Insurrection Act, and didn't know if he would.

"It's his constitutional right, and it's up to him if he wants to utilize it to do it," Noem said.

Residents of Minneapolis were on edge Thursday after an immigration agent shot and injured a man Wednesday evening, marking the second time in a week an ICE agent had opened fire on someone in Minneapolis.

Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said the shooting late Wednesday resulted from a struggle between an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent and a man he was trying to apprehend.

"During the struggle, the federal agent discharged his weapon, striking one adult male," O'Hara told reporters at a press conference.

Amid the tussle, two people emerged from a nearby residence and attacked the federal agent with a snow shovel and a broom handle, the Department of Homeland Security said, identifying the wounded man as an illegal immigrant from Venezuela.

The man suffered a non-life-threatening gunshot wound to his leg and was transported to a hospital for treatment, while the two others were taken into custody, officials said.

"No matter what led up to this incident, the situation we're seeing in our city is not sustainable," Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said in an X post.

The Insurrection Act was last invoked in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush at the request of the Republican governor of California, who was facing unprecedented riots in Los Angeles following the acquittal of police officers who had beaten Rodney King, a Black motorist, the previous year.

Senior White House official Stephen Miller on Thursday accused Minnesota officials of "deliberately, willfully and purposefully" inciting a "violent insurrection."

White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt also lashed out at journalists, saying "media is absolutely complicit in this violence."

But concerns about the tactics used by ICE are not limited to incidents of violent street enforcement.

In 2025, ICE broke its record for people dying in detention with 30 deaths, according to data released by the agency.

On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that the death of 55-year-old Cuban immigrant Lunas Campos in detention, will likely be declared a homicide, with "the preliminary cause of death as asphyxia due to neck and chest compression."

The deaths and the incidence of violence have raised questions about inadequate training and oversight of ICE agents.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:49:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2cb1d6b4-f239-11f0-9481-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-15T155848Z-674912169-RC2G1JARHXZS-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Gaza ‘board of peace’ formed, members to be named 'shortly'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260116-trump-board-of-peace-gaza</link><description>US President Donald Trump on Thursday announced the formation of a Gaza "board of peace," a key phase two element of a US-backed plan to end the war in the Palestinian territory.

"It is my Great Honor to announce that THE BOARD OF PEACE has been formed," Trump posted on his Truth Social platform, adding that the members of the body will be announced "shortly."

"I can say with certainty that it is the Greatest and Most Prestigious Board ever assembled at any time, any place," Trump said.

The board's creation comes shortly after the announcement of a 15-member Palestinian technocratic committee, charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza.

The committee will work under the supervision of the board of peace, which Trump is expected to chair.

The plan also calls for the deployment of an International Stabilisation Force to help secure Gaza and train vetted Palestinian police units.

"The ball is now in the court of the mediators, the American guarantor and the international community to empower the committee," Bassem Naim, a senior Hamas leader, said in a statement on Thursday.

The US-backed Gaza peace plan first came into force on October 10, facilitating the return of all the hostages held by Hamas and an end to the fighting in the besieged territory.

The plan's second phase is now underway, though clouded by unresolved issues.

Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry has said Israeli forces have killed 451 people since the ceasefire ostensibly took effect.

For Palestinians, the central issue remains Israel's full military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip -- a step included in the plan's framework but for which no detailed timetable has been announced.

Hamas, meanwhile, has refused to publicly commit to a full disarmament, a non-negotiable demand from Israel.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:49:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/90c1af42-f25e-11f0-aacc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26015064356266.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US court ruling puts pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil back at risk of detention</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260116-us-court-pro-palestinian-activist-mahmoud-khalil-detention</link><description>A federal appeals panel on Thursday reversed a lower court decision that released former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil from an immigration jail, bringing the government one step closer to detaining and ultimately deporting the Palestinian activist.

The three-judge panel of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals didn’t decide the key issue in Khalil’s case: whether the Trump administration’s effort to throw Khalil out of the US over his campus activism and criticism of Israel is unconstitutional.

But in its 2-1 decision, the panel ruled a federal judge in New Jersey didn’t have jurisdiction to decide the matter at this time. Federal law requires the case to fully move through the immigration courts first, before Khalil can challenge the decision, they wrote.

“That scheme ensures that petitioners get just one bite at the apple — not zero or two,” the panel wrote. “But it also means that some petitioners, like Khalil, will have to wait to seek relief for allegedly unlawful government conduct.”

Thursday’s decision marked a major win for the Trump administration’s sweeping campaign to detain and deport noncitizens who joined protests against Israel.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security Department spokesperson, called the ruling “a vindication of the rule of law.”

In a statement, she said the department will “work to enforce his lawful removal order” and encouraged Khalil to “self-deport now before he is arrested, deported, and never given a chance to return.”

It was not immediately clear whether the government would seek to detain Khalil, a legal permanent resident, again while his legal challenges continue.

In a statement distributed by the American Civil Liberties Union, Khalil called the appeals ruling “deeply disappointing."

“The door may have been opened for potential re-detainment down the line, but it has not closed our commitment to Palestine and to justice and accountability," he said. "I will continue to fight, through every legal avenue and with every ounce of determination, until my rights, and the rights of others like me, are fully protected.”

Baher Azmy, one of Khalil's lawyers, with the Center for Constitutional Rights, said the ruling was “contrary to rulings of other federal courts."

“Our legal options are by no means concluded, and we will fight with every available avenue,” he said.

The ACLU said the Trump administration cannot lawfully re-detain Khalil until the order takes formal effect, which won't happen while he can still immediately appeal.

Khalil’s lawyers can request that the panel's decision be set aside and the matter reconsidered by a larger group of judges on the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, or they can go to the US Supreme Court.

An outspoken leader of the pro-Palestinian movement at Columbia, Khalil was arrested last March. He then spent three months detained in a Louisiana immigration jail, missing the birth of his first child.

Federal officials have accused Khalil of leading activities “aligned to Hamas,” though they have not presented evidence to support the claim and have not accused him of criminal conduct. They also accused Khalil, 31, of failing to disclose information on his green card application.

The government justified the arrest under a seldom-used statute that allows for the expulsion of noncitizens whose beliefs are deemed to pose a threat to US foreign policy interests.

In June, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled that justification would likely be declared unconstitutional and ordered Khalil released.

President Donald Trump's administration appealed that ruling, arguing the deportation decision should fall to an immigration judge, rather than a federal court.

Khalil has dismissed the allegations as “baseless and ridiculous,” framing his arrest and detention as a “direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech as I advocated for a free Palestine and an end to the genocide in Gaza.”

New York City’s new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, said on social media Thursday that Khalil should remain free.

“Last year’s arrest of Mahmoud Khalil was more than just a chilling act of political repression, it was an attack on all of our constitutional rights,” Mamdani wrote on X. “Now, as the crackdown on pro-Palestinian free speech continues, Mahmoud is being threatened with rearrest. Mahmoud is free — and must remain free.”

Judge Arianna Freeman dissented Thursday, writing that her colleagues were holding Khalil to the wrong legal standard. Khalil, she wrote, is raising “now-or-never claims” that can be handled at the district court level, even though his immigration case isn't complete.

Both judges who ruled against Khalil, Thomas Hardiman and Stephanos Bibas, were Republican appointees. President George W. Bush appointed Hardiman to the 3rd Circuit, while Trump appointed Bibas. President Joe Biden, a Democrat, appointed Freeman.

The two-judge majority rejected Freeman's worry that their decision would leave Khalil with no remedy for unconstitutional immigration detention, even if he later can appeal.

“But our legal system routinely forces petitioners — even those with meritorious claims — to wait to raise their arguments," the judges wrote.

The decision comes as an appeals board in the immigration court system weighs a previous order that found Khalil could be deported to Algeria, where he maintains citizenship through a distant relative, or Syria, where he was born in a refugee camp to a Palestinian family.

His attorneys have said he faces mortal danger if forced to return to either country.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 01:49:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e3d536fe-f23b-11f0-be82-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/8aca6cc9dbb309d3366a01f7570ea42fadc668a1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US approves possible sale of equipment, services to shift Peruvian naval base</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-approves-possible-sale-equipment-services-shift-peruvian-naval-base-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale to Peru of $1.5 billion in equipment and services to support the country's efforts to shift its main naval base in the city of Callao, the Pentagon said in a statement on Thursday, so it can expand a neighboring seaport.

The Peruvian government plans to relocate its naval base at Callao, on the coast just west of the capital Lima, a few kilometers away.

This move will allow for the expansion of Peru's main commercial port in Callao, which is a competitor to the Chinese-built Chancay mega-port located 80 km (50 miles) north of Lima.

In a statement regarding the proposal, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said the "proposed sale will contribute to the foreign policy objectives of the United States by helping to improve the security of an important partner that promotes political stability, peace, and economic progress in South America."

The agency confirmed that it had issued the necessary proposal to inform Congress about this potential sale.

The principal contractors will be chosen at a later date from a list of approved vendors, likely through a competitive process, the Pentagon said.

The port in Callao is Peru's main commercial terminal and is currently operated separately by Dutch port operator APM Terminals on the north side and DP World Callao on the south.

The Callao port in November began offering new direct shipping routes from China and South Korea. Analysts have said Callao is likely to compete with the Chancay mega-port for Asian cargo as infrastructure investments accelerate along Peru's Pacific coast.

The port in Chancay, built by Chinese company Cosco Shipping Ports, began operations in November 2024. The port accommodates large vessels and offers direct voyages between South America and Asia.

China is Peru's primary trading partner.

The 70-year-old former leader was sentenced to 27 years in prison last year for his attempts to cling to power following his narrow 2022 re-election loss to Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva .

Bolsonaro's family has repeatedly complained on podcasts and social media about the conditions in which he was previously being held in a room at police headquarters, including excessive noise from an air conditioner, inadequate space and the food.

Supreme Court judge Alexandre de Moraes criticised a bid to "delegitimise the regular and legal fulfillment of the prison sentence."

He elaborated for several pages in his ruling on the dire conditions facing inmates in Brazil 's overcrowded prisons, highlighting the already "exclusive conditions" under which Bolsonaro is serving his sentence.

He criticised the complaints as apparent demands for Bolsonaro's jail time to be converted to "a hotel stay or a holiday resort."

Bolsonaro had been detained in a 12-square-meter (129.1-square-foot) room with a television, fridge and air-conditioning at police headquarters in Brasilia.

He was on Thursday transferred to the Papuda Penitentiary Complex, also in the capital, where he will be held in a special detention unit five times the size of his current room, with a kitchen, private outdoor area and a double bed, according to the court.

Moraes said Bolsonaro was being held "with complete isolation from the other prisoners in the complex."

One of the former president's sons, Carlos Bolsonaro, accused Moraes of "cruelty" and slammed "the transfer to a harsh prison environment", on the X social network.

Bolsonaro's lawyers have appealed, in vain, for him to be permitted house arrest, on health grounds.

His latest request, filed this week, is pending a medical evaluation.

Bolsonaro had been under house arrest before the official start of his sentence, however was moved to prison after he took a soldering iron to his ankle monitoring bracelet in what the court saw as an escape attempt.

The former army captain, who has suffered serious health complications related to a 2018 stabbing on the campaign trail, spent a week in hospital in December following surgery for a groin hernia and treatment for recurring hiccups.

Earlier this month he underwent tests after a fall in prison, but no serious injury was revealed.

Brazil's Congress late last year passed a law which could dramatically reduce Bolsonaro's sentence.

Lula vetoed the legislation on January 8, but lawmakers will have the final say, as Congress has the right to override his veto.

The 80-year-old president is seeking a fourth term in office in October elections.

Bolsonaro has anointed his eldest son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, as his political heir and presidential candidate.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 03:43:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ecb4a5ca-ebe2-11f0-9d6d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/9d8264ccfac8137ec58159f9649f9f825b260686.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US tells Mexico incremental progress on border security 'unacceptable'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-tells-mexico-incremental-progress-border-security-unacceptable-2026-01-16/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente and his U.S. counterpart, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, spoke on Thursday about security and "reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Mexico partnership," both governments said in a joint statement.

In a post on social media website X about the call, the State Department's Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs added that "the United States made clear that incremental progress in facing border security challenges is unacceptable."

Carney lauded a "new strategic partnership" between the two countries after he arrived for the talks at the Great Hall of the People.

Following President Donald Trump's aggressive tariffs on Canadian products, Carney has sought to reduce his country's economic reliance on its main market, the United States.

Carney told Xi that "together, we can build the best of what this relationship has been in the past to create a new one".

"Agriculture, energy, finance, that's where we can make the most immediate progress," he added.

Xi welcomed Carney and his delegation, saying that China-Canada relations were at a turning point after their last meeting at an APAC summit in October.

"It can be said that our meeting last year opened a new chapter in turning China-Canada relations toward improvement," Xi told Carney.

"The healthy and stable development of China-Canada relations serves the common interests of our two countries," he said, adding he was "glad" to see discussions over the last few months to restore cooperation.

Officials from both countries have been in talks to lower tariffs, but an agreement has yet to be reached.

Carney, who on Thursday met with Premier Li Qiang, is also scheduled to hold talks with business leaders to discuss trade.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 04:43:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/acb7f28c-ef62-11f0-b24c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/9a64ab45e7607717f0a95c046feee45c67d26daa.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: White House says Iran halted 800 executions, warns all options remain on table</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260116-live-the-white-house-says-iran-has-suspended-800-executions</link><description>The United States stands by the “brave people of Iran ,” and President Donald Trump "has made it clear all options are on the table to stop the slaughter," US Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz told ​the UN Security Council on Thursday.

Recent reports by the Defence Ministry and by health providers have detailed the military's mental health crisis, which comes as fighting persists in Gaza and Lebanon and as tensions flare with Iran .

The Gaza war quickly expanded with cross-border fire between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah, and saw hundreds of thousands of soldiers and reservists deployed across both fronts in some of the heaviest fighting in the country's history.

Israeli forces have killed more than 71,000 Palestinians in Gaza and 4,400 in southern Lebanon, according to Gazan and Lebanese officials, and Israel says more than 1,100 service members have been killed since October 7.

The war has left much of Gaza destroyed and its 2 million people overwhelmingly lack proper shelter, food or access to medical and health services.

Palestinian mental health specialists have said Gazans are suffering "a volcano" of psychological trauma , with large numbers now seeking treatment, and children suffering symptoms such as night terrors and an inability to focus.

Israeli studies show the war has taken its toll on the mental health of soldiers carrying out Israel's stated war aims of eliminating Hamas in Gaza, retrieving hostages there and disarming Hezbollah.

Some soldiers who came under attack when their military bases were invaded by Hamas on October 7 are also struggling.

Israel's Defence Ministry says it has recorded a nearly 40% increase in PTSD cases amongst its soldiers since September 2023, and predicts the figure will increase by 180% by 2028. Of the 22,300 troops or personnel being treated for war wounds, 60% suffer from post-trauma, the ministry says.

It has expanded the health care provided to those dealing with mental health issues, expanded the budget, and said there was an increase of about 50% in the use of alternative treatments.

The country's second-largest healthcare provider, Maccabi, said in its 2025 annual report that 39% of Israeli military personnel under its treatment had sought mental health support while 26% had voiced concerns about depression.

Several Israeli organizations like NGO HaGal Sheli, which uses surfing as a therapy technique, have taken on hundreds of soldiers and reservists suffering from PTSD. Some former soldiers have therapy dogs.

Ronen Sidi, a clinical psychologist who directs combat veteran research at Emek Medical Center in northern Israel, said soldiers were generally grappling with two different sources of trauma.

One source was related to "deep experiences of fear" and "being afraid to die" while deployed in Gaza and Lebanon and even while at home in Israel. Many witnessed the Hamas assault on southern Israel - in which the militants also took around 250 hostages back into Gaza - and its aftermath firsthand.

Sidi said the second source is from moral injury, or the damage done to a person's conscience or moral compass from something they did.

"A lot of (soldiers') split-second decisions are good decisions," which they take under fire, "but some of them are not, and then women and children are injured and killed by accident, and living with the feeling that you have killed innocent people... is a very difficult feeling and you can't correct what you have done," he said.

One reservist, Paul, a 28-year-old father of three, said he had to leave his job as a project manager with a global firm because "the whistles of the bullets" above his head lingered with him even after returning home.

Paul, who declined to give his last name over privacy concerns, said he deployed in combat roles in Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Although fighting has abated in recent months, he says he lives in a constant state of alert.

"I live that way every day," Paul said.

A soldier seeking state support for their mental health must appear before a defence ministry assessment committee which determines the severity of their case and grants them official recognition. That process can take months and can deter soldiers from seeking help, some trauma professionals say.

Israel's Defence Ministry says it provides some immediate help to soldiers once they start the evaluation process and has increased this effort since the war began.

An Israeli parliamentary committee found in October that 279 soldiers had attempted suicide in the period from January 2024 to July 2025, a sharp increase from previous years. The report found that combat soldiers comprised 78% of all suicide cases in Israel in 2024.

The risk of suicide or self-harm increases if trauma is untreated, said Sidi, the clinical psychologist.

"After October 7 and the war, the mental health institutions in Israel are overwhelmed completely, and a lot of people either can't get therapy or don't even understand the distress that they are feeling has to do with what they have experienced."

For soldiers, the chance of seeing combat remains high. Israel's military remains deployed in over half of Gaza and fighting has persisted there despite a U.S.-backed truce in October, with more than 440 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers killed.

Its troops still occupy parts of southern Lebanon, as the Lebanese army presses on with disarming Hezbollah under a separate U.S.-brokered deal. In Syria, Israeli troops have occupied an expanded section of the country's south since the ouster of former leader Bashar al-Assad.

As tensions flare with Iran and the U.S. threatens to intervene, Israel could also find itself in another violent confrontation with Tehran, after last June's 12-day war.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:25:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q4MK4ZHC7RIZ5CQ5ZIMVKAAYXM.jpg?auth=ef4e4fc345d1f50cdc02d594855c3e10743b68a8b257c9a0060705a2d9edc4d1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda's President Museveni takes strong lead in early election results</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ugandas-president-museveni-takes-strong-lead-early-election-results-2026-01-16/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Uganda's President Yoweri Museveni has a strong lead in this week's election, early results released by the election commission on Friday showed.

Then it forced them home</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ghana-took-trumps-deported-west-africans-then-it-forced-them-home-2026-01-16/</link><description>DAKAR/ACCRA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - After U.S. immigration agents detained Rabbiatu Kuyateh in July, she applied for protection from being deported to her native Sierra Leone, saying she feared being tortured because of her father's ties to the political opposition.

An immigration judge granted her request. But on November 5, she was deported to Ghana, another West African country. There, she said, she was detained at a hotel for six days before being forcibly returned to her home country.

Video posted on social media at the time, verified by Kuyateh's family, shows men in green and black uniforms dragging her across the hotel floor to a waiting van. "I'm not going!" she screams.

The video made headlines, putting Ghana in the middle of a heated debate over U.S. President Donald Trump's use of so-called third-country removals to hasten the departure of unauthorised immigrants who cannot easily be sent to their home countries - part of a vast crackdown that aims to deport millions.

Kuyateh, 58, was one of more than 30 third-country nationals deported by the United States to Ghana last year, according to lawyers in both countries who filed lawsuits on their behalf.

Of those, at least 22 were sent by Ghana to their home countries despite having obtained court-ordered protection in the U.S. meant to prevent this from happening, according to a Reuters tally based on interviews with six lawyers, legal filings in both countries and complaints filed with the U.N. human rights office in Geneva.

The lawyers said Ghana's repatriations appeared systematic and that none of their clients had opportunities to raise legal objections before being sent home.

Reuters also found that Equatorial Guinea, an oil-rich Central African country, sent home at least three U.S. deportees who had protection against this in the United States, according to interviews with one of the migrants and two lawyers. These repatriations have not previously been reported.

Migrant advocates and human rights groups say the Trump administration uses third-country removals to get around U.S. and international laws that prohibit returning people to countries where they face persecution or torture, a practice known as “refoulement”.

"If Ghana and Equatorial Guinea do not afford a meaningful opportunity to challenge repatriation, they are not safe third countries, and the United States should not be deporting individuals there," said Elora Mukherjee, who directs the Immigrants' Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School in New York. "Third countries cannot be used to circumvent the prohibition on refoulement."

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), said all those sent to Ghana and Equatorial Guinea were "illegal aliens" who received due process and had final removal orders.

"We are applying the law as written. If a judge finds an illegal alien has no right to be in this country, we are going to remove them," she said in a statement to Reuters.

McLaughlin did not address questions about the subsequent repatriations, saying, "Once an illegal alien is in another country's custody, we refer you to them for questions."

Neither did the U.S. State Department, which said the administration was "unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America’s border security".

Ghana's foreign ministry, interior ministry and immigration service did not respond to questions about the handling of U.S. deportees. Neither did the governments of Sierra Leone and Equatorial Guinea.

Ghana's interior ministry announced on November 12 that it was opening an investigation into Kuyateh's treatment by officials from the national immigration service. The results of that investigation have not been made public.

Reuters journalists met with Kuyateh after she fled Sierra Leone in November for another West African country, which she asked not be identified, citing safety reasons.

She said she was struggling to cope with her new circumstances, including being forced to spend holidays away from her adult son and aging parents, all U.S. citizens.

"I consider America as my second home," she said. "My whole family is there."

Kuyateh had been living in Maryland for nearly 30 years when Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents detained her at a routine check-in.

She said she moved to the U.S. to escape a 1991-2002 civil war. But her asylum application was denied when she missed a hearing, and a removal order was issued for overstaying a visa, according to her lawyer, Hannah Bridges.

In her application for protection against being sent to Sierra Leone, Kuyateh said government forces there detained and raped her during the war. More recently, her brother was detained and tortured during a 2014 visit due to their father's political activities, she stated in the document, seen by Reuters.

The news agency could not independently verify her account. The judge in the case granted her a form of relief known as "withholding of removal", which bars U.S. immigration authorities from sending a person to a country where they more likely than not face serious harm.

Bridges disputed that Kuyateh received due process before she was deported to Ghana instead, saying ICE did not inform her client where she was being sent until she was boarding a flight to Accra.

ICE did not respond to requests for comment.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June that the administration can send migrants to countries other than their own without offering them a chance to show the harms they might face, while a legal challenge proceeds before a lower court in Boston.

At least six African nations have agreed to take in third-country deportees. Few details have been released about the arrangements, though the U.S. has in some cases been willing to make large payments to the countries.

Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, raised concerns in November about a $7.5 million payment to Equatorial Guinea, which she said in a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio has one of the most corrupt governments in the world.

Ghana's government has said it will only take West Africans who do not have criminal records.

"As and when they come, they are processed and sent to their countries of origin," presidential spokesperson Felix Kwakye Ofosu said at a news conference on Wednesday.

Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa told reporters in September that Ghana would not receive financial compensation, saying its decision to receive migrants was grounded in humanitarian principles.

However, he later told a local television station that American officials had raised the possibility of concessions on visas and tariffs in exchange for help with "immigration challenges".

The foreign ministry announced in September that the U.S. would be easing visa restrictions on its citizens imposed in July. On December 1, Ablakwa posted on X that Washington had lifted a 15% tariff on cocoa and other agricultural products.

Reuters could not establish if the changes were related to Ghana's immigration cooperation.

The State Department said it had "no comment on the details of our diplomatic communications with other governments".

Meredyth Yoon, litigation director at the Atlanta branch of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and Oliver Barker-Vormawor, a Ghanaian lawyer, told Reuters they had confirmed two deportation flights to Ghana. One left the U.S. on September 5 carrying 14 third-country nationals, and another left on November 5 carrying 19, they said, adding they were seeking information about three other flights.

Those subsequently repatriated include citizens of Gambia, Guinea, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo, their lawyers said.

At least 10 were granted U.S. protection because their political views put them at risk in their home countries, they said. Three others who identify as gay or bisexual were deemed at risk because they come from countries that criminalise same-sex relations, while four told U.S. judges they feared being subjected to female genital mutilation.

Two women from Togo were driven over the border on motorbikes and dropped off in Togolese territory, circumventing formal crossings, three of the lawyers said. Ghana also sent migrants to Togo from countries including Nigeria and Liberia, according to the lawyers, who filed a lawsuit in Accra challenging the constitutionality of the government's agreement with the U.S.

Reuters could not independently verify the lawyers' account. The governments involved did not respond to requests for comment.

A Washington-based federal judge, Tanya Chutkan, criticised the arrangement with Ghana, saying at a hearing in September that it appeared the Trump administration crafted the deal as a way " to make an end run " around legal requirements that it refrain from sending migrants into danger in their home countries. However, Chutkan said she lacked jurisdiction to take up a lawsuit filed on behalf of five deportees who feared they could be repatriated.

In a declaration to the court, the State Department said it had "received diplomatic assurances" from Ghana that the plaintiffs would not be sent to countries where they feared persecution or torture.

The State Department did not respond to a question from Reuters about whether steps have been taken to ensure Ghana and Equatorial Guinea do not send more deportees to countries where they are at risk.

McLaughlin, from DHS, said many of those sent to Ghana were "heinous criminals with rap sheets that included injury to a child, robbery, aggravated assault and fraud."

Yoon, who has represented six of them, said "a few" had convictions, but "most had no criminal record whatsoever."

Diadie Camara told Reuters he was detained at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2024 after escaping hereditary slavery in Mauritania, a common practice in his North African homeland. His asylum application was rejected in March, but a U.S. immigration judge granted him protection from being sent to Mauritania, according to a copy of the decision seen by Reuters.

On November 24, the U.S. flew Camara, 27, and eight other migrants from countries including Angola, Eritrea, Georgia and Ghana to Equatorial Guinea, according to two lawyers and a human rights activist who spoke with some of them.

The group was detained at a Malabo hotel while local authorities arranged their repatriation, according to Camara and another migrant interviewed by Reuters who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Both asked if they could seek asylum in Equatorial Guinea but said government officials told them this was not possible.

On December 25, Camara and another Mauritanian national were flown home via Morocco, he said.

"I am now in hiding, and I don't know what to do," Camara said by phone, adding he was terrified he might be found by the family that enslaved him and punished for his escape.

The governments of Equatorial Guinea and Mauritania did not respond to requests for comment.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:26:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Magnitude 4.9 earthquake strikes Guerrero, Mexico, GFZ says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/magnitude-49-earthquake-strikes-guerrero-mexico-gfz-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - A magnitude 4.9 earthquake struck Guerrero, Mexico, on Friday, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) said.

The verdict is the first against Yoon in the eight criminal trials over the decree he issued in late 2024 and other allegations.

The most significant charge against him alleges that he led a rebellion in connection with his martial law enforcement and it carries a potential death penalty.

The Seoul Central District Court in the case decided Friday sentenced him for other charges like his defiance of authorities’ attempts to detain him.

Yoon has not yet publicly responded to the ruling. But when an independent counsel earlier demanded a 10-year prison term for Yoon over those charges, Yoon’s defence team accused them of being politically driven and lacking legal grounds to demand such “an excessive” sentence.

Yoon has been impeached, arrested and dismissed as president after his short-lived imposition of martial law in December 2024 triggered huge public protests calling for his ouster.

Yoon maintains he did not intend to place the country under military rule for an extended period, saying his decree was only meant to inform the people about the danger of the liberal-controlled parliament which obstructed his agenda. But investigators have viewed Yoon’s decree as an attempt to bolster and prolong his rule, charging him with rebellion, abuse of power and other criminal offenses.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:27:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8f5b890a-f26a-11f0-82fc-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/1e73b3ea3a03dc420fa606aa31db7e736067b293.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top Australia arts festival apologises for barring Palestinian writer</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/top-australia-arts-festival-apologises-barring-palestinian-writer-2026-01-16/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A major Australian arts festival has apologised to a Palestinian Australian writer after disinviting her over her remarks about Israel, sparking a controversy that forced the cancellation of this year's Adelaide Writers' Week.

The Adelaide Festival Board on Thursday retracted the decision to bar academic and novelist Randa Abdel-Fattah, inviting her back for next year's event and apologising to her , opens new tab "unreservedly for the harm the Adelaide Festival Corporation has caused her".

The board on Tuesday cancelled the writers' week, a premier Australian literary event and part of the Adelaide Festival, after 180 international and Australian authors boycotted it over Abdel-Fattah's ban. The writers' week director, the Jewish daughter of Holocaust survivors, said she could not be party to silencing a Palestinian author.

The festival's original board resigned in response to the backlash.

"Intellectual and artistic freedom is a powerful human right. Our goal is to uphold it, and in this instance Adelaide Festival Corporation fell well short," the new board said in a statement.

Abdel-Fattah accepted the apology , opens new tab "as acknowledgement of our right to speak publicly and truthfully about the atrocities that have been committed against the Palestinian people", but said in a post on X that "it is not a quick fix to repair the damage and injury inflicted."

She said she would consider the invitation to the 2027 event in the state of South Australia.

After Abdel-Fattah accepted the apology, the British band Pulp said they would perform at the Adelaide Festival, reversing their boycott.

Last week, the festival board said it had disinvited Abdel-Fattah from the writers' week because, "given her past statements", it would not be culturally sensitive to include her in the event "so soon after Bondi", a reference to last month's shooting rampage on a Jewish event that killed 15.

The board did not cite any specific statement made by Abdel-Fattah that led to her being disinvited. It said it did not suggest any of her writings have any connection with the Bondi Beach shootings.

Abdel-Fattah's past comments about Israel have been criticised by some Jewish and pro-Israel groups, and the Jewish Community Council of South Australia had lobbied against her participation at the Adelaide festival.

In March 2024 she posted on X: "Armed struggle is a moral and legal right of the colonised and brutalised... Western governments which use the blood of Palestinians as the ink to write international law have zero authority to define genocide, terrorist, self-defence, resistance, proportionality."

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday announced a national day of mourning would be held on January 22 to remember those killed in the December 14 shooting at a Hanukkah celebration on Bondi Beach.

The authorities have called the shooting an act of "terror", and the police allege that the father and son suspects were inspired by the Islamic State militant group. The incident sparked nationwide calls to tackle antisemitism and prompted state and federal government moves to tighten hate speech laws, which have spurred a debate on freedom of speech.

Among the participants who had pulled out of the festival after Abdel-Fattah was disinvited were former New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, British author Zadie Smith, Australian author Kathy Lette, Pulitzer Prize-winning American Percival Everett and former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis, Australian media reported.

Pulp said in a statement its management had told festival organisers last week the band would withdraw from the arts festival in support of the boycott.

"It is our understanding that the festival programmers are now acting in good faith. The festival board that made this dreadful decision have been replaced, and a full apology has been accepted by Randa Abdel-Fattah, who has been invited to appear next year," the band said.

It said it would perform in a concert on February 27.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:45:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia freezes army and police procurement decisions linked to corruption, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-freezes-army-police-procurement-decisions-linked-corruption-pm-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The procurement decisions of the Malaysian armed forces and the police linked to a corruption probed will be temporarily frozen until they fully comply with related rules, state media reported, citing Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.

The suspension comes following allegations of bribery linked to army procurement projects, with the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) raiding several firms suspected of involvement in a bribery scheme and freezing six bank accounts belonging to a suspect and their family members.

A former army chief and four others were detained on January 8 in connection with the alleged bribery. Local media reported that the former army chief was released from remand on Monday.

Former army chief Muhammad Hafizuddeain Jantan has been placed on leave since late December pending an investigation into the matter.

According to Bernama, Anwar said the government, through relevant ministries, will review and reorganise all procurement to ensure transparency in the existing system.

"We will take note and await reports of any loopholes or weaknesses in the procurement system, so that we can review and restructure it to ensure full compliance," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:45:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VNY4BSDHUFKF5N6ZATEPJMAEQQ.jpg?auth=1daad589a532da6e7e0e879e0cfbe6f52387cab977e7f9ededa88befdfe761f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy updates Arctic stance as Greenland tensions escalate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-updates-arctic-stance-greenland-tensions-escalate-2026-01-16/</link><description>ROME, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Arctic has become a theatre of intensifying strategic rivalry, an Italian government paper that will be presented on Friday said, citing Russia's "massive military presence" on its northern belt and the U.S. pursuit of Greenland.

Italy has had observer status on the Arctic Council that oversees the region since 2013 and updated its policy as recent U.S.-Danish tensions over Greenland sharpened focus on the area.

In the draft policy document that has been reviewed by Reuters, Rome pointed to Moscow's renewed focus on the Arctic - "where energy and mineral resources vital to the country's security are located" - which included a build-up of its military presence.

"The militarization of the region, the closer partnership between the Russian Federation and China, the end of Sweden and Finland's neutrality following their accession to NATO, and the U.S. position on Greenland are among the major drivers of change," the document said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has renewed calls for American control of Greenland to prevent Russia or China from occupying it. The island, an autonomous territory of Denmark, rejected the idea in talks held in Washington this week, exposing "fundamental" differences.

Italy flagged China's attempt to raise its Arctic profile as a self-declared "near-Arctic state," including growing interest in shipping along the Northern Sea Route and closer ties with Moscow that extend to military matters.

The document said the development of Arctic shipping routes opens up "significant prospects" for shipbuilders including Italy's Fincantieri (FCT.MI) , opens new tab , which builds vessels that can operate in extreme environments.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:45:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2I5BO6R3OFLA7CU4J3QCUVINL4.jpg?auth=c625fd2e6e50de6a75fbdda6ec0b3db67cb3c1f0c01a6513bd7950aa31728e0b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Football : Ligue 1 clubs PSG and Lille look to bounce back after French Cup defeats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/football-ligue-1-clubs-psg-and-lille-look-to-bounce-back-after-french-cup-defeats</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 07:46:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9c44225a-e41e-11ee-a4f4-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/DN178266-A-01-20240311_01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US lawmakers arrive in Copenhagen to counter Trump's Greenland threats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-lawmakers-arrive-copenhagen-counter-trumps-greenland-threats-2026-01-16/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A bipartisan delegation of U.S. lawmakers will meet with the leaders of Denmark and Greenland on Friday to reassure them of congressional support despite President Donald Trump's threats to seize the Arctic island .

Trump has said Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and large supply of minerals and has not ruled out the use of force to take it. European nations this week sent small numbers of military personnel to the island at Denmark's request.

The 11-member U.S. delegation, led by Democratic Senator Chris Coons, is scheduled to meet with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen, according to Frederiksen's office.

"At a time of increasing international instability, we need to draw closer to our allies, not drive them away," Coons said in a press release earlier this week, adding the delegation would send "a clear message that Congress is committed to NATO."

The delegation includes Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Lisa Murkowski, though it is largely composed of Democratic lawmakers.

The congressional visit follows a high-stakes meeting at the White House on Wednesday, where Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen and Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt met with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance.

Danish officials said after that meeting they had not managed to change the U.S. administration's position on acquiring Greenland.

Rasmussen and Motzfeldt have also been meeting with U.S. lawmakers in Washington this week to rally congressional support, as Denmark and Greenland seek to resolve the unprecedented diplomatic crisis with a NATO ally.

"(We are) ready for cooperation on security in the Arctic but it has to happen with respect for our territorial integrity, international law and the UN Charter," Rasmussen said in a post on Instagram late on Thursday.

Trump first floated the idea of acquiring Greenland in 2019 during his first term, but faces opposition in Washington, including from within his own party.

Lawmakers from both Trump's Republican party and opposition Democrats have said they would back legislation to rein in Trump's ability to seize Greenland, amid an ongoing fight over war powers, which the Constitution grants to Congress.

A House bill in support of annexing Greenland has also been introduced.

Just 17% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, and large majorities of Democrats and Republicans oppose using military force to annex the island, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Trump has called the poll "fake."</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 08:31:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VXGPM5RERRL7TL6FQHEBT7NIFA.jpg?auth=537a9f52b122f949caecff54e71f2e16c12e3276fcbf47e519b9b949b4f95e08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgaria will hold election after leading parties refused mandate to form government, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/bulgaria-will-hold-elections-after-leading-parties-refused-mandate-form-2026-01-16/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's President Rumen Radev said on Friday that the country will hold a snap election after leading parties refused a mandate to form a government after the previous administration stepped down last month amid widespread protests.

The prosecutor's office of Spain's High Court has said it has opened preliminary proceedings over the complaint, which a rights group said involved human trafficking for forced labour and servitude, sexual abuse and violations of workers' rights.

"I deny having abused, coerced or disrespected any woman. These accusations are completely false and cause me great sadness," Iglesias, 82, said in a statement bearing his signature posted on his Instagram profile.

Iglesias - one of the world's best-selling Latin artists with more than 300 million records sold in 14 languages - added he had found "great comfort" in messages of support.

Rights group Women's Link Worldwide filed the complaint on January 5 on behalf of the two women, identified by the pseudonyms Rebeca and Laura, after a three-year investigation by U.S. broadcaster Univision and Spanish outlet elDiario.es.

The group described the complainants as young Latin American women "in vulnerable situations who were heavily dependent on their wages due to their economic and social conditions". The reports said they had worked in Iglesias' Caribbean residences in the Dominican Republic and Bahamas for 10 months in 2021.

The court has not provided any details of the case, which is subject to secrecy rules.

Attempts by Reuters to contact representatives of Iglesias by email and phone went unanswered, while the star's record label, Sony, has declined to comment on the allegations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:29:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/USADLISCU5OYHJGLPFPLIQTGZQ.jpg?auth=ed860ab01b92c308946477479c8e19a7a9221643331a91ce544869f8d9eee85f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czech citizen imprisoned in Venezuela released, foreign minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/czech-citizen-imprisoned-venezuela-released-foreign-minister-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>PRAGUE, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A Czech national imprisoned in Venezuela since 2024 has been released along with other foreign nationals, Czech Foreign Minister Petr Macinka said on Friday.

European Union countries, including Greece - where more than one million people came ashore during Europe's refugee crisis in 2015-16 - are tightening rules on migration as right-wing parties gain ground across the bloc.

In the trial on the Aegean island of Lesbos, the 24 defendants faced charges including involvement in a criminal group facilitating the illegal entry of migrants as well as money laundering linked to their organisation's funding.

The defendants were affiliated with the Emergency Response Center International, a nonprofit search-and-rescue group that operated on Lesbos from 2016 to 2018.

Among them was Sarah Mardini, one of two Syrian sisters who saved refugees in 2015 by pulling their sinking dinghy to shore and whose story inspired the popular 2022 Netflix movie The Swimmers, and Sean Binder, a German national who began volunteering for ERCI in 2017.

The two were arrested in 2018 and spent over 100 days in pre-trial detention.

The court dismissed all charges, a ruling which defence lawyer Zacharias Kesses called "courageous", but said it was met with "bittersweet relief".

Some of the defendants plunged into the sea to celebrate the verdict late on Thursday.

Although the charges were unfounded, Kesses said, Greece's judicial system delayed a resolution of the case, leading hundreds of people to withdraw from humanitarian aid activity.

"It took 2,897 days for justice to be delivered and for the authorities’ false narrative to collapse. The largest case of criminalisation of humanitarian assistance was built on a manual of inhumanity," Kesses told Reuters.

In recent years, Greece has toughened its stance on migrants. Since 2019, the centre-right government has reinforced border controls with fences and sea patrols.

"The Greek authorities should stop criminalising solidarity, end pushbacks, and prioritise saving lives,” said Eva Cossé, senior researcher in the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch, calling the prosecutions "abusive".

Greece, which has recently seen a steep new rise in migrant arrivals from Libya, says it respects international law and human rights.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:30:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZTMTYRADURPVHCOKJBOVYFQZJE.jpg?auth=e5b325625f9a1dc719e2f4ccd9e4deeba34342eaae3341685f3fccbdad6686d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia was behind attempted 2024 arson attack, Lithuania says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-was-behind-attempted-2024-arson-attack-lithuania-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>VILNIUS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Russia's GRU military intelligence was responsible for an attempted arson attack in 2024 on a plant in Lithuania that supplies radio wave scanners to Ukraine's army, Lithuanian officials said on Friday.

The defendants were affiliated with the Emergency Response Center International, a nonprofit search-and-rescue group that operated on Lesbos from 2016 to 2018.

Among them was Sarah Mardini, one of two Syrian sisters who saved refugees in 2015 by pulling their sinking dinghy to shore and whose story inspired the popular 2022 Netflix movie The Swimmers, and Sean Binder, a German national who began volunteering for ERCI in 2017.

The two were arrested in 2018 and spent over 100 days in pre-trial detention.

The court dismissed all charges, a ruling which defence lawyer Zacharias Kesses called "courageous", but said it was met with "bittersweet relief".

Some of the defendants plunged into the sea to celebrate the verdict late on Thursday.

Although the charges were unfounded, Kesses said, Greece's judicial system delayed a resolution of the case, leading hundreds of people to withdraw from humanitarian aid activity.

"It took 2,897 days for justice to be delivered and for the authorities’ false narrative to collapse. The largest case of criminalisation of humanitarian assistance was built on a manual of inhumanity," Kesses told Reuters.

In recent years, Greece has toughened its stance on migrants. Since 2019, the centre-right government has reinforced border controls with fences and sea patrols.

"The Greek authorities should stop criminalising solidarity, end pushbacks, and prioritise saving lives,” said Eva Cossé, senior researcher in the Europe and Central Asia division at Human Rights Watch, calling the prosecutions "abusive".

Greece, which has recently seen a steep new rise in migrant arrivals from Libya, says it respects international law and human rights.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:31:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZTMTYRADURPVHCOKJBOVYFQZJE.jpg?auth=e5b325625f9a1dc719e2f4ccd9e4deeba34342eaae3341685f3fccbdad6686d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia was behind attempted 2024 arson attack, Lithuania says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-was-behind-attempted-2024-arson-attack-lithuania-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>VILNIUS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Russia's GRU military intelligence was responsible for an attempted arson attack in 2024 on a plant in Lithuania that supplies radio wave scanners to Ukraine's army, Lithuanian officials said on Friday.

With the war showing no sign of ending and Hungary's economy stagnating, Orban has framed the election as a choice between war and peace, portraying Ukraine as undeserving of support and his government as the only safeguard against conflict and economic spillover.

Since last year, election billboards for Orban's Fidesz party have sought to associate opposition leader Peter Magyar with Brussels and Ukraine, suggesting that voting for his Tisza party means voting for tanks and war.

Orban's campaign primarily targets rural voters and echoes his past anti-migrant campaigns as most polls show Fidesz trailing Tisza .

Details of the "petition" were unclear, but it appeared to amount to an informal referendum, in the form of a ballot paper sent to citizens.

"Everybody will get this (national petition) and will get the chance to say 'no' and to say, together with the government, that we will not pay," Orban told state radio on Friday, accusing the opposition of being pro-Ukraine.

Orban said, without citing any evidence, that the European Union would put pressure on Hungary to send its young people to fight in Ukraine, "and there is rightful fear that pro-Ukrainian forces would give in to pressure from Brussels".

Magyar has said Tisza supports peace in Ukraine, rejects the idea of conscription, and will not support any escalation in the war.

The European Commission on Wednesday put forward its proposal to loan Ukraine 90 billion euros.

In December, when the plan was sealed , Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic agreed as long as it did not affect them financially.

A survey in December by Policy Solutions and Zavecz Research indicated growing opposition in Hungary to EU funding for Ukraine. In 2023, 57% were in favour and 41% opposed but, by last year, only 36% were in favour, with 63% against.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:50:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GZXVDSXCZNOGJNP3ONEKKFX5FM.jpg?auth=598bd8adfaab1627fb64685e7f99f4857004da95e82634bba40c39bd53167be4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greek rice growers fear Mercosur deal will price them out of business</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greek-rice-growers-fear-mercosur-deal-will-price-them-out-business-2026-01-16/</link><description>CHALASTRA, Greece, Jan 16  (Reuters) - Rice growers in northern Greece had braced for a tough 2026 season as competition from non-EU exporters heated up but many of them now worry that a controversial free trade deal between the European Union and South America's biggest Mercosur economies might put them out of business for good.

Greece, Europe's third largest producer of paddy rice behind Italy and Spain, is exporting most of its 240,000-ton annual production, mainly to Europe and Turkey. But its rice producers have felt the pinch of rising production costs and droughts in recent years and joined nationwide protests with other farmers who have blockaded Greek roads for weeks over delayed EU aid.

"We cannot sell because they are bringing a lot of rice from Asian countries and we're already having trouble," said Menelaos Koukourdis, who grows rice across 450 acres of land in a fertile river plain outside the northern city of Thessaloniki, Greece's main rice-growing region.

Koukourdis now sells at 25 cents per kilo, half the price from a year ago. "Now that they will also bring rice from Mercosur, from South America, we'll have to abandon everything," he said.

Under the EU-Mercosur trade pact - which was approved by Greece and other EU states last week and is due to be signed on Saturday - Europe will import 60,000 tons of duty-free rice from South America's Mercosur, comprising Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay, over five years.

The European Commission says the quantities are equal to a fraction of the annual consumption in Europe which relies on rice imports for about half of its needs.

Greece also defended the deal, saying it will give many of its products, including the trademark "feta" cheese and mastic, access to a population of 270 million and will come with safeguards in the event of import spikes.

Feeling the pressure, many rice growers have abandoned their fields and machinery to look for other jobs, said Christos Gatzaras, a 52-year-old farmer and head of the Chalastra cooperative's rice producers near Thessaloniki.

For Koukourdis, who has lowered prices despite higher production costs to be able to compete with cheaper imported rice, switching crops will not be easy.

"We have no room to sow anything else in these fields, in this area. Rice used to be a monoculture," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:50:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M5TOP2YOO5LLVP2TM3UFTBNK4I.jpg?auth=19091b0e83e641b8c253868be1871bea260265ee25b00b58254c5e675f0cac33&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin and Netanyahu discuss Iran by phone, Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/putin-netanyahu-discuss-iran-by-phone-kremlin-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the situation in the Middle East and Iran by phone on Friday, the Kremlin said.

Nearly three years of fighting between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have left tens of thousands dead , 11 million displaced and repeated attempts at peace blocked.

Efforts led by the US and regional mediators—Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , known as the Quad—have failed to secure a ceasefire, as both sides wrestle for territorial gain.

A high-level meeting on Wednesday in Cairo brought together officials from the Quad countries, as well as the UN , European Union and regional organisations to discuss peace efforts, which have seen little progress.

“By the end of March, we will have depleted our food stocks in Sudan,” said Ross Smith, the World Food Programme’s Director of Emergency Preparedness and Response.

“Without immediate additional funding, millions of people will be left without vital food assistance within weeks.”

According to the UN, more than 21 million people—almost half of Sudan’s population—are now facing acute food insecurity, with two-thirds of the population in urgent need of assistance.

Visiting Dongola, the capital of Sudan’s Northern State, on Thursday, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk said many displaced people lack adequate shelter while women have limited access to support services.

He called for an “all-out effort” by both Sudanese authorities and the international community to enable the delivery of vital humanitarian aid.

The UN’s children agency UNICEF said last week that millions of children have been pushed “to the brink of survival” and humanitarian aid remains “far from sufficient” amid funding shortfalls and ongoing hostilities.

In December, outgoing UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said a wave of “drastic, irresponsible” aid cuts inflicted unnecessary suffering on those in need.

Smith said WFP has been forced to cut rations to the “absolute minimum for survival” and warned that previous “hard-earned gains” in hard-to-reach areas risk being reversed.

WFP says it urgently needs $700 million to continue its operations through June.

A UN-backed assessment confirmed last year that famine had taken hold in El-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur , which was overrun by the paramilitary forces in October.

On Wednesday, US senior advisor for Arab and African affairs Massad Boulos said the UN delivered more than 1.3 metric tons of humanitarian supplies to El-Fasher, the first such delivery since the city was besieged in May 2024.

But aid agencies warn that a deteriorating security situation across Darfur continues to jeopardise the delivery of desperately needed assistance.

Famine has also been confirmed in Kadugli, in neighbouring Kordofan, now a key battleground in the conflict.

In Dilling, around 130 kilometres north, the UN says civilians are likely experiencing famine conditions, though insecurity has prevented formal declaration.

The UN warned that 20 more areas across Darfur and Kordofan are at risk.

In November, US President Donald Trump pledged to help end the conflict after Saudi Arabia’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman urged his intervention, but his promise has yet to materialise.

Quad-led talks have been deadlocked since army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said in November the group was biased towards the UAE, which Sudan accuses of arming the RSF.

Abu Dhabi denies the accusations, despite reports from UN experts, US lawmakers and international organisations.

In Egypt, historically the Sudanese army’s closest ally, the UN Secretary General’s Sudan envoy Ramtane Lamamra met Wednesday with Boulos and other diplomats as part of the fifth meeting of the Consultative Mechanism to Enhance and Coordinate Peace Efforts.

Lamamra called it “a key and timely opportunity for international actors to align efforts and renew collective engagement”, but a diplomatic source told AFP there are no new truce proposals currently on the table.

Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said on Wednesday that there was a consensus on a humanitarian truce and the rejection of “foreign interference”.

But he also emphasised what he described as Egypt’s “red lines” and readiness to defend its southern neighbour’s territorial integrity.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 09:53:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/400b3f14-f2bd-11f0-bf75-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25350543690699.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine has fuel reserves for more than 20 days, energy minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraine-has-fuel-reserves-more-than-20-days-energy-minister-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine has fuel reserves for more than 20 days, Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal told parliament on Friday, describing the overall energy situation in the country as very difficult following a series of Russian drone and missile attacks on power infrastructure.

Shmyhal, who took office earlier this week, said the most challenging situation remains in the capital Kyiv, the regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Odesa, and in towns near the frontline, where thousands of homes have been without electricity and heating for days in subzero temperatures.

"In some cities and regions, winter preparations have failed. Over the past two days in office, I've seen that many things are clearly stalling," he said.

"There is not a single power plant left in Ukraine that the enemy has not attacked."

On Wednesday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he would declare a state of emergency in the energy sector to make up for lost time and address issues of disrupted power supplies following sustained Russian attacks.

Shmyhal, who previously served as prime minister and defence minister, ordered emergency imports of electricity. He said that Ukraine needs to install 2.2-2.7 GW of electricity generation capacity by the end of 2026 to meet its consumption needs.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:25:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4VLOXZNBJVMBVII7BHZMZLOIVM.jpg?auth=af30ea6fe985456d204b9800c8bc1c0566f860e7527e458aaa6987eb69a42275&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>NASA prepares first crewed moon mission in more than 50 years</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/nasa-prepares-first-crewed-moon-mission-in-more-than-50-years</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:26:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/00908b7e-f2c1-11f0-b84b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-101330-101508-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US delegation seeks to reassure Denmark and Greenland amid Trump seizure threats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-delegation-seeks-to-reassure-denmark-and-greenland-amid-trump-seizure-threats</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:26:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/46e1889e-f2c1-11f0-beda-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1457311013696a0ab5798116-91283512.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran deploys riot police to shut down protests in Tehran</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-deploys-riot-police-to-shut-down-protests</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:26:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fb98f374-f2be-11f0-8b35-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-100138-100228-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's government looking at forcing though budget after talks stall</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/frances-government-postpones-budget-talks-tuesday-2026-01-16/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - France's government suspended talks in parliament on its 2026 budget until Tuesday after lawmakers failed to reach a compromise, giving the prime minister time to consider options for forcing through the legislation without a vote.

Bypassing parliament to get the budget passed would inevitably trigger a no confidence motion , which could lead to the collapse of government, unless it includes revisions to the bill that placate Socialist lawmakers.

Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's government blamed the ideologically opposed hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and the far-right National Rally (RN) for sabotaging efforts to reach a compromise during three months of talks in parliament.

"The extremes have methodically voted for amendments to make the budget unvotable," Budget Minister Amelie de Montchalin said on Friday in an interview on France 2 TV.

Lecornu will on Friday propose an amended draft of the budget bill to try to reach a compromise before talks resume on Tuesday, according to Montchalin.

"There are things we have proposed that clearly do not work," she said. "We saw that there were issues concerning local authorities, which is a major concern. It's a matter of everyday life."

Lecornu will speak "towards the end of the day", the prime minister's office said.

A government source said that Lecornu was now looking at two options to pass the budget without a vote in parliament, despite the likelihood opposition lawmakers will respond with a vote of no confidence.

He could choose to invoke Article 49.3 of the Constitution that allows the government to push through a bill without a vote, but he had previously vowed not to do that, saying he wishes for the parliament to come to an agreement.

The alternative could be to invoke Article 47 - an executive order also allowing the government to pass the budget without a vote, though it is legally unclear whether the government could include some of the revisions made by lawmakers during the three months of talks.

If the government passes a bill that does not reflect at least some of the amendments backed by Socialists, their lawmakers could back a no confidence vote.

The Socialists' pointman on the budget, Philippe Brun, threatened to back a no confidence vote "without hesitation" if the government tried to pass the budget by executive order.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:50:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HR426KJPBVKE5BDGNH6LVDYWDE.jpg?auth=ff9f14d54967b6f8573f01eb0448199232c9dfc0b9d6876e468902b507e86a38&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa probes Iran's role in BRICS+ naval drills</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-africa-launches-inquiry-into-irans-participation-brics-naval-drills-2026-01-16/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 16 (Reuters) - South Africa's defence ministry said on Friday that Minister Angie Motshekga had launched an inquiry into Iran's participation in the BRICS+ naval exercises held in South African waters over the past week.

The defence ministry said in a statement that the inquiry would seek to determine whether South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's instructions regarding Iran's involvement were misrepresented and/or ignored.

South African news outlet Daily Maverick has reported that Ramaphosa sought to get Iran to withdraw from the drills due to concerns about the damage its participation could do to South Africa's relations with the United States.

"The Minister of Defence, Hon. Angie Motshekga, would like to place it on record that the instruction (from Ramaphosa) was clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and to be implemented and adhered to," the defence ministry statement added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:50:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/75PUW4TQBZKB7DX3543GDF3ZFE.jpg?auth=69901e43b41332cf9d9490d3942a5234de8e284034e9d4eb050ca3ba2e24630b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's opposition figurehead Machado presents Trump with Nobel Peace medal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-s-opposition-figurehead-machado-presents-nobel-peace-medal-to-trump</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:51:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a029af86-f2c5-11f0-9802-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-143976996696a12015d2d85-12422163.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran protests abate after deadly crackdown, residents and rights group say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/iran-protests-abate-after-deadly-crackdown-residents-rights-group-say-2026-01-16/</link><description>Dubai, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Iran's deadly crackdown appears to have broadly quelled protests for now, according to a rights group and residents, as state media reported more arrests on Friday in the shadow of U.S. threats to intervene if killing continues.

After President Donald Trump's repeated threats of military action against Iran in support of protesters, fears of a U.S. attack have retreated since Wednesday, when Trump said he'd been told killings in the crackdown were easing.

U.S. allies including Saudi Arabia and Qatar conducted intense diplomacy with Washington this week to prevent a U.S. strike, warning of consequences for the wider region that would ultimately impact the United States, a Gulf official said.

The White House said on Thursday that Trump is closely monitoring the situation on the ground, adding that the president and his team have warned Tehran there would be “grave consequences” if killings linked to its crackdown continue.

Trump understands that 800 scheduled executions were halted, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt added, saying the president was keeping "all of his options on the table".

The protests erupted on December 28 over soaring inflation in Iran, whose economy has been crippled by sanctions, before spiralling into one of the biggest challenges yet to the clerical establishment that has run Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

With information flows from Iran obstructed by an internet blackout, several residents of Tehran said the capital had been quiet since Sunday. They said drones were flying over the city, where they'd seen no sign of protests on Thursday or Friday.

Iranian-Kurdish rights group Hengaw said that there had been no protest gatherings since Sunday, saying "the security environment remains highly restrictive".

"Our independent sources confirm a heavy military and security presence in cities and towns where protests previously took place, as well as in several locations that did not experience major demonstrations," Norway-based Hengaw said in comments to Reuters.

Another resident in a northern city on the Caspian Sea said the streets also appeared calm.

The residents declined to be identified for their safety.

There were, however, indications of unrest in some areas.

Hengaw reported that a female nurse was killed by direct gunfire from government forces during protests in Karaj, west of Iran. Reuters was not able to independently verify the report.

The state-affiliated Tasnim news outlet reported that rioters set fire to a local education office in Falavarjan County, in central Isfahan Province, on Thursday.

An elderly resident of a town in Iran's northwestern region, where many Kurdish Iranians live and which has been the focus for many of the biggest flare-ups, said sporadic protests had continued, though not as intensely.

Describing scenes of violence earlier in the protests, she said: "I have not scenes like that before."

The state-owned Press TV cited Iran's police chief as saying calm had been restored across the country.

A death toll reported by U.S.-based rights group HRANA has increased little since Wednesday, currently standing at 2,677 people, including 2,478 protesters and 163 people identified as people affiliated with the government.

Reuters has not been able to independently verify the HRANA death toll. An Iranian official told the news agency earlier this week that about 2,000 people had been killed in the unrest.

The casualty numbers dwarf the death toll from previous bouts of unrest that have been suppressed by the state.

Iranian authorities have described the unrest as the most violent yet, accusing foreign enemies of fomenting it and armed people they have identified as terrorists of targeting security forces and carrying out other attacks.

The state-affiliated Tasnim news outlet reported what it described as the arrest of a large number of leaders of recent riots in the western province of Kermanshah.

Tasnim also reported the arrest of five people accused of vandalising a gas station and a base belonging to the Basij - a branch of the security forces often used to quell unrest - in the southeastern city of Kerman.

Also on Friday, state television broadcast the funerals of members of the security forces in Semnan, northern Iran, and Semirom, central Iran.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UNDKBRS6FISPL3CRRG3GHTAYA.jpg?auth=265ed7be7e20f3fbcde4f7c39e682657ba4172c8cf01b629b9b16742a27fc359&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Small Minneapolis businesses hit hard by ICE crackdown, while corporations stay silent</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/small-minneapolis-businesses-hit-hard-by-ice-crackdown-while-corporations-stay-2026-01-16/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Up and down Lake Street in the heavily Latino area of south Minneapolis, numerous mom-and-pop restaurants have hung up signs that say "No ICE," referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who have been conducting frequent raids in the area. The federal actions have also prompted thousands in the streets to protest after ICE agents killed 37-year-old Renee Good in her vehicle last week.

By contrast, large corporations in Minneapolis have been much less vocal about the effects of immigration enforcement on the city, known as both a bastion of progressive politics in the U.S. Midwest and a robust corporate employer. Seventeen Fortune 500 companies are based in Minnesota, including Target (TGT.N) , opens new tab , UnitedHealth (UNH.N) , opens new tab , and General Mills (GIS.N) , opens new tab .

Reuters reached out to those companies, as well as Minnesota-based corporations Best Buy (BBY.N) , opens new tab , Hormel (HRL.N) , opens new tab , Land O'Lakes, agricultural giant Cargill, and industrial conglomerate 3M (MMM.N) , opens new tab . None would speak on the record on the guidance they have given to employees. Their websites also have not addressed the current federal actions or unrest in the city.

It stands in contrast with how companies responded in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd that spurred nationwide anger; many companies, including UnitedHealth and General Mills, spoke out in support of Floyd or his family after his death.

Their silence, according to Bill George, a Minneapolis-based former executive and current Harvard Business School fellow, is a mistake.

"A lot of them are very silent and I think it's not a good time to be silent," he told Reuters. He added he has spoken with numerous executives in the Minneapolis area who have expressed concerns about the toll on business, with many still in the process of formulating guidance to workers.

"It is disappointing to me that we don't hear their voices. They're charged with the safety, security and well-being of their employees," he said.

Businesses have been much less outspoken about President Donald Trump's policies in his second term, due to fear of retaliation or threats of boycotts. After a Hilton-owned (HLT.N) , opens new tab Hampton Inn cancelled bookings for ICE members in early January, the company removed it from its network.

Many restaurants on Lake Street have reduced hours or closed. At Pineda Tacos, where a “No ICE” sign hangs in the front window and trash cans barricade the rear entrance, employees guard the door in an effort to prevent surprise raids, letting customers in one-by-one. Owner Luis Reyes Rojas said fear has reshaped daily operations.

“We have plan A, plan B and plan C,” Reyes Rojas said, describing plans to retreat to offices or basements in case agents appear. "We don’t know how much longer we can endure this.”

FEELING THE EFFECTS

Business associations say the $350 billion regional economy is feeling the effects, from sales declines at small businesses to falling attendance at large companies and agricultural operations. “There are impacts that roll up to Fortune 500 companies and all the way down to sole proprietors,” said Mike Logan, CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce.

The Trump administration has defended the operations, and has added more agents even as 69% of Americans in a recent Reuters poll say federal agents should minimize the harm to people during operations, even if arrests decline.

One high-profile ICE incident took place at a Target store in the suburb of Richfield, where a pair of workers - both U.S. citizens - were taken by ICE agents. One of those arrested was a 17-year-old Target employee, according to a source familiar with the situation. Target has not issued any public statement about the ICE raids; it declined to comment for this story.

Michael Howard, a Democratic state representative, whose district includes parts of Minneapolis and Richfield, said he has been trying to learn more about Target's protocols related to ICE. He is urging them to "exert more clearly their private property rights and Fourth Amendment rights to request that if ICE is going into their public-private spaces that they present a judicial warrant.”

Jeff, 61, who owns a residential cleaning company in the Minneapolis suburbs, said he has told his all-Latino workforce not to work if they feel threatened. He declined to share his last name or business name out of fear of attracting ICE attention. He has been filling the tanks of company cars following reports that ICE has questioned people at gas stations.

“I’m not telling anyone they have to work,” he said. “If they want to, I will give them as safe a route as I can give them. If they don’t want to come in, I understand, and no one will get fired.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NITM2REC5VIP7CNKHTI2XMZCBE.jpg?auth=fbd7ed071b58bf14f178a261e628755582899a385349e9cecafdb2c35f61a28f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia hails apparent desire of some EU states to resume dialogue on Ukraine with Moscow</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-hails-apparent-desire-some-eu-states-resume-dialogue-ukraine-with-moscow-2026-01-16/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Friday hailed what it said looked like the desire of Italy, France and Germany to resume dialogue on Ukraine with Russia as a "significant shift" which matched its own view of how the situation should evolve.

British Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper has signalled London does not agree that the time is right to re-engage, however, telling Politico that she had seen no evidence that Moscow wants peace in Ukraine.

"As for Britain, yes, Britain continues to take a radical stance," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday, when asked about the apparent shift in some European attitudes towards the idea of talking to Moscow.

"Nonetheless... the statements by the three leaders (of Italy, France and Germany) represents significant progress from our perspective," said Peskov, who said that such a shift, if it reflected those countries' strategic vision, was in line with how Russia believed things should evolve.

Moscow had an ongoing dialogue with the United States about so far unsuccessful efforts to get a peace deal in Ukraine, he added, but no such dialogue currently existed with European governments.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said earlier this month that Europe should restart dialogue with Russia to try to win more influence in negotiations over Ukraine, saying the EU should appoint an envoy to deal directly with President Vladimir Putin.

French President Emmanuel Macron has also spoken of the possibility of re-engaging, talking in December of the necessity for a "fulsome dialogue" with Moscow within weeks if a robust and lasting peace for Ukraine was not reached in the meantime.

On Thursday, according to German media, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called Russia a European country, saying he hoped ties between the EU and Moscow could be rebalanced.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/525WY2CTIZOJHG5TOKYJUINYPU.jpg?auth=405de6eed29414304fcf20e5a7f2457232aed7713d22d87ed630a32c7e6fe2e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar tells World Court Gambia has not proven Rohingya genocide case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-tells-world-court-gambia-has-not-proven-rohingya-genocide-case-2026-01-16/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Myanmar told the United Nations' top court on Friday that Gambia had not proven its accusation that the Myanmar government had committed genocide against the minority Muslim Rohingya, part of a hearing on the landmark case.

Gambia, a predominantly Muslim West African country, brought the case before the International Court of Justice in 2019. It told the court on Monday that Myanmar's authorities had targeted the Rohingya for destruction , allegations Myanmar rejected.

"Gambia has failed to meet its burden of proof. This case will be decided on proven fact not unsubstantiated allegations," Ko Ko Hlaing, a representative of the Myanmar government, told the ICJ, which is also known as the World Court.

Myanmar's armed forces launched an offensive in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh, where they recounted killings, mass rape and arson. A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded the 2017 military offensive had included "genocidal acts".

Myanmar has denied genocide and Hlaing told judges the offensive was a legitimate counter-terrorism campaign in response to attacks by Muslim militants. He added the U.N. fact-finding mission was not objective or reliable.

Lawyers for Gambia had argued that it would be unreasonable for judges to conclude that Myanmar's attack on thousands of Rohingya civilians, including women, children and the elderly, as well as burning their villages was done just to combat terrorism.

They said the pattern of conduct during the crackdown indicated the genocidal intent legally needed to determine genocide was committed.

The ICJ is the U.N.'s highest court and deals with disputes between states.

Gambia's case, backed by the 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, is the first genocide case the ICJ is hearing in full in more than a decade.

The outcome will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, likely affecting South Africa's 2023 genocide case at the ICJ against Israel over the war in Gaza. Israel also denies genocide and lawyers for Israel dismissed South Africa's case as an abuse of the genocide convention.

Myanmar has been in further turmoil since 2021, when the military toppled the elected civilian government and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion.

The country is currently holding phased elections , opens new tab that have been criticised by the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups as not free or fair. The military says the vote has public backing and is being conducted without coercion.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/75PGS5KX7VLSFPG3DJF6J2ZKAQ.jpg?auth=bd1fd7a09202007b231c0ca0a3a8444f61135eb7ba85a7c08b354e94796ae7f8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece orders safety investments by Italian-owned railway after train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greece-orders-safety-investments-by-italian-owned-railway-after-train-crash-2026-01-16/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Greece is requiring Italian-owned railway operator Hellenic Train to invest 420 million euros ($487.41 million) in new trains and maintenance to improve safety nearly three years after the country's worst rail disaster.

The requirements are contained in amendments to a 2017 state contract with Hellenic Train approved by parliament late on Thursday, the transport ministry said in a statement.

"For the first time, the contract includes a break clause. If trains are not delivered and put into service by 2027, the state can terminate the contract," the statement said.

On February 28, 2023, a passenger train coming from Athens and a freight train coming from Thessaloniki collided head-on near the town of Larissa, killing 57 people, mostly students.

Experts hired by the families of the victims and Greek investigators have highlighted safety deficiencies.

Hellenic Train had already announced part of the new agreement - a 308 million euro investment in new electric trains from Alstom (ALSO.PA) , opens new tab - in December, calling it "a decisive step toward a safer, more modern and more passenger-focused railway".

The trains will be fitted with a system for remote communication between drivers and traffic controllers and to control a train's brakes from a distance, Hellenic Train said.

A project co-funded by the European Union to install the system was launched in 2014 but was repeatedly pushed back. EU prosecutors have charged numerous Greek officials with malpractice over that contract.

The transport ministry statement said 100 million euros of investment by Hellenic Train was earmarked for maintenance infrastructure, depots and digital systems.

Following a judicial investigation, a trial over the train crash is expected to start in March. Hellenic Train said last year it had provided all required data and was committed to continuing full cooperation with the inquiry.

"We fully trust the legal proceedings due to start later this year," Alexandra Kassimi, a spokesperson for Hellenic Train, told Reuters on Friday in response to a request for comment.

SpaceX, which owns Starlink, made the satellite service free for Iranians earlier this week, placing Musk's space company at the center of another geopolitical hot spot and pitting a team of U.S.-based engineers against a regional power armed with satellite jammers and signal-spoofing tactics, according to activists, analysts and researchers.

How SpaceX withstands Iranian attacks on its most lucrative line of business is expected to be closely watched by U.S. military forces and intelligence agencies that use Starlink and its military-grade variant Starshield, as well as China, whose own nascent satellite internet constellations are set to rival Starlink in the coming years. With SpaceX weighing a public listing this year , the situation in Iran also represents a high-profile showcase for Starlink to investors.

"We're in this weird early part of the history of space-delivered communications where SpaceX is the only true provider at this scale," said John Plumb, the former Pentagon space policy chief under President Joe Biden.

"And these repressive regimes think they can still turn off communications, but I think the day is coming where that's just not possible," he said.

Thousands of people protesting Iran's clerical rule are reported to have been killed in the past week, while Tehran's order to restrict communications makes it difficult to discern the full extent of its violent crackdown on dissent.

Starlink, which is harder for Iran to tamper with than cable and cellphone tower networks, has become crucial for documenting events on the ground.

Raha Bahreini, an Iran researcher at Amnesty International, said they had verified dozens of videos from Iran, including footage of protesters killed or injured by Iranian forces, and believe that almost all of them came from people who had access to Starlink. She added, however, that the ongoing communications restrictions have impeded human-rights organizations' communications with people in Iran in efforts to assess the scale of the violence.

Starlink is banned in Iran, yet tens of thousands of terminals may have been smuggled into the country, although it remains unclear how many are in use, according to Holistic Resilience, a U.S. nonprofit that has helped deliver Starlink terminals to Iranians and says it is working with SpaceX to monitor what it describes as Iranian attempts to jam the system.

Consumer Starlink terminals are rectangular antenna dishes that come in two sizes - one roughly the size of a pizza box and a smaller “mobile” one the size of a laptop.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment on Thursday in response to Reuters' questions.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Monday, said the internet had been cut off "after we confronted terrorist operations and realized orders were coming from outside the country."

Starlink, the first massive internet-from-space constellation of its kind, has emerged as a crucial tool for communications in wartime and remote areas. The network, which drove SpaceX's $15 billion revenue in 2024, has expanded the geopolitical power of Musk, who in 2022 asserted control over how and where it was being used by Ukrainian troops fighting back Russian forces.

Roughly 10,000 low-orbiting Starlink satellites zipping above user terminals at an orbital velocity of some 17,000 miles per hour (27,360 kph) make its signals much harder to locate and disrupt than traditional satellite systems designed with a larger, single satellite fixed over a given territory.

Iran is likely using satellite jammers to disrupt the Starlink signals, according to Holistic Resilience and other specialists. Iran also appears to be engaging in so-called spoofing, or broadcasting fake GPS signals to confuse and disable Starlink terminals, according to Nariman Gharib, an Iranian opposition activist and independent cyber espionage investigator based in Britain.

The GPS spoofing wreaks havoc on a Starlink terminal's connection and slows internet speeds, said Gharib, who analyzed data from a terminal inside Iran.

"You might be able to send text messages, but forget about video calls," he said.

Though Starlink is not licensed to operate in Iran, Musk has repeatedly confirmed its presence on his social media platform X, spurring a yearslong effort by the Iranian government to counter the service. Amid protests over the death of Mahsa Amini in December 2022, Musk posted that nearly 100 Starlink terminals were active in the country.

Following the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, Iran's parliament passed a law banning the use of Starlink, introducing severe penalties for those who use or distribute the unlicensed technology, according to Iranian state media.

Iran has also pursued diplomatic channels, urging a panel at the United Nations' International Telecommunication Union last year to force the United States and Norway — where Starlink is internationally registered — to block the service.

At a July meeting, Iran told the board that Starlink's use in the country is illegal and said an "invading country" had deployed its terminals on drones during a recent attack.

Iran told the board in November that it was struggling to locate and disable the terminals itself.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YWUDLBVX5RKQZNGRXZMHBTKFSE.jpg?auth=1258bb9b3eaaa7737fd109082555de36f684aaf7c1db3dfe45e89ce0cdc9c8b7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Musk's Starlink faces high-profile security test in Iran crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/musks-starlink-faces-high-profile-security-test-iran-crackdown-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:21:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Small Minneapolis businesses hit hard by ICE crackdown, while corporations stay silent</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/small-minneapolis-businesses-hit-hard-by-ice-crackdown-while-corporations-stay-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:21:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Greece orders safety investments by Italian-owned railway after train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greece-orders-safety-investments-by-italian-owned-railway-after-train-crash-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:21:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Poker-faced Powell may have ace up sleeve to stymie Trump's Fed shakeup</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/poker-faced-powell-may-have-ace-up-sleeve-stymie-trumps-fed-shakeup-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:43:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Putin talks to Netanyahu and Iran's Pezeshkian, says Russia is willing to mediate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/putin-talks-netanyahu-irans-pezeshkian-says-russia-is-willing-mediate-2026-01-16/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the situation in Iran in separate calls on Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, and said that Moscow was willing to mediate in the region, the Kremlin said.

Tehran has cracked down hard on nationwide protests that broke out late last month, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to warn he might intervene. Last year, Israel and the United States both bombed Iranian nuclear sites, and Iran fought a 12-day war with Israel.

Russia has pursued closer ties with Iran since the start of its war in Ukraine, and Putin last year signed a 20-year strategic partnership pact with Pezeshkian.

In the conversation with Netanyahu, the Kremlin said Putin set out ideas for boosting stability in the Middle East and expressed Russia's willingness to "continue its mediation efforts and to promote constructive dialogue with the participation of all interested states".

The Kremlin said it would provide a readout later on the call with Pezeshkian.

Any threat to the survival of the Iranian leadership would pose a serious concern for Moscow, 13 months after it lost another key Middle East ally with the toppling of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Earlier this month another Russian ally, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was captured by the United States and brought to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

Asked what support Russia could provide to Iran, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "Russia is already providing assistance not only to Iran but also to the entire region, and to the cause of regional stability and peace. This is partly thanks to the president's efforts to help de-escalate tensions."

Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons, something Tehran denies. Russia says it supports Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:43:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KPWVOGMRJJOQ7EBNERCACOPX2E.jpg?auth=c3678c8b5ea5aeb477cfd5f6cb338d91a3e1bc93f196ffe0b41cf2fa907c4484&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CIA director Ratcliffe meets with Venezuela's Rodriguez in Caracas, NYT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cia-director-ratcliffe-meets-with-venezuelas-rodriguez-caracas-nyt-reports-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - CIA Director John Ratcliffe met with Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, in Caracas, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing a U.S. official.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report of the meeting, which the Times said took place on Thursday. The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Ratcliffe met with Rodriguez at U.S. President Donald Trump's direction "to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship," the report said.

They discussed intelligence cooperation, economic stability and the need to ensure that Venezuela was no longer a "safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narco-traffickers," the report added.

During her tenure as vice president of Venezuela, Rodriguez was involved in negotiations with a U.S. special envoy, Richard Grenell, along with other officials, on a deal to get the now-deposed former president Maduro to voluntarily give up power, the newspaper said.

Rodriguez has previously criticized the Trump administration for "kidnapping" Maduro and called for his return.

World Food Programme warned on Friday.

Around 15,000 people are at risk in Borno state, the agency said, an area already struggling with years of militant unrest.

Across West and Central Africa, 55 million people are facing severe food shortages, with more than three quarters of the people affected in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger, it added.

The U.N. body did not pick out specific funding but agencies have been raising the alarm since the Trump administration started reducing aid as part of its “America First” policy last year, and Britain and others cut aid budgets to boost spending on defence .

More than 13 million children in the region were projected to suffer malnutrition this year, the WFP said.

Conflict, displacement and economic pressures have driven food insecurity for years, but cuts to humanitarian assistance were now pushing vulnerable communities beyond their ability to cope, the statement added.

“The reduced funding we saw in 2025 has deepened hunger and malnutrition across the region,” Sarah Longford, WFP’s deputy regional director for West and Central Africa, said.

Funding shortfalls in 2025 had already forced WFP to scale back nutrition programmes in Nigeria, affecting more than 300,000 children, after the agency warned that nearly 35 million people could go hungry as its resources ran out in December.

Elsewhere, insecurity in Mali has disrupted food supply routes, leaving 1.5 million people facing crisis levels of hunger, while more than half a million people in Cameroon risk being cut off from aid in the coming weeks, the statement said.

The U.N. agency said it needed more than $453 million over the next six months to continue providing humanitarian assistance across the region.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:44:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZSWDIML3JFOAPOLKK2OB33AJTI.jpg?auth=bc43bfcc11f21a05f010d9b64cdbbcad190ba484a147c937a4ad467e4a408d8e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria poised to attack Kurdish-held towns to pressure stalled talks, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-poised-attack-kurdish-held-towns-pressure-stalled-talks-sources-say-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - Syrian troops are poised to attack towns in the north and east held by Kurdish fighters, sources familiar with the matter said, to pressure autonomy-minded Kurds into making concessions in deadlocked talks with the Damascus government.

The threat of renewed military action highlights the deepening fault lines between the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has vowed to reunify the fractured country under one leadership after 14 years of civil war, and regional Kurdish authorities wary of his Islamist-led administration.

The United States, which seeks to anchor peace in Syria to shore up wider Middle East stability and help prevent any resurgence of Islamic State militants, has urged both sides to avoid a showdown and return to talks, according to a Syrian official and a Syrian source familiar with diplomatic channels.

The two sides engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, insisting repeatedly that they wanted to resolve disputes diplomatically.

But after the deadline passed with little progress , clashes broke out last week in the northern city of Aleppo and ended with a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters.

Now, a broader confrontation looms, according to the sources, who include three Syrian officials, two Kurdish figures and three foreign diplomats.

As many as five Syrian army divisions could take part in the offensive targeting Kurdish-held towns in the northern province of Aleppo and the vast eastern desert province of Deir el-Zor, a senior military official involved in the planning told Reuters.

If the tactic fails to bring the parties back to the negotiating table, Syria's army is considering a full-scale campaign that could see the Kurds lose the semi-autonomous zone they have managed for more than a decade, the official said.

Syrian army units deployed on Wednesday and Thursday to the town of Deir Hafer and surrounding villages just west of the Euphrates River held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main Kurdish fighting force and a years-long recipient of U.S. support as it battled the Islamic State militant group.

Syria's military has ordered SDF fighters to withdraw east of the river and opened a humanitarian corridor for civilians to flee to government-held territory.

Some residents who made it out told Reuters they had to flee through farmland on foot as the main road had been shut. The SDF denied that it had blocked civilians from leaving.

Other Syrian troops were quietly sent to another front line in remote Deir el-Zor province, where the Kurds run key oil fields that Damascus says should be under central state control, according to two Syrian army commanders.

The SDF has condemned the build-up. "We clearly state that we are against any military confrontation, given its grave risks," Abdel Karim Omar, the Damascus-based representative of the Kurdish-led administration, told Reuters.

He said efforts were underway with the help of foreign mediators to revive the negotiations.

Washington had not explicitly opposed a limited operation by Syrian troops, three diplomats and an SDF official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. But the SDF official said the U.S. was not doing enough to prevent a clash.

U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said on Friday Washington was in "close contact with all parties in Syria, working around the clock to lower the temperature, prevent escalation, and return to integration talks between the Syrian government and the SDF".

A State Department spokesperson said both sides should avoid "pushing the country back into a cycle of violence".

The messaging underscores Washington’s effort to recalibrate its Syria policy by balancing years of backing for the SDF against its new support for Sharaa, whose rebel forces ousted Russian-backed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.

Sharaa accused the SDF of obstructing U.S. policy to nurture a reintegrated Syria and taking orders from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a separatist group that waged a long insurgency in Turkey before entering into a peace process with Ankara.

Sharaa, speaking on state TV, said the SDF had taken "no practical steps forward" to implement last year's integration pact, but hoped it could still be carried out "calmly."

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the SDF must show good intentions by unilaterally leaving the Deir Hafer area, instead of being expelled by a military offensive.

"I hope it doesn't come to that point ..., but when problems are not solved through dialogue, unfortunately, I see from here that the use of force is also an option for the Syrian government," Fidan said on Thursday.

If fighting spills into Deir el-Zor, it could draw in local Arab tribes who complain of marginalisation and forced conscription of tribesmen into the SDF, according to the Syrian military officials and two tribal leaders.

Shayesh al-Mulhem, a leader of the Jabbour tribe, said it was awaiting orders from Sharaa to turn against the SDF.

"The SDF is doomed to disappear. There can't be a state within a state, and there can't be a faction on Syrian land that is against the state," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:45:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T732ZACHLRPQLIQZTGOIIKYQS4.jpg?auth=2e07a5cca59db359b1a858db38a8e62fb263abce78bafb11a2b2c2f289aa7f6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Children in Ukraine risk hypothermia after Russian attacks, aid groups say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/children-ukraine-risk-hypothermia-after-russian-attacks-aid-groups-say-2026-01-16/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Children across Ukraine risk hypothermia in freezing temperatures as emergency stocks of power generators run low following Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, international aid agencies said on Friday.

The U.N. children's agency UNICEF said it faced a race against time to help restore water and heating services that have been pounded in missile and drone attacks as the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine approaches.

"Children and families are in constant survival mode," UNICEF Country Representative for Ukraine Munir Mammadzade told reporters in Geneva.

Mammadzade said people were trying to stay safe from strikes on high-rise buildings while temperatures sank to around minus 18 degrees Celsius (minus 0.4 Fahrenheit) at night.

Some families are stuffing their windows with soft toys to block out the freezing cold, UNICEF said.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday he would declare a state of emergency in the energy sector. Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Friday Ukraine had fuel reserves for more than 20 days.

Kyiv and frontline regions face the harshest conditions, with thousands of homes in the capital as well as in Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and frontline towns left without electricity or heating for days on end.

"Without heat, people are at high risk for hypothermia, frostbite and respiratory illnesses," said Jaime Wah, Deputy Head of Delegation in Kyiv for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, adding that unpredictable power cuts disrupted the water supply and healthcare provision.

"It's unbearable to live in apartments with no heating or electricity. Families (in Kyiv) are resorting to consider leaving the city."

Pre-positioned stockpiles of sleeping kits, generators and repair materials for buildings are running low because of the increasing need and limited funding.

An IFRC funding appeal for Ukraine and impacted countries is only 13% covered for 2026 and 2027, leaving a funding gap of 262 million Swiss francs($326.93 million), it said.

UNICEF said it was providing high-capacity generators to support heating and water supplies to hospitals and schools, but called for more funding.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:45:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UMGY5MPQVZOKPNJZMDVXZJPAVI.jpg?auth=c728939b95a496659a245d7e55e674d67c00da1c3607d04e6b542cadf984950f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 422,000 people signed contracts with Russian army in 2025, a drop from the previous year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-422000-people-signed-contracts-with-russian-army-2025-drop-previous-2026-01-16/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Russian Security Council deputy chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that 422,704 people had signed contracts with the Russian Armed Forces last year, state news agencies reported.

The number of sign-ups is lower than in 2024, when about 450,000 people signed contracts to join the Russian army.

Medvedev, a former Russian president, was speaking at a meeting of fellow security officials about drone technology in video shared by Russian news agencies.

President Vladimir Putin said in his end-of-year news conference in December that recruitment among drone operators was particularly strong in 2025.

Some 32,000 people had also joined volunteer brigades and gone off to fight in Ukraine last year, Medvedev added on Friday, according to news agencies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:45:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/42HU7G6IHBNYLDZKWHR55WFFFY.jpg?auth=9b7b6a863067b96e756f4e02388d30e1058cae54353aa79c198f4825d27b77e4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: What is the status of Iran's main nuclear facilities?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-status-irans-main-nuclear-facilities-2026-01-16/</link><description>VIENNA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Regional fears of a U.S. attack on Iran have eased after President Donald Trump said Tehran had assured him that protesters would not be executed, but he is keeping "all of his options on the table", the White House said.

The last major strikes on Iran were carried out by Israel and the United States in June, mainly targeting key nuclear facilities .

All three of Iran's uranium-enrichment plants - two at Natanz and one buried inside a mountain at Fordow - as well as a sprawling complex at Isfahan, which includes facilities that are part of the nuclear fuel cycle and an underground area where diplomats say much of Iran's enriched uranium has been stored.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog, which carried out regular inspections at nuclear facilities including Natanz and Fordow until they were attacked, has not been granted access to those facilities since they were bombed.

It has inspected other facilities that were not damaged but the exact status of the ones that were remains unclear.

In a quarterly report on Iran in November, the International Atomic Energy Agency said seven of its declared nuclear facilities were "affected by the military attacks" and 13 were not. Those reports do not elaborate on the damage done.

Soon after the bombings the IAEA said the smallest of the three enrichment plants, the above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz, was destroyed . It is likely the larger underground plants at Natanz and Fordow were at least badly damaged , the IAEA has said.

How far Iran's nuclear programme has been set back is subject to debate. Trump has repeatedly said Iran's nuclear facilities were obliterated, but IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said in June that Iran could start enriching uranium again on a more limited scale within months .

That is not entirely clear. Some will have been destroyed in the airstrikes, but Iran has yet to submit a report to the IAEA on what happened to its bombed facilities and stock of enriched uranium despite the agency saying it is urgent and overdue. Only once that happens can the IAEA verify it.

"I believe there is a general understanding that by and large, the material is still there. But, of course, it needs to be verified. Some could have been lost," Grossi told Reuters in September. Diplomats say little appears to have changed since then.

"We don't have indications that would lead us to believe that there has been major movement of material," Grossi added.

Iran was enriching uranium to up to 60% purity, a short step from the roughly 90% of weapons grade, until the strikes.

The IAEA estimates Iran had 440.9 kg of uranium enriched to that level when the bombing started. That is enough in theory, according to an IAEA yardstick, for 10 nuclear weapons, if refined further. It also has uranium enriched to lower levels.

The IAEA does not report where Iran stores that material. One key storage installation underground at Isfahan appears not to have been damaged beyond strikes on the tunnel entrance leading to it, diplomats say.

One reason the United States and Israel gave for the bombings was that Iran was getting too close to being able to produce a nuclear weapon. If enriched to weapons grade, uranium can be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb. It can also be used to fuel nuclear power plants at various enrichment levels.

Western powers say there is no credible civil justification for Iran's enrichment to such a high fissile level, and the IAEA has said it is of serious concern. No other country has done so without eventually producing nuclear weapons.

At the same time, before the attacks the IAEA said it had no credible indication of a coordinated nuclear weapons programme in Iran, and there was much debate about how long it would take Iran to develop a nuclear bomb if it chose to.

Tehran denies ever seeking nuclear weapons. As a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has the right to enrich for nuclear power or research, as long as it does not weaponise the process.

Iran has an unknown number of centrifuges - machines that can enrich uranium - stored at unknown locations. With its enriched uranium stock now unaccounted for, there is a risk that Iran could secretly put the two together and quickly produce weapons-grade uranium, in violation of its NPT obligations.

For now, it appears likely a cat-and-mouse hunt for Iran's enriched uranium stock will continue for some time.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:46:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PDA74UOVHFIZTLCR6IDAFYPHIQ.jpg?auth=1a3ba6d8e07d95df2d8519590fc233296d80c6ebd518243ba52310a2ad3e7213&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz to raise migrant returns in talks with Syrian leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/germanys-merz-raise-migrant-returns-talks-with-syrian-leader-2026-01-16/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will raise topics including the political transition in Syria and the return of migrants to their homeland in talks with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Berlin next Tuesday, a government spokesperson said on Friday.

"We have an interest in deepening relations and, if you like, making a fresh start with the new Syrian government," the spokesperson said. "We have many important issues to address ... One example is the return of Syrians to their home country."

Merz's conservative predecessor Angela Merkel oversaw a historic open-doors policy towards refugees 10 years ago, welcoming around one million migrants to Germany, many of them Syrians fleeing civil war.

Since then, support for the far-right has surged and the conservative CDU party under Merz has pursued a far tougher line on border security and migration, pledging to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians in Germany still hold only temporary residence permits.

The visit marks Sharaa's first visit to Germany since he and his Islamist fighters ousted former President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Sharaa has made a series of foreign trips as his transitional government seeks to re-establish Syria's ties with countries that had shunned Damascus during Assad's rule.

However, violence in Aleppo has tarnished Syria's efforts to rebuild after its devastating civil war, with Kurdish forces resisting efforts by Sharaa's Islamist-led government to bring their fighters under centralised authority.

The German government spokesperson said the violence was being addressed by Berlin during talks with the Syrian side.

"The key question remains how the political transition will be shaped so that all social groups can live in safety and participate equally in political and social life," he said. "It is one of the key topics we are discussing with the Syrian government."</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:46:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XNSKCEORGRJTXO7Q4ECLSVQF3Y.jpg?auth=3a9d69a48e68c03b9b5e3a5f45359108c91f59016ad5da4a037fe3d34709fc35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump envoy says he plans to visit Greenland in March</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-envoy-says-he-plans-visit-greenland-march-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy to Greenland said he plans to visit the Danish territory in March, and that he believes a deal can be made.

Activists say at least 2,637 people have been killed in a brutal crackdown on the protest movement, which kicked off in late December with demonstrations against crippling price rises before escalating into a broader challenge to Iran’s Islamist rulers.

FRANCE 24’s Mariam Pirzadeh spoke to a Tehran resident who took part in some of the largest protests between January 8-10, when the regime dramatically stepped up its deadly riposte.

The eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity and has now sought refuge in Europe, described seeing paramilitary forces fire indiscriminately into the crowds of protesters, seemingly aiming to kill.

He also said he witnessed demonstrators call for the return of the shah, Iran’s pre-revolution monarch, and spoke of their hopes that US President Donald Trump would make good on his promise to come to the “rescue” of protesting Iranians .

Read his account below.

“I went out to protest on Thursday, January 8. There were so many people, I had never seen anything like it. There were millions of us in Tehran. I set off from a northern neighbourhood of the capital; there were people in every street, every thoroughfare. It was extraordinary.

There were mothers with strollers, lots of women, some in chadors (full-body garments that cover the head) shouting “ Javid Shah! ” (“Long live the shah!”), which was unimaginable for me to see. We were all shouting: “Death to the dictator, death to (Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali) Khamenei!”

There was obviously a lot of anger, but we were all peaceful protesters. We felt safe because there were so many of us, united. We told ourselves that they couldn't shoot us. The security forces were there, watching us.”

“I later learned that the security forces had assembled outside Tehran, in Karaj (a town northwest of the capital) in particular. At the end of the march, they opened fire.

The next day, on Friday, even more of us turned out to protest. And there were a lot of them (security forces) on the other side. They began by firing tear gas and flash-balls (a handheld projectile launcher) using metal pellets.

They rode motorcycles in pairs, one driving, the other shooting indiscriminately into the crowd. They aimed for the head and torso, to hit the protesters’ eyes and lungs. Everyone ran away, trying to regroup elsewhere.

The next day, there were more gatherings, with lots of young people. They were ready to fight, with stones in their hands, but the other side had machine guns.

The security forces changed their strategy on Saturday (January 10), riding their motorcycles into smaller streets where people gathered, shooting and then moving on to the next street. I was in a shop when I saw them firing machine guns and assault rifles at a group of people. Twelve people collapsed before my eyes, in a pool of blood.

A friend of mine lost his three children, ages 17, 20 and 23. He found the bodies of his two sons first, and later that of his daughter. She had been shot three times.

The Basij (pro-regime paramilitary force) demanded 400 million tomans per bullet, the equivalent of €2,700 (to recover her body). They said they would declare that she was a Basij, to inflate casualty numbers among the regime's forces, if he couldn't afford to pay.”

“My friend refused. His relatives raised the money to recover the bodies of his three children. Everyone refuses, there is a real spirit of mutual aid.

The dead are so numerous they arrive in dozens of tipper trucks at the morgues and cemeteries. Everyone knows someone who has lost a loved one.

There is no turning back, we want to put an end to the Islamic Republic. I feel once again the atmosphere of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 (which toppled the previous regime).

At the airport, I saw families of regime officials leaving the country. It's impossible to quantify, but some are afraid. We’re living a revolution: We are all thirsty for revenge, we are filled with burning anger.

The only solution for Iranians I talk to, and myself, is Donald Trump: we are waiting for him, like the Messiah.”

During the talks, Kyiv's team also hopes to get clarity from the U.S. on the Russian stance toward U.S.-backed diplomatic efforts to end the war, Zelenskiy told a news conference in Kyiv alongside Czech president Petr Pavel.

U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters earlier this week that he may meet with Zelenskiy at the WEF, a meeting which the Ukrainian leader has publicly sought.

Zelenskiy said that Ukraine had completed its part of the work on the documents outlining a "prosperity package" to unlock money for Ukraine's costly post-war recovery, as well as on U.S. security guarantees designed to stop a future Russian attack. Ukrainian officials have said the country will need $800 billion for its post-war reconstruction.

Trump, who has often criticised Zelenskiy, said on Wednesday that Russia was ready for a peace deal and that he saw the Ukrainian leader as the obstacle to peace, an assessment which stands in stark contrast with that of European allies.

Washington has pushed Ukraine to agree to a peace framework that it will then present to Moscow, while Kyiv and its European allies have sought to ensure that Ukraine will not be attacked again by Russia in future.

On Friday, Zelenskiy said Russia was stalling peace efforts, and cited Moscow's recent strikes on Ukraine's energy system as proof of Moscow's real intentions.

"Each of these strikes against our energy sector and our cities quite clearly shows Russia's real interests and intentions: they are not interested in agreements, but in the further destruction of Ukraine," he posted on social media after the news conference.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:38:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDS4VYUXXZKG3CN6J4MEPINKEM.jpg?auth=cd80e203cd286602d643f58470ddff6852a7e22acc11e36038c91c222d941bc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU executive weighs idea of quick, but limited membership for Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-executive-weighs-idea-quick-limited-membership-ukraine-2026-01-16/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The European Commission is considering ways to allow Ukraine's quick accession to the EU as part of a peace deal with Russia but without giving Kyiv full membership rights, which would only be "earned" after transition periods, EU officials said.

The idea, which is at a very early stage, is intended as a possible gesture to Ukrainians who are seeking EU membership as part of a post-war security guarantee from Europe and who after four years of fighting off a Russian invasion want a credible promise that they are on the path toward economic stability and integration with the West.

Ukrainian EU membership in 2027 was pencilled into a 20-point peace plan discussed between the United States, Ukraine and the European Union, diplomats said, as a measure to ensure Ukraine's economic prosperity after the war ends.

But many EU governments believe that date, or any other fixed date, is completely unrealistic, because EU accession is currently a merit-based process, moving forward only when there is progress in adjusting a country's laws to EU standards.

Joining the bloc also requires signoff from the national parliaments of the EU's 27 member states.

The idea floated by EU officials would see the traditional process reversed, though even limited membership would still require the consent of EU governments and national parliaments.

"We have to recognise that we are in a very different reality than when the (accession) rules were first drawn up," one EU official said.

Ukraine - and potentially other candidates - would join the EU quickly and then get 'staged access' to voting rights, depending on their progress towards meeting the full membership criteria, the official said.

Ukraine has been battling a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022 and became a candidate to join the EU in June that year, with negotiations opened at the end of 2023.

Normally accession talks take years: Poland, with a similar population to Ukraine, needed 10 years, without being at war, to complete negotiations and all the necessary legal changes to be able to join in 2004 along with nine other countries.

But some in the Commission argue that, politically, Ukraine does not have that much time, because a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia could entail territorial losses for Kyiv and be hard for Ukrainians to accept in a possible referendum.

EU membership, even if limited, could make that more palatable and establish the stability needed to complete the necessary reforms to gain full EU rights, officials said.

"It is Europe’s interest to have Ukraine in the EU, because of our own security," an EU diplomat said.

"It is why we need to look for creative solutions - how to get Ukraine in the EU quickly. The reversed membership concept reflects this idea - to have Ukraine joining the EU politically and then getting full rights and full-fledged membership once all conditions are met," the diplomat said.

Membership without full rights on the first day of accession is nothing new -- most countries from the 2004 enlargement and later faced long transition periods to achieve, for example, the right of their citizens to work across the bloc.

But officials are now floating a model that would include more far-reaching limitations. They acknowledged that it would raise a host of questions beyond Ukraine and would struggle to win the unanimous support required.

"It will be a hard sell," a second EU official said. "It also has an impact on countries that have gone the good old traditional way and are close to accession after doing all the homework, like Montenegro or Albania."</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:38:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G7K64KRXRBMQLIO74RECBAKY7U.jpg?auth=68b055a5bed8e27f9cbbafcef000e5799dafea57e756e7a614f5f61934c71370&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Five pro-Palestinian activists plead not guilty over UK military base break-in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/five-pro-palestinian-activists-plead-not-guilty-over-uk-military-base-break-in-2026-01-16/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Five pro-Palestinian activists pleaded not guilty on Friday to breaking into a British military air base and damaging two planes in protest against Britain's support for Israel.

The five are accused of breaking into the Brize Norton Royal Air Force base in central England in June and spraying red paint over two Voyager aircraft used for re-fuelling and transport.

Campaign group Palestine Action, which has since been banned by the government, said it was behind the incident.

Lewie Chiaramello, Jon Cink, Amy Gardiner-Gibson – also known as Amu Gib, Daniel Jeronymides-Norie and Muhammad Umer Khalid appeared at London's Old Bailey court by videolink from prison.

They pleaded not guilty to damaging property and entering a prohibited place for a purpose prejudicial to the interests or safety of the UK.

"Several weeks ago, invitations were extended to individual government representatives from Iran . In light of current events, the Munich Security Conference will not be maintaining these invitations," it said in an emailed statement.

This year's gathering of security experts and policymakers takes place on February 13-15. The organisers said they aimed to invite participants who could provide significant policy insights, but always considered political developments before finalising the list.

The Berlin foreign ministry said Germany was against inviting Iranian officials given the events in Iran, where thousands have been reported killed in a crackdown on demonstrations against clerical rule.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:39:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F6KDDFB74RISTLLRCRHV5M53BY.jpg?auth=937546f4a42c86bd374d38cebdbc01c5cd3975a236de4ae8d173dc689de261b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US claims Iran halts executions of protesters amid crackdown on dissent</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-claims-iran-halts-executions-of-protesters-amid-crackdown-on-dissent</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:40:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/24804b1e-f2d5-11f0-8b41-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-130135-130340-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czechs set to provide Ukraine with drone-fighting jets, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/czechs-set-provide-ukraine-with-drone-fighting-jets-president-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic is set to provide Ukraine with combat planes shortly that can shoot down incoming drones, President Petr Pavel told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Friday.

He did not give specifics but two years ago said Czech-made subsonic L-159 fighter jets could be transferred to Ukraine, which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion for almost four years.

"The Czech Republic can in relatively short time provide several medium combat planes, which are highly effective in fighting drones, and I believe we will manage to quickly and successfully conclude this issue," Pavel told a news conference with Zelenskiy.

He said Prague might also supply early-warning systems such as passive radars.

Pavel, a former army general and head of NATO's Military Committee, has been a strong supporter of Ukraine and a Czech-led initiative supplying Kyiv with large-calibre ammunition paid for by Western donors.

A new Czech government led by populist Andrej Babis has agreed to continue the initiative but pledged not to provide any national funding for aid to Ukraine.

The Czech army has 24 L-159 planes in one- and two-seat configurations, used for training and support for ground forces. Its main fighter jets are 14 Swedish Saab JAS-39 Gripens, but it has ordered 24 American F-35 fighters for delivery after 2030.

Under its previous government, the Czech Republic gave Ukraine heavy equipment including tanks and helicopters from army stocks and received compensation from NATO allies as it rearms with Western weaponry.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:24:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ALQ54BSUURJ2TPYZV2SYXSILY4.jpg?auth=ba1e0f6294875bfc38eaf37a34031ab8922a6c62b01690167ad1e3e0488abdaf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK teenager who praised Southport murderer jailed for possessing al Qaeda manual</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-teenager-who-praised-southport-murderer-jailed-possessing-al-qaeda-manual-2026-01-16/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A British teenager who praised the killer of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event and said he planned to bomb British rock band Oasis' reunion concert was sentenced to detention on Friday for possession of an al Qaeda manual.

McKenzie Morgan, 18, was arrested at his home in Wales after sending messages on social media platform Snapchat in which he praised Axel Rudakubana, who murdered three girls and stabbed 10 others in July 2024, prosecutor Corinne Bramwell said.

Morgan told a psychiatric nurse on the morning of his arrest in June that he "planned to commit a Rudakubana-style terrorist attack" and had been researching how to stab people, Bramwell told Morgan's sentencing hearing at London's Old Bailey court.

The teenager twice tried to buy a 15-centimetre (6-inch) kitchen knife from Amazon, searched online for local playgrounds and a youth dance academy and put the academy on a document on his mobile phone entitled "places to attack", Bramwell added.

She said Morgan later told another Snapchat user that he planned to bomb the Oasis concert in Cardiff last July 4, the band's first gig of their comeback tour, and claimed to have tried to make the deadly poison ricin.

He was arrested on June 2 and a 188-page al Qaeda training manual was found on one of his electronic devices. Morgan pleaded guilty to a single count of possession of information likely to be of use to a person engaged in terrorism.

Morgan accepted having saved the al Qaeda manual and reading it, but told police he had no intention to commit an attack and simply intended to shock others with his messages.

He has been diagnosed with autism and two psychiatrists assessed Morgan as being vulnerable to being groomed or radicalised online, Bramwell told the court.

Judge Sarah Whitehouse sentenced Morgan to 14 months' detention in a young offenders' institution.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:24:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IK6GGBYC2ZNSFMY3T4ZENG3WMY.jpg?auth=0ec6b309c1ae96b13da1a0fcb05db8da2b49a2a2ed5381390257abdd52d2920c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece plans extension of territorial waters despite Turkish warning</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/greece-plans-extension-territorial-waters-despite-turkish-warning-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - Greece plans to extend its territorial waters further, including potentially in the Aegean Sea, Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said on Friday, despite Turkey's long-standing threat of war should Athens take such a step.

The NATO allies, but historic rivals, have eased tensions in recent years but remain at odds over where their continental shelves begin and end in the Aegean - an area believed to hold significant energy potential and with implications for overflights and airspace.

Greece has already extended its territorial waters in the Ionian Sea to 12 nautical miles from six, following agreements with Italy, and it has signed a maritime delimitation deal with Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean.

But it has avoided similar moves in the Aegean, where Ankara objected sharply.

In 1995, the Turkish parliament declared a "casus belli", or cause for war, if Greece unilaterally extended its waters beyond six nautical miles in the Aegean, a position Athens says violates international maritime law.

Answering questions in parliament on Friday, Gerapetritis said further expansion was expected.

"Today, our sovereignty in the Aegean Sea extends to six nautical miles," Gerapetritis said. "As there was an agreement with Egypt, as there was an agreement with Italy, there will also be a (further) extension of the territorial waters."

He didn't specify which maritime areas could be extended.

Turkey's Foreign Ministry was not immediately available for comment.

In July, Greece took another step by unveiling the boundaries of two planned marine parks in the Ionian and Aegean seas. The Aegean park, covering 9,500 square kilometres (3,668 square miles), would initially expand around the southern Cyclades islands, further south of Turkey, according to the maps submitted by Athens. The announcement has drawn objections from Ankara.

Greece says the only issue it is prepared to discuss with Turkey is the demarcation of their maritime zones, including the continental shelf and an exclusive economic zone.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:24:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6CQ4RLROQVJIXGFNUOUCWXM3NU.jpg?auth=562dda298b03d4e1a5306c54177a864806c684e99dfe635dee23264fa17d48e8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainians brave winter cold as Russia targets energy infrastructure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ukrainians-brave-winter-cold-as-russia-targets-energy-infrastructure</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:25:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4da130b4-f2e2-11f0-b8b0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-041236-041438-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Civilians flee Kurdish-held region in northern Syria ahead of army deadline</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/civilians-flee-kurdish-held-region-in-northern-syria-ahead-of-army-deadline</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:25:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/38b74ee6-f2e1-11f0-8020-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-141607-141743-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanon detains Syrian who helped funnel funds to pro-Assad fighters, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-detains-syrian-who-helped-funnel-funds-pro-assad-fighters-sources-say-2026-01-16/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Lebanon has arrested a Syrian national who was helping senior associates of ousted president Bashar al-Assad finance fighters as part of a plot to destabilise Syria's new ruling order, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.

Ahmad Dunya was detained earlier this week, according to two Lebanese security sources and two of his former associates. The Lebanese security sources did not say what charges were linked to his arrest or if he would be extradited to Syria.

Reuters could not immediately reach Dunya or his legal counsel for comment.

His arrest came nearly a month after top Syrian security officials asked Lebanon to track down and hand over more than 200 officers who fled there after Assad was overthrown by rebel forces in December 2024 following 14 years of civil war.

That request followed a Reuters investigation that detailed rival plots being pursued by former Assad cohorts to finance potential Alawite militant groups in Lebanon and along the Syrian coast through financial intermediaries.

Dunya was one of those intermediaries and funnelled money from Rami Makhlouf, Assad's billionaire cousin who now lives along with the ex-Syrian dictator in exile in Moscow, to prospective fighters in Lebanon and Syria, Reuters found.

A former associate of Dunya's and a Syrian figure close to Makhlouf both confirmed that Dunya was a key financial conduit for his funds and was detained in Lebanon. The two sources said he managed extensive financial records, including payroll tables and financial receipts.

In recent months, Dunya had been skimming off the top of Makhlouf's transfers, according to the two Syrian sources.

The Reuters investigation found that Makhlouf had spent at least $6 million on salaries and equipment for prospective fighters. Some of the financial records uncovered claimed that Makhlouf spent $976,705 in May, and that one group of 5,000 fighters received $150,000 in August.

A Lebanese security source said there were likely dozens of other financial handlers like Dunya still operating in Lebanon on behalf of Assad's former associates.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:51:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli soldiers kill Palestinian teen in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-soldiers-kill-palestinian-teen-west-bank-2026-01-16/</link><description>RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian hurling a rock at them in the occupied West Bank, the military said on Friday, and the Palestinian health ministry said the person killed was a 14-year-old boy.

There was no further comment from Palestinian officials about the fatal incident in the village of Al-Mughayyir. Official Palestinian news agency WAFA said the teen was killed during an Israeli military raid that led to confrontations.

The Israeli military said its forces were called to the area after receiving reports that Palestinians were throwing stones at Israelis and blocking a road with burning tyres.

The soldiers fired warning shots in an attempt to repel a person who was running at them with a rock, the military said, and then shot and killed him to eliminate the danger.

Violence has surged over the past year in the West Bank. Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians have risen sharply, while the military has tightened movement restrictions and carried out sweeping raids in several cities.

Palestinians have also carried out attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, some of them deadly.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:51:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cubans rally against US 'imperialists' before Havana embassy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-rally-against-us-imperialists-before-havana-embassy-2026-01-16/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Thousands of Cubans gathered before the U.S. embassy in Havana at daybreak Friday to protest against what they denounced as U.S. aggression in the region following the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicola Maduro, a Cuban ally.

Tension between the two longtime rivals has spiked since the U.S. attack on Venezuela , which resulted in the deaths of 32 Cuban military and intelligence officers believed to be defending Maduro were killed, marking the first clashes between U.S. and Cuban forces in decades.

Cubans bundled in hats and jackets gathered on the capital`s Malecon waterfront boulevard waving Cuban and Venezuelan flags under gray skies as blustery winds and waves buffeted the coast.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, dressed in olive-green military garb and with his back to the U.S. embassy, called on Cubans to remain united in the face of U.S. pressure.

"No, imperialists, we have absolutely no fear of you...and we don`t like to be threatened," he said, turning to wave his finger at the embassy building. "You will not intimidate us."

Both sides have ratcheted up political rhetoric in recent days, marking a new low in long frosty relations between the U.S. and communist-run Cuba, which lies 90 miles (145 km)from the shores of Florida.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that no more Venezuelan oil or money would go to Cuba, warning Havana to make a deal before it's "too late."

Diaz-Canel said after Trump's comments that Cuba would defend its homeland "to the last drop of blood."</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:24:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RIY2BKWB5RJJXPC2IV6LTWJLII.jpg?auth=b965704b89ddbced2ed529e524f82fd15694294802065f181a58de214ef2c132&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over half of Ukrainians oppose pulling back in return for security, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/over-half-ukrainians-oppose-pulling-back-return-security-poll-shows-2026-01-16/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A majority of Ukrainians would strongly oppose withdrawing troops from the part of the eastern Donetsk region still controlled by Kyiv in exchange for European and U.S. security guarantees, a poll released on Friday indicated.

Ukraine, wary of unmet commitments in the past, is pushing for legally binding security guarantees to prevent any future Russian aggression.

Ukraine is under U.S. pressure to agree quickly to a peace deal , but has refused to accept Russian demands that it cede land it still controls in eastern Donbas , a large mineral-rich industrial area comprising the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Russia controls almost all of Luhansk, but Kyiv still holds about 20% of Donetsk, including a string of strategically vital garrison towns and defensive lines.

According to the poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), 54% of Ukrainians categorically reject the idea of withdrawing from parts of Donbas in return for security reassurances from allies.

Some 39% said they would reluctantly accept.

"Moreover, those who are ready to agree expect quite significant security guarantees. Therefore, if the level of security guarantees is lower than expected, approval of such a proposal will be even lower," said KIIS executive director Anton Hrushetskyi.

The survey was conducted in early January among 601 respondents on Ukrainian-controlled territory.

Almost 70% did not believe current negotiations would lead to a lasting peace.

Some 57% believed Russia would attack again in the event of a ceasefire at the current frontlines and security guarantees from allies.

However, even if security guarantees were given, 40% believed the U.S. would not provide support in the event of renewed Russian invasion, while 39% thought it would.

Russia has publicly shown little interest in scaling down its demands and made few comments regarding the 20-point peace framework that Ukraine and the U.S. have been trying to finalise.

Instead, Russia has stepped up air strikes, significantly damaging already shattered energy infrastructure and leaving millions without power and heating in freezing temperatures.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:48:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TE3FKKUMBNJIFIFMSKZLE356SA.jpg?auth=8ff225d7eaa4c9b4cd48f9184aabf2821431478355a47f1c7af0abb78807ec9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son of Iran's last Shah appeals for more pressure to help protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/son-irans-last-shah-appeals-more-pressure-help-protesters-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 - Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi on Friday urged the international community to ramp up pressure on the Iranian government to help protesters overthrow clerical rule, even as a deadly crackdown appears to have broadly quelled demonstrations.

Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's toppled shah, held a news conference in Washington D.C. on Friday morning to call for political, economic and military pressure on Tehran.

He said that "large sections" of the Iranian army and security forces have "whispered" their loyalty to him and that he is uniquely positioned to ensure a stable transition for the country.

Having emerged as a prominent voice in the country's opposition, Pahlavi, 65, seeks to play a role in Iran's future even as President Donald Trump earlier this week expressed uncertainty over his ability to muster support within the country.

"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully," Pahlavi said.

U.S.-based Pahlavi has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran's opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions - including the monarchists who back Pahlavi - and appears to have little organised presence inside the Islamic Republic.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the unrest against clerical rule.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:48:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BZ6QHM6PHJIL3K2UGJJZMNRE44.jpg?auth=487af823c55ab1da5b18d5d75140f8d2e2c5a40bca9fc430a12e4d6cd783c7b3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Suspects in Russian-led explosive parcels plot face life sentences, Poland says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/suspects-russian-led-explosive-parcels-plot-face-life-sentences-poland-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Five men have been charged in Poland with taking part in a Russian-run sabotage plot to send explosive parcels to Britain, the U.S., Canada and other destinations, and will face life sentences if convicted, prosecutors said on Friday.

The four Ukrainian citizens and one Russian were charged "with acting ... on behalf of the intelligence services of the Russian Federation," the National Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.

There was no immediate reaction from Russia which has regularly denied accusations of stepping up sabotage attacks in the region following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Moscow says the West is trying to stoke anti-Russian feeling.

The five were accused of committing or preparing acts of sabotage against logistics and aviation infrastructure, the prosecutors' statement read.

One, named as Vladyslav D., was planning to prepare parcels with hidden incendiary devices and explosives and forward them for shipment to Britain and Poland, the statement said.

Another, Viacheslav C., was planning "future sabotage activities" including the sending of two test packages to the U.S. and Canada, it added.

A third, Vladyslav B., was accused of receiving, securing and transporting packages between Lithuania's capital Vilnius and its central city of Kaunas, the statement said.

The prosecutors said they had presented five bills of indictment to a court which will now take over the case.

"The accused face a sentence of life imprisonment," National Prosecutor's Office spokesperson Przemyslaw Nowak said.

The sabotage plot led to three parcels being detonated at courier depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in 2024, a person familiar with the Polish investigation told Reuters last year.

Massage pillows were packed with homemade incendiary devices made of a cocktail of chemicals including highly reactive magnesium into the parcels with the cosmetics and sex toys, the source said.

Last year, Lithuania separately said that detonations of parcels carried by DHL were organised and supervised by Russian citizens with ties to Russian military intelligence.

Charges were not formally presented to a sixth suspect Jaroslaw. M., a Russian citizen. Poland has been trying to extradite him from Azerbaijan, prosecutors said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:48:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2KKBIH2QRRLBPBQ47XYXEJITQ4.jpg?auth=22bc47887f817466c8edf1bc1d608e1221b62bf624e76a82a157e4b778a5dc31&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv has only half of the electricity it needs, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kyiv-has-only-half-electricity-it-needs-mayor-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.

Kyiv, one of Eastern Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity a day to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.

Klitschko said the current energy crisis was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.

"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity," Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview in his office at the heart of Kyiv.

Klitschko said Ukraine's international partners had rushed in additional generators and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian strike last week knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings. About 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.

Ukraine has declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles under Russian bombardments, bitter cold temperatures and accumulated wartime damage.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:48:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QXFUYQRNKNKJ7E7QAAXTCLJ5AQ.jpg?auth=7320338d2bf3040a77baecb2240d22ad4ffbe07b48780086b69e7b8d86221919&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Latest US sanctions target Houthi funding networks, Treasury says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/latest-us-sanctions-target-houthi-funding-networks-treasury-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration issued fresh sanctions on Friday further targeting the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen and the transfer of oil products, weapons and other so-called dual-use equipment that it said helped fund the group.

The action targets 21 individuals and entities as well as one vessel, including some alleged front companies in Yemen, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement.

"The Houthis threaten the United States by committing acts of terror and attacking commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the statement.

The move builds on previous Treasury action to pressure the Houthis "vast revenue generation and smuggling networks, which enable the group to sustain its capability to conduct destabilizing regional activities," including the Red Sea attacks, the department added.

Since 2023, the Houthis have launched numerous assaults on vessels in the Red Sea that they deem to be linked with Israel in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war on Gaza.

The two officers in their 20s, who were arrested last July and remain in custody, are accused of torture, acts of cruelty and abuse of power, according to the indictment signed by Lisbon Prosecutor Felismina Franco last week and seen by Reuters.

One of them also faces charges of rape, robbery and forgery.

The document described one incident in which the policemen beat up a Moroccan immigrant inside a police station for several hours, making him kiss their boots as one shouted in English: "Welcome to Portugal!"

"The victims were systematically picked from among particularly vulnerable people, namely homeless, physically weak, economically challenged," the prosecutor wrote.

"This circumstance reveals acts of pure and gratuitous violence aimed at those who were unable to offer resistance."

The Interior Ministry told Reuters it "profoundly laments such behaviour and all actions that infringe upon citizen rights... which do not represent the general behaviour of police professionals".

The General Inspectorate has opened a separate inquiry to investigate other police officers, the ministry said.

The Portuguese branch of rights group Amnesty International, which said it had received information about more cases of torture, said the sharing of images and messages about their acts in chats and social media "shows an enormous sense of impunity" by the officers, although it welcomed the fact that the crimes had been denounced from within the law enforcement community.

It called for an external and independent police supervision agency to be set up and for more cameras to be installed at police stations, in cars and for officers to use body cams when interacting with people.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:29:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela acting president, opposition leader navigate new relations with Trump administration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-acting-president-opposition-leader-navigate-new-relations-with-trump-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The CIA director met with Venezuela's interim leader in Caracas and the country's opposition leader was due to speak to reporters in Washington on Friday as the two sides navigate their new relationships with U.S. President Donald Trump following his administration's attack early this year.

Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe is the most senior known U.S. official to meet with Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's acting president, since Trump attacked Caracas on January 3, capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a socialist, and his wife.

The two met on Thursday, the same day that Maria Corina Machado , the leader of Venezuela's liberal opposition party, met Trump at the White House, where she gave him the medal she had received after being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, an honor Trump has publicly coveted.

Machado is due to discuss her meeting with reporters on Friday at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington with close ties to the Trump administration. After leaving the White House on Thursday, she described the meeting as excellent. Trump, in turn, warmly thanked Machado for the medal, describing it on social media as "a wonderful gesture of mutual respect."

In Caracas, Rodriguez appeared to deride Machado as she gave her first State of the Union address on Thursday, telling Venezuelans that if she should visit Washington, "I will do so with my head held high, walking, not on my knees."

Ratcliffe, the CIA chief, met with Rodriguez at Trump's direction "to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship," according to a U.S. official.

The two of them discussed intelligence cooperation, economic stability and the need to ensure Venezuela was no longer a "safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narco-traffickers," according to the U.S. official.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:30:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XXIFT3YG2NJYXBGAHN2TJKLQKU.jpg?auth=09c9b4ef5d9de100570e7dec3d02b76afdd3ff9e5b39a2e3c9dbffbb9ebb77e8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens tariffs on countries not backing US takeover of Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260116-trump-threatens-tariffs-countries-not-backing-us-takeover-of-greenland</link><description>President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the US controlling Greenland , a message that came as a Congressional delegation met Danish and Greenlandic lawmakers in Copenhagen and sought to lower tensions .

Trump for months has insisted that the US should control Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark , and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in US hands would be “unacceptable”.

“I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland,” he said Friday, without providing details. “We need Greenland for national security.”

He had not previously mentioned using tariffs to try to force the issue.

Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio .

That encounter didn’t resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group – on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views.

Concentration camp memorial sites and documentation centres expressed deep concern in a letter this week at a tide of so-called AI Slop, or falsified images, around the Nazis' killing of more than six million Jews during World War Two.

Images included highly emotionalized illustrations of invented incidents such as meetings of concentration camp inmates and their liberators or children behind barbed wire.

"AI-generated content distorts history by trivialising and kitschification," said the organizations' January 13 letter, adding that such images helped fuel mistrust among users of authentic historical documents.

Germany's state minister for culture and media Wolfram Weimer said he supported efforts by the memorial institutions for AI-generated imagery to be clearly marked and, where necessary, removed.

"This is a matter of respect for the millions of people who were killed and persecuted under the Nazi regime of terror," he said in an email to Reuters.

AI companies, notably Elon Musk's xAI , which runs the chatbot Grok, are also under pressure over thousands of sexualised deepfake images of women and minors spread online.

The memorial institutions said the imagery appeared in part aimed at generating attention and earning money and in part intended to "dilute historical facts, shift victim and perpetrator roles, or spread revisionist narratives".

The institutions include memorial centres for Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald, Dachau and other concentration camps where Jews, as well as others including Roma and Sinti people, sexual minorities and disabled people, were killed.

They said social media platforms should move proactively against fake AI imagery around the Holocaust rather than waiting for users to report it, ensuring it was clearly marked and preventing it from being monetized.

The spread of low-quality AI Slop, which can consist of fake text, images or video has raised alarm among many experts that it will pollute the information landscape and make it increasingly hard for users to distinguish between truth and falsehood.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:28:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MYNENBR6BNNNBKPP74FMF345A4.jpg?auth=e1027fa0f0cc247c3b3c0daeab0df860f149a0c4df7b3a9cda982b3f17ddad9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to pardon former Puerto Rico governor Vazquez, CBS News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pardon-former-puerto-rico-governor-vazquez-cbs-news-reports-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is issuing a pardon to Puerto Rico's former Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced, who was previously indicted in a federal corruption case, CBS News reported on Friday, citing multiple sources.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:28:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DPGIKJND4VPF5PPGZXWLZGMBXI.jpg?auth=8f4078d0c1a3d8df988f97f0509840ebe1973ea194b74980ce1939e009f7d0b4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to pardon former Puerto Rico governor Vazquez, CBS News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pardon-former-puerto-rico-governor-vazquez-cbs-news-reports-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Arrests reported by official media for first time since Tehran protests began</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/arrests-reported-by-official-media-for-first-time-since-tehran-protests-began</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:29:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a5d6522c-f2f7-11f0-b8d6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-170202-170256-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to pardon former Puerto Rico governor Vazquez</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-pardon-former-puerto-rico-governor-vazquez-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is issuing a pardon to Puerto Rico's former Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced, who was previously indicted in a federal corruption case, a White House official confirmed on Friday.

Trump is also pardoning Vazquez's co-defendants Julio Martin Herrera Velutini and Mark Rossini, CBS News, which first reported the development, said.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her medal on Thursday to Trump, who thanked her for it. The White House released a photo of Trump and Machado, with Trump holding up a gold-coloured frame displaying it, and a White House official said Trump intends to keep it.

Machado's award also consists of a diploma and 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.19 million).

"Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize," the award body said in a statement.

"There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money. This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items," it added.

The medal and the diploma are physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the prize, said the five-strong award committee.

"The prize itself – the honour and recognition – remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee," it said.

The committee, which did not refer to Trump and Machado by name in its statement, said it does not comment on a laureate's statements, decisions or actions after the prize is announced.

It was not the first time a Nobel laureate has given away the medal. In 1943 Nobel literature laureate Knut Hamsun gave his to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.

In 2022, Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov sold his medal for $100 million to raise money for the U.N. children's fund UNICEF to help Ukrainian refugee children.

In 2024, the widow of former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan donated his 2001 Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma to the U.N. office in Geneva.

Trump says Greenland is vital to U.S. security and has not ruled out the use of force to take it. European nations this week sent small numbers of military personnel to the island at Denmark's request.

"We don't see any Russian or Chinese vessels around Greenland... there are Chinese and Russian vessels in the Arctic Ocean, but not near Greenland," Major General Soren Andersen told Reuters.

Speaking on board a Danish warship in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, Andersen said that he had extended an invitation for the United States to join exercises planned on the island this year.

"We had a meeting today with a lot of NATO partners including the U.S. and invited them to participate in this exercise," said Andersen. When asked if the Americans will join, the general replied "I don't know that yet."

Denmark's Joint Arctic Command enforces sovereignty and conducts surveillance, fisheries inspection and search-and-rescue across Greenland and the Faroe Islands, drawing on patrol vessels, aircraft, helicopters and satellite-based monitoring.

Headquartered in Nuuk, it also fields Greenland's Sirius dog-sled patrol for long-range land operations and maintains about 150 staff across command, logistics and fixed Arctic stations.

Responding to Trump's criticism that Denmark does too little to defend Greenland, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) Arctic defence package .</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:34:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FEV5ZOF56BP2NCLOFPBWVZ7KNM.jpg?auth=6ca21fd35b11db918e6dbc00354127288854d4b986a56ec176a7c3f9933c81e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula says EU and Mercosur will make history with signing of trade agreement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-says-eu-mercosur-will-make-history-with-signing-trade-agreement-2026-01-16/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Friday said the European Union and the South American bloc Mercosur are about to make history with the signing of a free trade agreement over the weekend, ending 25 years of negotiations between them.

The event was not an isolated episode. The Washington Post on Friday reported the January 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, while in ICE custody, citing a medical examiner who believes his death to be a homicide. A fellow detainee said he witnessed Luna Campos being choked by guards.

Such incidents have come to characterise what is now the most aggressive immigration enforcement surge the city – and perhaps the country – has seen in decades.

The day before Good was killed, Washington announced the deployment of roughly 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis–St. Paul area. In the days following her death, an additional 1,000 officers from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) were deployed to the city, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hailing its “largest immigration operation ever.”

Caught in the chaos of a raid, Minneapolis City Council president Elliott Payne said the presence of heavily armed agents in combat gear felt “ like an occupying force ”.

Rather than de-escalate, Trump has threatened to go further. On Thursday, he raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy troops in response to civil unrest.

“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,” Trump wrote on social media, promising to “quickly put an end to the travesty”.

The starting point of the escalation was relatively innocuous. The Trump administration initially alleged financial irregularities involving Somali-run daycare centres in Minnesota as justification for the first raids. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the United States, estimated at around 84,000, most of whom are US citizens .

A far-right influencer posted a video in late December alleging fraud at daycare centres run by Somali-Americans. Citing the video , the Trump administration suspended $185 million in funding to Minnesota pending a review of the childcare centres in question. The administration followed up in January by suspending another $10 billion in federal funding for childcare subsidies to hundreds of thousands of households in five Democratic states, including Minnesota.

The decision to target the Somali community echoed Trump’s own rhetoric. In December, he said Somalis should not be welcome in the United States, comparing them to “garbage” . DHS reinforced the message in a post on X announcing the end of a temporary protected status: “Our message is clear. Go back to your own country, or we’ll send you back ourselves.”

What followed bore little resemblance to a targeted investigation. Residents reported agents sweeping through residential neighbourhoods and the parking lots of big-box stores, stopping people seemingly at random to demand their immigration status . "Masked men" broke into a north Minneapolis home without a judicial warrant, arresting a 38-year-old Liberian man as his wife and 9-year-old stepdaughter were inside, local public radio outlet MPR News reported .

Operation “Metro Surge” has brought together a rarely seen patchwork of agencies far from the border: three-quarters are from ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, AP reported , working alongside agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).

This blending of uniforms, mandates and chains of command made it nearly impossible for civilians to know who was stopping them, under what authority, and what rights they retained.

The scale of coordination reflects a strategy first developed at the southern border. Shortly after returning to office in January 2025, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, triggering a significant mobilisation involving DHS, ICE, CBP, the National Guard and US Northern Command.

With the events in Minnesota, the same emergency logic and the same mix of civilian and quasi-military forces are now being applied hundreds of miles from the border.

Minneapolis is the most dramatic example so far, but not the only one. Federal immigration surges have already taken place or are planned in cities including Chicago, Phoenix, Denver, New York and Los Angeles.

Trump has shown little interest in calming tensions, using florid and almost biblical language to describe the continuing operation.

“FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA,” he wrote on Truth Social. “THE DAY OF RECKONING &amp; RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”

Immigration attorney Scott Shuchart says Minnesota offered a perfect opportunity for the Trump administration, which was looking for an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act as Trump has threatened to do.

“The administration has been trying to pick this fight, trying to find a place [resisting] enough to have an excuse to declare an insurrection and use more force,” Shuchart said. “Minneapolis was the next target. It’s ideal for them – it has a large Somali immigrant population, and there is [Minnesota Representative] Ilhan Omar, whom Trump hates. His people are very angry and, frankly, racist.”

Unlike law enforcement agents like police, who are trained in de-escalation tactics, ICE officers appear to relish doing the opposite.

“They are escalating rather than de-escalating,” Shuchart added. “They need this. They don’t want unity: disunity is good for them. Trump has never tried to be more popular or to appeal to the other side. By continuing to feel victimised, he empowers himself politically.”

Minneapolis represents both a symbolic and strategic target: it's a Democratic stronghold, a “ sanctuary city ” where local authorities limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, and a place still nationally associated with protests against police violence over the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Minnesota is also governed by Tim Walz , the Democrats’ 2024 vice-presidential nominee.

According to DHS, the surge is part of a nationwide push to fulfil Trump’s promise to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in American history. ICE has more than doubled its manpower in less than a year, from roughly 10,000 officers to more than 22,000, driven by an aggressive recruitment campaign.

To staff that expansion, barriers to entry have been lowered. Deportation officers must be US citizens, pass a background check and drug screening, and meet basic physical requirements. The job requires carrying a firearm and explicitly authorises the use of deadly force “when necessary”.

Training has been significantly shortened, with NBC reporting that it was cut from 13 weeks to six – a move one former ICE agent described to Time magazine as “a recipe for disaster” .

“New recruits often have minimal education and abbreviated preparation. The danger is that it attracts people who are more loyal to Trump than to professional law enforcement,” said Shuchart, citing far-right, pro-Trump militias such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.

That broader lack of professionalism has fed into another flashpoint in the operation: the use of masks by immigration agents. Acting ICE director Todd Lyons said the practice is intended to prevent officers from being doxxed . But it actually “spurs dangerous impersonations, impedes accountability for officers who are engaged in misconduct, and undermines trust in law enforcement”, the Center for American Progress argued in a report released on August 2025 , when hundreds of officers from nearly 20 federal agencies were deployed to the streets of Washington.

In a confidential bulletin circulated to law enforcement agencies last month, the FBI even warned that criminals across several states have been posing as ICE officers to commit robberies, kidnappings and sexual assaults.

The confusion has been amplified online. High-profile right-wing influencers were granted privileged access to operations, blurring the line between the administration, law enforcement agents and partisan media.

Figures with large followings, including “Dr Phil” McGraw and Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, were repeatedly invited on ride-alongs and allowed to interview senior officials, producing content that framed enforcement actions as necessary and heroic. ICE’s own social media accounts actively promoted the operation, which the Washington Post has described as a broader “media machine” designed to project strength and deter resistance.

Pro-Trump influencer Benny Johnson went even further, wearing a Border Patrol tactical vest to observe a raid at a Walmart in the Chicago area alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem. In a video posted on X, he praised the operation as “amazing”, highlighting what he called “wild scenes”.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:35:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09bba20c-f301-11f0-8378-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016127809169.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Victims of a slaughter: Iranian people have been rising up for decades against the Islamic regime'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/victims-of-a-slaughter-iranian-people-rising-up-for-decades-now-against-the-islamic-regime</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:35:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c00decec-f2ff-11f0-82c0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-211159-211908-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CIA chief meets Venezuela's interim leader to discuss 'potential opportunities'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260116-cia-chief-meets-venezuela-interim-leader-discuss-potential-opportunities</link><description>US Central Intelligence Agency head John Ratcliffe traveled to Venezuela and met leader Delcy Rodriguez , a US administration official said Friday, in the highest-level American visit since the fall of Nicolas Maduro .

President Donald Trump sent the spy chief to Caracas on Thursday for a meeting that lasted approximately two hours, US sources said, less than two weeks after Maduro and his wife were seized in a US military operation.

"At President Trump's direction, Director Ratcliffe traveled to Venezuela to meet with interim president Delcy Rodriguez to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship," the Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Ratcliffe and Rodriguez "discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration, and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narcotraffickers".

The visit came a day after Trump spoke to Rodriguez for the first time – and on the same day that Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace prize at the White House .

Trump has so far backed Rodriguez , Maduro's former vice president and a former vocal ally of the ousted leader, to stay in charge so long as Venezuelan oil keeps flowing.

Ratcliffe sits at Trump's cabinet meetings and is the most senior official to travel to Venezuela since the United States toppled leftist Maduro.

US sources billed the CIA chief's visit as a "trust-building measure" that paved the way for continued communication between Washington and Caracas.

The visit was coordinated between the White House, US State Department and the Pentagon , they added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 19:24:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3415b7ac-f308-11f0-b24c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T150850Z-1604783218-RC22WIAV2FB3-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-CONGRESS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US officials provide shifting accounts of ICE detainee death in Texas military camp</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-officials-provide-shifting-accounts-ice-detainee-death-texas-military-camp-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials on Friday provided a new but incomplete account of an immigrant detainee's death in Texas after a report emerged suggesting it may have been homicide.

The Washington Post on Thursday reported , opens new tab the El Paso County medical examiner is likely to classify the death as a homicide, raising more questions about how it unfolded.

The January 3 death was one of four deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody over a 10-day period at the start of the year. Detention deaths reached a 20-year high in 2025 as President Donald Trump's administration ramped up the number of people held for alleged immigration violations.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security initially said in a January 9 press release it was investigating the death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, which occurred after he experienced "medical distress."

Lunas was being held in Camp East Montana, a detention site opened by the Trump administration inside Fort Bliss that has been criticized by immigrant rights advocates.

DHS did not provide a cause of death, but the Washington Post reported that the medical examiner's office planned to list the cause of death as a lack of oxygen due to pressure on the neck and chest, citing a recording of a conversation between the medical examiner's office and the detainee's daughter.

The Post also interviewed a detainee held at the Camp East Montana site who said he saw guards choking Lunas when he refused to enter solitary confinement.

In a new statement on Friday, a DHS spokesperson said Lunas, who had lived in the U.S. since 1996 and had multiple criminal convictions, attempted to take his own life while detained at the detention site.

DHS said the security staff "immediately intervened to save his life" but that Lunas "violently resisted" the security staff.

"During the ensuing struggle, [Lunas] stopped breathing and lost consciousness," DHS said. "Medical staff was immediately called and responded. After repeated attempts to resuscitate him, EMTs declared him deceased on the scene."

The DHS statement did not mention the Washington Post story. The department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment regarding the report and DHS' decision to issue a new statement on Friday.

The El Paso medical examiner's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the months that follow detainee deaths, ICE typically publishes detailed individual reports, with the last such report published in September 2025.

In a December letter, the American Civil Liberties Union urged ICE and the Defense Department to close Camp East Montana, citing reports and allegations around use of force and poor living conditions.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 19:40:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PZQQAUHEURLPRD2HFMRVWPKMVI.jpg?auth=1cd49fa491ce2dd9030d5c2fe0856cae3727addb84243b057e406416516247df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>FAA issues warnings to airlines on Central, South American flights over potential military actions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/faa-issues-warnings-airlines-central-south-american-flights-over-potential-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it is issuing a series of warnings to airlines to exercise caution when flying over Central America and parts of South America, citing the risks of potential military activities and GPS interference.

In one panicked call after another, witnesses told police what they had seen: Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in the street, several shots fired at a driver, her vehicle slamming into other cars, blood everywhere.

"There's 15 ICE agents and they shot her, like, 'cause she wouldn't open her car door," one caller said, adding a stream of profanities.

"ICE fired shots into her windshield," another caller said, as the operator urged the person to slow their breathing. "She's bleeding."

Later, as Good was being pronounced dead at a local hospital, police were trying to evacuate ICE officers from the scene while angry protesters cut down tape that had been used to secure the area, according to an incident report that recorded communications between emergency responders.

"ICE BEING SURROUNDED," one person transmitted at 11:01 a.m., about 80 minutes after the shooting, according to the report.

The city has seen increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers since Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot on January 7. Protests have spread to other cities, and more demonstrations are expected on Friday evening and this weekend.

Trump and other administration officials have defended the officer, Jonathan Ross, and accused Good of deliberately trying to kill him and other agents at the scene with her car. Videos of the incident show her turning her wheels away from the officers and Democratic city and state officials have rejected the government's account as false.

The Trump administration has said Ross suffered injuries during the incident - although video shows him walking around after shooting Good - while noting he was involved months earlier in another enforcement stop that resulted in him being dragged behind a vehicle.

During that stop, in Bloomington, Minnesota in June 2025, Ross broke Roberto Carlos Munoz-Guatemala's car window during a stop and reached inside his vehicle. Munoz-Guatemala attempted to drive away, dragging Ross with him, according to court records. Munoz-Guatemala was later convicted of assaulting a federal officer.

In trial transcripts obtained by Reuters, an attorney for the defense focused on whether Munoz-Guatemala understood that Ross was a law enforcement officer during the stop, given that Munoz-Guatemala had repeatedly asked Ross who he was.

Ross countered that Munoz-Guatemala "seemed to know who I was just by his demeanor," and asserted that suspects often act confused about the identity of agents.

"I believe a lot of time people are on the phone and they're waiting for people to get - to show up, especially with our line of work. They've got phone trees where they call and then protesters show up," Ross told the court.

The Trump administration has sent nearly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota, adding hundreds of additional officers in the aftermath of the Good shooting.

Trump has said the deployment was prompted in part by allegations of fraud among the state's large Somali-American community. Trump has called Somali immigrants "garbage" and said they should be thrown out of the country.

Minnesota Democrats, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have decried the shooting and accused Trump of intentionally fomenting chaos.

Since the surge began, agents have arrested both immigrants and protesters, at times smashing windows and pulling people from their cars. Some have been shouted at for stopping Black and Latino U.S. citizens and demanding identification.

The Department of Homeland Security said on X that 12 "agitators" were arrested on Thursday night for assaulting law enforcement, without providing more details.

The first 911 call after the Good shooting arrived at 9:38 a.m., and paramedics were on the scene four minutes later, where they found her in her car, not breathing. She had four apparent gunshot wounds, including one to her head and two to her chest.

Emergency personnel attempted to revive her, both at the scene and in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Hospital staff ended those efforts at approximately 10:30 a.m., according to the records.

Meanwhile, back on Portland Street, police were trying to prevent more violence, according to an incident report that recorded communications among first responders at the scene.

"CROWD GETTING HOSTILE," the incident record reads at 9:50 a.m. "CONTACT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FEDS AND HAVE THEM LEAVE SCENE."

At 11:01 a.m., ICE agents were "being surrounded," and protesters were throwing snowballs at them – but not at police, the report says. The agents finally managed to leave the scene by 11:20 a.m.

"CROWD CALMED DOWN NOW THAT ICE IS GONE," it says at 11:38 a.m.

On Friday, at the spot where Good was shot and killed more than a week ago, a makeshift memorial continued to grow and attract clusters of visitors, despite frigid temperatures and falling snow.

Residents have cordoned off the spot where Good's car slammed into a light pole, while hand-painted signs call for justice and include many anti-ICE slogans. Tarps were laid atop mounds of flowers to protect them from the wind and snow.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:23:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K7BSWYP3FFJWLL6OOD7AKZBKZY.jpg?auth=fbedbcdb4e2ad1c06bf9712bced4da90854d884bdebd3f1a5e2bea9ba3075ad4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria's Sharaa grants Kurdish Syrians citizenship, language rights for first time, SANA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrias-sharaa-grants-kurdish-syrians-citizenship-language-rights-first-time-sana-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree affirming the rights of the Kurdish Syrians, formally recognising their language and restoring citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians, state news agency SANA reported on Friday.

Sharaa's decree came after fierce clashes that broke out last week in the northern city of Aleppo, leaving at least 23 people dead, according to Syria's health ministry, and forced more than 150,000 to flee the two Kurdish-run pockets of the city.

The clashes ended after Kurdish fighters withdrew .

The violence in Aleppo has deepened one of the main faultlines in Syria , where al-Sharaa's promise to unify the country under one leadership after 14 years of war has faced resistance from Kurdish forces wary of his Islamist-led government.

The decree for the first time grants Kurdish Syrians rights, including recognition of Kurdish identity as part of Syria's national fabric. It designates Kurdish as a national language alongside Arabic and allows schools to teach it.

It also abolishes measures dating to a 1962 census in Hasaka province that stripped many Kurds of Syrian nationality, granting citizenship to all affected residents, including those previously registered as stateless.

The decree declares Nowruz, the spring and new year festival, a paid national holiday. It bans ethnic or linguistic discrimination, requires state institutions to adopt inclusive national messaging and sets penalties for incitement to ethnic strife.

The Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), that controls the country's northeast, have engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, but there has been little progress .</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:24:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6IWFVYAQPZMR5BRMEVJ7EGM4AM.jpg?auth=d5f92e85d8ce78153bb90982b832c55b43f9dddee8904c7bca3ba17c4d262750&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump offers to restart mediation between Egypt and Ethiopia on Nile River water sharing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/trump-offers-restart-mediation-between-egypt-ethiopia-nile-river-water-sharing-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - The United States is ready to restart mediation between Egypt and Ethiopia to help resolve the issue of Nile River water sharing, President Donald Trump said in a letter to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Friday.

Colombia has been involved in an ongoing internal armed conflict for six decades that has left more than 450,000 dead. Conflict in the Andean nation has involved the military and police forces, leftist guerrillas, criminal gangs formed by former right-wing paramilitaries and drug cartels.

"Colombia is embarking on one of the boldest and most innovative strategies for our national security and defense," Defense Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a video statement.

Colombia's government has approved a budget of $271.1 million for the first phase of the project, Sanchez added.

A meeting with countries and companies interested in the project was held on Friday in Bogotá, though no details were disclosed.

Between 2024 and 2025, Colombia recorded 264 attacks from unmanned drones loaded with explosives. They were registered predominantly across the country's dense jungles and mountainous regions dedicated to the cultivation of coca leaves, the base ingredient in the production of cocaine.

The attacks were attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group.

The drone attacks between 2024 and 2025 left 15 soldiers dead and an additional 153 others wounded, according to official statistics.

In November, Colombia signed a 3.1 billion-euro ($3.6 billion) agreement with the Swedish company Saab to purchase 17 Gripen fighter jets over the next five years.

US President Donald Trump , whose repeated threats to act had included a vow to "take very strong action" if Iran executed protesters, said Tehran's leaders had called off mass hangings .

"I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!" he posted on social media.

Iran has not publicly announced ​plans for such executions or said it had cancelled them.

The protests erupted on December 28 over economic hardship and swelled into widespread demonstrations calling for the end of clerical rule, culminating in mass violence at the end ‍of last week.

According to opposition groups and an Iranian official, more than 2,000 people were killed in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution .

But several residents of Tehran reached by Reuters said the capital had now been comparatively quiet for four days.

Drones were flying over the city, but there had been no ​sign of major protests on Thursday or Friday. Another resident in a northern city on the Caspian Sea said the streets there also appeared calm. The residents declined to be identified ​for their safety.

The prospect of a US attack has retreated since Wednesday, when Trump said he had been told killings in Iran were easing. But more US military assets were expected to arrive in the region, showing the continued tensions.

US allies, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar , conducted intense diplomacy with Washington this week to prevent a US strike, warning of repercussions for the wider region that would ultimately impact the United States, a Gulf official said.

Israel 's intelligence chief David Barnea was also in the US on Friday for talks on Iran, according to a source familiar with the matter, and an Israeli military official said the country's forces were on "peak readiness".

As an internet blackout eased this week, more accounts of the violence have trickled out.

The US is expected to send additional offensive and defensive capabilities to the region, but the exact makeup of those forces and the timing of their arrival was still unclear, a US official said speaking on condition of anonymity.

The US military's Central Command declined to comment, saying it does not discuss ship movements.

Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of Iran's last shah who has gained increasing prominence as an opposition figure, on Friday urged the international community to ramp up pressure on Tehran to help protesters overthrow clerical rule.

"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully," said Pahlavi, whose level of support inside Iran is hard to gauge.

Trump this week appeared to ‌downplay the idea of US backing for Pahlavi, voicing uncertainty that the exiled royal heir who has courted support among Western countries could muster significant backing inside Iran. Pahlavi met US envoy Steve Witkoff last weekend, Axios reported.

Iranian-Kurdish rights group Hengaw said that there had been no protest gatherings since Sunday, but "the security environment remains highly restrictive".

"Our independent sources confirm a heavy military and security presence in ‍cities and towns where protests previously took place, as well as in several locations that did not experience major demonstrations," Norway-based Hengaw said in comments to Reuters.

There were, however, still indications of unrest in some areas. Hengaw reported that a female nurse was killed by direct gunfire from government forces during protests in Karaj, west of Tehran. Reuters was not able to independently verify the report.

The state-affiliated Tasnim news outlet reported that rioters had set fire to a local education office in Falavarjan County, in central Isfahan Province, on Thursday.

An elderly resident of a town in Iran's northwestern region, where many Kurdish Iranians live and which has been the focus for many of the biggest flare-ups, said sporadic protests had continued, though not as intensely.

Describing violence earlier in the protests, she said: "I have not seen scenes like that before."

Video circulating online, which Reuters was able to verify as having been recorded in a forensic medical center in Tehran, showed dozens of bodies lying on floors and stretchers, most in bags but some uncovered. Reuters could not verify the date of the ‍video.

The state-owned Press TV cited Iran's police chief as saying calm had been restored across the country.

A death toll reported by U.S.-based rights group HRANA has increased little since Wednesday, now at 2,677 people, including 2,478 protesters and 163 people identified as affiliated with the government.

Reuters has not been ‌able to independently verify the HRANA death toll. ​An Iranian official told the news agency earlier this week that about 2,000 people had been killed.

The casualty numbers dwarf the death toll from previous bouts of unrest that have been suppressed by the state, including in 2009 and 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:28:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3f415c7a-f322-11f0-bd25-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016436555126.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda: preliminary results begin to emerge</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uganda-preliminary-results-begin-to-emerge</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:28:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/462dcc6a-f31f-11f0-ba04-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260116-2141-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria's Sharaa declares Kurdish a 'national language' following clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260116-syria-sharaa-declares-kurdish-national-language-following-clashes</link><description>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree on Friday declaring Kurdish a "national language", in an apparent gesture of good will towards the minority following clashes in past days .

The move came as the Syrian army warned of new strikes east of Aleppo, despite a meeting between the US-led coalition and Kurdish forces seeking to ease tensions between the two sides.

After driving Kurdish forces from Aleppo city last week, the Syrian army had deployed reinforcements near the Kurdish-controlled Deir Hafer, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) east of the city, ordering Kurdish fighters to leave the area.

On Friday, it issued warnings ahead of strikes on Deir Hafer, saying it would target areas that Kurdish forces were using "as a launching point for their terrorist operations towards the city of Aleppo and its eastern countryside".

In addition to decreeing Kurdish a national language, Sharaa granted the minority national rights and made the Kurdish new year, Nowruz , a national holiday.

The decree also grants nationality to Kurds , as 20 percent of them had been stripped of it under a controversial 1962 census.

The apparent olive branch marks a momentous step in the country where teaching and publishing or broadcasting in Kurdish were effectively prohibited for decades under Assad rule.

The Syrian government has been seeking to extend its authority nationwide following the ousting of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

Under a March deal, the Kurdish de facto autonomous administration in the north and its forces were to be integrated into the state.

But disagreements have stalled its implementation, with fighting repeatedly breaking out and the Kurds calling for a decentralised federal system, which Damascus rejects.

Earlier on Friday, Farhad Shami, spokesman for the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces , said that the US-led anti-jihadist coalition had met with them in Deir Hafer on Friday.

Following the meeting, a Syrian military source said that "a delegation from the Syrian defence ministry entered the Deir Hafer area to negotiate with SDF leaders".

The US envoy for Syria , Tom Barrack, posted on X that he was working "around the clock" to prevent any escalation between Kurdish fighters and government forces, both of which have US backing.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, much of which it captured during the country's civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.

Quoting local authorities in Deir Hafer, Syrian state television reported that "more than 4,000 civilians" had left the Kurdish-controlled region .

AFP correspondents saw some using a rickety bridge to cross a branch of the Euphrates River.

The military had used the same tactic in the city of Aleppo last week, telling civilians to depart before shelling Kurdish-held districts.

"The SDF stopped us from leaving – that's why we used an agricultural back road and then crossed the bridge," said 60-year-old Abu Mohammad, who was accompanied by relatives.

Civilians have been fleeing the area on back roads since Thursday.

Syrian authorities had extended the deadline to flee until Friday, accusing the SDF of preventing civilians from leaving, a claim the group dismissed as "unfounded".

Syria's military called on members of the SDF on Friday to "hurry and defect from this organisation and return to your country and your people".

The SDF in a statement said it believed these calls were intended to "create discord among the region's communities".

On Sunday, government troops took full control of Aleppo city after capturing two Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods.

Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said that capture of Aleppo's Kurdish-held areas "doesn't change the military balance" but shows that Damascus "can impose costs when negotiations stall".

While Syria's government "cannot replicate" this scenario in the northeast, "it can apply sustained pressure along contact lines" like Deir Hafer.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e4aa635c-f316-11f0-ae06-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-87E99FR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge says visa warranted for 'mistake' of deporting college student</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-says-visa-warranted-mistake-deporting-college-student-2026-01-17/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:44:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US names Rubio, Blair and Kushner in Gaza board under Trump's plan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-names-rubio-blair-kushner-gaza-board-under-trumps-plan-2026-01-17/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:45:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UN biodiversity treaty enters into force, aims to protect 30% of oceans by 2030</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/un-biodiversity-treaty-enters-into-force-aims-protect-30-oceans-by-2030-2026-01-17/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Jan 17 (Reuters) - A landmark global treaty to safeguard biodiversity in the high seas came into effect on Saturday, providing countries with a legally binding framework to tackle threats such as overfishing and meet a target to protect 30% of the ocean environment by 2030.

The U.N. treaty, also known as Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), was finalised in March 2023 after 15 years of negotiations, and will allow the creation of a global network of "marine protected areas" in vast and previously unregulated ocean ecosystems lying in international waters.

"It's two-thirds of the ocean, (and) it's half the surface of the planet that for the first time will have a comprehensive legal regime," said Adam McCarthy, first assistant secretary at the Australian foreign ministry and a co-chair of the treaty's preparatory committee, speaking at a media briefing.

The treaty reached the threshold of 60 national ratifications on September 19 last year, meaning that it would go formally into operation within 120 days. The number of ratifications has since risen to more than 80, with China, Brazil and Japan adding their names to the list.

Others, including Britain and Australia, are expected to follow soon. The United States signed the treaty during the previous administration but has not yet ratified it.

"Whilst we only needed 60 for it to enter into force, obviously it's really critical for its implementation and for it to be as effective as possible for us to achieve global or universal ratification of the treaty," said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups.

"We're really aiming for all UN member states to ratify the treaty."

Under the treaty, countries must conduct environmental assessments of activities that have an impact on ocean ecology. It will also create mechanisms allowing nations to share the spoils of the "blue economy", including "marine genetic resources" used in industries such as biotechnology.

Environmentalists say more than 190,000 protected areas would need to be established in order to meet the "30 by 30" target to bring 30% of the oceans under formal protection by 2030. Currently, only about 8% - or 29 million square kilometres (11.2 million square miles) - is protected.

But the treaty will have little impact on what some conservationists identify as one of the greatest threats facing the marine environment - the clamour to extract mineral resources from the ocean bed.

"BBNJ is very ambitious but there are certain defined limits," McCarthy said.

"The question of mining in the substrate or in the seabed simply belongs to the ISA (International Seabed Authority). It's not something where the BBNJ gets a role."</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:53:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7VK2QORNEZK7TOBGMKHOGO4TJE.jpg?auth=09efd2cc965b4f77177b26ab20adbe574ded336417624623641c594ccadf2edf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Iran protests over 3,000, rights group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/death-toll-iran-protests-over-3000-rights-group-says-2026-01-17/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - More than 3,000 people have died in Iran's nationwide protests, rights activists said on Saturday, while a "very slight rise" in internet activity was reported in the country after an eight-day blackout.

The U.S.-based HRANA group said it had verified 3,090 deaths, including 2,885 protesters, after residents said the crackdown appeared to have broadly quelled protests for now and state media reported more arrests.

The capital Tehran has been comparatively quiet for four days, said several residents reached by Reuters. Drones were flying over the city, but there were no signs of major protests on Thursday or Friday, said the residents, who asked not to be identified for their safety.

A resident of a northern city on the Caspian Sea said the streets there also appeared calm.

The protests erupted on December 28 over economic hardship and swelled into widespread demonstrations calling for the end of clerical rule in the Islamic Republic, culminating in mass violence late last week. According to opposition groups and an Iranian official, more than 2,000 people were killed in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution.

"Metrics show a very slight rise in internet connectivity in #Iran this morning" after 200 hours of shutdown, the internet monitoring group NetBlocks posted on X. Connectivity remained around 2% of ordinary levels, it said.

A few Iranians overseas said on social media that they had been able to message users living inside Iran early on Saturday.

U.S. President Donald Trump, who had threatened "very strong action" if Iran executed protesters, said Tehran's leaders had called off mass hangings.

"I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!" he posted on social media.

Iran had not announced plans for such executions or said it had cancelled them.

Indian students and pilgrims returning from Iran said they were largely confined to their accommodations while in the country, unable to communicate with their families back home.

"We only heard stories of violent protests, and one man jumped in front of our car holding a burning baton, shouting something in the local language, with anger visible in his eyes," said Z Syeda, a third-year medical student at a university in Tehran.

India's External Affairs Ministry said on Friday that commercial flights were available and that New Delhi would take steps to secure the safety and welfare of Indian nationals.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 05:44:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JPUYUPDCDVO3NOLIRYPHP73GO4.jpg?auth=25eedbd93d5654b52b1b3a7a5a8dc4b00eb4999f92509c5938b13c4e2813ccf2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran death toll tops 3,000, yet another rights group says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260117-live-iran-protests-death-toll-tops-3-000-rights-group-ayatollah-khamenei-trump-crackdown</link><description>Internet connectivity in Iran has risen “very” sightly after more than 200 hours of a nationwide internet shutdown, monitoring group NetBlocks said.

At least 3, 090 people, including 2,885 protesters, ‍have died in the unrest in Iran, US-based HRANA group said on Saturday, becoming the second rights group to claim such a high death toll.

Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) has estimated that at least 3,428 people, while other estimates have put the toll at more than 5,000 or possibly as high as 20,000.

“The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Wednesday as Danish and Greenlandic officials arrived in Washington for talks aimed at staving off a confrontation between NATO allies.

The minerals-rich island, Trump wrote, “is vital for the Golden Dome we are building”.

The US president has repeatedly stated that he will acquire the semi-autonomous Danish territory “one way or the other”, sparking bewilderment and concern in Copenhagen and across Europe.

His post this week marked the first time he linked his expansionist aims to a concrete defence project – though analysts have expressed doubts that his missile defence system will ever see the light of day.

Inspired by Israel’s Iron Dome missile shield, the Golden Dome is intended to block projectiles heading for US territory, including intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Trump first announced his signature project in May 2025, unveiling a $175 billion plan to build the missile shield in just three years.

Months later, the Golden Dome is still only in the planning stage, says historian Andrew Gawthorpe, a US foreign policy expert at Leiden University in Germany.

“The whole thing is completely notional at this point,” he says. “They haven't awarded a single government contract to actually develop it.”

The Dome has been described as a Trumpian version of former president Ronald Reagan’s much-derided “Star Wars” programme, which was ultimately abandoned.

Its main feature is “an early-warning system based on a constellation of satellites in space”, says Matthew Powell, an air defence specialist at the University of Portsmouth.

“Interceptors” designed to shoot down incoming missiles “would also be launched from space”, adds Liviu Horovitz, a defence expert at the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (Science and Politics Foundation) in Berlin.

With the bulk of the Dome located above the Earth, Horovitz says he has “no idea why Trump thinks he needs Greenland to build this defence system”.

Gawthorpe cautions that ground infrastructure would still be a part of the missile shield, notably for communication purposes and to house some interceptor launches.

However, he adds, “it is disputed whether Greenland is actually a good place to do this”.

The Pentagon has already mapped out potential locations for establishing the Golden Dome's terrestrial infrastructure – and Greenland does not feature on the list.

“New York State has been identified as an ideal location for the US East Coast interceptor base,” notes Horovitz.

The recently rebranded US Department of War has earmarked $25 million to develop an interceptor base at Fort Drum military base in northern New York State, not far from the Canadian border.

Located further north and closer to Russia, Greenland has a potential advantage over Fort Drum, says Powell, noting that “it could allow for a slightly faster response to detect and intercept missiles”, particularly if fired from Russian soil.

But the US need not acquire Greenland – a territory three times the size of Texas – to install part of the Golden Dome there.

The US already has a “space base” in the Danish territory, known as Pituffik (formerly Thule Air Base), which houses a substantial part of the US military’s global network of missile warning sensors.

The US also retains the right to expand its military presence.

“A 1951 agreement between the US and Denmark, which was revised in 2004, allows Washington to develop the base as it deems necessary, provided it has the agreement of Denmark and Greenland,” says Gawthorpe.

US officials are reportedly already allocating tens of millions of dollars into upgrading the facility based on current agreements with local authorities. At least 150 US military troops are still stationed at Pituffik along with Danish, Greenlandic and Canadian military personnel and contractors.

So far, Denmark has been largely accommodating towards Washington’s requests regarding Pituffik, adds Horovitz. “Copenhagen is unlikely to oppose US plans [to develop] the base in the current geopolitical context,” he says – particularly if it means avoiding a US takeover of Greenland.

That is, unless the US wants to develop its presence in Greenland without having to consult with Danish authorities.

“The Americans have always been very sensitive when it comes to sharing new military technologies,” says Powell. “It could be that they are worried about having to share information with the Danes, even though they wouldn’t have to go into details.”

Another explanation for Trump’s decision to invoke the Golden Dome is the need to persuade a deeply sceptical US public of its interest in acquiring Greenland – by force, if necessary – at the expense of a NATO ally, or indeed at the expense of the Alliance as a whole.

Watch more What will Europe actually do to defend Greenland?

Only 17 percent of Americans support their president's ambition to take over the Danish territory, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on January 15. A mere 4 percent – including just one in 10 Republicans – said ‍it would be a “good idea” to do so by force.

Trump is underscoring the national security argument for another reason, since it is unlikely his desire for the territory’s rare earth minerals would play as well with the public.

“Trump hopes that portraying the acquisition of Greenland as vital to American security will help to win over public opinion,” says Gawthorpe. “It’s much easier to say, ‘We need Greenland to keep Chicago safe’ than it is to say, ‘We need Greenland because it has minerals’.”

President Yoweri Museveni , 81, looked set to be declared winner and extend his 40-year rule later on Saturday, with a commanding lead against Wine, a former singer turned politician.

Wine said Friday that he was under house arrest, and his party later wrote on X that he had been “forcibly taken” by an army helicopter from his compound.

The army denied that claim.

“The rumours of his so-called arrest are baseless and unfounded,” army spokesman Chris Magezi told AFP.

“They are designed to incite his supporters into acts of violence,” he added.

AFP journalists said the situation was calm outside Wine’s residence early Saturday, but they were unable to contact members of the party due to continued communications interruptions.

A nearby stall-owner, 29-year-old Prince Jerard, said he heard a drone and helicopter at the home the previous night, with a heavy security presence.

“Many people have left (the area),” he said. “We have a lot of fear.”

With more than 80 percent of votes counted on Friday, Museveni was leading on 73.7 percent to Wine’s 22.7, the Electoral Commission said.

Final results were due around 1300 GMT on Saturday.

Wine, 43, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the main challenger to Museveni in recent years, styling himself the “ghetto president” after the slum areas where he grew up in the capital, Kampala.

He has accused the government of “massive ballot stuffing” and attacking several of his party officials under cover of the internet blackout, which was imposed ahead of Thursday’s polls and remained in place on Saturday.

His claims could not be independently verified, but the United Nations rights office said last week that the elections were taking place in an environment marked by “widespread repression and intimidation” against the opposition.

Analysts have long viewed the election as a formality.

Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter who seized power in 1986, has total control over the state and security apparatus, and has ruthlessly crushed any challenger during his rule.

Election day was marred by significant technical problems after biometric machines—used to confirm voters’ identities—malfunctioned and ballot papers were undelivered for several hours in many areas.

There were reports of violence against the opposition in other parts of the country.

Muwanga Kivumbi, member of parliament for Wine’s party in the Butambala area of central Uganda, told AFP’s Nairobi office by phone that security forces had killed 10 of his campaign agents after storming his home.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 07:44:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/74d30918-f374-11f0-835e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014476033025.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda police deny opposition leader's arrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-police-deny-opposition-leaders-arrest-2026-01-17/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Ugandan police denied on Saturday allegations by opposition leader Bobi Wine’s party that he had been arrested by soldiers as President Yoweri Museveni closed in on a landslide re-election.

Wine’s National Unity Platform (NUP) said on Friday night an army helicopter landed in his compound in Kampala and “forcibly took him away to an unknown destination”. Reuters could not immediately verify the claim.

National police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke told a televised news conference that Wine was at his home and free to move.

"He is not under arrest," Rusoke said. Wine and representatives of the NUP could not be immediately reached for comment.

Wine has alleged mass fraud during Thursday's election , held under an internet blackout , and called on supporters to protest.

His party said on Thursday he had been placed under effective house arrest.

The vote has been widely seen as a test of the 81-year-old Museveni's political strength and ability to avoid the unrest that has rocked neighbours Tanzania and Kenya.

As of Saturday morning, Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, held a commanding lead with nearly 72% of the vote, the electoral commission said. Wine trailed with 24%, with more than 90% of polling stations counted.

After a campaign marred by clashes at opposition rallies and what the United Nations said was widespread repression and intimidation, voting passed peacefully on Thursday.

But violence broke out in the early hours of Friday in the town of Butambala, about 55 km (35 miles) southwest of the capital Kampala, according to a police spokesperson and a member of parliament from the area, who gave differing accounts of events.

Local police spokesperson Lydia Tumushabe said machete-wielding opposition "goons" organised by local MP Muwanga Kivumbi attacked a police station and vote-tallying centre.

"Security responded in self-defence because these people came in big numbers. Police fired in self-defence," she told Reuters, adding that 25 people were arrested.

Kivumbi, however, told Reuters the victims were killed at around 3 a.m. inside his house, where they were waiting for election results for his parliamentary seat to be announced.

"They killed 10 people inside my house," he said. "There were people inside the garage who were waiting for the results to celebrate my victory."

"They broke the front door and began shooting inside the garage. It was a massacre."

He said security forces had earlier dispersed crowds outside but disputed the police's assertion that the deaths occurred during clashes between the two sides.

Tumushabe, the police spokesperson, said she was not aware of an incident at Kivumbi's house, which she said was close to the police station.

Reuters was not able to independently confirm the circumstances of the violence.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 08:27:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZEXQ4YQ7VZLCLE7ZOFBN5COLOY.jpg?auth=e5bb7519cde44774851f55965cc08c7e50c246f8fd8192d2c8737e3442d92a91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge bars ICE agents from arresting peaceful Minnesota protesters or pepper-spraying them</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260117-us-judge-bars-ice-agents-arresting-peaceful-minnesota-protesters-pepper-spray-renee-good-fatal-shooting</link><description>A US judge restricted federal agents on Friday from interfering with peaceful protesters in Minnesota, after President Donald Trump said there was no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act over the demonstrations.

US District Judge Katherine Menendez ordered immigration agents to dial back their aggressive tactics, barring the detention or arrest of peaceful protesters and drivers and the use of pepper-spray against demonstrators.

The 83-page order gives the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) current operation in the northern US city 72 hours to come into compliance, and follows two incidents where federal agents opened fire, killing one person and wounding another in the span of a week.

In a separate legal move that could inflame the standoff between the White House and Minnesota elected officials, CBS News reported that the Justice Department (DOJ) was investigating Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for impeding federal officers.

Both have called for peaceful protests against immigration sweeps in their state.

“This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city,” Frey wrote on X on Friday.

Walz said the Trump administration has moved to investigate other Democrats who have spoken out against the president’s policies and mentioned the 37-year-old woman who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on January 7.

“The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” Walz wrote on X.

The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. However, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X on Friday: “A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.”

Trump threatened the drastic measure of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to police the protests, as the row escalated this week.

“If I needed it, I would use it. I don’t think there is any reason right now to use it,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the move.

The Insurrection Act allows a president to sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act to suppress “armed rebellion” or “domestic violence” and deploy soldiers on US soil “as he considers necessary” to enforce the 19th-century law.

Crowds of protesters have clashed with immigration officers across Minneapolis, opposing their efforts to target undocumented migrants. Some officers have responded with violence.

Demonstrations grew dramatically following Good’s killing as the Trump administration pressed operations to catch undocumented migrants.

Four dead while in ICE detention

Federal agents fired their weapons in two separate incidents, wounding a man from Venezuela on Wednesday and in Good’s killing last week.

In a separate incident, DHS confirmed on Friday that Heber Sanchez Dominguez, a 34-year-old Mexican national, died while detained in ICE custody two days earlier.

At least four people have died in ICE detention so far this year, according to agency data.

Trump backers have also begun to face off with protesters who oppose ICE’s actions in the state, leading to tense encounters.

The Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper reported that divisions within the anti-ICE movement were beginning to emerge over how aggressively to resist the enforcement efforts.

Activists have also become increasingly wary of “far-right provocateurs trying to bait demonstrators into rioting,” it said.

Minnesota’s American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) chapter has reported an uptick in complaints against ICE officers.

Walz accused federal agents of waging “a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota” in a video posted to X Wednesday night.

Good’s family announced on Wednesday that they had retained a top law firm to probe the killing ahead of launching possible legal action against the officer and the government.

The lawyers demanded on Thursday that federal officials—including the officer who shot Good—preserve records and evidence relating to the incident.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 08:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6889d2c4-f322-11f0-b455-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/53e3007edfa095a993e863684aa28c4878ce8d25.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan says Chinese drone made 'provocative' flight over South China Sea island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-says-chinese-drone-made-provocative-flight-over-south-china-sea-island-2026-01-17/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - A Chinese reconnaissance drone briefly flew over the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the top end of the South China Sea on Saturday, in what Taiwan's defence ministry called a "provocative and irresponsible" move.

Democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, reports Chinese military activity around it on an almost daily basis, including drones though they very rarely enter Taiwanese airspace.

Taiwan's defence ministry said the Chinese reconnaissance drone was detected around dawn on Saturday approaching the Pratas Islands and flew in its airspace for eight minutes at an altitude outside the range of anti-aircraft weapons.

"After our side broadcast warnings on international channels, it departed at 0548," it said in a statement.

"Such highly provocative and irresponsible actions by the People's Liberation Army seriously undermine regional peace and stability, violated international legal norms, and will inevitably be condemned," it added.

Taiwan's armed forces will continue to maintain strict vigilance and monitoring, and will respond in accordance with the routine combat readiness rules, the ministry said.

Calls to China's defence ministry outside of office hours on a weekend went unanswered.

In 2022, Taiwan's military for the first time shot down an unidentified civilian drone that entered its airspace near an islet off the Chinese coast controlled by Taiwan.

Lying roughly between southern Taiwan and Hong Kong, the Pratas are seen by some security experts as vulnerable to Chinese attack due to their distance - more than 400 km (250 miles) - from mainland Taiwan.

The Pratas, an atoll which is also a Taiwanese national park, are only lightly defended by Taiwan's military, but lie at a highly strategic location at the top end of the disputed South China Sea.

China also views the Pratas as its own territory.

In a Telegram message, Delcy Rodriguez announced the ministry would be combined with a commerce ministry and thanked Saab -- a Colombian-born Venezuelan -- "for his service to the Homeland; he will be taking on new responsibilities."

The change comes amid pressure from Washington following the January 3 US military raid that ousted Maduro.

Saab, released in 2023 as part of a prisoner exchange with the United States, was appointed to office in 2024 by Maduro.

He had been arrested in Cape Verde in 2020 due to an Interpol notice over accusations he had served as a money launderer for the socialist leader.

He was subsequently extradited to the US, where he and his business partner Alvaro Pulido were charged with running a network that exploited food aid destined for Venezuela.

Saab's dismissal is among the latest key changes to Venezuela's government by Rodriguez since the US capture of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado meanwhile said her country is starting a "true transition" to democracy and will become free with support from the United States and President Donald Trump.

Trump however has sidelined Nobel laureate Machado and backed former vice president Rodriguez as interim leader of the oil-rich country following the seizure of Maduro.

"We are definitely now into the first steps of a true transition to democracy," Machado said during an event in Washington, adding that this will have an "immense impact in the lives of all Venezuelans" as well as around the region and the world.

"Venezuela is going to be free, and that's going to be achieved with the support of the people of the United States and the president, Donald Trump," Machado said.

Her party has presented evidence that Maduro stole the 2024 election -- claims supported by Washington and much of the international community.

But Trump has said that Machado does not have enough support among Venezuelans, and opted to stick with Rodriguez so long as she toes the line on US access to Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

Machado said Friday that Rodriguez is "following orders" rather than acting of her own will.

The opposition leader's remarks came a day after US Central Intelligence Agency chief John Ratcliffe met Rodriguez in Caracas.

Ratcliffe traveled to Venezuela to "deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship," a US administration official said on condition of anonymity.

In an indication of that improved relationship, a US deportation flight carrying 231 Venezuelans landed in Caracas on Friday, the first since Maduro's overthrow.

Trump has made cracking down on undocumented immigrants a major part of his second term, carrying out sweeping immigration raids and deporting migrants.

Machado, 58, on Thursday presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Trump in a bid to win over the US president.

"He deserves it," she said. "And it was a very emotional moment, I decided to present the Nobel Peace Prize medal on behalf of the people of Venezuela."

It was not immediately clear if Trump -- who said Friday that he and Machado will "be talking again" -- kept the award following their White House lunch. The Norwegian Nobel committee says its prizes cannot be transferred.

Trump had campaigned hard to win last year's prize, falsely claiming that he stopped eight wars since taking office, but it went to Machado instead.

Trump and Rodriguez had their first telephone call on Wednesday and the White House said he "likes what he's seeing" from her.

Rodriguez said however that her government will stand up to Washington.

"We know they are very powerful... we are not afraid to confront them diplomatically, through political dialogue," she said Thursday.

Rodriguez was delivering Maduro's state of the nation address to parliament while the long-time authoritarian leader is in a New York jail facing drug trafficking charges.

By contrast Machado, who campaigned for years to end leftist Maduro's rule, was greeted by jubilant supporters in Washington.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 08:53:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/02ea9d46-f353-11f0-9d2e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/1146cea08a3524b10852146b79440ff9a240715f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian forces enter Deir Hafer near Aleppo after Kurdish fighters agree to withdraw</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260117-syria-forces-enter-deir-hafer-near-aleppo-after-kurdish-fighters-agree-withdraw</link><description>Syria’s army said Saturday its forces had started entering an area east of the city of Aleppo after Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw from the region following recent clashes .

In a statement carried by state television, the army said its forces “began entering the western Euphrates area, starting with the town of Deir Hafer”, after Kurdish forces had agreed to withdraw on Saturday morning.

In a statement carried by state television, the military urged civilians “not to enter the operations area” until the army had secured it and “cleared it of all mines and war remnants”.

After driving out Kurdish forces from Aleppo city last week following deadly clashes, Syria’s army deployed reinforcements near Deir Hafer and told the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to evacuate the area between the town and the Euphrates River, around 30 kilometres further east.

On Friday, Kurdish leader Mazloum Abdi committed to withdrawing his US-backed, Kurdish-led SDF on Saturday morning “towards redeployment in areas east of the Euphrates”, based on “calls from friendly countries and mediators”.

The defence ministry had welcomed Abdi’s announcement, saying army troops would deploy in the areas after the SDF withdrew.

The Syrian army had urged civilians to flee the Deir Hafer area in recent days, with at least 4,000 people leaving, according to Syrian authorities.

On Friday, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Friday issued a decree declaring Kurdish a “national language”, in an apparent gesture of good will towards the minority after the recent violence.

Syria’s Islamist-led government is seeking to extend its authority across the country following the ousting of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.

Progress on implementing a March deal to integrate the Kurds’ de facto autonomous administration in the north into the state has stalled.

But Sharaa’s announcement on Friday is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria’s independence in 1946.

The decree stated Kurds were “an essential and integral part” of Syria, where they have suffered decades of marginalisation and oppression under former rulers.

It makes Kurdish a “national language” that can be taught in public schools in areas where the minority community is heavily present.

Kurdish forces control swathes of Syria’s oil-rich north and northeast, much of which they captured during the country’s civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 09:45:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/49f31d82-f383-11f0-89a0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016422815062.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egypt's Sisi says he values offer by Trump to mediate Egypt-Ethiopia dispute on Nile River waters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/egypts-sisi-says-he-values-offer-by-trump-mediate-egypt-ethiopia-dispute-nile-2026-01-17/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said he valued an offer by U.S. President Donald Trump to mediate a dispute over Nile River waters between Egypt and Ethiopia.

Trump named members of a board to help supervise Gaza that was dominated by Americans, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in a territory that lies in rubble after two-plus years of relentless Israeli bombardment.

Watch Gazans sceptical of phase 2 of truce as strikes continue

The step came after a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo which was attended by Jared Kushner , Trump's son-in-law who plays a key role on the Middle East .

Trump has already declared himself the chair of a "Board of Peace" and on Friday announced its full membership that will include Blair as well as senior Americans – Kushner, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff , Trump's business partner turned globe-trotting negotiator.

Blair is a controversial figure in the Middle East because of his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Trump himself said last year that he wanted to make sure Blair was an "acceptable choice to everybody".

Blair spent years focused on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as representative of the "Middle East Quartet" – the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia – after leaving Downing Street in 2007.

The White House said the Board of Peace will take on issues such as "governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding and capital mobilization".

Trump, a real-estate developer, has previously mused about turning devastated Gaza into a Riviera-style area of resorts, although he has backed away from calls to forcibly displace the population.

The other members of the board are World Bank President Ajay Banga, an Indian-born American businessman; billionaire US financier Marc Rowan; and Robert Gabriel, a loyal Trump aide who serves on the National Security Council.

Israel 's military said Friday it had again hit the Gaza Strip in response to a "blatant violation" of the ceasefire declared in October.

The strikes come despite Washington announcing that the Gaza plan had gone on to a second phrase – from implementing the ceasefire to disarming Hamas , whose October, 2023 attack on Israel prompted the massive Israeli offensive.

Trump on Friday named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to head the International Stabilization Force, which will be tasked with providing security in Gaza and training a new police force to succeed Hamas.

Jeffers, from special operations in US Central Command, in late 2024 was put in charge of monitoring a ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, which has continued periodic strikes aimed at Hezbollah militants.

The United States has been searching the world for countries to contribute to the force, with Indonesia an early volunteer.

But diplomats expect challenges in seeing countries send troops so long as Hamas does not agree to disarm fully.

Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath was earlier tapped to head the governing committee.

The committee's meeting in Cairo also included Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov, who was given a role of high representative liaising between the new governing body and Trump's Board of Peace.

Committee members are scheduled to meet again Saturday, one of them told AFP on condition of anonymity.

"We hope to go to Gaza next week or the week after; our work is there, and we need to be there," he said.

Trump also named a second "executive board" that appears designed to have a more advisory role.

Blair, Witkoff and Mladenov will serve on it as well as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.

Israel has refused a Turkish role in the security force, owing to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's fiery denunciations of Israel's actions in Gaza.

The board will also include senior figures from mediators Egypt and Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020.

Trump also named to the board Sigrid Kaag, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, despite his administration's efforts to sideline the world body.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 10:49:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c3d6edb4-d500-11f0-bf7b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25289604461877.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US talks with hardline Venezuelan minister Cabello began months before raid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-talks-with-hardline-venezuelan-minister-cabello-began-months-before-raid-2026-01-17/</link><description>NEW YORK/MIAMI/WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Trump administration officials had been in discussions with Venezuela's hardline interior minister Diosdado Cabello months before the U.S. operation to seize President Nicolas Maduro, and have been in communication with him since then, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.

The officials warned Cabello, 62, against using the security services or militant ruling-party supporters he oversees to target the country's opposition, four sources said. That security apparatus, which includes the intelligence services, police and the armed forces, remains largely intact after the January 3 U.S. raid .

Cabello is named in the same U.S. drug-trafficking indictment that the Trump administration used as justification to arrest Maduro, but was not taken as part of the operation.

The communication with Cabello, which has also touched on sanctions the U.S. has imposed on him and the indictment he faces, dates back to the early days of the current Trump administration and continued in the weeks just prior to the U.S. ouster of Maduro, two sources familiar with the discussions said. The administration has also been in touch with Cabello since Maduro's ouster, four of the people said.

The communications, which have not been previously reported, are critical to the Trump administration's efforts to control the situation inside Venezuela. If Cabello decides to unleash the forces that he controls, it could foment the kind of chaos that Trump wants to avoid and threaten interim President Delcy Rodriguez's grip on power, according to a source briefed on U.S. concerns.

It is not clear if the Trump administration's discussions with Cabello extended to questions about the future governance of Venezuela. Also unclear is whether Cabello has heeded the U.S. warnings. He has publicly pledged unity with Rodriguez, whom Trump has so far praised .

While Rodriguez has been seen by the U.S. as the linchpin for U.S. President Donald Trump's strategy for post-Maduro Venezuela, Cabello is widely believed to have the power to keep those plans on track or upend them.

The Venezuelan minister has been in contact with the Trump administration both directly and via intermediaries, one person familiar with the conversations said.

All of the sources were granted anonymity to speak freely about sensitive internal government communications with Cabello.

The White House and the government of Venezuela did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Cabello has long been seen as Venezuela's second most powerful figure. A close aide of late former President Hugo Chavez, Maduro's mentor, he went on to become a long-time Maduro loyalist, feared as his main enforcer of repression. Rodriguez and Cabello have both operated at the heart of the government, legislature and ruling socialist party for years, but have never been considered close allies of each other.

A former military officer, Cabello has exerted influence over the country's military and civilian counterintelligence agencies, which conduct widespread domestic espionage. He has also been closely associated with pro-government militias, notably the colectivos, groups of motorcycle-riding armed civilians who have been deployed to attack protesters.

Cabello is one of a handful of Maduro loyalists Washington has relied on as temporary rulers to maintain stability while it accesses the OPEC nation's oil reserves during an unspecified transition period.

But U.S. officials are concerned that Cabello - given his record of repression and a history of rivalry with Rodriguez - could play the spoiler, according to a source briefed on the administration's thinking.

Rodriguez has been working to consolidate her own power, installing loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats while meeting U.S. demands to boost oil production, Reuters interviews with sources in Venezuela have shown.

Elliott Abrams, who served as Trump's special representative on Venezuela in his first term, said many Venezuelans would expect Cabello to be removed at some point if a democratic transition is to advance.

"If and when he goes, Venezuelans will know that the regime has really begun to change," said Abrams, now at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

Cabello has long been under U.S. sanctions for alleged drug trafficking.

In 2020, the U.S. issued a $10 million bounty for Cabello and indicted him as a key figure in the "Cartel de los Soles," a group the U.S. has said is a Venezuelan drug-trafficking network led by members of the country's government.

The U.S. has since raised the award to $25 million. Cabello has publicly denied any links to drug trafficking.

In the hours after Maduro's ouster, some analysts and politicians in Washington questioned why the U.S. didn't also grab Cabello - listed second in the Department of Justice indictment of Maduro.

"I know that just Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy," Republican U.S. Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said in an interview with CBS's "Face the Nation" on January 11.

In the days following, Cabello denounced American intervention in the country, saying in a speech that "Venezuela will not surrender."

But media reports of residents being searched at checkpoints - sometimes by uniformed members of the security forces and sometimes by people in plain clothes - have become less frequent in recent days.

And both Trump and the Venezuelan government have said many detainees who are considered by the opposition and rights groups to be political prisoners will be released.

The government has said that Cabello, in his role as interior minister, is overseeing that effort. Rights groups say the liberations are proceeding extremely slowly and hundreds remain unjustly detained.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:17:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SNI5INORENPI7OKUWHRDFIKPAA.jpg?auth=c14e0cfb7018f8e16b3bcaec2b41fd627c0416683d67655241573970fc86669b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's peace negotiators arrive in US for talks with Trump officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-peace-negotiators-arrive-us-talks-with-trump-officials-2026-01-17/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Ukraine's peace negotiators arrived in the United States on Saturday for talks on details of a proposed agreement to end the four-year war with Russia , the head of the Ukrainian president's office said.

Kyrylo Budanov said the delegation would meet with White House envoy Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.

"Ukraine needs a just peace. We are working to achieve results," Budanov, a former military intelligence chief, said on the Telegram app.

Trump has been pushing both Kyiv and Moscow for a deal to end the war. But despite many rounds of talks, no tangible diplomatic breakthrough has been reached so far, and fighting continues to rage on a front line extending more than 1,200 km (750 miles).

Ukraine and the U.S. have drafted a 20-point peace proposal, but Russia has yet to comment on it.

The trickiest issues include territorial concessions, security guarantees and the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest, occupied by Russia.

Ukrainian officials said the agenda would include security guarantees and a post-war recovery package for Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he hoped to sign documents outlining "a prosperity package" with the U.S. on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos next week, to unlock about $800 billion in reconstruction investments.

Trump told Reuters this week that he may meet with Zelenskiy at the WEF.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:17:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UWXOFGHS5FJV7M6YB3572QPFXY.jpg?auth=808991e0d6057477a251c6fc240912f14c349c1e4ddc9bbfe68589f316e8c08c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's military 'monitors' US vessels transiting the Taiwan Strait</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-military-monitors-us-vessels-transiting-taiwan-strait-2026-01-17/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - China's military said it had followed and monitored the transit of guided-missile destroyer USS Finn and oceanographic survey ship USNS Mary Sears through the Taiwan Strait on January 16 and 17, it said on an official WeChat account Saturday.

Rodriguez, 56, a quiet but rigorous technocrat who was vice president and oil minister, has named a central banker to help run the economy, a presidential chief of staff and, crucially, a new head of Venezuela’s feared DGCIM, the military counterintelligence agency built over decades with Cuban assistance.

Major General Gustavo Gonzalez, 65, will now head the agency, a move three sources with knowledge of the government described as an early gambit by Rodriguez to counter what many in Venezuela say is the biggest threat to her leadership: Diosdado Cabello , Venezuela's hardline interior minister with close ties to the security services and the dreaded “colectivos” motorcycle gangs which have killed opposition supporters.

"She is very clear that she doesn't have the capacity to survive without the consent of the Americans," said one source close to the government. "She's already reforming the armed forces, removing people and naming new officials."

Interviews with seven sources in Venezuela, including diplomats, business people and politicians, reveal in previously unreported detail the fault line at the heart of Venezuela's government and the risks it poses to Rodriguez as she tries to consolidate internal control while meeting Trump administration dictates on oil sales. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

The tightrope Rodriguez is attempting to walk was evident in her first major speech since taking office. Addressing parliament in a national annual address on Thursday, she called for unity, stressed her bona fides as Maduro’s loyal deputy, and vowed to forge a new chapter in Venezuela’s politics with increased oil investment.

Venezuela’s communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government and individual officials, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

The White House responded to emailed questions from Reuters by referring the news agency to recent comments made by Trump. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said Rodriguez "has been very good to deal with" and that he expected her to visit Washington at some point.

Rodriguez - nicknamed "the tsarina" for her business connections - has broad influence over the country's civilian levers of power, including the crucial oil industry, and now also enjoys the backing of the United States. That backing appeared to be reemphasized on Thursday when Rodriguez met with CIA director John Ratcliffe in Caracas.

The other main faction is led by Cabello.

Cabello, who also heads the ruling PSUV socialist party, is a former soldier with a weekly four-hour show on state television, which has run for 12 years. His first public act after Maduro's capture was to appear on screen dressed in a flak jacket and surrounded by armed guards as he led a chant of, "To doubt is to betray.”

Officials in the Trump administration had contact with Cabello months before the operation to seize Maduro and have also been in communication with him since, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, warning him against using the security services or colectivos to target the opposition.

Cabello, who was jailed in Venezuela for backing eventual socialist President Hugo Chavez in a failed 1992 coup, is under indictment in the U.S. and has a $25 million reward for his capture.

So far Cabello has been conciliatory towards Rodriguez, saying they are “very united” and he arrived at Thursday's national address alongside Rodriguez and her brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly. But sources with knowledge of their relationship told Reuters that Cabello remains the biggest threat to her ability to govern.

In Caracas, security forces are skittish. A few hours after Rodriguez was sworn in, there was a brief burst of anti-aircraft fire outside the presidential palace that some feared could be another U.S. attack. Instead, reports suggest it was a miscommunication between police and the presidential guard, which shot down police drones. The government said the craft were spy drones, without explaining who they belonged to.

Across the country, people are reeling from the shock of Maduro’s capture and unsure whether to be hopeful or scared. In some places, local socialist party branches have asked members to spy on their neighbors and report anyone celebrating Maduro’s downfall, according to three party members who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In this tense environment, Rodriguez must persuade party loyalists that she is not a U.S. puppet who betrayed Maduro. She must also stabilize an economy that saw prices for basic goods soar in the days since the U.S. attack, as well as wrestle some degree of control over the sprawling military-linked patronage networks that have developed over decades of Chavismo rule.

Venezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals, more than double the number in the United States, a military superpower with 20 times more active duty and reserve troops. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.

Many officials are able to run their regional fiefdoms as they see fit - ordering patrols or checkpoints by soldiers under their command - and some parts of the country and capital Caracas have seen increased activity by security services since Maduro's capture.

Gonzalez, the new head of the military counterintelligence agency DGCIM, has over his long career in Venezuela’s government worked closely with Cabello, particularly during two stints as head of the separate civilian spy agency.

Yet it is to Rodriguez that Gonzalez owes his most recent posts. In 2024, Rodriguez tapped Gonzalez for a top job at the state oil company, Venezuela’s most important company and the engine of the country’s economy.

Questions still remain over how much control Gonzalez will be able to exert over DGCIM. Cabello's allies within the agency could undermine him, the three sources with knowledge of the government said.

One source with knowledge of the inner workings of the security services said Gonzalez's DGCIM predecessor General Javier Marcano struggled to control the agency.

"The role of boss of repression already has a name… Diosdado," this person said. "Marcano was coordinating with (civilian) militias and with the colectivos, but he had serious difficulties controlling DGCIM because his designation was nominal."

Reuters could not reach Marcano directly and all formal communication with officials in Venezuela is handled through the communications ministry, which did not respond to a list of questions related to this story.

The colectivos, closely connected to Cabello, could also make the country ungovernable by implementing a so-called " anarchization " strategy, which was first designed to fend off U.S. intervention but could be directed against Rodriguez, the source close to the government told Reuters. That strategy would mobilize the intelligence services and colectivos to plunge Caracas into disorder and chaos.

Cabello could also slow the pace of prisoner releases that have been hailed by Trump. They have been proceeding much more slowly than demanded by families and rights groups, creating a potential pressure point for Rodriguez.

Outside of Venezuela, however, pressure on Cabello continues to mount.

"For the Trump administration to achieve a real transition in Venezuela, sooner or later Diosdado Cabello must face U.S. justice," U.S. Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said on X this month. "When Diosdado is brought to justice, it will be a decisive step toward a democratic transition in Venezuela and the release of all political hostages."</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:17:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SUCWFFC4RVMKDLJ4HTU72ILJTE.jpg?auth=2f73d032e67716e512e72ffc221c5193f235962cf1da319efaa99a47fee49fe4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian troops sweep northern towns as Kurdish fighters withdraw</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-troops-sweep-northern-towns-kurdish-fighters-withdraw-2026-01-17/</link><description>DEIR HAFER, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Syrian troops swept through dozens of towns and villages in the country's north on Saturday after Kurdish fighters withdrew under an agreement that aimed to avoid a bloody showdown between the rival forces.

For days, Syrian troops had amassed around a cluster of villages that lie just west of the winding Euphrates River and had called on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces stationed there to redeploy their forces on the opposite bank of the river.

Overnight, SDF head Mazloum Abdi said his forces would withdraw early on Saturday morning to territory east of the Euphrates as a gesture of goodwill, leaving the river as a frontline between Syrian government troops to its west and Kurdish forces to its east.

By mid-day on Saturday, Syrian troops were in control of the main town of Deir Hafer and surrounding villages whose residents are predominantly Arab, according to statements from the military.

Some residents had left in recent days through a humanitarian corridor set up by Syria's army but those who stayed celebrated the army's arrival.

"It happened with the least amount of losses. There's been enough blood in this country, Syria. We have sacrificed and lost enough - people are tired of it," Hussein al-Khalaf, a resident, told Reuters.

SDF forces had withdrawn east, some on foot, towards the flashpoint town of Tabqa -- downstream but still on the western side of the river, according to a Reuters reporter in the area.

Syria's army announced it was aiming to capture Tabqa next. Some SDF forces regrouped in Tabqa and headed back west to defend some of their positions, the Reuters reporter said.

Clashes broke out in some towns as the SDF and Syria's army accused each other of violating the withdrawal agreement.

In a bid to calm tensions, U.S. envoy Tom Barrack traveled to Erbil in northern Iraq on Saturday to meet with both Abdi and Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, according to two Kurdish sources. There was no immediate comment from Barrack's spokesperson.

Weeks of tensions between government forces and the SDF have deepened the faultline between the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has vowed to reunify the fractured country under one leadership after 14 years of war, and local Kurdish authorities wary of his Islamist-led administration.

The two sides engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, insisting repeatedly that they wanted to resolve disputes diplomatically.

But after the deadline passed with , clashes broke out last week in the northern city of Aleppo and ended with a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters.

Syrian troops then amassed around towns in the north and east earlier this week to pressure Kurdish authorities into making concessions in the deadlocked talks with Damascus.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:41:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XPWZGGZJVFNM7IGALPRPYQNXUE.jpg?auth=01ed9f6916a2aa946081fa738aed0061bff2cc885e8e09b9564c5679d9495111&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Hands off Greenland': Thousands protest in Denmark against Trump's land grab</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260117-large-crowds-expected-for-hands-off-greenland-protests</link><description>Large demonstrations are planned across Denmark and Greenland on Saturday to protest against US President Donald Trump 's designs to take over the Arctic island.

Thousands of people have indicated on social media that they intend to take part in marches and rallies organised by Greenlandic associations in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense and the Greenlandic capital Nuuk.

"The aim is to send a clear and unified message of respect for Greenland's democracy and fundamental human rights," Uagut, an association of Greenlanders in Denmark, said on its website.

The protests follow Trump's warning on Friday that he "may put a tariff" on countries that oppose his plans to take over Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

The demonstration in Nuuk is scheduled to begin at 4:00 pm (1500 GMT), to protest "against the United States' illegal plans to take control of Greenland", organisers said. Demonstrators would march to the US consulate carrying Greenlandic flags.

The Copenhagen rally was due to begin at 12:00 pm (1100 GMT), and make a stop outside the US embassy in the Danish capital around an hour later.

"Recent events have put Greenland and Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark under pressure," Uagut chairwoman Julie Rademacher said in a statement sent to AFP, calling for "unity".

"When tensions rise and people go into a state of alarm, we risk creating more problems than solutions for ourselves and for each other. We appeal to Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark to stand together," she said.

The protests come as a bipartisan delegation of US Congress members visited Copenhagen on a two-day trip to give backing to Denmark and Greenland, saying the US president's territorial ambitions were not shared by the American people.

Europeans have also been showing support for Greenland in a military reconnaissance mission that a Danish general said Washington was invited to.

Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News on Friday that "positive early talks" had taken place at a White House meeting between senior officials from the United States, Denmark and Greenland this week.

But he reiterated that Trump had been "clear" that he wanted the United States to control the island.

"They want us to spend hundreds of billions of dollars defending a territory for them that is 25 percent bigger than Alaska at 100 percent American expense, but they say while we do this, it belongs 100 percent to Denmark," Miller said.

Uagut, along with the citizens' movement "Hands Off Greenland", and Inuit, an umbrella group of Greenlandic associations, were staging the demonstrations to coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers.

On the event's Facebook page, at least 900 people in Greenland said they planned to take part in the territory, which has a total population of about 57,000.

"With this demonstration, we want to show that we are taking action, that we stand together and that we support our politicians, diplomats and partners," Kristian Johansen, one of the organisers, said in a statement.

"We demand respect for our country's right to self-determination and for us as a people," added Avijaja Rosing-Olsen, another organiser.

"We demand respect for international law and international legal principles. This is not only our struggle, it is a struggle that concerns the entire world."

According to the latest poll published in January 2025, 85 percent of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the United States. Only six percent were in favour.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:43:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/02ba0f3a-f39b-11f0-b00c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/Copenhague.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy orders faster imports of electricity, power equipment</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-orders-faster-imports-electricity-power-equipment-2026-01-17/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 17 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that he had ordered imports of electricity and additional power equipment to be accelerated as much as possible as Ukraine confronts its worst wartime energy crisis.

The government has declared an energy emergency as the system, damaged by relentless Russian strikes, is meeting only 60% of electricity needs. The situation is exacerbated by exceptionally cold temperatures.

"All decisions for this are already in place, and the increase in imports must proceed without delay," Zelenskiy said in a post on X after a meeting with top government and military officials.

The energy ministry said scheduled power cuts were in effect in most regions. The situation was most challenging in and around the capital Kyiv, where residents faced long blackouts and dozens of apartment buildings were without heating as temperatures plunged to 16 Celsius (3 Fahrenheit).

Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said the government and the state energy company Naftogaz had discussed additional gas imports this year, but she gave no details on volumes.

Last year, Naftogaz imported 5.7 billion cubic metres of gas using state financing and funds provided by international partners, she said.

Ukraine was forced to start importing gas back in the spring of 2025, due to attacks by hundreds of Russian drones and missiles on gas production facilities.

Naftogaz said that Russia had struck its gas production facilities six times this week alone.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDS4VYUXXZKG3CN6J4MEPINKEM.jpg?auth=cd80e203cd286602d643f58470ddff6852a7e22acc11e36038c91c222d941bc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protesters in Denmark support Greenland after Trump's takeover threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/protesters-denmark-support-greenland-after-trumps-takeover-threat-2026-01-17/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters gathered across Denmark on Saturday in solidarity with Greenland amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to annex the Arctic island , demanding that the United States respect Greenlanders' right to self-determination.

Trump says Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and large supply of minerals and has not ruled out the use of force to take it. European nations this week sent military personnel to the island at Denmark's request.

Chanting "Greenland is not for sale" and holding banners with slogans such as "Hands off Greenland" alongside Greenland's red and white "Erfalasorput" flag, demonstrators assembled in Copenhagen's City Hall Square before marching towards the U.S. embassy.

"I am very grateful for the huge support we as Greenlanders receive ... we are also sending a message to the world that you all must wake up," said Julie Rademacher, chair of Uagut, an organization for Greenlanders in Denmark.

"Greenland and the Greenlanders have involuntarily become the front in the fight for democracy and human rights," she added.

Reuters video footage showed thousands of protesters. Spokespersons for organisers and police declined to provide a crowd estimate.

Protests were also ongoing in other locations across Denmark and are scheduled to take place in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, later on Saturday.

Trump's repeated statements about the island have triggered an unprecedented diplomatic crisis between the United States and Denmark, both founding members of the NATO military alliance, and have been widely condemned in Europe.

The Greenland territory of 57,000 people, governed for centuries from Copenhagen , has carved out significant autonomy since 1979 but remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark which controls defence and foreign policy, and funds much of its administration.

All five political parties elected to Greenland's parliament ultimately favour independence, but they disagree on the timeline of such a move and have in recent days said they would rather remain part of Denmark than join the United States.

The protests in Denmark were organised by Greenlandic groups in cooperation with ActionAid Denmark, an NGO.

"We demand respect for the Danish Realm and for Greenland's right to self-determination," said Camilla Siezing, chair of Inuit, the Joint Association of Greenlandic Local Associations in Denmark.

Some 17,000 Greenlanders live in Denmark, according to Danish authorities.

Just 17% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, and large majorities of Democrats and Republicans oppose using military force to annex the island, a found.

Museveni, 81, won 71.65 percent of the vote in Thursday's election, the Electoral Commission said, amid reports of at least 10 deaths and intimidation of the opposition and civil society.

His victory allows him to extend his 40-year rule of the East African country.

He defeated opposition leader Bobi Wine , 43, a former singer-turned-politician who won 24.72 percent and said he was in hiding on Saturday after a raid by security forces on his home.

Wine has faced relentless pressure since entering politics, including multiple arrests before his first run for the presidency in 2021.

He stated his "complete rejection of the fake results" and said he was on the run after the raid on his home on Friday night.

"I want to confirm that I managed to escape from them," Wine posted on X on Saturday. "Currently, I am not at home, although my wife and other family members remain under house arrest."

"I know that these criminals are looking for me everywhere and I am trying my best to keep safe," he added.

There was a heavy police presence around the capital, Kampala, AFP journalists saw, as security forces sought to prevent the sort of protests that have hit neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania in recent months.

Electoral officials also face questions about the failure of biometric voter identification machines on Thursday, which caused delays in the start of voting in urban areas – including the capital, Kampala – that are opposition strongholds.

After the machines failed, in a blow to pro-democracy activists who have long demanded their use to curb rigging, polling officials used manual registers of voters. The failure of the machines is likely to be the basis for any legal challenges to the official result.

Police denied they had raided Wine's home but said they had "controlled access in areas we feel are security hotspots", adding they believed the opposition leader was still at home.

"We have not necessarily denied people accessing him but we cannot tolerate instances where people use his residence to gather and ... incite violence," police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke told reporters.

A stall-owner near Wine's home, 29-year-old Prince Jerard, told AFP he had heard a drone and helicopter at the residence the previous night, and saw numerous security officials.

"Many people have left (the area)," he said. "We have a lot of fear."

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the main challenger to Museveni in recent years, styling himself the "ghetto president" after the Kampala slum areas where he grew up.

He has accused the government of "massive ballot stuffing" and attacking several of his party officials under cover of the internet blackout, which was imposed ahead of the polls and remained in place on Saturday.

African election observers said on Saturday they saw no evidence of ballot stuffing but denounced "reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions" targeting the opposition and civil society.

This "instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process", former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan told reporters in Kampala.

He was representing election observers from the African Union , as well as regional bodies COMESA and IGAD for east and southern Africa.

Jonathan said the shutdown of the internet "disrupted effective observation" and "increased suspicion" but that the overall conduct of the polls on election day was "peaceful".

Museveni's ruling party, the National Resistance Movement, also had a commanding lead in parliamentary seats, according to provisional results. Ballots were still being counted.

Analysts have long viewed the election as a formality.

Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter who seized power in 1986, has total control over the state and security apparatus, and has ruthlessly crushed any challenger during his rule.

The other major opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, who ran four times against Museveni, was abducted in Kenya in 2024 and brought back to a military court in Uganda for a treason trial that is ongoing.

There were reports of election-related violence against the opposition.

Muwanga Kivumbi, member of parliament for Wine's party in the Butambala area of central Uganda, told AFP's Nairobi office by phone that security forces had killed 10 of his campaign agents after storming his home.

Police gave a different account, saying an "unspecified number" of people had been "put out of action" when opposition members planned to overrun and burn down a local tally centre and police station.

Yusuf Serunkuma, an academic and columnist for the local Observer newspaper, told the Associated Press on Saturday that Wine “didn’t stand a chance” against the authoritarian Museveni.

“He has quite successfully emasculated the opposition,” Serunkuma said of Museveni. “You would have to credit him for that.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:23:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9bc1677e-f39a-11f0-b7ab-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Yoweri-Museveni.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘Playing straight into Russia’s hands’: Expert warns Trump’s Greenland push strains NATO</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/playing-straight-into-russia-s-hands-expert-warns-trump-s-greenland-push-strains-nato</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:47:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/de6605c2-f3ad-11f0-a177-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260117-140325-141040-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia searching for missing surveillance plane with 11 onboard</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-searching-missing-surveillance-plane-with-11-onboard-2026-01-17/</link><description>Jan 17 (Reuters) - Indonesian rescuers were searching on Saturday for an ATR 42-500 fisheries surveillance aircraft that went missing with 11 people on board, officials said.

The Indonesia Air Transport plane lost contact with air traffic control at about 1:30 p.m. (0530 GMT) around Maros region in South Sulawesi province, Andi Sultan, an official at the local rescue agency, told Reuters.

The aircraft had been heading to Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi, after departing from Yogyakarta province before contact was lost, Sultan said.

There were eight crew and three passengers on board, he added.

Around 400 personnel, including military and police units, were deployed to search for the plane and those on board, though the effort was being hampered by bad weather, Sultan said. He declined to comment on the possible cause of the incident.

"We suspect the plane came down near the peak of Mount Bulusaraung. We have deployed our personnel there," he said.

The plane had been chartered by Indonesia's Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, ministry official Pung Nugroho Saksono told state news agency Antara.

Marine Affairs and Fisheries Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono said the three passengers were ministry staff conducting air surveillance on fisheries.

The ATR 42‑500 is a regional turboprop aircraft capable of carrying between 42 and 50 passengers.

According to unconfirmed Flightradar24 data, an aircraft matching the description was flying eastward over the Java Sea at about 11,000 feet before rapidly losing altitude and dropping off tracking systems.

He has imposed double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country on Earth as well as singling out specific industries, such as steel and autos, for levies of their own.

Critics warn raising tariffs to levels not seen since the Great Depression risks fuelling inflation and undermining US industries.

Canada broke with the United States on Friday by slashing its 100 percent import tax on Chinese electric vehicles in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, particularly canola seeds.

“It’s a huge declaration of realignment in Canada’s economic relations,” said Edward Alden, who studies trade issues as senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

“The economic threat from the United States is now perceived by Canadians as far bigger than the economic threat from China . So this is a big deal.’’

Canada has repeatedly been the target of Trump’s wrath. In October, for instance, he said he was imposing a 10 percent tariff on Canadian imports as a reprisal for Ontario’s provincial government airing an advertisement that criticised the president’s go-to diplomatic tariff tool. He didn’t follow through on the increase, but tariffs on on some key Canadian sectors like steel and aluminium remain.

The deal with China is a potentially perilous one for Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney , who risks retribution from Trump ahead of negotiations over the renewal of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is crucial to Canadian businesses.

But Canada is not alone in looking for alternatives to America’s massive market as Trump slaps huge tariffs on imports in an attempt to strong-arm other countries into moving production to the United States.

The European Union is expected to formally sign a trade pact Saturday with the South American alliance known as Mercosur , which includes the region’s two biggest economies, Brazil and Argentina . The EU is also pursuing a trade deal with India .

China, pounded by US tariffs since Trump’s first term, has also diversified its exports away from the world’s biggest economy to markets such as Europe and Southeast Asia.

It seems to be working. China’s trade surplus with the rest of the world surged to a record $1.2 trillion in 2025, the Chinese government reported Wednesday, despite tumbling exports to the US.

Trump says tariffs will raise money for the US Treasury, protect American industries and bring investment into the United States. On Thursday, Taiwan agreed to invest $250 billion in the United States in return for Trump reducing the tariff on its products to 15 percent from 20 percent.

But the US president’s use of tariffs has often been arbitrary and unpredictable.

He targeted Brazil, for instance, for prosecuting his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro . On Friday, he again threatened to slap tariffs on countries that don’t support his efforts to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark .

Friday’s deal in Beijing marks a turnabout in Canadian policy.

In 2024, Canada had followed the US lead by imposing 100 percent tariffs on EVs from China, reflecting fears that inexpensive Chinese cars would overwhelm domestic North American automakers.

But the deal with China delivers benefits to Canada.

First, its canola farmers need export markets, and this pact lowers China’s tariff on canola from 84 percent to 15 percent. Canola farmers are hailing Canada’s new trade deal with China as great news that could restore exports for the major crop.

Second, the Trump administration, favouring fossil fuels over green energy, “is actively hostile to EV production in North America’’, said economist Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

America’s opposition “threatens to make the North American [auto] industry obsolete in the future, as China moves ahead with rapid quality improvements in batteries and electronics for EVs", she said.

“China’s strengths in electric vehicle sector are undeniable,” Carney said Friday. “China produces some of the most affordable and efficient energy-efficient vehicles in the world. And in order for Canada to build our own competitive EV sector, we need to learn from innovative partners, access their supply chains, and increase local demand.’’

But Carney’s economic rapprochement with Beijing amounts to a gamble.

“This was an extraordinarily difficult thing for Carney to do,’’ Alden said. “Relations between Canada and China have been extremely fraught.’’

In 2018, China detained two Canadians in retaliation for Canada arresting an executive of the Chinese tech firm Huawei at the request of the United States. All three were released in a 2021 swap. Canada also launched an investigation three years ago into whether the Chinese interfered in Canadian elections in 2019 and 2021.

The deal has drawn criticism already for exposing Canadian autoworkers to competition from low-price Chinese EVs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, leading the province that is the centre of Canadian auto production, blasted the deal.

“Make no mistake: China now has a foothold in the Canadian market and will use it to their full advantage at the expense of Canadian workers,” Ford posted on social media. “Worse, by lowering tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles this lopsided deal risks closing the door on Canadian automakers to the American market, our largest export destination.”

In response to the criticism, Carney noted that the deal is limited. China can only export 49,000 EVs to Canada at the reduced 6.1 percent tariff rate, rising to about 70,000 in five years.

But the biggest risk to Canada comes from its prickly southern neighbour.

The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) – a regional trade pact that allows many goods to cross North American borders duty free – comes up for renewal this year. Trump is almost sure to demand changes meant to shift manufacturing to the United States and might threaten to pull out of the deal altogether, especially if he is inclined to punish Carney for reversing his policy with China.

That’s a scary thought for Canada, which sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States.

The Canada-China deal Friday “will make the talks more complicated", said William Reinsch, a former US trade official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"Trump will not be pleased with the Canadian action, will probably take some retaliatory measure, probably against the Canadian auto industry , and will certainly make it an issue in the USMCA talks.’’

On Friday anyway, Trump commended Carney: “If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.″ And Carney noted that the China deal is preliminary, potentially giving him flexibility to seek changes if necessary to head off a conflict with the US.

For days, Syrian troops had amassed around a cluster of villages that lie just west of ​the winding Euphrates River and had called on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stationed there to redeploy their forces on the opposite bank of the river.

Overnight, SDF ‍head Mazloum Abdi said his forces would withdraw early on Saturday morning as a gesture of goodwill, leaving the river as a front line between Syrian government troops to its west and Kurdish forces to its east.

But clashes broke out ​in some towns and oil fields on Saturday as the SDF and Syria 's army accused each other of violating the agreement, with Kurdish ​authorities saying Syrian troops were pushing into towns not included in the withdrawal deal.

Kurdish authorities in northern Syria ordered a curfew for the Raqqa region "until further notice", as government forces advanced and threatened to bomb sites in the area.

After taking control of territory outside Aleppo city earlier Saturday, the army designated a swathe of Kurdish-held territory in Raqqa province southwest of the Euphrates River, including the city of Tabqa, a "closed military zone".

In statements carried on state media, it announced it would target what it said were several military sites in the area – one of them near Raqqa city.

Syrian troops moved relatively smoothly into the main town of Deir Hafer and surrounding villages whose residents are predominantly Arab, according to statements from the military.

Some residents had left in recent days through a humanitarian corridor set up by Syria's army but those who stayed celebrated the army's arrival.

"It happened with the least amount of losses. There's been enough blood in this country, Syria. We have sacrificed and lost enough – people are tired of it," Hussein al-Khalaf, a resident of Deir Hafer, told Reuters.

SDF forces had withdrawn east, some on foot, towards the flashpoint town of Tabqa – downstream but still on the western side of the river, according to a Reuters reporter in the ‍area.

But when Syria's army announced it was aiming to capture Tabqa next, the SDF said it wasn't part of the original deal and that it would fight to keep the town, as well as oil fields in its vicinity.

Syria's army ​said four of its troops had been killed in attacks by Kurdish militants, and the SDF said some of its own fighters had been killed, but did not give a number.

US-led coalition planes flew over the flashpoint towns, releasing warning flares, according to a Syrian security source.

In a bid to end the fighting, ‌US envoy Tom Barrack travelled to Erbil in northern Iraq on Saturday to meet with both Abdi and Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, according to two Kurdish sources. There was no immediate comment from Barrack's spokesperson.

France 's President Emmanuel Macron and the president of Iraqi Kurdistan , Nechirvan Barzani, in telephone talks on Saturday urged a cessation of fighting in Syria, the French presidency said.

They "called on all parties for an immediate de-escalation and a permanent ceasefire", it said, after fighting between Syrian Kurdish forces and government troops in the country's north.

Weeks of tensions between Syrian troops and the SDF have deepened the ‍fault-line between the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa , who has vowed to reunify the fractured country after 14 years of war, and local Kurdish authorities wary of his Islamist-led administration.

The two sides engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, insisting repeatedly that they wanted to resolve disputes diplomatically.

But after the deadline passed with little progress, clashes broke out earlier this month in the northern city of Aleppo and ended with a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters.

Syrian troops then amassed around towns in the north and east to pressure Kurdish authorities into making concessions in the deadlocked talks with Damascus.

Kurdish authorities still hold key Arab-majority areas in the country's east, including some of Syria's largest oil ‍and gas fields. Arab tribal leaders in SDF-held territory have told Reuters they are ready to take up arms against the Kurdish force if Syria's army issues orders to do so.

Kurdish fears have been deepened ‌by bouts of sectarian violence last ​year, when nearly 1,500 Alawites were killed by government-aligned forces in western Syria and hundreds of Druze were killed in southern Syria, some in execution-style killings.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 16:55:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d5efafba-f3bc-11f0-91bf-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26017502408089.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON 2025: Egypt and Nigeria face off for third place</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/afcon-2025-egypt-and-nigeria-face-off-for-third-place</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 16:55:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0915d5fe-f3c2-11f0-a314-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1341998506696bb97a957711-07851543.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland: Trump announces 10% tariff on Europe – including France, UK, Denmark – starting Feb. 1</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260117-greenland-trump-announces-10-tariff-on-europe-%E2%80%93-including-france-uk-denmark-%E2%80%93-starting-feb-1</link><description>US President ​Donald Trump on ⁠Saturday vowed to implement a wave of rising tariffs ​on European ‍allies until the United ​States is allowed to purchase ​Greenland .

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain - all already subject to tariffs imposed by Trump.

Those tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1 and would continue until a deal was reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote.

The president has repeatedly said Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and large mineral deposits, and has not ruled out using force to take it. European nations this week sent military personnel to the island at Denmark's request.

"These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable," Trump wrote.

"The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades," he said.

Protesters in Denmark and Greenland demonstrated on Saturday against Trump's demands and called for it to be left to determine its own future.

Prominent European Union countries have backed Denmark, warning that the U.S. military seizure of a territory in NATO could collapse the military alliance that Washington leads. Britain has also given its support.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 17:40:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DTINOUR3IRPOVCJSDAHLXRA76Q.jpg?auth=afc70aecd9f7e3879f4c7e449d683429a7c4d6183455359e914b32e8d8c53f66&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU and Mercosur sign trade deal after 25 years of negotiations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/eu-mercosur-sign-trade-deal-after-25-years-negotiations-2026-01-17/</link><description>ASUNCION, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Top officials from the EU and the South American bloc Mercosur signed a free trade agreement on Saturday in Paraguay, paving the way for the European Union's largest ever trade accord after 25 years of negotiations.

The agreement, designed to lower tariffs and boost trade between the two regions, must now gain the consent of the European Parliament and be ratified by legislatures of Mercosur members Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa joined the presidents of Mercosur countries at Saturday's ceremony, with the exception of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who sent his foreign minister.

The deal was signed after receiving the green light from most European nations last week, despite concerns from farmer and environmental groups, who fear a surge of inexpensive South American imports and increased deforestation.

Von der Leyen, who met with Lula before heading to Asuncion for the signing, said the deal would create the largest free trade zone in the world.

"This agreement sends a very strong message to the world. It reflects a clear and deliberate choice. We choose fair trade over tariffs. We choose a productive, long-term partnership over isolation," she said on Saturday.

Trade between the two blocs, which encompasses a market of 700 million people, reached a value of 111 billion euros in 2024. European Union exports mainly consist of machinery, chemical products, and transport equipment, whereas Mercosur's exports are concentrated in agricultural goods, minerals, wood pulp, and paper.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 17:41:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PRWYY4ZS2RL7ZG55CP3KGIU7ME.jpg?auth=18bc91d16e54844f6685501ad2414ad99c48103c2f5e62c01f143cb72c84ceb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel says US Gaza executive board composition against its policy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-us-gaza-executive-board-composition-against-its-policy-2026-01-17/</link><description>TEL AVIV, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Saturday that this week's Trump administration announcement on the composition of a Gaza executive board was not coordinated with Israel and ran counter to government policy.

It said Foreign Minister Gideon Saar would raise the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The statement did not specify what part of the board's composition contradicted Israeli policy. An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment.

The board, unveiled by the White House on Friday, includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Israel has repeatedly opposed any Turkish role in Gaza.

Other members of the executive board include Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process; an Israeli‑Cypriot billionaire; and a minister from the United Arab Emirates, which established relations with Israel in 2020.

Washington this week also announced the start of the second phase of President Donald Trump's plan, announced in September, to end the war in Gaza. This includes creating a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in the enclave.

The first members of the so-called Board of Peace - to be chaired by Trump and tasked with supervising Gaza's temporary governance - were also named. Members include Rubio, billionaire developer Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 17:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IXV2BANUPBIEZL3YQTQBKMRJJE.jpg?auth=39cebb0d26d453b1222b1338725333e894c3aeb6707ae27a4b251ff14a7dc1ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq takes full control of air base after US withdrawal, defence ministry says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraq-takes-full-control-air-base-after-us-withdrawal-defence-ministry-says-2026-01-17/</link><description>BAGHDAD, Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. forces have withdrawn from Iraq's Ain al-Asad Airbase, which housed U.S.-led forces in Western Iraq, and the Iraqi army has assumed full control, the Iraqi defence ministry said on Saturday.

In 2024, Washington and Baghdad reached an understanding , opens new tab on plans for the withdrawal of U.S.-led coalition forces from Iraq and a move towards a bilateral security relationship.

Ain al-Asad has hosted U.S. and coalition troops for years and has been repeatedly targeted by Iran-backed armed groups during periods of heightened regional tensions, including after the 2020 U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.

An Iraqi army colonel confirmed the U.S. forces withdrawal from the base, saying there were a few soldiers remaining due to some logistical issues. He did not give further details for security reasons.

It was not immediately clear when the withdrawal started, but the initial plan stipulated that hundreds of troops would leave by September 2025, with the rest departing by the end of 2026.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 18:29:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SBO25MQYB5MYFLYIMWT5JFPIJY.jpg?auth=61cf0a34811952a18f4b72674f99f6c38a2965737183dd4ba74ee6c45b52cd69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Minneapolis keeps guard over schools amid ICE arrests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whistles-walkie-talkies-minneapolis-keeps-guard-over-schools-amid-ice-arrests-2026-01-17/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Peter Brown's gray mustache and beard were matted with ice as he stood watch on a frigid Friday afternoon outside Green Central Elementary, not far from where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good last week.

Wearing a neon green vest and equipped with a whistle and walkie-talkie, Brown, an 81-year-old retired lawyer who lives nearby, kept his head on a swivel. His eyes were taking in each passing car and pedestrian near the campus as he stood ready to sound the alarm should federal immigration personnel approach the school, which teaches in English and Spanish and is around the corner from the spot where Good died.

"I never did like bullies, and that's what the federal government has become," Brown said, explaining why an octogenarian stood outside for four hours in -2 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chill (-19 Celsius). "What's happening in my city is nothing more than authoritarian intimidation, and me and my neighbors are not going to put up with it."

The Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 federal agents across the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, making it the latest region targeted by the president's mass deportation program . People who normally might be organizing parent-teacher association meetings are arranging security patrols at their kids' schools to watch for immigration agents.

Some parents not on patrol are escorting foreign-born teachers or staff members, driving them to and from their homes and schools to make them feel safer. Others are delivering groceries and prescription medicines to immigrant families who are too afraid to leave their homes or send their kids to class.

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat representing Minnesota, said on Friday she had met with school principals from her state "and heard horror stories of kids and parents 'under siege' by ICE."

"Little kids scared. Dangerous encounters. This is no longer about a fraud investigation," Klobuchar wrote on social media, as she urged residents to remain peaceful.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said this week more than 2,500 people have been arrested during the effort that officials have dubbed Operation Metro Surge. DHS has repeatedly said its agents are not targeting schools.

“ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children," said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. "Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened."

But parents and school leaders say otherwise.

A spokesperson for Saint Paul Public Schools said in a statement that two of its contracted student transportation vans were pulled over by ICE agents this week. Several schools and daycare centers have emailed parents to notify them of teachers and staff who have been detained, according to school leaders and parents.

Schools have notified the public that some parents have been detained at bus stops after dropping off kids. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters on the grounds of Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis as classes ended, just a few hours after Good was shot and killed. DHS said the clash followed agents' pursuit of someone who had rammed one of their vehicles several miles away and fled to the school grounds.

Several school districts — including those in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the state's two largest — have cancelled classes some days and are allowing students to learn online instead of attending classes in person for the next several weeks in response to the immigration operations.

“Many families in my area are afraid to send their kids to school because ICE is staking out our bus stops,” state Representative Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, a Democrat and co-chair of the Minnesota House of Representatives' Children and Families Finance and Policy Committee, told the Star Tribune newspaper.

Nate Byrne, a spokesperson for Kids Count on Us, a coalition of 500 community-based childcare centers in Minnesota, said it is receiving daily reports about ICE officers on or near childcare center grounds, and that such centers in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods have seen a 50% reduction in attendance.

Kids Count on Us has received reports of childcare workers taken into ICE custody, Byrne said, though he did not have specific figures.

"Parents who are not fearful of being detained by ICE — typically because they are white — are forming teams to patrol outside their childcare centers during drop-off and pick-up and when staff need to come and go," Byrne said. "Parents who are fearful of being detained by ICE due to the color of their skin are being extremely cautious."

St. Paul parent Kelly, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, citing fears of retribution from the federal government, said she was helping deliver food to immigrant families that attend her children's school but were afraid to leave their homes. Parents are also raising money to help pay rent for the families across the metro area, as the parents are missing work, according to Kelly and other parents.

Kelly, who was attending a Friday night protest against ICE with her husband and two children, ages 6 and 9, said she was bewildered by what has become of her city amid the immigration raids. In years past, she volunteered for parent-teacher association events. Now, she carries a whistle everywhere she goes and said she is ready to confront federal agents if they approach her kids' school.

"There's no parenting handbook for this," Kelly said. "My parents never had to sit me down and explain that my classmates who are suddenly missing from school aren't there because their parents are afraid of being snatched by the government."</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 18:30:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VKEXBHJBABPE3MC3S5QN2KPNPY.jpg?auth=df979cd30aeb0582e974b0d1a46fb4f2ae5892cc1bffa0d1d72913f0d6f083ab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU and Mercosur sign landmark free trade deal after 25 years of negotiations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260117-eu-and-mercosur-sign-landmark-free-trade-deal-after-25-years-of-negotiations</link><description>Top officials from the EU and the South American bloc Mercosur signed a free trade agreement on Saturday in Paraguay , paving the way for ​the European Union 's largest ever trade accord after 25 years ‍of negotiations.

Although the accord eliminates more than 90 percent of tariffs on goods and services between the European and Mercosur markets, some tariffs will progressively be cut over 10-15 years and key farm products such as beef will be limited by strict quotas in a bid to assuage European farmers’ fears.

Those quotas, as well as safeguard measures and generous EU subsidies to cash-strapped farmers, pushed agricultural powerhouse Italy across the line earlier this month. France , however, remains opposed to the accord .

In creating one of the world’s largest free trade zones, the accord – pushed by South America 's renowned cattle-raising countries and Europe's industrial sectors craving new markets for cars and machines – brings together a market of more than 700 million consumers that accounts for a quarter of global gross domestic product.

A counter-protest organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump is expected to take place nearby and clashes were feared, leading state authorities to put the Minneapolis National Guard on alert to respond if needed, officials said. Minneapolis police in SWAT gear boarded buses and armored carriers and headed downtown, where the protests were expected to kick off around 1 p.m. local time.

Jake Lang, one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 event, said his “anti-fraud” march would begin at Minneapolis City Hall, where he vowed to burn copies of the Koran and lead people on a march for about two miles to the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, where many Somali immigrants live.

Residents vowed to blockade the neighborhood and not let the marchers into the area.

Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota.

Lang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure the United States for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week.

Some 3,000 agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot Good , a U.S. citizen and mother of three, behind the wheel of her car on January 7, igniting large and heated protests against Trump’s deportation efforts in the metro area.

The situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 19:17:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/43QNGYGG3JM7RJCSZSJHJEMY5Q.jpg?auth=063abf624fd0874dae7852cec43a1b7e8aa85f1655fc0fba638d8fdf11b6b757&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron says Trump tariff threat over Greenland unacceptable</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-says-trump-tariff-threat-over-greenland-unacceptable-2026-01-17/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - France's President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that the threat of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump over Greenland was unacceptable and that if they were confirmed Europe would respond in a coordinated manner.

The Justice Department since December has been releasing caches of documents tied to its investigations of Epstein. But U.S. Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have criticized the department's slow pace.

Khanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, last week said they asked U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer to permit them to file a brief that would argue for the appointment of a special master and independent monitor, given the Justice Department's failure to fully comply with a law that requires the DOJ to release all records related to Epstein by December 19.

In a six-page letter filed on Friday to U.S. District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche argued that Khanna and Thomas Massie are not parties to the U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell case involving Epstein and should not be allowed to file a friend of the court request in the matter.

"Representatives Khanna and Massie do not have standing, their stated objectives are in-consistent with the role of an amicus as well as the role of the Court, and, in any event, there is no authority permitting the Court to grant the Representatives the relief they improperly seek," the DOJ said in the letter signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney for the Southern District of New York.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.

The Justice Department said at the end of 2025 that it had 5.2 million pages of Epstein files left to review and needs 400 lawyers from four different department offices to help with the process through late January.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 19:38:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ILFJKU4RBI2JEN73NHPR7JWBE.jpg?auth=9870531b243b02eb90743d6cbd5cb89d9c1eb3be566a5196ab8c69edad16adf1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US kills al-Qaeda affiliate leader tied to December attack in Syria, Centcom says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-kills-al-qaeda-affiliate-leader-tied-december-attack-syria-centcom-says-2026-01-17/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. military forces on Friday killed an al-Qaeda affiliate leader linked to an Islamic State attack on Americans in Syria last month , U.S. Central Command said in a statement on Saturday.

Bilal Hasan al-Jasim had "direct ties" to an ISIS gunman who killed and injured U.S. and Syrian personnel on December 13 in Palmyra, Syria, Central Command said.

“The death of a terrorist operative linked to the deaths of three Americans demonstrates our resolve in pursuing terrorists who attack our forces,” said Admiral Brad Cooper, the head of U.S. Central Command, in a statement.

Since the December 13 attack, U.S. forces have been conducting strikes in Syria, with the U.S. military saying it has hit more than 100 ISIS targets.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 21:18:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU calls emergency envoys meeting for Sunday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-calls-emergency-envoys-meeting-sunday-after-trump-vows-tariffs-linked-2026-01-17/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 countries will convene on Sunday for an emergency meeting after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.

The demonstrations were sparked by anger over economic hardship that exploded into the biggest protests against the Islamic Republic in more than three years.

But demonstrations have subsided after the crackdown that rights groups say left thousands of people dead under an internet blackout that has lasted more than a week.

Schools were set to resume Sunday, the ISNA news agency said, following a one-week closure, with postponed university exams set to be held in a week.

Authorities have said demonstrations they condemn as "riots" had been controlled and calm returned, with state-aligned media reporting thousands of arrests.

"By God's grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition," supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told supporters during a televised address.

"We do not intend to lead the country to war, but we will not spare domestic criminals," he added, saying "international criminals" were "worse".

He alleged that "agents ... murdered a few thousand people. They murdered some with the utmost inhumanity, meaning pure savagery" – seemingly his first admission that thousands had died.

Iranian authorities have blamed the latest wave of demonstrations on arch-foes the United States and Israel , saying they fuelled a "terrorist operation" that hijacked peaceful protests over the economy.

Trump, who backed and joined Israel's 12-day war against Iran in June, had repeatedly threatened new military action against Tehran if protesters were killed.

Khamenei on Saturday lashed out at Trump, accusing him of being "guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation".

"This was an American conspiracy," he said, adding that "America's goal is to swallow Iran ... the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination".

In response, Trump called for an end to Khamenei’s nearly 40-year reign.

“The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people,” Trump told Politico in an interview Saturday. “His country is the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership.”

“It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran," he added.

While Washington has appeared to have stepped back, the US president has said he has not ruled out military options and made clear he was keeping a close eye on whether any protesters were executed.

Trump on Friday had struck a more conciliatory tone, saying on his Truth Social platform that Iran had called off the executions of hundreds of protesters and said to the clerical state: "Thank you!"

Asked on state TV about Trump's comment, Tehran prosecutor Ali Salehi said the US president "always talks a lot of nonsense" and that the government's response had been "firm, dissuasive and swift" with many cases leading to indictments and sent to court.

Rights groups have estimated up to 20,000 people have been arrested. Security officials cited by the Tasnim news agency on Friday said around 3,000 people were arrested.

Iranian authorities said on Saturday that "a 32-member network of the Bahai espionage cult who were active in the riots and acts of vandalism were identified and 12 main agents were arrested and 13 were summoned," according to Tasnim.

The Bahais, Iran's biggest non-Muslim religious minority, regularly experience persecution and the Islamic Republic has accused its members of being spies linked to Israel.

Alarm has mounted over the reported death toll during the crackdown, as verifying cases remains difficult under severe internet restrictions.

Eyewitnesses who left Iran after the protests told AFP of coming under fire and hearing numerous gunshots during protests.

Kiarash, who gave only his first name for security reasons, was fired on during protests on January 10 and said he saw thousands of bodies at a mortuary in Tehran.

"I saw the blood ... Thousands of people and thousands of dead bodies" of people "asking for their rights", he told AFP from Germany .

Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) says 3,428 protesters have been verified to have been killed by security forces, but warns the actual toll could be several times higher.

Other estimates place the death toll at more than 5,000 – and possibly as high as 20,000, IHR said.

The opposition Iran International channel based outside the country has said at least 12,000 people were killed during the protests, citing senior government and security sources.

Monitor Netblocks said on Saturday "internet connectivity continues to flatline in Iran despite a minor short-lived bump in access earlier today, when new reports of atrocities emerged".

People in Iran were reportedly again able to send text messages within the country and to outside numbers but were still often unable to receive texts from those abroad.

Rights groups say there have been no verifiable reports of protests in recent days and videos circulating on social media have shown a heavy security presence in some areas.

But Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of the shah ousted in the 1979 Islamic revolution, took to social media on Friday to call for Iranians to protest again on Saturday and Sunday evening.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 21:40:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b49106c6-f3ac-11f0-b3e8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/0b7dbc2ec8eda006799c1c1c4e6bf06634e9d54a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU warns of 'dangerous downward spiral'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-warns-downward-spiral-after-trump-threatens-tariffs-over-greenland-2026-01-17/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders on Saturday warned of a "dangerous downward spiral" over U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to implement increasing tariffs on European allies until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.

"Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President Antonio Costa said in posts on X.

The bloc's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said tariffs would hurt prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, while distracting the EU from its "core task" of ending Russia's war in Ukraine.

"China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies," Kallas said on X.

"Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity. If Greenland’s security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO."

Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 countries will convene on Sunday for an emergency meeting to discuss their response to the tariff threat.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:22:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/35TURRJKS5OOPAB6Q2NLOWITQA.jpg?auth=9357ab30f7046186c9c8ae998283aae191725346ad13be364fabcc03d3224df7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'The goal is to destroy the Syrian Democratic Forces': Clashes break out between army and Kurds</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/the-goal-is-to-destroy-the-syrian-democratic-forces-clashes-break-out-between-army-and-kurds</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:23:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9913ee94-f3ee-11f0-93b4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260117-210522-210813-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A lot of contradictory information': Syrian and Kurdish forces clash along the Euphrates River</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/a-lot-of-contradictory-information-syrian-and-kurdish-forces-clash-along-the-euphrates-river</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:23:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e08be9d0-f3ed-11f0-9e81-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260117-210232-210521-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rights group says 139 political prisoners released in Venezuela since January</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rights-group-says-139-political-prisoners-released-venezuela-since-january-2026-01-17/</link><description>Jan 17 (Reuters) - Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal said on Saturday that it has confirmed the release of 139 political prisoners in Venezuela since January 8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:45:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D2GMANNVEZP4JKTHF2UAXBFMWQ.jpg?auth=46f9d60181c3849af60b51054cbd9b5ca917b21eb50220137b2804ab1a08c16d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guatemalan inmates riot at three prisons, taking 46 people hostage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/guatemalan-inmates-riot-three-prisons-taking-46-people-hostage-2026-01-17/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Inmates at three prisons in Guatemala rioted on Saturday and took at least 46 people hostage, mostly guards but also a psychologist, officials said.

So far, there have been no reported deaths or injuries among the hostages, Interior Minister Marco Antonio Villeda said at a press conference.

Villeda said prisoners coordinated riots at three prisons, which he alleged were organized by the Barrio 18 gang, which was rioting because its leader is seeking a transfer to another facility to gain better conditions and special treatment.

“I am not going to make any deals with any terrorist group, I will not give in to this blackmail, and I will not restore their privileges in exchange for them stopping their actions,” Villeda added.

While hostage situations involving prison guards have occurred previously in Guatemala, the current number of hostages is notably higher than in past incidents.

The ministry said security forces, including members of the army, are maintaining full perimeter control and working to restore order and ensure the safety of surrounding areas.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 23:22:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heavy rains in eastern Australia spark flash floods, 20 rescued</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/heavy-rains-eastern-australia-spark-flash-floods-20-rescued-2026-01-17/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Australian authorities on Sunday said 20 people were rescued from floodwaters in the eastern state of New South Wales after torrential rains sparked warnings for residents to move to higher ground.

In state capital Sydney, Australia's largest city, residents and holidaymakers were evacuated late on Saturday after dangerous flooding hit the low-lying suburb of Narrabeen, authorities said.

Emergency crews responded to more than 1,400 incidents across the state since the rain hit on Saturday, the authorities said, adding that most rescues related to people driving through floodwaters.

"There has been a lot of flash flooding which has closed roads, and we anticipate some may remain closed for some time," State Emergency Services Assistant Commissioner Sonya Oyston said in a statement.

The authorities warned more thunderstorms were possible south of Sydney on Sunday. Some 72.4 mm (2.8 inches) of rain fell on Sydney's northern fringe in 2 hours on Sunday morning, the nation's weather forecaster said.

On Saturday, a woman died after being hit by a falling tree branch near Wollongong, about 66km (41 miles) south of Sydney, amid the wild weather, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 23:43:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump wants nations to pay $1 billion to stay on his peace board, report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-wants-nations-pay-1-billion-stay-his-peace-board-report-says-2026-01-17/</link><description>Jan 17 (Reuters) - The Trump administration wants nations to pay $1 billion to stay on his peace board, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing a draft charter.

The ATR 42-500 turboprop owned by aviation group Indonesia Air Transport lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday at about 1:30 p.m. local time (0530 GMT) around the Maros region in South Sulawesi.

There were eight crew members and three passengers on board the plane, which was chartered by Indonesia's Marine Affairs and Fisheries Ministry to conduct air surveillance on fisheries. The passengers were ministry staff members.

The head of South Sulawesi's rescue agency, Muhammad Arif Anwar, said on local television that after finding the wreckage, the rescuers would deploy 1,200 personnel to search for the missing passengers and crew.

"Our priority is to search for the victims, and we hope that there are some that we can evacuate safely," he said.

The aircraft had been heading to Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi, after departing from Yogyakarta province before contact was lost.

On Sunday morning, local rescuers found the wreckage in different locations around Mount Bulusaraung in the Maros region, said Andi Sultan, an official at South Sulawesi's rescue agency. The mountain is roughly 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of the sprawling island nation's capital, Jakarta.

"Our helicopter crews have seen the debris of the plane's window at 7:46 a.m.," Sultan told reporters.

"And around 7:49 a.m., we discovered large parts of the aircraft, suspected to be the fuselage of the plane," he said, adding the tail of the plane was also seen at the bottom of the mountain slope.

Rescuers have been deployed to the locations where the wreckage was discovered, Sultan said, adding the search was hampered by thick fog and mountainous terrain.

In video footage shared by the rescue agency, a window of the plane was found scattered on the mountain with thick fog and strong wind around it.

Sultan said Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee would lead an investigation into the crash. The cause remains unclear, and experts say most accidents are caused by a combination of factors.

The ATR 42‑500, manufactured by Franco-Italian planemaker ATR (AIR.PA) , opens new tab , (LDOF.MI) , opens new tab , is a regional turboprop aircraft capable of carrying between 42 and 50 passengers.

Flight tracking website Flightradar24 said on X that the plane was flying over the ocean at a low altitude so its tracking coverage was limited, and the last signal was received at 0420 GMT about 20 km northeast of Makassar airport.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 04:41:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pentagon readies 1,500 soldiers to possibly deploy to Minnesota, Washington Post reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-readies-1500-soldiers-possibly-deploy-minnesota-washington-post-reports-2026-01-18/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing defense officials.

The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to use the Insurrection Act if officials in the state don't stop protesters from targeting immigration officials.

"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday.
