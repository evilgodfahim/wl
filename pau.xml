Bypassing parliament to get the budget passed would inevitably trigger a no confidence motion , which could lead to the collapse of government, unless it includes revisions to the bill that placate Socialist lawmakers.

Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu's government blamed the ideologically opposed hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and the far-right National Rally (RN) for sabotaging efforts to reach a compromise during three months of talks in parliament.

"The extremes have methodically voted for amendments to make the budget unvotable," Budget Minister Amelie de Montchalin said on Friday in an interview on France 2 TV.

Lecornu will on Friday propose an amended draft of the budget bill to try to reach a compromise before talks resume on Tuesday, according to Montchalin.

"There are things we have proposed that clearly do not work," she said. "We saw that there were issues concerning local authorities, which is a major concern. It's a matter of everyday life."

Lecornu will speak "towards the end of the day", the prime minister's office said.

A government source said that Lecornu was now looking at two options to pass the budget without a vote in parliament, despite the likelihood opposition lawmakers will respond with a vote of no confidence.

He could choose to invoke Article 49.3 of the Constitution that allows the government to push through a bill without a vote, but he had previously vowed not to do that, saying he wishes for the parliament to come to an agreement.

The alternative could be to invoke Article 47 - an executive order also allowing the government to pass the budget without a vote, though it is legally unclear whether the government could include some of the revisions made by lawmakers during the three months of talks.

If the government passes a bill that does not reflect at least some of the amendments backed by Socialists, their lawmakers could back a no confidence vote.

The Socialists' pointman on the budget, Philippe Brun, threatened to back a no confidence vote "without hesitation" if the government tried to pass the budget by executive order.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:50:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HR426KJPBVKE5BDGNH6LVDYWDE.jpg?auth=ff9f14d54967b6f8573f01eb0448199232c9dfc0b9d6876e468902b507e86a38&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Africa probes Iran's role in BRICS+ naval drills</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/south-africa-launches-inquiry-into-irans-participation-brics-naval-drills-2026-01-16/</link><description>JOHANNESBURG, Jan 16 (Reuters) - South Africa's defence ministry said on Friday that Minister Angie Motshekga had launched an inquiry into Iran's participation in the BRICS+ naval exercises held in South African waters over the past week.

The defence ministry said in a statement that the inquiry would seek to determine whether South African President Cyril Ramaphosa's instructions regarding Iran's involvement were misrepresented and/or ignored.

South African news outlet Daily Maverick has reported that Ramaphosa sought to get Iran to withdraw from the drills due to concerns about the damage its participation could do to South Africa's relations with the United States.

"The Minister of Defence, Hon. Angie Motshekga, would like to place it on record that the instruction (from Ramaphosa) was clearly communicated to all parties concerned, agreed upon and to be implemented and adhered to," the defence ministry statement added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:50:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/75PUW4TQBZKB7DX3543GDF3ZFE.jpg?auth=69901e43b41332cf9d9490d3942a5234de8e284034e9d4eb050ca3ba2e24630b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela's opposition figurehead Machado presents Trump with Nobel Peace medal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/venezuela-s-opposition-figurehead-machado-presents-nobel-peace-medal-to-trump</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 10:51:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a029af86-f2c5-11f0-9802-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-143976996696a12015d2d85-12422163.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran protests abate after deadly crackdown, residents and rights group say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/iran-protests-abate-after-deadly-crackdown-residents-rights-group-say-2026-01-16/</link><description>Dubai, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Iran's deadly crackdown appears to have broadly quelled protests for now, according to a rights group and residents, as state media reported more arrests on Friday in the shadow of U.S. threats to intervene if killing continues.

After President Donald Trump's repeated threats of military action against Iran in support of protesters, fears of a U.S. attack have retreated since Wednesday, when Trump said he'd been told killings in the crackdown were easing.

U.S. allies including Saudi Arabia and Qatar conducted intense diplomacy with Washington this week to prevent a U.S. strike, warning of consequences for the wider region that would ultimately impact the United States, a Gulf official said.

The White House said on Thursday that Trump is closely monitoring the situation on the ground, adding that the president and his team have warned Tehran there would be “grave consequences” if killings linked to its crackdown continue.

Trump understands that 800 scheduled executions were halted, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt added, saying the president was keeping "all of his options on the table".

The protests erupted on December 28 over soaring inflation in Iran, whose economy has been crippled by sanctions, before spiralling into one of the biggest challenges yet to the clerical establishment that has run Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

With information flows from Iran obstructed by an internet blackout, several residents of Tehran said the capital had been quiet since Sunday. They said drones were flying over the city, where they'd seen no sign of protests on Thursday or Friday.

Iranian-Kurdish rights group Hengaw said that there had been no protest gatherings since Sunday, saying "the security environment remains highly restrictive".

"Our independent sources confirm a heavy military and security presence in cities and towns where protests previously took place, as well as in several locations that did not experience major demonstrations," Norway-based Hengaw said in comments to Reuters.

Another resident in a northern city on the Caspian Sea said the streets also appeared calm.

The residents declined to be identified for their safety.

There were, however, indications of unrest in some areas.

Hengaw reported that a female nurse was killed by direct gunfire from government forces during protests in Karaj, west of Iran. Reuters was not able to independently verify the report.

The state-affiliated Tasnim news outlet reported that rioters set fire to a local education office in Falavarjan County, in central Isfahan Province, on Thursday.

An elderly resident of a town in Iran's northwestern region, where many Kurdish Iranians live and which has been the focus for many of the biggest flare-ups, said sporadic protests had continued, though not as intensely.

Describing scenes of violence earlier in the protests, she said: "I have not scenes like that before."

The state-owned Press TV cited Iran's police chief as saying calm had been restored across the country.

A death toll reported by U.S.-based rights group HRANA has increased little since Wednesday, currently standing at 2,677 people, including 2,478 protesters and 163 people identified as people affiliated with the government.

Reuters has not been able to independently verify the HRANA death toll. An Iranian official told the news agency earlier this week that about 2,000 people had been killed in the unrest.

The casualty numbers dwarf the death toll from previous bouts of unrest that have been suppressed by the state.

Iranian authorities have described the unrest as the most violent yet, accusing foreign enemies of fomenting it and armed people they have identified as terrorists of targeting security forces and carrying out other attacks.

The state-affiliated Tasnim news outlet reported what it described as the arrest of a large number of leaders of recent riots in the western province of Kermanshah.

Tasnim also reported the arrest of five people accused of vandalising a gas station and a base belonging to the Basij - a branch of the security forces often used to quell unrest - in the southeastern city of Kerman.

Also on Friday, state television broadcast the funerals of members of the security forces in Semnan, northern Iran, and Semirom, central Iran.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UNDKBRS6FISPL3CRRG3GHTAYA.jpg?auth=265ed7be7e20f3fbcde4f7c39e682657ba4172c8cf01b629b9b16742a27fc359&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Small Minneapolis businesses hit hard by ICE crackdown, while corporations stay silent</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/small-minneapolis-businesses-hit-hard-by-ice-crackdown-while-corporations-stay-2026-01-16/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Up and down Lake Street in the heavily Latino area of south Minneapolis, numerous mom-and-pop restaurants have hung up signs that say "No ICE," referring to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials who have been conducting frequent raids in the area. The federal actions have also prompted thousands in the streets to protest after ICE agents killed 37-year-old Renee Good in her vehicle last week.

By contrast, large corporations in Minneapolis have been much less vocal about the effects of immigration enforcement on the city, known as both a bastion of progressive politics in the U.S. Midwest and a robust corporate employer. Seventeen Fortune 500 companies are based in Minnesota, including Target (TGT.N) , opens new tab , UnitedHealth (UNH.N) , opens new tab , and General Mills (GIS.N) , opens new tab .

Reuters reached out to those companies, as well as Minnesota-based corporations Best Buy (BBY.N) , opens new tab , Hormel (HRL.N) , opens new tab , Land O'Lakes, agricultural giant Cargill, and industrial conglomerate 3M (MMM.N) , opens new tab . None would speak on the record on the guidance they have given to employees. Their websites also have not addressed the current federal actions or unrest in the city.

It stands in contrast with how companies responded in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd that spurred nationwide anger; many companies, including UnitedHealth and General Mills, spoke out in support of Floyd or his family after his death.

Their silence, according to Bill George, a Minneapolis-based former executive and current Harvard Business School fellow, is a mistake.

"A lot of them are very silent and I think it's not a good time to be silent," he told Reuters. He added he has spoken with numerous executives in the Minneapolis area who have expressed concerns about the toll on business, with many still in the process of formulating guidance to workers.

"It is disappointing to me that we don't hear their voices. They're charged with the safety, security and well-being of their employees," he said.

Businesses have been much less outspoken about President Donald Trump's policies in his second term, due to fear of retaliation or threats of boycotts. After a Hilton-owned (HLT.N) , opens new tab Hampton Inn cancelled bookings for ICE members in early January, the company removed it from its network.

Many restaurants on Lake Street have reduced hours or closed. At Pineda Tacos, where a “No ICE” sign hangs in the front window and trash cans barricade the rear entrance, employees guard the door in an effort to prevent surprise raids, letting customers in one-by-one. Owner Luis Reyes Rojas said fear has reshaped daily operations.

“We have plan A, plan B and plan C,” Reyes Rojas said, describing plans to retreat to offices or basements in case agents appear. "We don’t know how much longer we can endure this.”

FEELING THE EFFECTS

Business associations say the $350 billion regional economy is feeling the effects, from sales declines at small businesses to falling attendance at large companies and agricultural operations. “There are impacts that roll up to Fortune 500 companies and all the way down to sole proprietors,” said Mike Logan, CEO of the Minneapolis Regional Chamber of Commerce.

The Trump administration has defended the operations, and has added more agents even as 69% of Americans in a recent Reuters poll say federal agents should minimize the harm to people during operations, even if arrests decline.

One high-profile ICE incident took place at a Target store in the suburb of Richfield, where a pair of workers - both U.S. citizens - were taken by ICE agents. One of those arrested was a 17-year-old Target employee, according to a source familiar with the situation. Target has not issued any public statement about the ICE raids; it declined to comment for this story.

Michael Howard, a Democratic state representative, whose district includes parts of Minneapolis and Richfield, said he has been trying to learn more about Target's protocols related to ICE. He is urging them to "exert more clearly their private property rights and Fourth Amendment rights to request that if ICE is going into their public-private spaces that they present a judicial warrant.”

Jeff, 61, who owns a residential cleaning company in the Minneapolis suburbs, said he has told his all-Latino workforce not to work if they feel threatened. He declined to share his last name or business name out of fear of attracting ICE attention. He has been filling the tanks of company cars following reports that ICE has questioned people at gas stations.

“I’m not telling anyone they have to work,” he said. “If they want to, I will give them as safe a route as I can give them. If they don’t want to come in, I understand, and no one will get fired.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NITM2REC5VIP7CNKHTI2XMZCBE.jpg?auth=fbd7ed071b58bf14f178a261e628755582899a385349e9cecafdb2c35f61a28f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia hails apparent desire of some EU states to resume dialogue on Ukraine with Moscow</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-hails-apparent-desire-some-eu-states-resume-dialogue-ukraine-with-moscow-2026-01-16/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Kremlin on Friday hailed what it said looked like the desire of Italy, France and Germany to resume dialogue on Ukraine with Russia as a "significant shift" which matched its own view of how the situation should evolve.

British Foreign Minister Yvette Cooper has signalled London does not agree that the time is right to re-engage, however, telling Politico that she had seen no evidence that Moscow wants peace in Ukraine.

"As for Britain, yes, Britain continues to take a radical stance," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday, when asked about the apparent shift in some European attitudes towards the idea of talking to Moscow.

"Nonetheless... the statements by the three leaders (of Italy, France and Germany) represents significant progress from our perspective," said Peskov, who said that such a shift, if it reflected those countries' strategic vision, was in line with how Russia believed things should evolve.

Moscow had an ongoing dialogue with the United States about so far unsuccessful efforts to get a peace deal in Ukraine, he added, but no such dialogue currently existed with European governments.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said earlier this month that Europe should restart dialogue with Russia to try to win more influence in negotiations over Ukraine, saying the EU should appoint an envoy to deal directly with President Vladimir Putin.

French President Emmanuel Macron has also spoken of the possibility of re-engaging, talking in December of the necessity for a "fulsome dialogue" with Moscow within weeks if a robust and lasting peace for Ukraine was not reached in the meantime.

On Thursday, according to German media, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called Russia a European country, saying he hoped ties between the EU and Moscow could be rebalanced.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/525WY2CTIZOJHG5TOKYJUINYPU.jpg?auth=405de6eed29414304fcf20e5a7f2457232aed7713d22d87ed630a32c7e6fe2e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar tells World Court Gambia has not proven Rohingya genocide case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-tells-world-court-gambia-has-not-proven-rohingya-genocide-case-2026-01-16/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Myanmar told the United Nations' top court on Friday that Gambia had not proven its accusation that the Myanmar government had committed genocide against the minority Muslim Rohingya, part of a hearing on the landmark case.

Gambia, a predominantly Muslim West African country, brought the case before the International Court of Justice in 2019. It told the court on Monday that Myanmar's authorities had targeted the Rohingya for destruction , allegations Myanmar rejected.

"Gambia has failed to meet its burden of proof. This case will be decided on proven fact not unsubstantiated allegations," Ko Ko Hlaing, a representative of the Myanmar government, told the ICJ, which is also known as the World Court.

Myanmar's armed forces launched an offensive in 2017 that forced at least 730,000 Rohingya from their homes and into neighbouring Bangladesh, where they recounted killings, mass rape and arson. A U.N. fact-finding mission concluded the 2017 military offensive had included "genocidal acts".

Myanmar has denied genocide and Hlaing told judges the offensive was a legitimate counter-terrorism campaign in response to attacks by Muslim militants. He added the U.N. fact-finding mission was not objective or reliable.

Lawyers for Gambia had argued that it would be unreasonable for judges to conclude that Myanmar's attack on thousands of Rohingya civilians, including women, children and the elderly, as well as burning their villages was done just to combat terrorism.

They said the pattern of conduct during the crackdown indicated the genocidal intent legally needed to determine genocide was committed.

The ICJ is the U.N.'s highest court and deals with disputes between states.

Gambia's case, backed by the 57-nation Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, is the first genocide case the ICJ is hearing in full in more than a decade.

The outcome will have repercussions beyond Myanmar, likely affecting South Africa's 2023 genocide case at the ICJ against Israel over the war in Gaza. Israel also denies genocide and lawyers for Israel dismissed South Africa's case as an abuse of the genocide convention.

Myanmar has been in further turmoil since 2021, when the military toppled the elected civilian government and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion.

The country is currently holding phased elections , opens new tab that have been criticised by the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups as not free or fair. The military says the vote has public backing and is being conducted without coercion.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:20:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/75PGS5KX7VLSFPG3DJF6J2ZKAQ.jpg?auth=bd1fd7a09202007b231c0ca0a3a8444f61135eb7ba85a7c08b354e94796ae7f8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece orders safety investments by Italian-owned railway after train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greece-orders-safety-investments-by-italian-owned-railway-after-train-crash-2026-01-16/</link><description>ATHENS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Greece is requiring Italian-owned railway operator Hellenic Train to invest 420 million euros ($487.41 million) in new trains and maintenance to improve safety nearly three years after the country's worst rail disaster.

The requirements are contained in amendments to a 2017 state contract with Hellenic Train approved by parliament late on Thursday, the transport ministry said in a statement.

"For the first time, the contract includes a break clause. If trains are not delivered and put into service by 2027, the state can terminate the contract," the statement said.

On February 28, 2023, a passenger train coming from Athens and a freight train coming from Thessaloniki collided head-on near the town of Larissa, killing 57 people, mostly students.

Experts hired by the families of the victims and Greek investigators have highlighted safety deficiencies.

Hellenic Train had already announced part of the new agreement - a 308 million euro investment in new electric trains from Alstom (ALSO.PA) , opens new tab - in December, calling it "a decisive step toward a safer, more modern and more passenger-focused railway".

The trains will be fitted with a system for remote communication between drivers and traffic controllers and to control a train's brakes from a distance, Hellenic Train said.

A project co-funded by the European Union to install the system was launched in 2014 but was repeatedly pushed back. EU prosecutors have charged numerous Greek officials with malpractice over that contract.

The transport ministry statement said 100 million euros of investment by Hellenic Train was earmarked for maintenance infrastructure, depots and digital systems.

Following a judicial investigation, a trial over the train crash is expected to start in March. Hellenic Train said last year it had provided all required data and was committed to continuing full cooperation with the inquiry.

"We fully trust the legal proceedings due to start later this year," Alexandra Kassimi, a spokesperson for Hellenic Train, told Reuters on Friday in response to a request for comment.

SpaceX, which owns Starlink, made the satellite service free for Iranians earlier this week, placing Musk's space company at the center of another geopolitical hot spot and pitting a team of U.S.-based engineers against a regional power armed with satellite jammers and signal-spoofing tactics, according to activists, analysts and researchers.

How SpaceX withstands Iranian attacks on its most lucrative line of business is expected to be closely watched by U.S. military forces and intelligence agencies that use Starlink and its military-grade variant Starshield, as well as China, whose own nascent satellite internet constellations are set to rival Starlink in the coming years. With SpaceX weighing a public listing this year , the situation in Iran also represents a high-profile showcase for Starlink to investors.

"We're in this weird early part of the history of space-delivered communications where SpaceX is the only true provider at this scale," said John Plumb, the former Pentagon space policy chief under President Joe Biden.

"And these repressive regimes think they can still turn off communications, but I think the day is coming where that's just not possible," he said.

Thousands of people protesting Iran's clerical rule are reported to have been killed in the past week, while Tehran's order to restrict communications makes it difficult to discern the full extent of its violent crackdown on dissent.

Starlink, which is harder for Iran to tamper with than cable and cellphone tower networks, has become crucial for documenting events on the ground.

Raha Bahreini, an Iran researcher at Amnesty International, said they had verified dozens of videos from Iran, including footage of protesters killed or injured by Iranian forces, and believe that almost all of them came from people who had access to Starlink. She added, however, that the ongoing communications restrictions have impeded human-rights organizations' communications with people in Iran in efforts to assess the scale of the violence.

Starlink is banned in Iran, yet tens of thousands of terminals may have been smuggled into the country, although it remains unclear how many are in use, according to Holistic Resilience, a U.S. nonprofit that has helped deliver Starlink terminals to Iranians and says it is working with SpaceX to monitor what it describes as Iranian attempts to jam the system.

Consumer Starlink terminals are rectangular antenna dishes that come in two sizes - one roughly the size of a pizza box and a smaller “mobile” one the size of a laptop.

The Iranian mission to the United Nations in New York declined to comment on Thursday in response to Reuters' questions.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, speaking to Al Jazeera TV on Monday, said the internet had been cut off "after we confronted terrorist operations and realized orders were coming from outside the country."

Starlink, the first massive internet-from-space constellation of its kind, has emerged as a crucial tool for communications in wartime and remote areas. The network, which drove SpaceX's $15 billion revenue in 2024, has expanded the geopolitical power of Musk, who in 2022 asserted control over how and where it was being used by Ukrainian troops fighting back Russian forces.

Roughly 10,000 low-orbiting Starlink satellites zipping above user terminals at an orbital velocity of some 17,000 miles per hour (27,360 kph) make its signals much harder to locate and disrupt than traditional satellite systems designed with a larger, single satellite fixed over a given territory.

Iran is likely using satellite jammers to disrupt the Starlink signals, according to Holistic Resilience and other specialists. Iran also appears to be engaging in so-called spoofing, or broadcasting fake GPS signals to confuse and disable Starlink terminals, according to Nariman Gharib, an Iranian opposition activist and independent cyber espionage investigator based in Britain.

The GPS spoofing wreaks havoc on a Starlink terminal's connection and slows internet speeds, said Gharib, who analyzed data from a terminal inside Iran.

"You might be able to send text messages, but forget about video calls," he said.

Though Starlink is not licensed to operate in Iran, Musk has repeatedly confirmed its presence on his social media platform X, spurring a yearslong effort by the Iranian government to counter the service. Amid protests over the death of Mahsa Amini in December 2022, Musk posted that nearly 100 Starlink terminals were active in the country.

Following the 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, Iran's parliament passed a law banning the use of Starlink, introducing severe penalties for those who use or distribute the unlicensed technology, according to Iranian state media.

Iran has also pursued diplomatic channels, urging a panel at the United Nations' International Telecommunication Union last year to force the United States and Norway — where Starlink is internationally registered — to block the service.

At a July meeting, Iran told the board that Starlink's use in the country is illegal and said an "invading country" had deployed its terminals on drones during a recent attack.

Iran told the board in November that it was struggling to locate and disable the terminals itself.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YWUDLBVX5RKQZNGRXZMHBTKFSE.jpg?auth=1258bb9b3eaaa7737fd109082555de36f684aaf7c1db3dfe45e89ce0cdc9c8b7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Musk's Starlink faces high-profile security test in Iran crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/musks-starlink-faces-high-profile-security-test-iran-crackdown-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:21:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Small Minneapolis businesses hit hard by ICE crackdown, while corporations stay silent</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/small-minneapolis-businesses-hit-hard-by-ice-crackdown-while-corporations-stay-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:21:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Greece orders safety investments by Italian-owned railway after train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greece-orders-safety-investments-by-italian-owned-railway-after-train-crash-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:21:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Poker-faced Powell may have ace up sleeve to stymie Trump's Fed shakeup</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/poker-faced-powell-may-have-ace-up-sleeve-stymie-trumps-fed-shakeup-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:43:20 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Putin talks to Netanyahu and Iran's Pezeshkian, says Russia is willing to mediate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/putin-talks-netanyahu-irans-pezeshkian-says-russia-is-willing-mediate-2026-01-16/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the situation in Iran in separate calls on Friday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, and said that Moscow was willing to mediate in the region, the Kremlin said.

Tehran has cracked down hard on nationwide protests that broke out late last month, prompting U.S. President Donald Trump to warn he might intervene. Last year, Israel and the United States both bombed Iranian nuclear sites, and Iran fought a 12-day war with Israel.

Russia has pursued closer ties with Iran since the start of its war in Ukraine, and Putin last year signed a 20-year strategic partnership pact with Pezeshkian.

In the conversation with Netanyahu, the Kremlin said Putin set out ideas for boosting stability in the Middle East and expressed Russia's willingness to "continue its mediation efforts and to promote constructive dialogue with the participation of all interested states".

The Kremlin said it would provide a readout later on the call with Pezeshkian.

Any threat to the survival of the Iranian leadership would pose a serious concern for Moscow, 13 months after it lost another key Middle East ally with the toppling of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Earlier this month another Russian ally, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, was captured by the United States and brought to New York to face drug trafficking charges.

Asked what support Russia could provide to Iran, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: "Russia is already providing assistance not only to Iran but also to the entire region, and to the cause of regional stability and peace. This is partly thanks to the president's efforts to help de-escalate tensions."

Western powers accuse Iran of having a clandestine agenda to develop nuclear weapons, something Tehran denies. Russia says it supports Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:43:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KPWVOGMRJJOQ7EBNERCACOPX2E.jpg?auth=c3678c8b5ea5aeb477cfd5f6cb338d91a3e1bc93f196ffe0b41cf2fa907c4484&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CIA director Ratcliffe meets with Venezuela's Rodriguez in Caracas, NYT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cia-director-ratcliffe-meets-with-venezuelas-rodriguez-caracas-nyt-reports-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - CIA Director John Ratcliffe met with Venezuela's interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, in Caracas, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing a U.S. official.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report of the meeting, which the Times said took place on Thursday. The White House did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Ratcliffe met with Rodriguez at U.S. President Donald Trump's direction "to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship," the report said.

They discussed intelligence cooperation, economic stability and the need to ensure that Venezuela was no longer a "safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narco-traffickers," the report added.

During her tenure as vice president of Venezuela, Rodriguez was involved in negotiations with a U.S. special envoy, Richard Grenell, along with other officials, on a deal to get the now-deposed former president Maduro to voluntarily give up power, the newspaper said.

Rodriguez has previously criticized the Trump administration for "kidnapping" Maduro and called for his return.

World Food Programme warned on Friday.

Around 15,000 people are at risk in Borno state, the agency said, an area already struggling with years of militant unrest.

Across West and Central Africa, 55 million people are facing severe food shortages, with more than three quarters of the people affected in Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon and Niger, it added.

The U.N. body did not pick out specific funding but agencies have been raising the alarm since the Trump administration started reducing aid as part of its “America First” policy last year, and Britain and others cut aid budgets to boost spending on defence .

More than 13 million children in the region were projected to suffer malnutrition this year, the WFP said.

Conflict, displacement and economic pressures have driven food insecurity for years, but cuts to humanitarian assistance were now pushing vulnerable communities beyond their ability to cope, the statement added.

“The reduced funding we saw in 2025 has deepened hunger and malnutrition across the region,” Sarah Longford, WFP’s deputy regional director for West and Central Africa, said.

Funding shortfalls in 2025 had already forced WFP to scale back nutrition programmes in Nigeria, affecting more than 300,000 children, after the agency warned that nearly 35 million people could go hungry as its resources ran out in December.

Elsewhere, insecurity in Mali has disrupted food supply routes, leaving 1.5 million people facing crisis levels of hunger, while more than half a million people in Cameroon risk being cut off from aid in the coming weeks, the statement said.

The U.N. agency said it needed more than $453 million over the next six months to continue providing humanitarian assistance across the region.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 11:44:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZSWDIML3JFOAPOLKK2OB33AJTI.jpg?auth=bc43bfcc11f21a05f010d9b64cdbbcad190ba484a147c937a4ad467e4a408d8e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria poised to attack Kurdish-held towns to pressure stalled talks, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-poised-attack-kurdish-held-towns-pressure-stalled-talks-sources-say-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 15 (Reuters) - Syrian troops are poised to attack towns in the north and east held by Kurdish fighters, sources familiar with the matter said, to pressure autonomy-minded Kurds into making concessions in deadlocked talks with the Damascus government.

The threat of renewed military action highlights the deepening fault lines between the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has vowed to reunify the fractured country under one leadership after 14 years of civil war, and regional Kurdish authorities wary of his Islamist-led administration.

The United States, which seeks to anchor peace in Syria to shore up wider Middle East stability and help prevent any resurgence of Islamic State militants, has urged both sides to avoid a showdown and return to talks, according to a Syrian official and a Syrian source familiar with diplomatic channels.

The two sides engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, insisting repeatedly that they wanted to resolve disputes diplomatically.

But after the deadline passed with little progress , clashes broke out last week in the northern city of Aleppo and ended with a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters.

Now, a broader confrontation looms, according to the sources, who include three Syrian officials, two Kurdish figures and three foreign diplomats.

As many as five Syrian army divisions could take part in the offensive targeting Kurdish-held towns in the northern province of Aleppo and the vast eastern desert province of Deir el-Zor, a senior military official involved in the planning told Reuters.

If the tactic fails to bring the parties back to the negotiating table, Syria's army is considering a full-scale campaign that could see the Kurds lose the semi-autonomous zone they have managed for more than a decade, the official said.

Syrian army units deployed on Wednesday and Thursday to the town of Deir Hafer and surrounding villages just west of the Euphrates River held by the Syrian Democratic Forces, the main Kurdish fighting force and a years-long recipient of U.S. support as it battled the Islamic State militant group.

Syria's military has ordered SDF fighters to withdraw east of the river and opened a humanitarian corridor for civilians to flee to government-held territory.

Some residents who made it out told Reuters they had to flee through farmland on foot as the main road had been shut. The SDF denied that it had blocked civilians from leaving.

Other Syrian troops were quietly sent to another front line in remote Deir el-Zor province, where the Kurds run key oil fields that Damascus says should be under central state control, according to two Syrian army commanders.

The SDF has condemned the build-up. "We clearly state that we are against any military confrontation, given its grave risks," Abdel Karim Omar, the Damascus-based representative of the Kurdish-led administration, told Reuters.

He said efforts were underway with the help of foreign mediators to revive the negotiations.

Washington had not explicitly opposed a limited operation by Syrian troops, three diplomats and an SDF official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters. But the SDF official said the U.S. was not doing enough to prevent a clash.

U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said on Friday Washington was in "close contact with all parties in Syria, working around the clock to lower the temperature, prevent escalation, and return to integration talks between the Syrian government and the SDF".

A State Department spokesperson said both sides should avoid "pushing the country back into a cycle of violence".

The messaging underscores Washington’s effort to recalibrate its Syria policy by balancing years of backing for the SDF against its new support for Sharaa, whose rebel forces ousted Russian-backed Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.

Sharaa accused the SDF of obstructing U.S. policy to nurture a reintegrated Syria and taking orders from the Kurdistan Workers' Party, a separatist group that waged a long insurgency in Turkey before entering into a peace process with Ankara.

Sharaa, speaking on state TV, said the SDF had taken "no practical steps forward" to implement last year's integration pact, but hoped it could still be carried out "calmly."

Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the SDF must show good intentions by unilaterally leaving the Deir Hafer area, instead of being expelled by a military offensive.

"I hope it doesn't come to that point ..., but when problems are not solved through dialogue, unfortunately, I see from here that the use of force is also an option for the Syrian government," Fidan said on Thursday.

If fighting spills into Deir el-Zor, it could draw in local Arab tribes who complain of marginalisation and forced conscription of tribesmen into the SDF, according to the Syrian military officials and two tribal leaders.

Shayesh al-Mulhem, a leader of the Jabbour tribe, said it was awaiting orders from Sharaa to turn against the SDF.

"The SDF is doomed to disappear. There can't be a state within a state, and there can't be a faction on Syrian land that is against the state," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:45:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T732ZACHLRPQLIQZTGOIIKYQS4.jpg?auth=2e07a5cca59db359b1a858db38a8e62fb263abce78bafb11a2b2c2f289aa7f6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Children in Ukraine risk hypothermia after Russian attacks, aid groups say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/children-ukraine-risk-hypothermia-after-russian-attacks-aid-groups-say-2026-01-16/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Children across Ukraine risk hypothermia in freezing temperatures as emergency stocks of power generators run low following Russian attacks on energy infrastructure, international aid agencies said on Friday.

The U.N. children's agency UNICEF said it faced a race against time to help restore water and heating services that have been pounded in missile and drone attacks as the fourth anniversary of Russia's invasion of Ukraine approaches.

"Children and families are in constant survival mode," UNICEF Country Representative for Ukraine Munir Mammadzade told reporters in Geneva.

Mammadzade said people were trying to stay safe from strikes on high-rise buildings while temperatures sank to around minus 18 degrees Celsius (minus 0.4 Fahrenheit) at night.

Some families are stuffing their windows with soft toys to block out the freezing cold, UNICEF said.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday he would declare a state of emergency in the energy sector. Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Friday Ukraine had fuel reserves for more than 20 days.

Kyiv and frontline regions face the harshest conditions, with thousands of homes in the capital as well as in Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and frontline towns left without electricity or heating for days on end.

"Without heat, people are at high risk for hypothermia, frostbite and respiratory illnesses," said Jaime Wah, Deputy Head of Delegation in Kyiv for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, adding that unpredictable power cuts disrupted the water supply and healthcare provision.

"It's unbearable to live in apartments with no heating or electricity. Families (in Kyiv) are resorting to consider leaving the city."

Pre-positioned stockpiles of sleeping kits, generators and repair materials for buildings are running low because of the increasing need and limited funding.

An IFRC funding appeal for Ukraine and impacted countries is only 13% covered for 2026 and 2027, leaving a funding gap of 262 million Swiss francs($326.93 million), it said.

UNICEF said it was providing high-capacity generators to support heating and water supplies to hospitals and schools, but called for more funding.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:45:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UMGY5MPQVZOKPNJZMDVXZJPAVI.jpg?auth=c728939b95a496659a245d7e55e674d67c00da1c3607d04e6b542cadf984950f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 422,000 people signed contracts with Russian army in 2025, a drop from the previous year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-than-422000-people-signed-contracts-with-russian-army-2025-drop-previous-2026-01-16/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Russian Security Council deputy chairman Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that 422,704 people had signed contracts with the Russian Armed Forces last year, state news agencies reported.

Medvedev, a former Russian president, was speaking at a meeting of fellow security officials about drone technology in video shared by Russian news agencies.

President Vladimir Putin said in his end-of-year news conference in December that recruitment among drone operators was particularly strong in 2025.

Some 32,000 people had also joined volunteer brigades and gone off to fight in Ukraine last year, Medvedev added on Friday, according to news agencies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:45:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/42HU7G6IHBNYLDZKWHR55WFFFY.jpg?auth=9b7b6a863067b96e756f4e02388d30e1058cae54353aa79c198f4825d27b77e4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: What is the status of Iran's main nuclear facilities?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/what-is-status-irans-main-nuclear-facilities-2026-01-16/</link><description>VIENNA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Regional fears of a U.S. attack on Iran have eased after President Donald Trump said Tehran had assured him that protesters would not be executed, but he is keeping "all of his options on the table", the White House said.

The last major strikes on Iran were carried out by Israel and the United States in June, mainly targeting key nuclear facilities .

All three of Iran's uranium-enrichment plants - two at Natanz and one buried inside a mountain at Fordow - as well as a sprawling complex at Isfahan, which includes facilities that are part of the nuclear fuel cycle and an underground area where diplomats say much of Iran's enriched uranium has been stored.

The U.N. nuclear watchdog, which carried out regular inspections at nuclear facilities including Natanz and Fordow until they were attacked, has not been granted access to those facilities since they were bombed.

It has inspected other facilities that were not damaged but the exact status of the ones that were remains unclear.

In a quarterly report on Iran in November, the International Atomic Energy Agency said seven of its declared nuclear facilities were "affected by the military attacks" and 13 were not. Those reports do not elaborate on the damage done.

Soon after the bombings the IAEA said the smallest of the three enrichment plants, the above-ground Pilot Fuel Enrichment Plant at Natanz, was destroyed . It is likely the larger underground plants at Natanz and Fordow were at least badly damaged , the IAEA has said.

How far Iran's nuclear programme has been set back is subject to debate. Trump has repeatedly said Iran's nuclear facilities were obliterated, but IAEA Director-General Rafael Grossi said in June that Iran could start enriching uranium again on a more limited scale within months .

That is not entirely clear. Some will have been destroyed in the airstrikes, but Iran has yet to submit a report to the IAEA on what happened to its bombed facilities and stock of enriched uranium despite the agency saying it is urgent and overdue. Only once that happens can the IAEA verify it.

"I believe there is a general understanding that by and large, the material is still there. But, of course, it needs to be verified. Some could have been lost," Grossi told Reuters in September. Diplomats say little appears to have changed since then.

"We don't have indications that would lead us to believe that there has been major movement of material," Grossi added.

Iran was enriching uranium to up to 60% purity, a short step from the roughly 90% of weapons grade, until the strikes.

The IAEA estimates Iran had 440.9 kg of uranium enriched to that level when the bombing started. That is enough in theory, according to an IAEA yardstick, for 10 nuclear weapons, if refined further. It also has uranium enriched to lower levels.

The IAEA does not report where Iran stores that material. One key storage installation underground at Isfahan appears not to have been damaged beyond strikes on the tunnel entrance leading to it, diplomats say.

One reason the United States and Israel gave for the bombings was that Iran was getting too close to being able to produce a nuclear weapon. If enriched to weapons grade, uranium can be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb. It can also be used to fuel nuclear power plants at various enrichment levels.

Western powers say there is no credible civil justification for Iran's enrichment to such a high fissile level, and the IAEA has said it is of serious concern. No other country has done so without eventually producing nuclear weapons.

At the same time, before the attacks the IAEA said it had no credible indication of a coordinated nuclear weapons programme in Iran, and there was much debate about how long it would take Iran to develop a nuclear bomb if it chose to.

Tehran denies ever seeking nuclear weapons. As a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has the right to enrich for nuclear power or research, as long as it does not weaponise the process.

Iran has an unknown number of centrifuges - machines that can enrich uranium - stored at unknown locations. With its enriched uranium stock now unaccounted for, there is a risk that Iran could secretly put the two together and quickly produce weapons-grade uranium, in violation of its NPT obligations.

For now, it appears likely a cat-and-mouse hunt for Iran's enriched uranium stock will continue for some time.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:46:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PDA74UOVHFIZTLCR6IDAFYPHIQ.jpg?auth=1a3ba6d8e07d95df2d8519590fc233296d80c6ebd518243ba52310a2ad3e7213&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz to raise migrant returns in talks with Syrian leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/germanys-merz-raise-migrant-returns-talks-with-syrian-leader-2026-01-16/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 16 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will raise topics including the political transition in Syria and the return of migrants to their homeland in talks with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Berlin next Tuesday, a government spokesperson said on Friday.

"We have an interest in deepening relations and, if you like, making a fresh start with the new Syrian government," the spokesperson said. "We have many important issues to address ... One example is the return of Syrians to their home country."

Merz's conservative predecessor Angela Merkel oversaw a historic open-doors policy towards refugees 10 years ago, welcoming around one million migrants to Germany, many of them Syrians fleeing civil war.

Since then, support for the far-right has surged and the conservative CDU party under Merz has pursued a far tougher line on border security and migration, pledging to speed up deportations of failed asylum seekers. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians in Germany still hold only temporary residence permits.

The visit marks Sharaa's first visit to Germany since he and his Islamist fighters ousted former President Bashar al-Assad in December 2024. Sharaa has made a series of foreign trips as his transitional government seeks to re-establish Syria's ties with countries that had shunned Damascus during Assad's rule.

However, violence in Aleppo has tarnished Syria's efforts to rebuild after its devastating civil war, with Kurdish forces resisting efforts by Sharaa's Islamist-led government to bring their fighters under centralised authority.

The German government spokesperson said the violence was being addressed by Berlin during talks with the Syrian side.

"The key question remains how the political transition will be shaped so that all social groups can live in safety and participate equally in political and social life," he said. "It is one of the key topics we are discussing with the Syrian government."</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 12:46:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XNSKCEORGRJTXO7Q4ECLSVQF3Y.jpg?auth=3a9d69a48e68c03b9b5e3a5f45359108c91f59016ad5da4a037fe3d34709fc35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump envoy says he plans to visit Greenland in March</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-envoy-says-he-plans-visit-greenland-march-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy to Greenland said he plans to visit the Danish territory in March, and that he believes a deal can be made.

Activists say at least 2,637 people have been killed in a brutal crackdown on the protest movement, which kicked off in late December with demonstrations against crippling price rises before escalating into a broader challenge to Iran’s Islamist rulers.

FRANCE 24’s Mariam Pirzadeh spoke to a Tehran resident who took part in some of the largest protests between January 8-10, when the regime dramatically stepped up its deadly riposte.

The eyewitness, who spoke on condition of anonymity and has now sought refuge in Europe, described seeing paramilitary forces fire indiscriminately into the crowds of protesters, seemingly aiming to kill.

He also said he witnessed demonstrators call for the return of the shah, Iran’s pre-revolution monarch, and spoke of their hopes that US President Donald Trump would make good on his promise to come to the “rescue” of protesting Iranians .

Read his account below.

“I went out to protest on Thursday, January 8. There were so many people, I had never seen anything like it. There were millions of us in Tehran. I set off from a northern neighbourhood of the capital; there were people in every street, every thoroughfare. It was extraordinary.

There were mothers with strollers, lots of women, some in chadors (full-body garments that cover the head) shouting “ Javid Shah! ” (“Long live the shah!”), which was unimaginable for me to see. We were all shouting: “Death to the dictator, death to (Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali) Khamenei!”

There was obviously a lot of anger, but we were all peaceful protesters. We felt safe because there were so many of us, united. We told ourselves that they couldn't shoot us. The security forces were there, watching us.”

“I later learned that the security forces had assembled outside Tehran, in Karaj (a town northwest of the capital) in particular. At the end of the march, they opened fire.

The next day, on Friday, even more of us turned out to protest. And there were a lot of them (security forces) on the other side. They began by firing tear gas and flash-balls (a handheld projectile launcher) using metal pellets.

They rode motorcycles in pairs, one driving, the other shooting indiscriminately into the crowd. They aimed for the head and torso, to hit the protesters’ eyes and lungs. Everyone ran away, trying to regroup elsewhere.

The next day, there were more gatherings, with lots of young people. They were ready to fight, with stones in their hands, but the other side had machine guns.

The security forces changed their strategy on Saturday (January 10), riding their motorcycles into smaller streets where people gathered, shooting and then moving on to the next street. I was in a shop when I saw them firing machine guns and assault rifles at a group of people. Twelve people collapsed before my eyes, in a pool of blood.

A friend of mine lost his three children, ages 17, 20 and 23. He found the bodies of his two sons first, and later that of his daughter. She had been shot three times.

The Basij (pro-regime paramilitary force) demanded 400 million tomans per bullet, the equivalent of €2,700 (to recover her body). They said they would declare that she was a Basij, to inflate casualty numbers among the regime's forces, if he couldn't afford to pay.”

“My friend refused. His relatives raised the money to recover the bodies of his three children. Everyone refuses, there is a real spirit of mutual aid.

The dead are so numerous they arrive in dozens of tipper trucks at the morgues and cemeteries. Everyone knows someone who has lost a loved one.

There is no turning back, we want to put an end to the Islamic Republic. I feel once again the atmosphere of the Islamic Revolution in 1979 (which toppled the previous regime).

At the airport, I saw families of regime officials leaving the country. It's impossible to quantify, but some are afraid. We’re living a revolution: We are all thirsty for revenge, we are filled with burning anger.

The only solution for Iranians I talk to, and myself, is Donald Trump: we are waiting for him, like the Messiah.”

During the talks, Kyiv's team also hopes to get clarity from the U.S. on the Russian stance toward U.S.-backed diplomatic efforts to end the war, Zelenskiy told a news conference in Kyiv alongside Czech president Petr Pavel.

U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters earlier this week that he may meet with Zelenskiy at the WEF, a meeting which the Ukrainian leader has publicly sought.

Zelenskiy said that Ukraine had completed its part of the work on the documents outlining a "prosperity package" to unlock money for Ukraine's costly post-war recovery, as well as on U.S. security guarantees designed to stop a future Russian attack. Ukrainian officials have said the country will need $800 billion for its post-war reconstruction.

Trump, who has often criticised Zelenskiy, said on Wednesday that Russia was ready for a peace deal and that he saw the Ukrainian leader as the obstacle to peace, an assessment which stands in stark contrast with that of European allies.

Washington has pushed Ukraine to agree to a peace framework that it will then present to Moscow, while Kyiv and its European allies have sought to ensure that Ukraine will not be attacked again by Russia in future.

On Friday, Zelenskiy said Russia was stalling peace efforts, and cited Moscow's recent strikes on Ukraine's energy system as proof of Moscow's real intentions.

"Each of these strikes against our energy sector and our cities quite clearly shows Russia's real interests and intentions: they are not interested in agreements, but in the further destruction of Ukraine," he posted on social media after the news conference.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:38:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDS4VYUXXZKG3CN6J4MEPINKEM.jpg?auth=cd80e203cd286602d643f58470ddff6852a7e22acc11e36038c91c222d941bc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU executive weighs idea of quick, but limited membership for Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-executive-weighs-idea-quick-limited-membership-ukraine-2026-01-16/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The European Commission is considering ways to allow Ukraine's quick accession to the EU as part of a peace deal with Russia but without giving Kyiv full membership rights, which would only be "earned" after transition periods, EU officials said.

The idea, which is at a very early stage, is intended as a possible gesture to Ukrainians who are seeking EU membership as part of a post-war security guarantee from Europe and who after four years of fighting off a Russian invasion want a credible promise that they are on the path toward economic stability and integration with the West.

Ukrainian EU membership in 2027 was pencilled into a 20-point peace plan discussed between the United States, Ukraine and the European Union, diplomats said, as a measure to ensure Ukraine's economic prosperity after the war ends.

But many EU governments believe that date, or any other fixed date, is completely unrealistic, because EU accession is currently a merit-based process, moving forward only when there is progress in adjusting a country's laws to EU standards.

Joining the bloc also requires signoff from the national parliaments of the EU's 27 member states.

The idea floated by EU officials would see the traditional process reversed, though even limited membership would still require the consent of EU governments and national parliaments.

"We have to recognise that we are in a very different reality than when the (accession) rules were first drawn up," one EU official said.

Ukraine - and potentially other candidates - would join the EU quickly and then get 'staged access' to voting rights, depending on their progress towards meeting the full membership criteria, the official said.

Ukraine has been battling a full-scale Russian invasion since February 2022 and became a candidate to join the EU in June that year, with negotiations opened at the end of 2023.

Normally accession talks take years: Poland, with a similar population to Ukraine, needed 10 years, without being at war, to complete negotiations and all the necessary legal changes to be able to join in 2004 along with nine other countries.

But some in the Commission argue that, politically, Ukraine does not have that much time, because a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia could entail territorial losses for Kyiv and be hard for Ukrainians to accept in a possible referendum.

EU membership, even if limited, could make that more palatable and establish the stability needed to complete the necessary reforms to gain full EU rights, officials said.

"It is Europe’s interest to have Ukraine in the EU, because of our own security," an EU diplomat said.

"It is why we need to look for creative solutions - how to get Ukraine in the EU quickly. The reversed membership concept reflects this idea - to have Ukraine joining the EU politically and then getting full rights and full-fledged membership once all conditions are met," the diplomat said.

Membership without full rights on the first day of accession is nothing new -- most countries from the 2004 enlargement and later faced long transition periods to achieve, for example, the right of their citizens to work across the bloc.

But officials are now floating a model that would include more far-reaching limitations. They acknowledged that it would raise a host of questions beyond Ukraine and would struggle to win the unanimous support required.

"It will be a hard sell," a second EU official said. "It also has an impact on countries that have gone the good old traditional way and are close to accession after doing all the homework, like Montenegro or Albania."</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:38:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G7K64KRXRBMQLIO74RECBAKY7U.jpg?auth=68b055a5bed8e27f9cbbafcef000e5799dafea57e756e7a614f5f61934c71370&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Five pro-Palestinian activists plead not guilty over UK military base break-in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/five-pro-palestinian-activists-plead-not-guilty-over-uk-military-base-break-in-2026-01-16/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Five pro-Palestinian activists pleaded not guilty on Friday to breaking into a British military air base and damaging two planes in protest against Britain's support for Israel.

Campaign group Palestine Action, which has since been banned by the government, said it was behind the incident.

Lewie Chiaramello, Jon Cink, Amy Gardiner-Gibson – also known as Amu Gib, Daniel Jeronymides-Norie and Muhammad Umer Khalid appeared at London's Old Bailey court by videolink from prison.

"Several weeks ago, invitations were extended to individual government representatives from Iran . In light of current events, the Munich Security Conference will not be maintaining these invitations," it said in an emailed statement.

This year's gathering of security experts and policymakers takes place on February 13-15. The organisers said they aimed to invite participants who could provide significant policy insights, but always considered political developments before finalising the list.

The Berlin foreign ministry said Germany was against inviting Iranian officials given the events in Iran, where thousands have been reported killed in a crackdown on demonstrations against clerical rule.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:39:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F6KDDFB74RISTLLRCRHV5M53BY.jpg?auth=937546f4a42c86bd374d38cebdbc01c5cd3975a236de4ae8d173dc689de261b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US claims Iran halts executions of protesters amid crackdown on dissent</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/us-claims-iran-halts-executions-of-protesters-amid-crackdown-on-dissent</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 13:40:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/24804b1e-f2d5-11f0-8b41-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-130135-130340-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czechs set to provide Ukraine with drone-fighting jets, president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/czechs-set-provide-ukraine-with-drone-fighting-jets-president-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Czech Republic is set to provide Ukraine with combat planes shortly that can shoot down incoming drones, President Petr Pavel told Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Kyiv on Friday.

He did not give specifics but two years ago said Czech-made subsonic L-159 fighter jets could be transferred to Ukraine, which has been fighting a full-scale Russian invasion for almost four years.

"The Czech Republic can in relatively short time provide several medium combat planes, which are highly effective in fighting drones, and I believe we will manage to quickly and successfully conclude this issue," Pavel told a news conference with Zelenskiy.

He said Prague might also supply early-warning systems such as passive radars.

Pavel, a former army general and head of NATO's Military Committee, has been a strong supporter of Ukraine and a Czech-led initiative supplying Kyiv with large-calibre ammunition paid for by Western donors.

A new Czech government led by populist Andrej Babis has agreed to continue the initiative but pledged not to provide any national funding for aid to Ukraine.

The Czech army has 24 L-159 planes in one- and two-seat configurations, used for training and support for ground forces. Its main fighter jets are 14 Swedish Saab JAS-39 Gripens, but it has ordered 24 American F-35 fighters for delivery after 2030.

Under its previous government, the Czech Republic gave Ukraine heavy equipment including tanks and helicopters from army stocks and received compensation from NATO allies as it rearms with Western weaponry.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:24:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ALQ54BSUURJ2TPYZV2SYXSILY4.jpg?auth=ba1e0f6294875bfc38eaf37a34031ab8922a6c62b01690167ad1e3e0488abdaf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK teenager who praised Southport murderer jailed for possessing al Qaeda manual</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk-teenager-who-praised-southport-murderer-jailed-possessing-al-qaeda-manual-2026-01-16/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A British teenager who praised the killer of three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event and said he planned to bomb British rock band Oasis' reunion concert was sentenced to detention on Friday for possession of an al Qaeda manual.

McKenzie Morgan, 18, was arrested at his home in Wales after sending messages on social media platform Snapchat in which he praised Axel Rudakubana, who murdered three girls and stabbed 10 others in July 2024, prosecutor Corinne Bramwell said.

Morgan told a psychiatric nurse on the morning of his arrest in June that he "planned to commit a Rudakubana-style terrorist attack" and had been researching how to stab people, Bramwell told Morgan's sentencing hearing at London's Old Bailey court.

The teenager twice tried to buy a 15-centimetre (6-inch) kitchen knife from Amazon, searched online for local playgrounds and a youth dance academy and put the academy on a document on his mobile phone entitled "places to attack", Bramwell added.

She said Morgan later told another Snapchat user that he planned to bomb the Oasis concert in Cardiff last July 4, the band's first gig of their comeback tour, and claimed to have tried to make the deadly poison ricin.

He was arrested on June 2 and a 188-page al Qaeda training manual was found on one of his electronic devices. Morgan pleaded guilty to a single count of possession of information likely to be of use to a person engaged in terrorism.

Morgan accepted having saved the al Qaeda manual and reading it, but told police he had no intention to commit an attack and simply intended to shock others with his messages.

He has been diagnosed with autism and two psychiatrists assessed Morgan as being vulnerable to being groomed or radicalised online, Bramwell told the court.

Judge Sarah Whitehouse sentenced Morgan to 14 months' detention in a young offenders' institution.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:24:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IK6GGBYC2ZNSFMY3T4ZENG3WMY.jpg?auth=0ec6b309c1ae96b13da1a0fcb05db8da2b49a2a2ed5381390257abdd52d2920c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greece plans extension of territorial waters despite Turkish warning</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/greece-plans-extension-territorial-waters-despite-turkish-warning-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - Greece plans to extend its territorial waters further, including potentially in the Aegean Sea, Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said on Friday, despite Turkey's long-standing threat of war should Athens take such a step.

The NATO allies, but historic rivals, have eased tensions in recent years but remain at odds over where their continental shelves begin and end in the Aegean - an area believed to hold significant energy potential and with implications for overflights and airspace.

Greece has already extended its territorial waters in the Ionian Sea to 12 nautical miles from six, following agreements with Italy, and it has signed a maritime delimitation deal with Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean.

But it has avoided similar moves in the Aegean, where Ankara objected sharply.

In 1995, the Turkish parliament declared a "casus belli", or cause for war, if Greece unilaterally extended its waters beyond six nautical miles in the Aegean, a position Athens says violates international maritime law.

Answering questions in parliament on Friday, Gerapetritis said further expansion was expected.

"Today, our sovereignty in the Aegean Sea extends to six nautical miles," Gerapetritis said. "As there was an agreement with Egypt, as there was an agreement with Italy, there will also be a (further) extension of the territorial waters."

He didn't specify which maritime areas could be extended.

Turkey's Foreign Ministry was not immediately available for comment.

In July, Greece took another step by unveiling the boundaries of two planned marine parks in the Ionian and Aegean seas. The Aegean park, covering 9,500 square kilometres (3,668 square miles), would initially expand around the southern Cyclades islands, further south of Turkey, according to the maps submitted by Athens. The announcement has drawn objections from Ankara.

Greece says the only issue it is prepared to discuss with Turkey is the demarcation of their maritime zones, including the continental shelf and an exclusive economic zone.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:24:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6CQ4RLROQVJIXGFNUOUCWXM3NU.jpg?auth=562dda298b03d4e1a5306c54177a864806c684e99dfe635dee23264fa17d48e8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainians brave winter cold as Russia targets energy infrastructure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ukrainians-brave-winter-cold-as-russia-targets-energy-infrastructure</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:25:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4da130b4-f2e2-11f0-b8b0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-041236-041438-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Civilians flee Kurdish-held region in northern Syria ahead of army deadline</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/civilians-flee-kurdish-held-region-in-northern-syria-ahead-of-army-deadline</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:25:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/38b74ee6-f2e1-11f0-8020-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-141607-141743-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lebanon detains Syrian who helped funnel funds to pro-Assad fighters, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/lebanon-detains-syrian-who-helped-funnel-funds-pro-assad-fighters-sources-say-2026-01-16/</link><description>BEIRUT, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Lebanon has arrested a Syrian national who was helping senior associates of ousted president Bashar al-Assad finance fighters as part of a plot to destabilise Syria's new ruling order, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.

Ahmad Dunya was detained earlier this week, according to two Lebanese security sources and two of his former associates. The Lebanese security sources did not say what charges were linked to his arrest or if he would be extradited to Syria.

Reuters could not immediately reach Dunya or his legal counsel for comment.

His arrest came nearly a month after top Syrian security officials asked Lebanon to track down and hand over more than 200 officers who fled there after Assad was overthrown by rebel forces in December 2024 following 14 years of civil war.

That request followed a Reuters investigation that detailed rival plots being pursued by former Assad cohorts to finance potential Alawite militant groups in Lebanon and along the Syrian coast through financial intermediaries.

Dunya was one of those intermediaries and funnelled money from Rami Makhlouf, Assad's billionaire cousin who now lives along with the ex-Syrian dictator in exile in Moscow, to prospective fighters in Lebanon and Syria, Reuters found.

A former associate of Dunya's and a Syrian figure close to Makhlouf both confirmed that Dunya was a key financial conduit for his funds and was detained in Lebanon. The two sources said he managed extensive financial records, including payroll tables and financial receipts.

In recent months, Dunya had been skimming off the top of Makhlouf's transfers, according to the two Syrian sources.

The Reuters investigation found that Makhlouf had spent at least $6 million on salaries and equipment for prospective fighters. Some of the financial records uncovered claimed that Makhlouf spent $976,705 in May, and that one group of 5,000 fighters received $150,000 in August.

A Lebanese security source said there were likely dozens of other financial handlers like Dunya still operating in Lebanon on behalf of Assad's former associates.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:51:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli soldiers kill Palestinian teen in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-soldiers-kill-palestinian-teen-west-bank-2026-01-16/</link><description>RAMALLAH, West Bank, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Israeli soldiers shot dead a Palestinian hurling a rock at them in the occupied West Bank, the military said on Friday, and the Palestinian health ministry said the person killed was a 14-year-old boy.

There was no further comment from Palestinian officials about the fatal incident in the village of Al-Mughayyir. Official Palestinian news agency WAFA said the teen was killed during an Israeli military raid that led to confrontations.

The Israeli military said its forces were called to the area after receiving reports that Palestinians were throwing stones at Israelis and blocking a road with burning tyres.

The soldiers fired warning shots in an attempt to repel a person who was running at them with a rock, the military said, and then shot and killed him to eliminate the danger.

Violence has surged over the past year in the West Bank. Attacks by Israeli settlers on Palestinians have risen sharply, while the military has tightened movement restrictions and carried out sweeping raids in several cities.

Palestinians have also carried out attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians, some of them deadly.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 14:51:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cubans rally against US 'imperialists' before Havana embassy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cubans-rally-against-us-imperialists-before-havana-embassy-2026-01-16/</link><description>HAVANA, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Thousands of Cubans gathered before the U.S. embassy in Havana at daybreak Friday to protest against what they denounced as U.S. aggression in the region following the capture of Venezuelan leader Nicola Maduro, a Cuban ally.

Tension between the two longtime rivals has spiked since the U.S. attack on Venezuela , which resulted in the deaths of 32 Cuban military and intelligence officers believed to be defending Maduro were killed, marking the first clashes between U.S. and Cuban forces in decades.

Cubans bundled in hats and jackets gathered on the capital`s Malecon waterfront boulevard waving Cuban and Venezuelan flags under gray skies as blustery winds and waves buffeted the coast.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, dressed in olive-green military garb and with his back to the U.S. embassy, called on Cubans to remain united in the face of U.S. pressure.

"No, imperialists, we have absolutely no fear of you...and we don`t like to be threatened," he said, turning to wave his finger at the embassy building. "You will not intimidate us."

Both sides have ratcheted up political rhetoric in recent days, marking a new low in long frosty relations between the U.S. and communist-run Cuba, which lies 90 miles (145 km)from the shores of Florida.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that no more Venezuelan oil or money would go to Cuba, warning Havana to make a deal before it's "too late."

Diaz-Canel said after Trump's comments that Cuba would defend its homeland "to the last drop of blood."</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:24:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RIY2BKWB5RJJXPC2IV6LTWJLII.jpg?auth=b965704b89ddbced2ed529e524f82fd15694294802065f181a58de214ef2c132&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Over half of Ukrainians oppose pulling back in return for security, poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/over-half-ukrainians-oppose-pulling-back-return-security-poll-shows-2026-01-16/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - A majority of Ukrainians would strongly oppose withdrawing troops from the part of the eastern Donetsk region still controlled by Kyiv in exchange for European and U.S. security guarantees, a poll released on Friday indicated.

Ukraine, wary of unmet commitments in the past, is pushing for legally binding security guarantees to prevent any future Russian aggression.

Ukraine is under U.S. pressure to agree quickly to a peace deal , but has refused to accept Russian demands that it cede land it still controls in eastern Donbas , a large mineral-rich industrial area comprising the Donetsk and Luhansk regions.

Russia controls almost all of Luhansk, but Kyiv still holds about 20% of Donetsk, including a string of strategically vital garrison towns and defensive lines.

According to the poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS), 54% of Ukrainians categorically reject the idea of withdrawing from parts of Donbas in return for security reassurances from allies.

Some 39% said they would reluctantly accept.

"Moreover, those who are ready to agree expect quite significant security guarantees. Therefore, if the level of security guarantees is lower than expected, approval of such a proposal will be even lower," said KIIS executive director Anton Hrushetskyi.

The survey was conducted in early January among 601 respondents on Ukrainian-controlled territory.

Almost 70% did not believe current negotiations would lead to a lasting peace.

Some 57% believed Russia would attack again in the event of a ceasefire at the current frontlines and security guarantees from allies.

However, even if security guarantees were given, 40% believed the U.S. would not provide support in the event of renewed Russian invasion, while 39% thought it would.

Russia has publicly shown little interest in scaling down its demands and made few comments regarding the 20-point peace framework that Ukraine and the U.S. have been trying to finalise.

Instead, Russia has stepped up air strikes, significantly damaging already shattered energy infrastructure and leaving millions without power and heating in freezing temperatures.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:48:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TE3FKKUMBNJIFIFMSKZLE356SA.jpg?auth=8ff225d7eaa4c9b4cd48f9184aabf2821431478355a47f1c7af0abb78807ec9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Son of Iran's last Shah appeals for more pressure to help protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/son-irans-last-shah-appeals-more-pressure-help-protesters-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 - Iranian opposition figure Reza Pahlavi on Friday urged the international community to ramp up pressure on the Iranian government to help protesters overthrow clerical rule, even as a deadly crackdown appears to have broadly quelled demonstrations.

Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's toppled shah, held a news conference in Washington D.C. on Friday morning to call for political, economic and military pressure on Tehran.

He said that "large sections" of the Iranian army and security forces have "whispered" their loyalty to him and that he is uniquely positioned to ensure a stable transition for the country.

Having emerged as a prominent voice in the country's opposition, Pahlavi, 65, seeks to play a role in Iran's future even as President Donald Trump earlier this week expressed uncertainty over his ability to muster support within the country.

"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully," Pahlavi said.

U.S.-based Pahlavi has lived outside Iran since before his father was toppled in the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Iran's opposition is fragmented among rival groups and ideological factions - including the monarchists who back Pahlavi - and appears to have little organised presence inside the Islamic Republic.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene in support of protesters in Iran, where thousands of people have been reported killed in a crackdown on the unrest against clerical rule.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:48:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BZ6QHM6PHJIL3K2UGJJZMNRE44.jpg?auth=487af823c55ab1da5b18d5d75140f8d2e2c5a40bca9fc430a12e4d6cd783c7b3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Suspects in Russian-led explosive parcels plot face life sentences, Poland says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/suspects-russian-led-explosive-parcels-plot-face-life-sentences-poland-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Five men have been charged in Poland with taking part in a Russian-run sabotage plot to send explosive parcels to Britain, the U.S., Canada and other destinations, and will face life sentences if convicted, prosecutors said on Friday.

The four Ukrainian citizens and one Russian were charged "with acting ... on behalf of the intelligence services of the Russian Federation," the National Prosecutor's Office said in a statement.

There was no immediate reaction from Russia which has regularly denied accusations of stepping up sabotage attacks in the region following its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Moscow says the West is trying to stoke anti-Russian feeling.

The five were accused of committing or preparing acts of sabotage against logistics and aviation infrastructure, the prosecutors' statement read.

One, named as Vladyslav D., was planning to prepare parcels with hidden incendiary devices and explosives and forward them for shipment to Britain and Poland, the statement said.

Another, Viacheslav C., was planning "future sabotage activities" including the sending of two test packages to the U.S. and Canada, it added.

A third, Vladyslav B., was accused of receiving, securing and transporting packages between Lithuania's capital Vilnius and its central city of Kaunas, the statement said.

The prosecutors said they had presented five bills of indictment to a court which will now take over the case.

"The accused face a sentence of life imprisonment," National Prosecutor's Office spokesperson Przemyslaw Nowak said.

The sabotage plot led to three parcels being detonated at courier depots in Britain, Germany and Poland in 2024, a person familiar with the Polish investigation told Reuters last year.

Massage pillows were packed with homemade incendiary devices made of a cocktail of chemicals including highly reactive magnesium into the parcels with the cosmetics and sex toys, the source said.

Last year, Lithuania separately said that detonations of parcels carried by DHL were organised and supervised by Russian citizens with ties to Russian military intelligence.

Charges were not formally presented to a sixth suspect Jaroslaw. M., a Russian citizen. Poland has been trying to extradite him from Azerbaijan, prosecutors said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:48:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2KKBIH2QRRLBPBQ47XYXEJITQ4.jpg?auth=22bc47887f817466c8edf1bc1d608e1221b62bf624e76a82a157e4b778a5dc31&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv has only half of the electricity it needs, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kyiv-has-only-half-electricity-it-needs-mayor-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Ukraine's capital Kyiv has only about half the electricity that it needs as it faces its most severe wartime energy crisis following waves of Russian attacks on its infrastructure, mayor Vitali Klitschko told Reuters on Friday.

Kyiv, one of Eastern Europe's largest cities, requires 1,700 megawatts of electricity a day to power the services for its 3.6 million people, Klitschko said.

Klitschko said the current energy crisis was the most difficult challenge facing the capital in the nearly four years since Russia's invasion in February 2022.

"It's the first time in the history of our city that, in such severe frosts, most of the city was left without heating and with a huge shortage of electricity," Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, said in an interview in his office at the heart of Kyiv.

Klitschko said Ukraine's international partners had rushed in additional generators and repair teams had worked round the clock to restore heating following a Russian strike last week knocked out supplies to 6,000 apartment buildings. About 100 buildings still have no heating, he said.

Ukraine has declared an energy emergency this week as its grid crumbles under Russian bombardments, bitter cold temperatures and accumulated wartime damage.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 15:48:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QXFUYQRNKNKJ7E7QAAXTCLJ5AQ.jpg?auth=7320338d2bf3040a77baecb2240d22ad4ffbe07b48780086b69e7b8d86221919&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Latest US sanctions target Houthi funding networks, Treasury says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/latest-us-sanctions-target-houthi-funding-networks-treasury-says-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Trump administration issued fresh sanctions on Friday further targeting the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen and the transfer of oil products, weapons and other so-called dual-use equipment that it said helped fund the group.

The action targets 21 individuals and entities as well as one vessel, including some alleged front companies in Yemen, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, the U.S. Department of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control said in a statement.

"The Houthis threaten the United States by committing acts of terror and attacking commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the statement.

The move builds on previous Treasury action to pressure the Houthis "vast revenue generation and smuggling networks, which enable the group to sustain its capability to conduct destabilizing regional activities," including the Red Sea attacks, the department added.

Since 2023, the Houthis have launched numerous assaults on vessels in the Red Sea that they deem to be linked with Israel in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war on Gaza.

The two officers in their 20s, who were arrested last July and remain in custody, are accused of torture, acts of cruelty and abuse of power, according to the indictment signed by Lisbon Prosecutor Felismina Franco last week and seen by Reuters.

One of them also faces charges of rape, robbery and forgery.

The document described one incident in which the policemen beat up a Moroccan immigrant inside a police station for several hours, making him kiss their boots as one shouted in English: "Welcome to Portugal!"

"The victims were systematically picked from among particularly vulnerable people, namely homeless, physically weak, economically challenged," the prosecutor wrote.

"This circumstance reveals acts of pure and gratuitous violence aimed at those who were unable to offer resistance."

The Interior Ministry told Reuters it "profoundly laments such behaviour and all actions that infringe upon citizen rights... which do not represent the general behaviour of police professionals".

The General Inspectorate has opened a separate inquiry to investigate other police officers, the ministry said.

The Portuguese branch of rights group Amnesty International, which said it had received information about more cases of torture, said the sharing of images and messages about their acts in chats and social media "shows an enormous sense of impunity" by the officers, although it welcomed the fact that the crimes had been denounced from within the law enforcement community.

It called for an external and independent police supervision agency to be set up and for more cameras to be installed at police stations, in cars and for officers to use body cams when interacting with people.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:29:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela acting president, opposition leader navigate new relations with Trump administration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-acting-president-opposition-leader-navigate-new-relations-with-trump-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - The CIA director met with Venezuela's interim leader in Caracas and the country's opposition leader was due to speak to reporters in Washington on Friday as the two sides navigate their new relationships with U.S. President Donald Trump following his administration's attack early this year.

Central Intelligence Agency Director John Ratcliffe is the most senior known U.S. official to meet with Delcy Rodriguez, Venezuela's acting president, since Trump attacked Caracas on January 3, capturing Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a socialist, and his wife.

The two met on Thursday, the same day that Maria Corina Machado , the leader of Venezuela's liberal opposition party, met Trump at the White House, where she gave him the medal she had received after being awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year, an honor Trump has publicly coveted.

Machado is due to discuss her meeting with reporters on Friday at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank in Washington with close ties to the Trump administration. After leaving the White House on Thursday, she described the meeting as excellent. Trump, in turn, warmly thanked Machado for the medal, describing it on social media as "a wonderful gesture of mutual respect."

In Caracas, Rodriguez appeared to deride Machado as she gave her first State of the Union address on Thursday, telling Venezuelans that if she should visit Washington, "I will do so with my head held high, walking, not on my knees."

Ratcliffe, the CIA chief, met with Rodriguez at Trump's direction "to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship," according to a U.S. official.

The two of them discussed intelligence cooperation, economic stability and the need to ensure Venezuela was no longer a "safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narco-traffickers," according to the U.S. official.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 16:30:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XXIFT3YG2NJYXBGAHN2TJKLQKU.jpg?auth=09c9b4ef5d9de100570e7dec3d02b76afdd3ff9e5b39a2e3c9dbffbb9ebb77e8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens tariffs on countries not backing US takeover of Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260116-trump-threatens-tariffs-countries-not-backing-us-takeover-of-greenland</link><description>President Donald Trump suggested Friday that he may punish countries with tariffs if they don’t back the US controlling Greenland , a message that came as a Congressional delegation met Danish and Greenlandic lawmakers in Copenhagen and sought to lower tensions .

Trump for months has insisted that the US should control Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark , and said earlier this week that anything less than the Arctic island being in US hands would be “unacceptable”.

“I may put a tariff on countries if they don’t go along with Greenland,” he said Friday, without providing details. “We need Greenland for national security.”

He had not previously mentioned using tariffs to try to force the issue.

Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Denmark and Greenland met in Washington this week with US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio .

That encounter didn’t resolve the deep differences, but did produce an agreement to set up a working group – on whose purpose Denmark and the White House then offered sharply diverging public views.

Concentration camp memorial sites and documentation centres expressed deep concern in a letter this week at a tide of so-called AI Slop, or falsified images, around the Nazis' killing of more than six million Jews during World War Two.

Images included highly emotionalized illustrations of invented incidents such as meetings of concentration camp inmates and their liberators or children behind barbed wire.

"AI-generated content distorts history by trivialising and kitschification," said the organizations' January 13 letter, adding that such images helped fuel mistrust among users of authentic historical documents.

Germany's state minister for culture and media Wolfram Weimer said he supported efforts by the memorial institutions for AI-generated imagery to be clearly marked and, where necessary, removed.

"This is a matter of respect for the millions of people who were killed and persecuted under the Nazi regime of terror," he said in an email to Reuters.

AI companies, notably Elon Musk's xAI , which runs the chatbot Grok, are also under pressure over thousands of sexualised deepfake images of women and minors spread online.

The memorial institutions said the imagery appeared in part aimed at generating attention and earning money and in part intended to "dilute historical facts, shift victim and perpetrator roles, or spread revisionist narratives".

The institutions include memorial centres for Bergen-Belsen, Buchenwald, Dachau and other concentration camps where Jews, as well as others including Roma and Sinti people, sexual minorities and disabled people, were killed.

They said social media platforms should move proactively against fake AI imagery around the Holocaust rather than waiting for users to report it, ensuring it was clearly marked and preventing it from being monetized.

The spread of low-quality AI Slop, which can consist of fake text, images or video has raised alarm among many experts that it will pollute the information landscape and make it increasingly hard for users to distinguish between truth and falsehood.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:28:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MYNENBR6BNNNBKPP74FMF345A4.jpg?auth=e1027fa0f0cc247c3b3c0daeab0df860f149a0c4df7b3a9cda982b3f17ddad9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to pardon former Puerto Rico governor Vazquez, CBS News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pardon-former-puerto-rico-governor-vazquez-cbs-news-reports-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is issuing a pardon to Puerto Rico's former Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced, who was previously indicted in a federal corruption case, CBS News reported on Friday, citing multiple sources.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:28:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DPGIKJND4VPF5PPGZXWLZGMBXI.jpg?auth=8f4078d0c1a3d8df988f97f0509840ebe1973ea194b74980ce1939e009f7d0b4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to pardon former Puerto Rico governor Vazquez, CBS News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-pardon-former-puerto-rico-governor-vazquez-cbs-news-reports-2026-01-16/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:29:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Arrests reported by official media for first time since Tehran protests began</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/arrests-reported-by-official-media-for-first-time-since-tehran-protests-began</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 17:29:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a5d6522c-f2f7-11f0-b8d6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-170202-170256-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to pardon former Puerto Rico governor Vazquez</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trump-pardon-former-puerto-rico-governor-vazquez-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is issuing a pardon to Puerto Rico's former Governor Wanda Vazquez Garced, who was previously indicted in a federal corruption case, a White House official confirmed on Friday.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado gave her medal on Thursday to Trump, who thanked her for it. The White House released a photo of Trump and Machado, with Trump holding up a gold-coloured frame displaying it, and a White House official said Trump intends to keep it.

Machado's award also consists of a diploma and 11 million Swedish crowns ($1.19 million).

"Regardless of what may happen to the medal, the diploma, or the prize money, it is and remains the original laureate who is recorded in history as the recipient of the prize," the award body said in a statement.

"There are no restrictions in the statutes of the Nobel Foundation on what a laureate may do with the medal, the diploma, or the prize money. This means that a laureate is free to keep, give away, sell, or donate these items," it added.

The medal and the diploma are physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the prize, said the five-strong award committee.

"The prize itself – the honour and recognition – remains inseparably linked to the person or organisation designated as the laureate by the Norwegian Nobel Committee," it said.

The committee, which did not refer to Trump and Machado by name in its statement, said it does not comment on a laureate's statements, decisions or actions after the prize is announced.

It was not the first time a Nobel laureate has given away the medal. In 1943 Nobel literature laureate Knut Hamsun gave his to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.

In 2022, Nobel Peace laureate Dmitry Muratov sold his medal for $100 million to raise money for the U.N. children's fund UNICEF to help Ukrainian refugee children.

In 2024, the widow of former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan donated his 2001 Nobel Peace Prize medal and diploma to the U.N. office in Geneva.

Trump says Greenland is vital to U.S. security and has not ruled out the use of force to take it. European nations this week sent small numbers of military personnel to the island at Denmark's request.

"We don't see any Russian or Chinese vessels around Greenland... there are Chinese and Russian vessels in the Arctic Ocean, but not near Greenland," Major General Soren Andersen told Reuters.

Speaking on board a Danish warship in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, Andersen said that he had extended an invitation for the United States to join exercises planned on the island this year.

"We had a meeting today with a lot of NATO partners including the U.S. and invited them to participate in this exercise," said Andersen. When asked if the Americans will join, the general replied "I don't know that yet."

Denmark's Joint Arctic Command enforces sovereignty and conducts surveillance, fisheries inspection and search-and-rescue across Greenland and the Faroe Islands, drawing on patrol vessels, aircraft, helicopters and satellite-based monitoring.

Headquartered in Nuuk, it also fields Greenland's Sirius dog-sled patrol for long-range land operations and maintains about 150 staff across command, logistics and fixed Arctic stations.

Responding to Trump's criticism that Denmark does too little to defend Greenland, Copenhagen last year announced a 42 billion Danish crowns ($6.54 billion) Arctic defence package .</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:34:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FEV5ZOF56BP2NCLOFPBWVZ7KNM.jpg?auth=6ca21fd35b11db918e6dbc00354127288854d4b986a56ec176a7c3f9933c81e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula says EU and Mercosur will make history with signing of trade agreement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-says-eu-mercosur-will-make-history-with-signing-trade-agreement-2026-01-16/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Friday said the European Union and the South American bloc Mercosur are about to make history with the signing of a free trade agreement over the weekend, ending 25 years of negotiations between them.

The event was not an isolated episode. The Washington Post on Friday reported the January 3 death of Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, while in ICE custody, citing a medical examiner who believes his death to be a homicide. A fellow detainee said he witnessed Luna Campos being choked by guards.

Such incidents have come to characterise what is now the most aggressive immigration enforcement surge the city – and perhaps the country – has seen in decades.

The day before Good was killed, Washington announced the deployment of roughly 2,000 federal agents to the Minneapolis–St. Paul area. In the days following her death, an additional 1,000 officers from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) were deployed to the city, with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hailing its “largest immigration operation ever.”

Caught in the chaos of a raid, Minneapolis City Council president Elliott Payne said the presence of heavily armed agents in combat gear felt “ like an occupying force ”.

Rather than de-escalate, Trump has threatened to go further. On Thursday, he raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy troops in response to civil unrest.

“If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT,” Trump wrote on social media, promising to “quickly put an end to the travesty”.

The starting point of the escalation was relatively innocuous. The Trump administration initially alleged financial irregularities involving Somali-run daycare centres in Minnesota as justification for the first raids. Minnesota is home to the largest Somali community in the United States, estimated at around 84,000, most of whom are US citizens .

A far-right influencer posted a video in late December alleging fraud at daycare centres run by Somali-Americans. Citing the video , the Trump administration suspended $185 million in funding to Minnesota pending a review of the childcare centres in question. The administration followed up in January by suspending another $10 billion in federal funding for childcare subsidies to hundreds of thousands of households in five Democratic states, including Minnesota.

The decision to target the Somali community echoed Trump’s own rhetoric. In December, he said Somalis should not be welcome in the United States, comparing them to “garbage” . DHS reinforced the message in a post on X announcing the end of a temporary protected status: “Our message is clear. Go back to your own country, or we’ll send you back ourselves.”

What followed bore little resemblance to a targeted investigation. Residents reported agents sweeping through residential neighbourhoods and the parking lots of big-box stores, stopping people seemingly at random to demand their immigration status . "Masked men" broke into a north Minneapolis home without a judicial warrant, arresting a 38-year-old Liberian man as his wife and 9-year-old stepdaughter were inside, local public radio outlet MPR News reported .

Operation “Metro Surge” has brought together a rarely seen patchwork of agencies far from the border: three-quarters are from ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, AP reported , working alongside agents from Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP).

This blending of uniforms, mandates and chains of command made it nearly impossible for civilians to know who was stopping them, under what authority, and what rights they retained.

The scale of coordination reflects a strategy first developed at the southern border. Shortly after returning to office in January 2025, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, triggering a significant mobilisation involving DHS, ICE, CBP, the National Guard and US Northern Command.

With the events in Minnesota, the same emergency logic and the same mix of civilian and quasi-military forces are now being applied hundreds of miles from the border.

Minneapolis is the most dramatic example so far, but not the only one. Federal immigration surges have already taken place or are planned in cities including Chicago, Phoenix, Denver, New York and Los Angeles.

Trump has shown little interest in calming tensions, using florid and almost biblical language to describe the continuing operation.

“FEAR NOT, GREAT PEOPLE OF MINNESOTA,” he wrote on Truth Social. “THE DAY OF RECKONING &amp; RETRIBUTION IS COMING!”

Immigration attorney Scott Shuchart says Minnesota offered a perfect opportunity for the Trump administration, which was looking for an excuse to invoke the Insurrection Act as Trump has threatened to do.

“The administration has been trying to pick this fight, trying to find a place [resisting] enough to have an excuse to declare an insurrection and use more force,” Shuchart said. “Minneapolis was the next target. It’s ideal for them – it has a large Somali immigrant population, and there is [Minnesota Representative] Ilhan Omar, whom Trump hates. His people are very angry and, frankly, racist.”

Unlike law enforcement agents like police, who are trained in de-escalation tactics, ICE officers appear to relish doing the opposite.

“They are escalating rather than de-escalating,” Shuchart added. “They need this. They don’t want unity: disunity is good for them. Trump has never tried to be more popular or to appeal to the other side. By continuing to feel victimised, he empowers himself politically.”

Minneapolis represents both a symbolic and strategic target: it's a Democratic stronghold, a “ sanctuary city ” where local authorities limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement, and a place still nationally associated with protests against police violence over the killing of George Floyd in 2020. Minnesota is also governed by Tim Walz , the Democrats’ 2024 vice-presidential nominee.

According to DHS, the surge is part of a nationwide push to fulfil Trump’s promise to carry out the “largest deportation operation” in American history. ICE has more than doubled its manpower in less than a year, from roughly 10,000 officers to more than 22,000, driven by an aggressive recruitment campaign.

To staff that expansion, barriers to entry have been lowered. Deportation officers must be US citizens, pass a background check and drug screening, and meet basic physical requirements. The job requires carrying a firearm and explicitly authorises the use of deadly force “when necessary”.

Training has been significantly shortened, with NBC reporting that it was cut from 13 weeks to six – a move one former ICE agent described to Time magazine as “a recipe for disaster” .

“New recruits often have minimal education and abbreviated preparation. The danger is that it attracts people who are more loyal to Trump than to professional law enforcement,” said Shuchart, citing far-right, pro-Trump militias such as the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys.

That broader lack of professionalism has fed into another flashpoint in the operation: the use of masks by immigration agents. Acting ICE director Todd Lyons said the practice is intended to prevent officers from being doxxed . But it actually “spurs dangerous impersonations, impedes accountability for officers who are engaged in misconduct, and undermines trust in law enforcement”, the Center for American Progress argued in a report released on August 2025 , when hundreds of officers from nearly 20 federal agencies were deployed to the streets of Washington.

In a confidential bulletin circulated to law enforcement agencies last month, the FBI even warned that criminals across several states have been posing as ICE officers to commit robberies, kidnappings and sexual assaults.

The confusion has been amplified online. High-profile right-wing influencers were granted privileged access to operations, blurring the line between the administration, law enforcement agents and partisan media.

Figures with large followings, including “Dr Phil” McGraw and Libs of TikTok creator Chaya Raichik, were repeatedly invited on ride-alongs and allowed to interview senior officials, producing content that framed enforcement actions as necessary and heroic. ICE’s own social media accounts actively promoted the operation, which the Washington Post has described as a broader “media machine” designed to project strength and deter resistance.

Pro-Trump influencer Benny Johnson went even further, wearing a Border Patrol tactical vest to observe a raid at a Walmart in the Chicago area alongside Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem. In a video posted on X, he praised the operation as “amazing”, highlighting what he called “wild scenes”.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:35:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09bba20c-f301-11f0-8378-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016127809169.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Victims of a slaughter: Iranian people have been rising up for decades against the Islamic regime'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/victims-of-a-slaughter-iranian-people-rising-up-for-decades-now-against-the-islamic-regime</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 18:35:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c00decec-f2ff-11f0-82c0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260115-211159-211908-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CIA chief meets Venezuela's interim leader to discuss 'potential opportunities'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260116-cia-chief-meets-venezuela-interim-leader-discuss-potential-opportunities</link><description>US Central Intelligence Agency head John Ratcliffe traveled to Venezuela and met leader Delcy Rodriguez , a US administration official said Friday, in the highest-level American visit since the fall of Nicolas Maduro .

President Donald Trump sent the spy chief to Caracas on Thursday for a meeting that lasted approximately two hours, US sources said, less than two weeks after Maduro and his wife were seized in a US military operation.

"At President Trump's direction, Director Ratcliffe traveled to Venezuela to meet with interim president Delcy Rodriguez to deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship," the Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity.

The official added that Ratcliffe and Rodriguez "discussed potential opportunities for economic collaboration, and that Venezuela can no longer be a safe haven for America's adversaries, especially narcotraffickers".

The visit came a day after Trump spoke to Rodriguez for the first time – and on the same day that Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado presented Trump with her Nobel Peace prize at the White House .

Trump has so far backed Rodriguez , Maduro's former vice president and a former vocal ally of the ousted leader, to stay in charge so long as Venezuelan oil keeps flowing.

Ratcliffe sits at Trump's cabinet meetings and is the most senior official to travel to Venezuela since the United States toppled leftist Maduro.

US sources billed the CIA chief's visit as a "trust-building measure" that paved the way for continued communication between Washington and Caracas.

The visit was coordinated between the White House, US State Department and the Pentagon , they added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 19:24:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3415b7ac-f308-11f0-b24c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-07T150850Z-1604783218-RC22WIAV2FB3-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-CONGRESS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US officials provide shifting accounts of ICE detainee death in Texas military camp</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-officials-provide-shifting-accounts-ice-detainee-death-texas-military-camp-2026-01-16/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials on Friday provided a new but incomplete account of an immigrant detainee's death in Texas after a report emerged suggesting it may have been homicide.

The Washington Post on Thursday reported , opens new tab the El Paso County medical examiner is likely to classify the death as a homicide, raising more questions about how it unfolded.

The January 3 death was one of four deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody over a 10-day period at the start of the year. Detention deaths reached a 20-year high in 2025 as President Donald Trump's administration ramped up the number of people held for alleged immigration violations.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security initially said in a January 9 press release it was investigating the death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos, 55, which occurred after he experienced "medical distress."

Lunas was being held in Camp East Montana, a detention site opened by the Trump administration inside Fort Bliss that has been criticized by immigrant rights advocates.

DHS did not provide a cause of death, but the Washington Post reported that the medical examiner's office planned to list the cause of death as a lack of oxygen due to pressure on the neck and chest, citing a recording of a conversation between the medical examiner's office and the detainee's daughter.

The Post also interviewed a detainee held at the Camp East Montana site who said he saw guards choking Lunas when he refused to enter solitary confinement.

In a new statement on Friday, a DHS spokesperson said Lunas, who had lived in the U.S. since 1996 and had multiple criminal convictions, attempted to take his own life while detained at the detention site.

DHS said the security staff "immediately intervened to save his life" but that Lunas "violently resisted" the security staff.

"During the ensuing struggle, [Lunas] stopped breathing and lost consciousness," DHS said. "Medical staff was immediately called and responded. After repeated attempts to resuscitate him, EMTs declared him deceased on the scene."

The DHS statement did not mention the Washington Post story. The department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment regarding the report and DHS' decision to issue a new statement on Friday.

The El Paso medical examiner's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the months that follow detainee deaths, ICE typically publishes detailed individual reports, with the last such report published in September 2025.

In a December letter, the American Civil Liberties Union urged ICE and the Defense Department to close Camp East Montana, citing reports and allegations around use of force and poor living conditions.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 19:40:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PZQQAUHEURLPRD2HFMRVWPKMVI.jpg?auth=1cd49fa491ce2dd9030d5c2fe0856cae3727addb84243b057e406416516247df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>FAA issues warnings to airlines on Central, South American flights over potential military actions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/faa-issues-warnings-airlines-central-south-american-flights-over-potential-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday it is issuing a series of warnings to airlines to exercise caution when flying over Central America and parts of South America, citing the risks of potential military activities and GPS interference.

"There's 15 ICE agents and they shot her, like, 'cause she wouldn't open her car door," one caller said, adding a stream of profanities.

"ICE fired shots into her windshield," another caller said, as the operator urged the person to slow their breathing. "She's bleeding."

Later, as Good was being pronounced dead at a local hospital, police were trying to evacuate ICE officers from the scene while angry protesters cut down tape that had been used to secure the area, according to an incident report that recorded communications between emergency responders.

"ICE BEING SURROUNDED," one person transmitted at 11:01 a.m., about 80 minutes after the shooting, according to the report.

The city has seen increasingly tense confrontations between residents and federal officers since Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, was shot on January 7. Protests have spread to other cities, and more demonstrations are expected on Friday evening and this weekend.

Trump and other administration officials have defended the officer, Jonathan Ross, and accused Good of deliberately trying to kill him and other agents at the scene with her car. Videos of the incident show her turning her wheels away from the officers and Democratic city and state officials have rejected the government's account as false.

The Trump administration has said Ross suffered injuries during the incident - although video shows him walking around after shooting Good - while noting he was involved months earlier in another enforcement stop that resulted in him being dragged behind a vehicle.

During that stop, in Bloomington, Minnesota in June 2025, Ross broke Roberto Carlos Munoz-Guatemala's car window during a stop and reached inside his vehicle. Munoz-Guatemala attempted to drive away, dragging Ross with him, according to court records. Munoz-Guatemala was later convicted of assaulting a federal officer.

In trial transcripts obtained by Reuters, an attorney for the defense focused on whether Munoz-Guatemala understood that Ross was a law enforcement officer during the stop, given that Munoz-Guatemala had repeatedly asked Ross who he was.

Ross countered that Munoz-Guatemala "seemed to know who I was just by his demeanor," and asserted that suspects often act confused about the identity of agents.

"I believe a lot of time people are on the phone and they're waiting for people to get - to show up, especially with our line of work. They've got phone trees where they call and then protesters show up," Ross told the court.

The Trump administration has sent nearly 3,000 federal agents to Minnesota, adding hundreds of additional officers in the aftermath of the Good shooting.

Trump has said the deployment was prompted in part by allegations of fraud among the state's large Somali-American community. Trump has called Somali immigrants "garbage" and said they should be thrown out of the country.

Minnesota Democrats, including Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, have decried the shooting and accused Trump of intentionally fomenting chaos.

Since the surge began, agents have arrested both immigrants and protesters, at times smashing windows and pulling people from their cars. Some have been shouted at for stopping Black and Latino U.S. citizens and demanding identification.

The Department of Homeland Security said on X that 12 "agitators" were arrested on Thursday night for assaulting law enforcement, without providing more details.

The first 911 call after the Good shooting arrived at 9:38 a.m., and paramedics were on the scene four minutes later, where they found her in her car, not breathing. She had four apparent gunshot wounds, including one to her head and two to her chest.

Emergency personnel attempted to revive her, both at the scene and in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. Hospital staff ended those efforts at approximately 10:30 a.m., according to the records.

Meanwhile, back on Portland Street, police were trying to prevent more violence, according to an incident report that recorded communications among first responders at the scene.

"CROWD GETTING HOSTILE," the incident record reads at 9:50 a.m. "CONTACT WHO IS IN CHARGE OF FEDS AND HAVE THEM LEAVE SCENE."

At 11:01 a.m., ICE agents were "being surrounded," and protesters were throwing snowballs at them – but not at police, the report says. The agents finally managed to leave the scene by 11:20 a.m.

"CROWD CALMED DOWN NOW THAT ICE IS GONE," it says at 11:38 a.m.

On Friday, at the spot where Good was shot and killed more than a week ago, a makeshift memorial continued to grow and attract clusters of visitors, despite frigid temperatures and falling snow.

Residents have cordoned off the spot where Good's car slammed into a light pole, while hand-painted signs call for justice and include many anti-ICE slogans. Tarps were laid atop mounds of flowers to protect them from the wind and snow.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:23:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K7BSWYP3FFJWLL6OOD7AKZBKZY.jpg?auth=fbedbcdb4e2ad1c06bf9712bced4da90854d884bdebd3f1a5e2bea9ba3075ad4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria's Sharaa grants Kurdish Syrians citizenship, language rights for first time, SANA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrias-sharaa-grants-kurdish-syrians-citizenship-language-rights-first-time-sana-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree affirming the rights of the Kurdish Syrians, formally recognising their language and restoring citizenship to all Kurdish Syrians, state news agency SANA reported on Friday.

Sharaa's decree came after fierce clashes that broke out last week in the northern city of Aleppo, leaving at least 23 people dead, according to Syria's health ministry, and forced more than 150,000 to flee the two Kurdish-run pockets of the city.

The clashes ended after Kurdish fighters withdrew .

The violence in Aleppo has deepened one of the main faultlines in Syria , where al-Sharaa's promise to unify the country under one leadership after 14 years of war has faced resistance from Kurdish forces wary of his Islamist-led government.

The decree for the first time grants Kurdish Syrians rights, including recognition of Kurdish identity as part of Syria's national fabric. It designates Kurdish as a national language alongside Arabic and allows schools to teach it.

It also abolishes measures dating to a 1962 census in Hasaka province that stripped many Kurds of Syrian nationality, granting citizenship to all affected residents, including those previously registered as stateless.

The decree declares Nowruz, the spring and new year festival, a paid national holiday. It bans ethnic or linguistic discrimination, requires state institutions to adopt inclusive national messaging and sets penalties for incitement to ethnic strife.

The Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), that controls the country's northeast, have engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, but there has been little progress .</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 21:24:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6IWFVYAQPZMR5BRMEVJ7EGM4AM.jpg?auth=d5f92e85d8ce78153bb90982b832c55b43f9dddee8904c7bca3ba17c4d262750&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump offers to restart mediation between Egypt and Ethiopia on Nile River water sharing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/trump-offers-restart-mediation-between-egypt-ethiopia-nile-river-water-sharing-2026-01-16/</link><description>Jan 16 (Reuters) - The United States is ready to restart mediation between Egypt and Ethiopia to help resolve the issue of Nile River water sharing, President Donald Trump said in a letter to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi on Friday.

Colombia has been involved in an ongoing internal armed conflict for six decades that has left more than 450,000 dead. Conflict in the Andean nation has involved the military and police forces, leftist guerrillas, criminal gangs formed by former right-wing paramilitaries and drug cartels.

"Colombia is embarking on one of the boldest and most innovative strategies for our national security and defense," Defense Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a video statement.

Colombia's government has approved a budget of $271.1 million for the first phase of the project, Sanchez added.

A meeting with countries and companies interested in the project was held on Friday in Bogotá, though no details were disclosed.

Between 2024 and 2025, Colombia recorded 264 attacks from unmanned drones loaded with explosives. They were registered predominantly across the country's dense jungles and mountainous regions dedicated to the cultivation of coca leaves, the base ingredient in the production of cocaine.

The attacks were attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrillas and dissidents from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla group.

The drone attacks between 2024 and 2025 left 15 soldiers dead and an additional 153 others wounded, according to official statistics.

In November, Colombia signed a 3.1 billion-euro ($3.6 billion) agreement with the Swedish company Saab to purchase 17 Gripen fighter jets over the next five years.

US President Donald Trump , whose repeated threats to act had included a vow to "take very strong action" if Iran executed protesters, said Tehran's leaders had called off mass hangings .

"I greatly respect the fact that all scheduled hangings, which were to take place yesterday (Over 800 of them), have been cancelled by the leadership of Iran. Thank you!" he posted on social media.

Iran has not publicly announced ​plans for such executions or said it had cancelled them.

The protests erupted on December 28 over economic hardship and swelled into widespread demonstrations calling for the end of clerical rule, culminating in mass violence at the end ‍of last week.

According to opposition groups and an Iranian official, more than 2,000 people were killed in the worst domestic unrest since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution .

But several residents of Tehran reached by Reuters said the capital had now been comparatively quiet for four days.

Drones were flying over the city, but there had been no ​sign of major protests on Thursday or Friday. Another resident in a northern city on the Caspian Sea said the streets there also appeared calm. The residents declined to be identified ​for their safety.

The prospect of a US attack has retreated since Wednesday, when Trump said he had been told killings in Iran were easing. But more US military assets were expected to arrive in the region, showing the continued tensions.

US allies, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar , conducted intense diplomacy with Washington this week to prevent a US strike, warning of repercussions for the wider region that would ultimately impact the United States, a Gulf official said.

Israel 's intelligence chief David Barnea was also in the US on Friday for talks on Iran, according to a source familiar with the matter, and an Israeli military official said the country's forces were on "peak readiness".

As an internet blackout eased this week, more accounts of the violence have trickled out.

The US is expected to send additional offensive and defensive capabilities to the region, but the exact makeup of those forces and the timing of their arrival was still unclear, a US official said speaking on condition of anonymity.

The US military's Central Command declined to comment, saying it does not discuss ship movements.

Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of Iran's last shah who has gained increasing prominence as an opposition figure, on Friday urged the international community to ramp up pressure on Tehran to help protesters overthrow clerical rule.

"The Iranian people are taking decisive action on the ground. It is now time for the international community to join them fully," said Pahlavi, whose level of support inside Iran is hard to gauge.

Trump this week appeared to ‌downplay the idea of US backing for Pahlavi, voicing uncertainty that the exiled royal heir who has courted support among Western countries could muster significant backing inside Iran. Pahlavi met US envoy Steve Witkoff last weekend, Axios reported.

Iranian-Kurdish rights group Hengaw said that there had been no protest gatherings since Sunday, but "the security environment remains highly restrictive".

"Our independent sources confirm a heavy military and security presence in ‍cities and towns where protests previously took place, as well as in several locations that did not experience major demonstrations," Norway-based Hengaw said in comments to Reuters.

There were, however, still indications of unrest in some areas. Hengaw reported that a female nurse was killed by direct gunfire from government forces during protests in Karaj, west of Tehran. Reuters was not able to independently verify the report.

The state-affiliated Tasnim news outlet reported that rioters had set fire to a local education office in Falavarjan County, in central Isfahan Province, on Thursday.

An elderly resident of a town in Iran's northwestern region, where many Kurdish Iranians live and which has been the focus for many of the biggest flare-ups, said sporadic protests had continued, though not as intensely.

Describing violence earlier in the protests, she said: "I have not seen scenes like that before."

Video circulating online, which Reuters was able to verify as having been recorded in a forensic medical center in Tehran, showed dozens of bodies lying on floors and stretchers, most in bags but some uncovered. Reuters could not verify the date of the ‍video.

The state-owned Press TV cited Iran's police chief as saying calm had been restored across the country.

A death toll reported by U.S.-based rights group HRANA has increased little since Wednesday, now at 2,677 people, including 2,478 protesters and 163 people identified as affiliated with the government.

Reuters has not been ‌able to independently verify the HRANA death toll. ​An Iranian official told the news agency earlier this week that about 2,000 people had been killed.

The casualty numbers dwarf the death toll from previous bouts of unrest that have been suppressed by the state, including in 2009 and 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:28:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3f415c7a-f322-11f0-bd25-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016436555126.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda: preliminary results begin to emerge</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/uganda-preliminary-results-begin-to-emerge</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:28:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/462dcc6a-f31f-11f0-ba04-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260116-2141-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria's Sharaa declares Kurdish a 'national language' following clashes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260116-syria-sharaa-declares-kurdish-national-language-following-clashes</link><description>Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree on Friday declaring Kurdish a "national language", in an apparent gesture of good will towards the minority following clashes in past days .

The move came as the Syrian army warned of new strikes east of Aleppo, despite a meeting between the US-led coalition and Kurdish forces seeking to ease tensions between the two sides.

After driving Kurdish forces from Aleppo city last week, the Syrian army had deployed reinforcements near the Kurdish-controlled Deir Hafer, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) east of the city, ordering Kurdish fighters to leave the area.

On Friday, it issued warnings ahead of strikes on Deir Hafer, saying it would target areas that Kurdish forces were using "as a launching point for their terrorist operations towards the city of Aleppo and its eastern countryside".

In addition to decreeing Kurdish a national language, Sharaa granted the minority national rights and made the Kurdish new year, Nowruz , a national holiday.

The decree also grants nationality to Kurds , as 20 percent of them had been stripped of it under a controversial 1962 census.

The apparent olive branch marks a momentous step in the country where teaching and publishing or broadcasting in Kurdish were effectively prohibited for decades under Assad rule.

The Syrian government has been seeking to extend its authority nationwide following the ousting of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in December 2024.

Under a March deal, the Kurdish de facto autonomous administration in the north and its forces were to be integrated into the state.

But disagreements have stalled its implementation, with fighting repeatedly breaking out and the Kurds calling for a decentralised federal system, which Damascus rejects.

Earlier on Friday, Farhad Shami, spokesman for the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces , said that the US-led anti-jihadist coalition had met with them in Deir Hafer on Friday.

Following the meeting, a Syrian military source said that "a delegation from the Syrian defence ministry entered the Deir Hafer area to negotiate with SDF leaders".

The US envoy for Syria , Tom Barrack, posted on X that he was working "around the clock" to prevent any escalation between Kurdish fighters and government forces, both of which have US backing.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil-rich north and northeast, much of which it captured during the country's civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.

Quoting local authorities in Deir Hafer, Syrian state television reported that "more than 4,000 civilians" had left the Kurdish-controlled region .

AFP correspondents saw some using a rickety bridge to cross a branch of the Euphrates River.

The military had used the same tactic in the city of Aleppo last week, telling civilians to depart before shelling Kurdish-held districts.

"The SDF stopped us from leaving – that's why we used an agricultural back road and then crossed the bridge," said 60-year-old Abu Mohammad, who was accompanied by relatives.

Civilians have been fleeing the area on back roads since Thursday.

Syrian authorities had extended the deadline to flee until Friday, accusing the SDF of preventing civilians from leaving, a claim the group dismissed as "unfounded".

Syria's military called on members of the SDF on Friday to "hurry and defect from this organisation and return to your country and your people".

The SDF in a statement said it believed these calls were intended to "create discord among the region's communities".

On Sunday, government troops took full control of Aleppo city after capturing two Kurdish-majority neighbourhoods.

Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said that capture of Aleppo's Kurdish-held areas "doesn't change the military balance" but shows that Damascus "can impose costs when negotiations stall".

While Syria's government "cannot replicate" this scenario in the northeast, "it can apply sustained pressure along contact lines" like Deir Hafer.</description><pubDate>Fri, 16 Jan 2026 22:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e4aa635c-f316-11f0-ae06-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-87E99FR.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge says visa warranted for 'mistake' of deporting college student</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-says-visa-warranted-mistake-deporting-college-student-2026-01-17/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:44:32 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US names Rubio, Blair and Kushner in Gaza board under Trump's plan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-names-rubio-blair-kushner-gaza-board-under-trumps-plan-2026-01-17/</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 01:45:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UN biodiversity treaty enters into force, aims to protect 30% of oceans by 2030</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/un-biodiversity-treaty-enters-into-force-aims-protect-30-oceans-by-2030-2026-01-17/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Jan 17 (Reuters) - A landmark global treaty to safeguard biodiversity in the high seas came into effect on Saturday, providing countries with a legally binding framework to tackle threats such as overfishing and meet a target to protect 30% of the ocean environment by 2030.

The U.N. treaty, also known as Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ), was finalised in March 2023 after 15 years of negotiations, and will allow the creation of a global network of "marine protected areas" in vast and previously unregulated ocean ecosystems lying in international waters.

"It's two-thirds of the ocean, (and) it's half the surface of the planet that for the first time will have a comprehensive legal regime," said Adam McCarthy, first assistant secretary at the Australian foreign ministry and a co-chair of the treaty's preparatory committee, speaking at a media briefing.

The treaty reached the threshold of 60 national ratifications on September 19 last year, meaning that it would go formally into operation within 120 days. The number of ratifications has since risen to more than 80, with China, Brazil and Japan adding their names to the list.

Others, including Britain and Australia, are expected to follow soon. The United States signed the treaty during the previous administration but has not yet ratified it.

"Whilst we only needed 60 for it to enter into force, obviously it's really critical for its implementation and for it to be as effective as possible for us to achieve global or universal ratification of the treaty," said Rebecca Hubbard, director of the High Seas Alliance, a coalition of environmental groups.

"We're really aiming for all UN member states to ratify the treaty."

Under the treaty, countries must conduct environmental assessments of activities that have an impact on ocean ecology. It will also create mechanisms allowing nations to share the spoils of the "blue economy", including "marine genetic resources" used in industries such as biotechnology.

Environmentalists say more than 190,000 protected areas would need to be established in order to meet the "30 by 30" target to bring 30% of the oceans under formal protection by 2030. Currently, only about 8% - or 29 million square kilometres (11.2 million square miles) - is protected.

But the treaty will have little impact on what some conservationists identify as one of the greatest threats facing the marine environment - the clamour to extract mineral resources from the ocean bed.

"BBNJ is very ambitious but there are certain defined limits," McCarthy said.

"The question of mining in the substrate or in the seabed simply belongs to the ISA (International Seabed Authority). It's not something where the BBNJ gets a role."</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 04:53:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7VK2QORNEZK7TOBGMKHOGO4TJE.jpg?auth=09efd2cc965b4f77177b26ab20adbe574ded336417624623641c594ccadf2edf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Iran protests over 3,000, rights group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/death-toll-iran-protests-over-3000-rights-group-says-2026-01-17/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - More than 3,000 people have died in Iran's nationwide protests, rights activists said on Saturday, while a "very slight rise" in internet activity was reported in the country after an eight-day blackout.

The U.S.-based HRANA group said it had verified 3,090 deaths, including 2,885 protesters, after residents said the crackdown appeared to have broadly quelled protests for now and state media reported more arrests.

"Metrics show a very slight rise in internet connectivity in #Iran this morning" after 200 hours of shutdown, the internet monitoring group NetBlocks posted on X. Connectivity remained around 2% of ordinary levels, it said.

A few Iranians overseas said on social media that they had been able to message users living inside Iran early on Saturday.

Indian students and pilgrims returning from Iran said they were largely confined to their accommodations while in the country, unable to communicate with their families back home.

"We only heard stories of violent protests, and one man jumped in front of our car holding a burning baton, shouting something in the local language, with anger visible in his eyes," said Z Syeda, a third-year medical student at a university in Tehran.

India's External Affairs Ministry said on Friday that commercial flights were available and that New Delhi would take steps to secure the safety and welfare of Indian nationals.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 05:44:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JPUYUPDCDVO3NOLIRYPHP73GO4.jpg?auth=25eedbd93d5654b52b1b3a7a5a8dc4b00eb4999f92509c5938b13c4e2813ccf2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Iran death toll tops 3,000, yet another rights group says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260117-live-iran-protests-death-toll-tops-3-000-rights-group-ayatollah-khamenei-trump-crackdown</link><description>Internet connectivity in Iran has risen “very” sightly after more than 200 hours of a nationwide internet shutdown, monitoring group NetBlocks said.

At least 3, 090 people, including 2,885 protesters, ‍have died in the unrest in Iran, US-based HRANA group said on Saturday, becoming the second rights group to claim such a high death toll.

Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR) has estimated that at least 3,428 people, while other estimates have put the toll at more than 5,000 or possibly as high as 20,000.

“The United States needs Greenland for the purpose of National Security,” Trump said in a Truth Social post on Wednesday as Danish and Greenlandic officials arrived in Washington for talks aimed at staving off a confrontation between NATO allies.

The minerals-rich island, Trump wrote, “is vital for the Golden Dome we are building”.

The US president has repeatedly stated that he will acquire the semi-autonomous Danish territory “one way or the other”, sparking bewilderment and concern in Copenhagen and across Europe.

His post this week marked the first time he linked his expansionist aims to a concrete defence project – though analysts have expressed doubts that his missile defence system will ever see the light of day.

Inspired by Israel’s Iron Dome missile shield, the Golden Dome is intended to block projectiles heading for US territory, including intercontinental ballistic missiles.

Trump first announced his signature project in May 2025, unveiling a $175 billion plan to build the missile shield in just three years.

Months later, the Golden Dome is still only in the planning stage, says historian Andrew Gawthorpe, a US foreign policy expert at Leiden University in Germany.

“The whole thing is completely notional at this point,” he says. “They haven't awarded a single government contract to actually develop it.”

The Dome has been described as a Trumpian version of former president Ronald Reagan’s much-derided “Star Wars” programme, which was ultimately abandoned.

Its main feature is “an early-warning system based on a constellation of satellites in space”, says Matthew Powell, an air defence specialist at the University of Portsmouth.

“Interceptors” designed to shoot down incoming missiles “would also be launched from space”, adds Liviu Horovitz, a defence expert at the Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (Science and Politics Foundation) in Berlin.

With the bulk of the Dome located above the Earth, Horovitz says he has “no idea why Trump thinks he needs Greenland to build this defence system”.

Gawthorpe cautions that ground infrastructure would still be a part of the missile shield, notably for communication purposes and to house some interceptor launches.

However, he adds, “it is disputed whether Greenland is actually a good place to do this”.

The Pentagon has already mapped out potential locations for establishing the Golden Dome's terrestrial infrastructure – and Greenland does not feature on the list.

“New York State has been identified as an ideal location for the US East Coast interceptor base,” notes Horovitz.

The recently rebranded US Department of War has earmarked $25 million to develop an interceptor base at Fort Drum military base in northern New York State, not far from the Canadian border.

Located further north and closer to Russia, Greenland has a potential advantage over Fort Drum, says Powell, noting that “it could allow for a slightly faster response to detect and intercept missiles”, particularly if fired from Russian soil.

But the US need not acquire Greenland – a territory three times the size of Texas – to install part of the Golden Dome there.

The US already has a “space base” in the Danish territory, known as Pituffik (formerly Thule Air Base), which houses a substantial part of the US military’s global network of missile warning sensors.

The US also retains the right to expand its military presence.

“A 1951 agreement between the US and Denmark, which was revised in 2004, allows Washington to develop the base as it deems necessary, provided it has the agreement of Denmark and Greenland,” says Gawthorpe.

US officials are reportedly already allocating tens of millions of dollars into upgrading the facility based on current agreements with local authorities. At least 150 US military troops are still stationed at Pituffik along with Danish, Greenlandic and Canadian military personnel and contractors.

So far, Denmark has been largely accommodating towards Washington’s requests regarding Pituffik, adds Horovitz. “Copenhagen is unlikely to oppose US plans [to develop] the base in the current geopolitical context,” he says – particularly if it means avoiding a US takeover of Greenland.

That is, unless the US wants to develop its presence in Greenland without having to consult with Danish authorities.

“The Americans have always been very sensitive when it comes to sharing new military technologies,” says Powell. “It could be that they are worried about having to share information with the Danes, even though they wouldn’t have to go into details.”

Another explanation for Trump’s decision to invoke the Golden Dome is the need to persuade a deeply sceptical US public of its interest in acquiring Greenland – by force, if necessary – at the expense of a NATO ally, or indeed at the expense of the Alliance as a whole.

Watch more What will Europe actually do to defend Greenland?

Only 17 percent of Americans support their president's ambition to take over the Danish territory, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on January 15. A mere 4 percent – including just one in 10 Republicans – said ‍it would be a “good idea” to do so by force.

Trump is underscoring the national security argument for another reason, since it is unlikely his desire for the territory’s rare earth minerals would play as well with the public.

“Trump hopes that portraying the acquisition of Greenland as vital to American security will help to win over public opinion,” says Gawthorpe. “It’s much easier to say, ‘We need Greenland to keep Chicago safe’ than it is to say, ‘We need Greenland because it has minerals’.”

President Yoweri Museveni , 81, looked set to be declared winner and extend his 40-year rule later on Saturday, with a commanding lead against Wine, a former singer turned politician.

Wine said Friday that he was under house arrest, and his party later wrote on X that he had been “forcibly taken” by an army helicopter from his compound.

The army denied that claim.

“The rumours of his so-called arrest are baseless and unfounded,” army spokesman Chris Magezi told AFP.

“They are designed to incite his supporters into acts of violence,” he added.

AFP journalists said the situation was calm outside Wine’s residence early Saturday, but they were unable to contact members of the party due to continued communications interruptions.

A nearby stall-owner, 29-year-old Prince Jerard, said he heard a drone and helicopter at the home the previous night, with a heavy security presence.

“Many people have left (the area),” he said. “We have a lot of fear.”

With more than 80 percent of votes counted on Friday, Museveni was leading on 73.7 percent to Wine’s 22.7, the Electoral Commission said.

Final results were due around 1300 GMT on Saturday.

Wine, 43, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the main challenger to Museveni in recent years, styling himself the “ghetto president” after the slum areas where he grew up in the capital, Kampala.

He has accused the government of “massive ballot stuffing” and attacking several of his party officials under cover of the internet blackout, which was imposed ahead of Thursday’s polls and remained in place on Saturday.

His claims could not be independently verified, but the United Nations rights office said last week that the elections were taking place in an environment marked by “widespread repression and intimidation” against the opposition.

Analysts have long viewed the election as a formality.

Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter who seized power in 1986, has total control over the state and security apparatus, and has ruthlessly crushed any challenger during his rule.

Election day was marred by significant technical problems after biometric machines—used to confirm voters’ identities—malfunctioned and ballot papers were undelivered for several hours in many areas.

There were reports of violence against the opposition in other parts of the country.

Muwanga Kivumbi, member of parliament for Wine’s party in the Butambala area of central Uganda, told AFP’s Nairobi office by phone that security forces had killed 10 of his campaign agents after storming his home.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 07:44:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/74d30918-f374-11f0-835e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014476033025.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda police deny opposition leader's arrest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-police-deny-opposition-leaders-arrest-2026-01-17/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Ugandan police denied on Saturday allegations by opposition leader Bobi Wine’s party that he had been arrested by soldiers as President Yoweri Museveni closed in on a landslide re-election.

Wine’s National Unity Platform (NUP) said on Friday night an army helicopter landed in his compound in Kampala and “forcibly took him away to an unknown destination”. Reuters could not immediately verify the claim.

National police spokesperson Kituuma Rusoke told a televised news conference that Wine was at his home and free to move.

"He is not under arrest," Rusoke said. Wine and representatives of the NUP could not be immediately reached for comment.

Wine has alleged mass fraud during Thursday's election , held under an internet blackout , and called on supporters to protest.

His party said on Thursday he had been placed under effective house arrest.

The vote has been widely seen as a test of the 81-year-old Museveni's political strength and ability to avoid the unrest that has rocked neighbours Tanzania and Kenya.

As of Saturday morning, Museveni, who has been in power since 1986, held a commanding lead with nearly 72% of the vote, the electoral commission said. Wine trailed with 24%, with more than 90% of polling stations counted.

After a campaign marred by clashes at opposition rallies and what the United Nations said was widespread repression and intimidation, voting passed peacefully on Thursday.

But violence broke out in the early hours of Friday in the town of Butambala, about 55 km (35 miles) southwest of the capital Kampala, according to a police spokesperson and a member of parliament from the area, who gave differing accounts of events.

Local police spokesperson Lydia Tumushabe said machete-wielding opposition "goons" organised by local MP Muwanga Kivumbi attacked a police station and vote-tallying centre.

"Security responded in self-defence because these people came in big numbers. Police fired in self-defence," she told Reuters, adding that 25 people were arrested.

Kivumbi, however, told Reuters the victims were killed at around 3 a.m. inside his house, where they were waiting for election results for his parliamentary seat to be announced.

"They killed 10 people inside my house," he said. "There were people inside the garage who were waiting for the results to celebrate my victory."

"They broke the front door and began shooting inside the garage. It was a massacre."

He said security forces had earlier dispersed crowds outside but disputed the police's assertion that the deaths occurred during clashes between the two sides.

Tumushabe, the police spokesperson, said she was not aware of an incident at Kivumbi's house, which she said was close to the police station.

Reuters was not able to independently confirm the circumstances of the violence.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 08:27:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZEXQ4YQ7VZLCLE7ZOFBN5COLOY.jpg?auth=e5bb7519cde44774851f55965cc08c7e50c246f8fd8192d2c8737e3442d92a91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge bars ICE agents from arresting peaceful Minnesota protesters or pepper-spraying them</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260117-us-judge-bars-ice-agents-arresting-peaceful-minnesota-protesters-pepper-spray-renee-good-fatal-shooting</link><description>A US judge restricted federal agents on Friday from interfering with peaceful protesters in Minnesota, after President Donald Trump said there was no immediate need to invoke the Insurrection Act over the demonstrations.

US District Judge Katherine Menendez ordered immigration agents to dial back their aggressive tactics, barring the detention or arrest of peaceful protesters and drivers and the use of pepper-spray against demonstrators.

The 83-page order gives the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) current operation in the northern US city 72 hours to come into compliance, and follows two incidents where federal agents opened fire, killing one person and wounding another in the span of a week.

In a separate legal move that could inflame the standoff between the White House and Minnesota elected officials, CBS News reported that the Justice Department (DOJ) was investigating Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey for impeding federal officers.

Both have called for peaceful protests against immigration sweeps in their state.

“This is an obvious attempt to intimidate me for standing up for Minneapolis, local law enforcement, and residents against the chaos and danger this Administration has brought to our city,” Frey wrote on X on Friday.

Walz said the Trump administration has moved to investigate other Democrats who have spoken out against the president’s policies and mentioned the 37-year-old woman who was fatally shot by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer in Minneapolis on January 7.

“The only person not being investigated for the shooting of Renee Good is the federal agent who shot her,” Walz wrote on X.

The DOJ did not respond to a request for comment. However, Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote on X on Friday: “A reminder to all those in Minnesota: No one is above the law.”

Trump threatened the drastic measure of invoking the Insurrection Act, which would allow him to deploy the military to police the protests, as the row escalated this week.

“If I needed it, I would use it. I don’t think there is any reason right now to use it,” Trump told reporters at the White House when asked about the move.

The Insurrection Act allows a president to sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act to suppress “armed rebellion” or “domestic violence” and deploy soldiers on US soil “as he considers necessary” to enforce the 19th-century law.

Crowds of protesters have clashed with immigration officers across Minneapolis, opposing their efforts to target undocumented migrants. Some officers have responded with violence.

Demonstrations grew dramatically following Good’s killing as the Trump administration pressed operations to catch undocumented migrants.

Four dead while in ICE detention

Federal agents fired their weapons in two separate incidents, wounding a man from Venezuela on Wednesday and in Good’s killing last week.

In a separate incident, DHS confirmed on Friday that Heber Sanchez Dominguez, a 34-year-old Mexican national, died while detained in ICE custody two days earlier.

At least four people have died in ICE detention so far this year, according to agency data.

Trump backers have also begun to face off with protesters who oppose ICE’s actions in the state, leading to tense encounters.

The Minnesota Star Tribune newspaper reported that divisions within the anti-ICE movement were beginning to emerge over how aggressively to resist the enforcement efforts.

Activists have also become increasingly wary of “far-right provocateurs trying to bait demonstrators into rioting,” it said.

Minnesota’s American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) chapter has reported an uptick in complaints against ICE officers.

Walz accused federal agents of waging “a campaign of organised brutality against the people of Minnesota” in a video posted to X Wednesday night.

Good’s family announced on Wednesday that they had retained a top law firm to probe the killing ahead of launching possible legal action against the officer and the government.

The lawyers demanded on Thursday that federal officials—including the officer who shot Good—preserve records and evidence relating to the incident.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 08:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6889d2c4-f322-11f0-b455-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/53e3007edfa095a993e863684aa28c4878ce8d25.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan says Chinese drone made 'provocative' flight over South China Sea island</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-says-chinese-drone-made-provocative-flight-over-south-china-sea-island-2026-01-17/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - A Chinese reconnaissance drone briefly flew over the Taiwan-controlled Pratas Islands at the top end of the South China Sea on Saturday, in what Taiwan's defence ministry called a "provocative and irresponsible" move.

Democratically governed Taiwan, which China claims as its own territory, reports Chinese military activity around it on an almost daily basis, including drones though they very rarely enter Taiwanese airspace.

Taiwan's defence ministry said the Chinese reconnaissance drone was detected around dawn on Saturday approaching the Pratas Islands and flew in its airspace for eight minutes at an altitude outside the range of anti-aircraft weapons.

"After our side broadcast warnings on international channels, it departed at 0548," it said in a statement.

"Such highly provocative and irresponsible actions by the People's Liberation Army seriously undermine regional peace and stability, violated international legal norms, and will inevitably be condemned," it added.

Taiwan's armed forces will continue to maintain strict vigilance and monitoring, and will respond in accordance with the routine combat readiness rules, the ministry said.

Calls to China's defence ministry outside of office hours on a weekend went unanswered.

In 2022, Taiwan's military for the first time shot down an unidentified civilian drone that entered its airspace near an islet off the Chinese coast controlled by Taiwan.

Lying roughly between southern Taiwan and Hong Kong, the Pratas are seen by some security experts as vulnerable to Chinese attack due to their distance - more than 400 km (250 miles) - from mainland Taiwan.

The Pratas, an atoll which is also a Taiwanese national park, are only lightly defended by Taiwan's military, but lie at a highly strategic location at the top end of the disputed South China Sea.

China also views the Pratas as its own territory.

Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 08:51:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela’s interim leader sacks Maduro ally Alex Saab as industry minister</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260116-venezuela-s-interim-leader-sacks-maduro-ally-alex-saab-as-industry-minister</link><description>Venezuela 's interim president on Friday dismissed businessman Alex Saab, a close ally of deposed leader Nicolas Maduro , from his post as minister of industry.

In a Telegram message, Delcy Rodriguez announced the ministry would be combined with a commerce ministry and thanked Saab -- a Colombian-born Venezuelan -- "for his service to the Homeland; he will be taking on new responsibilities."

The change comes amid pressure from Washington following the January 3 US military raid that ousted Maduro.

Saab, released in 2023 as part of a prisoner exchange with the United States, was appointed to office in 2024 by Maduro.

He had been arrested in Cape Verde in 2020 due to an Interpol notice over accusations he had served as a money launderer for the socialist leader.

He was subsequently extradited to the US, where he and his business partner Alvaro Pulido were charged with running a network that exploited food aid destined for Venezuela.

Saab's dismissal is among the latest key changes to Venezuela's government by Rodriguez since the US capture of Maduro and his wife Cilia Flores.

Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado meanwhile said her country is starting a "true transition" to democracy and will become free with support from the United States and President Donald Trump.

Trump however has sidelined Nobel laureate Machado and backed former vice president Rodriguez as interim leader of the oil-rich country following the seizure of Maduro.

"We are definitely now into the first steps of a true transition to democracy," Machado said during an event in Washington, adding that this will have an "immense impact in the lives of all Venezuelans" as well as around the region and the world.

"Venezuela is going to be free, and that's going to be achieved with the support of the people of the United States and the president, Donald Trump," Machado said.

Her party has presented evidence that Maduro stole the 2024 election -- claims supported by Washington and much of the international community.

But Trump has said that Machado does not have enough support among Venezuelans, and opted to stick with Rodriguez so long as she toes the line on US access to Venezuela's vast oil reserves.

Machado said Friday that Rodriguez is "following orders" rather than acting of her own will.

The opposition leader's remarks came a day after US Central Intelligence Agency chief John Ratcliffe met Rodriguez in Caracas.

Ratcliffe traveled to Venezuela to "deliver the message that the United States looks forward to an improved working relationship," a US administration official said on condition of anonymity.

In an indication of that improved relationship, a US deportation flight carrying 231 Venezuelans landed in Caracas on Friday, the first since Maduro's overthrow.

Trump has made cracking down on undocumented immigrants a major part of his second term, carrying out sweeping immigration raids and deporting migrants.

Machado, 58, on Thursday presented her Nobel Peace Prize medal to Trump in a bid to win over the US president.

"He deserves it," she said. "And it was a very emotional moment, I decided to present the Nobel Peace Prize medal on behalf of the people of Venezuela."

It was not immediately clear if Trump -- who said Friday that he and Machado will "be talking again" -- kept the award following their White House lunch. The Norwegian Nobel committee says its prizes cannot be transferred.

Trump had campaigned hard to win last year's prize, falsely claiming that he stopped eight wars since taking office, but it went to Machado instead.

Trump and Rodriguez had their first telephone call on Wednesday and the White House said he "likes what he's seeing" from her.

Rodriguez said however that her government will stand up to Washington.

"We know they are very powerful... we are not afraid to confront them diplomatically, through political dialogue," she said Thursday.

Rodriguez was delivering Maduro's state of the nation address to parliament while the long-time authoritarian leader is in a New York jail facing drug trafficking charges.

By contrast Machado, who campaigned for years to end leftist Maduro's rule, was greeted by jubilant supporters in Washington.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 08:53:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/02ea9d46-f353-11f0-9d2e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/1146cea08a3524b10852146b79440ff9a240715f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian forces enter Deir Hafer near Aleppo after Kurdish fighters agree to withdraw</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260117-syria-forces-enter-deir-hafer-near-aleppo-after-kurdish-fighters-agree-withdraw</link><description>Syria’s army said Saturday its forces had started entering an area east of the city of Aleppo after Kurdish forces agreed to withdraw from the region following recent clashes .

In a statement carried by state television, the army said its forces “began entering the western Euphrates area, starting with the town of Deir Hafer”, after Kurdish forces had agreed to withdraw on Saturday morning.

In a statement carried by state television, the military urged civilians “not to enter the operations area” until the army had secured it and “cleared it of all mines and war remnants”.

After driving out Kurdish forces from Aleppo city last week following deadly clashes, Syria’s army deployed reinforcements near Deir Hafer and told the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) to evacuate the area between the town and the Euphrates River, around 30 kilometres further east.

On Friday, Kurdish leader Mazloum Abdi committed to withdrawing his US-backed, Kurdish-led SDF on Saturday morning “towards redeployment in areas east of the Euphrates”, based on “calls from friendly countries and mediators”.

The defence ministry had welcomed Abdi’s announcement, saying army troops would deploy in the areas after the SDF withdrew.

The Syrian army had urged civilians to flee the Deir Hafer area in recent days, with at least 4,000 people leaving, according to Syrian authorities.

On Friday, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Friday issued a decree declaring Kurdish a “national language”, in an apparent gesture of good will towards the minority after the recent violence.

Syria’s Islamist-led government is seeking to extend its authority across the country following the ousting of longtime leader Bashar al-Assad in late 2024.

Progress on implementing a March deal to integrate the Kurds’ de facto autonomous administration in the north into the state has stalled.

But Sharaa’s announcement on Friday is the first formal recognition of Kurdish national rights since Syria’s independence in 1946.

The decree stated Kurds were “an essential and integral part” of Syria, where they have suffered decades of marginalisation and oppression under former rulers.

It makes Kurdish a “national language” that can be taught in public schools in areas where the minority community is heavily present.

Trump named members of a board to help supervise Gaza that was dominated by Americans, as he promotes a controversial vision of economic development in a territory that lies in rubble after two-plus years of relentless Israeli bombardment.

Watch Gazans sceptical of phase 2 of truce as strikes continue

The step came after a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern Gaza held its first meeting in Cairo which was attended by Jared Kushner , Trump's son-in-law who plays a key role on the Middle East .

Trump has already declared himself the chair of a "Board of Peace" and on Friday announced its full membership that will include Blair as well as senior Americans – Kushner, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Steve Witkoff , Trump's business partner turned globe-trotting negotiator.

Blair is a controversial figure in the Middle East because of his role in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Trump himself said last year that he wanted to make sure Blair was an "acceptable choice to everybody".

Blair spent years focused on the Israeli-Palestinian issue as representative of the "Middle East Quartet" – the United Nations, European Union, United States and Russia – after leaving Downing Street in 2007.

The White House said the Board of Peace will take on issues such as "governance capacity-building, regional relations, reconstruction, investment attraction, large-scale funding and capital mobilization".

Trump, a real-estate developer, has previously mused about turning devastated Gaza into a Riviera-style area of resorts, although he has backed away from calls to forcibly displace the population.

The other members of the board are World Bank President Ajay Banga, an Indian-born American businessman; billionaire US financier Marc Rowan; and Robert Gabriel, a loyal Trump aide who serves on the National Security Council.

Israel 's military said Friday it had again hit the Gaza Strip in response to a "blatant violation" of the ceasefire declared in October.

The strikes come despite Washington announcing that the Gaza plan had gone on to a second phrase – from implementing the ceasefire to disarming Hamas , whose October, 2023 attack on Israel prompted the massive Israeli offensive.

Trump on Friday named US Major General Jasper Jeffers to head the International Stabilization Force, which will be tasked with providing security in Gaza and training a new police force to succeed Hamas.

Jeffers, from special operations in US Central Command, in late 2024 was put in charge of monitoring a ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel, which has continued periodic strikes aimed at Hezbollah militants.

The United States has been searching the world for countries to contribute to the force, with Indonesia an early volunteer.

But diplomats expect challenges in seeing countries send troops so long as Hamas does not agree to disarm fully.

Gaza native and former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath was earlier tapped to head the governing committee.

The committee's meeting in Cairo also included Bulgarian diplomat Nickolay Mladenov, who was given a role of high representative liaising between the new governing body and Trump's Board of Peace.

Committee members are scheduled to meet again Saturday, one of them told AFP on condition of anonymity.

"We hope to go to Gaza next week or the week after; our work is there, and we need to be there," he said.

Trump also named a second "executive board" that appears designed to have a more advisory role.

Blair, Witkoff and Mladenov will serve on it as well as Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan.

Israel has refused a Turkish role in the security force, owing to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's fiery denunciations of Israel's actions in Gaza.

The board will also include senior figures from mediators Egypt and Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, which normalised ties with Israel in 2020.

Trump also named to the board Sigrid Kaag, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Gaza, despite his administration's efforts to sideline the world body.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 10:49:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c3d6edb4-d500-11f0-bf7b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25289604461877.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US talks with hardline Venezuelan minister Cabello began months before raid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-talks-with-hardline-venezuelan-minister-cabello-began-months-before-raid-2026-01-17/</link><description>NEW YORK/MIAMI/WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Trump administration officials had been in discussions with Venezuela's hardline interior minister Diosdado Cabello months before the U.S. operation to seize President Nicolas Maduro, and have been in communication with him since then, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.

The officials warned Cabello, 62, against using the security services or militant ruling-party supporters he oversees to target the country's opposition, four sources said. That security apparatus, which includes the intelligence services, police and the armed forces, remains largely intact after the January 3 U.S. raid .

Cabello is named in the same U.S. drug-trafficking indictment that the Trump administration used as justification to arrest Maduro, but was not taken as part of the operation.

The communication with Cabello, which has also touched on sanctions the U.S. has imposed on him and the indictment he faces, dates back to the early days of the current Trump administration and continued in the weeks just prior to the U.S. ouster of Maduro, two sources familiar with the discussions said. The administration has also been in touch with Cabello since Maduro's ouster, four of the people said.

The communications, which have not been previously reported, are critical to the Trump administration's efforts to control the situation inside Venezuela. If Cabello decides to unleash the forces that he controls, it could foment the kind of chaos that Trump wants to avoid and threaten interim President Delcy Rodriguez's grip on power, according to a source briefed on U.S. concerns.

It is not clear if the Trump administration's discussions with Cabello extended to questions about the future governance of Venezuela. Also unclear is whether Cabello has heeded the U.S. warnings. He has publicly pledged unity with Rodriguez, whom Trump has so far praised .

While Rodriguez has been seen by the U.S. as the linchpin for U.S. President Donald Trump's strategy for post-Maduro Venezuela, Cabello is widely believed to have the power to keep those plans on track or upend them.

The Venezuelan minister has been in contact with the Trump administration both directly and via intermediaries, one person familiar with the conversations said.

All of the sources were granted anonymity to speak freely about sensitive internal government communications with Cabello.

The White House and the government of Venezuela did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Cabello has long been seen as Venezuela's second most powerful figure. A close aide of late former President Hugo Chavez, Maduro's mentor, he went on to become a long-time Maduro loyalist, feared as his main enforcer of repression. Rodriguez and Cabello have both operated at the heart of the government, legislature and ruling socialist party for years, but have never been considered close allies of each other.

A former military officer, Cabello has exerted influence over the country's military and civilian counterintelligence agencies, which conduct widespread domestic espionage. He has also been closely associated with pro-government militias, notably the colectivos, groups of motorcycle-riding armed civilians who have been deployed to attack protesters.

Cabello is one of a handful of Maduro loyalists Washington has relied on as temporary rulers to maintain stability while it accesses the OPEC nation's oil reserves during an unspecified transition period.

But U.S. officials are concerned that Cabello - given his record of repression and a history of rivalry with Rodriguez - could play the spoiler, according to a source briefed on the administration's thinking.

Rodriguez has been working to consolidate her own power, installing loyalists in key positions to protect herself from internal threats while meeting U.S. demands to boost oil production, Reuters interviews with sources in Venezuela have shown.

Elliott Abrams, who served as Trump's special representative on Venezuela in his first term, said many Venezuelans would expect Cabello to be removed at some point if a democratic transition is to advance.

"If and when he goes, Venezuelans will know that the regime has really begun to change," said Abrams, now at the Council on Foreign Relations think tank.

Cabello has long been under U.S. sanctions for alleged drug trafficking.

In 2020, the U.S. issued a $10 million bounty for Cabello and indicted him as a key figure in the "Cartel de los Soles," a group the U.S. has said is a Venezuelan drug-trafficking network led by members of the country's government.

The U.S. has since raised the award to $25 million. Cabello has publicly denied any links to drug trafficking.

In the hours after Maduro's ouster, some analysts and politicians in Washington questioned why the U.S. didn't also grab Cabello - listed second in the Department of Justice indictment of Maduro.

"I know that just Diosdado is probably worse than Maduro and worse than Delcy," Republican U.S. Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said in an interview with CBS's "Face the Nation" on January 11.

In the days following, Cabello denounced American intervention in the country, saying in a speech that "Venezuela will not surrender."

But media reports of residents being searched at checkpoints - sometimes by uniformed members of the security forces and sometimes by people in plain clothes - have become less frequent in recent days.

And both Trump and the Venezuelan government have said many detainees who are considered by the opposition and rights groups to be political prisoners will be released.

The government has said that Cabello, in his role as interior minister, is overseeing that effort. Rights groups say the liberations are proceeding extremely slowly and hundreds remain unjustly detained.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:17:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SNI5INORENPI7OKUWHRDFIKPAA.jpg?auth=c14e0cfb7018f8e16b3bcaec2b41fd627c0416683d67655241573970fc86669b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's peace negotiators arrive in US for talks with Trump officials</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraines-peace-negotiators-arrive-us-talks-with-trump-officials-2026-01-17/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Ukraine's peace negotiators arrived in the United States on Saturday for talks on details of a proposed agreement to end the four-year war with Russia , the head of the Ukrainian president's office said.

Kyrylo Budanov said the delegation would meet with White House envoy Steve Witkoff, President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, and U.S. Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll.

"Ukraine needs a just peace. We are working to achieve results," Budanov, a former military intelligence chief, said on the Telegram app.

Trump has been pushing both Kyiv and Moscow for a deal to end the war. But despite many rounds of talks, no tangible diplomatic breakthrough has been reached so far, and fighting continues to rage on a front line extending more than 1,200 km (750 miles).

Ukraine and the U.S. have drafted a 20-point peace proposal, but Russia has yet to comment on it.

The trickiest issues include territorial concessions, security guarantees and the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's biggest, occupied by Russia.

Ukrainian officials said the agenda would include security guarantees and a post-war recovery package for Ukraine.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said he hoped to sign documents outlining "a prosperity package" with the U.S. on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos next week, to unlock about $800 billion in reconstruction investments.

Trump told Reuters this week that he may meet with Zelenskiy at the WEF.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:17:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UWXOFGHS5FJV7M6YB3572QPFXY.jpg?auth=808991e0d6057477a251c6fc240912f14c349c1e4ddc9bbfe68589f316e8c08c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's military 'monitors' US vessels transiting the Taiwan Strait</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-military-monitors-us-vessels-transiting-taiwan-strait-2026-01-17/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 17 (Reuters) - China's military said it had followed and monitored the transit of guided-missile destroyer USS Finn and oceanographic survey ship USNS Mary Sears through the Taiwan Strait on January 16 and 17, it said on an official WeChat account Saturday.

Rodriguez, 56, a quiet but rigorous technocrat who was vice president and oil minister, has named a central banker to help run the economy, a presidential chief of staff and, crucially, a new head of Venezuela’s feared DGCIM, the military counterintelligence agency built over decades with Cuban assistance.

Major General Gustavo Gonzalez, 65, will now head the agency, a move three sources with knowledge of the government described as an early gambit by Rodriguez to counter what many in Venezuela say is the biggest threat to her leadership: Diosdado Cabello , Venezuela's hardline interior minister with close ties to the security services and the dreaded “colectivos” motorcycle gangs which have killed opposition supporters.

"She is very clear that she doesn't have the capacity to survive without the consent of the Americans," said one source close to the government. "She's already reforming the armed forces, removing people and naming new officials."

Interviews with seven sources in Venezuela, including diplomats, business people and politicians, reveal in previously unreported detail the fault line at the heart of Venezuela's government and the risks it poses to Rodriguez as she tries to consolidate internal control while meeting Trump administration dictates on oil sales. The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

The tightrope Rodriguez is attempting to walk was evident in her first major speech since taking office. Addressing parliament in a national annual address on Thursday, she called for unity, stressed her bona fides as Maduro’s loyal deputy, and vowed to forge a new chapter in Venezuela’s politics with increased oil investment.

Venezuela’s communications ministry, which handles all press inquiries for the government and individual officials, did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

The White House responded to emailed questions from Reuters by referring the news agency to recent comments made by Trump. In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Trump said Rodriguez "has been very good to deal with" and that he expected her to visit Washington at some point.

Rodriguez - nicknamed "the tsarina" for her business connections - has broad influence over the country's civilian levers of power, including the crucial oil industry, and now also enjoys the backing of the United States. That backing appeared to be reemphasized on Thursday when Rodriguez met with CIA director John Ratcliffe in Caracas.

The other main faction is led by Cabello.

Cabello, who also heads the ruling PSUV socialist party, is a former soldier with a weekly four-hour show on state television, which has run for 12 years. His first public act after Maduro's capture was to appear on screen dressed in a flak jacket and surrounded by armed guards as he led a chant of, "To doubt is to betray.”

Officials in the Trump administration had contact with Cabello months before the operation to seize Maduro and have also been in communication with him since, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, warning him against using the security services or colectivos to target the opposition.

Cabello, who was jailed in Venezuela for backing eventual socialist President Hugo Chavez in a failed 1992 coup, is under indictment in the U.S. and has a $25 million reward for his capture.

So far Cabello has been conciliatory towards Rodriguez, saying they are “very united” and he arrived at Thursday's national address alongside Rodriguez and her brother Jorge, the head of the national assembly. But sources with knowledge of their relationship told Reuters that Cabello remains the biggest threat to her ability to govern.

In Caracas, security forces are skittish. A few hours after Rodriguez was sworn in, there was a brief burst of anti-aircraft fire outside the presidential palace that some feared could be another U.S. attack. Instead, reports suggest it was a miscommunication between police and the presidential guard, which shot down police drones. The government said the craft were spy drones, without explaining who they belonged to.

Across the country, people are reeling from the shock of Maduro’s capture and unsure whether to be hopeful or scared. In some places, local socialist party branches have asked members to spy on their neighbors and report anyone celebrating Maduro’s downfall, according to three party members who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In this tense environment, Rodriguez must persuade party loyalists that she is not a U.S. puppet who betrayed Maduro. She must also stabilize an economy that saw prices for basic goods soar in the days since the U.S. attack, as well as wrestle some degree of control over the sprawling military-linked patronage networks that have developed over decades of Chavismo rule.

Venezuela has as many as 2,000 generals and admirals, more than double the number in the United States, a military superpower with 20 times more active duty and reserve troops. Senior and retired officers control food distribution, raw materials and the state oil company PDVSA, while dozens of generals sit on the boards of private firms.

Many officials are able to run their regional fiefdoms as they see fit - ordering patrols or checkpoints by soldiers under their command - and some parts of the country and capital Caracas have seen increased activity by security services since Maduro's capture.

Gonzalez, the new head of the military counterintelligence agency DGCIM, has over his long career in Venezuela’s government worked closely with Cabello, particularly during two stints as head of the separate civilian spy agency.

Yet it is to Rodriguez that Gonzalez owes his most recent posts. In 2024, Rodriguez tapped Gonzalez for a top job at the state oil company, Venezuela’s most important company and the engine of the country’s economy.

Questions still remain over how much control Gonzalez will be able to exert over DGCIM. Cabello's allies within the agency could undermine him, the three sources with knowledge of the government said.

One source with knowledge of the inner workings of the security services said Gonzalez's DGCIM predecessor General Javier Marcano struggled to control the agency.

"The role of boss of repression already has a name… Diosdado," this person said. "Marcano was coordinating with (civilian) militias and with the colectivos, but he had serious difficulties controlling DGCIM because his designation was nominal."

Reuters could not reach Marcano directly and all formal communication with officials in Venezuela is handled through the communications ministry, which did not respond to a list of questions related to this story.

The colectivos, closely connected to Cabello, could also make the country ungovernable by implementing a so-called " anarchization " strategy, which was first designed to fend off U.S. intervention but could be directed against Rodriguez, the source close to the government told Reuters. That strategy would mobilize the intelligence services and colectivos to plunge Caracas into disorder and chaos.

Cabello could also slow the pace of prisoner releases that have been hailed by Trump. They have been proceeding much more slowly than demanded by families and rights groups, creating a potential pressure point for Rodriguez.

Outside of Venezuela, however, pressure on Cabello continues to mount.

"For the Trump administration to achieve a real transition in Venezuela, sooner or later Diosdado Cabello must face U.S. justice," U.S. Representative Maria Elvira Salazar said on X this month. "When Diosdado is brought to justice, it will be a decisive step toward a democratic transition in Venezuela and the release of all political hostages."</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 11:17:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SUCWFFC4RVMKDLJ4HTU72ILJTE.jpg?auth=2f73d032e67716e512e72ffc221c5193f235962cf1da319efaa99a47fee49fe4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian troops sweep northern towns as Kurdish fighters withdraw</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-troops-sweep-northern-towns-kurdish-fighters-withdraw-2026-01-17/</link><description>DEIR HAFER, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Syrian troops swept through dozens of towns and villages in the country's north on Saturday after Kurdish fighters withdrew under an agreement that aimed to avoid a bloody showdown between the rival forces.

For days, Syrian troops had amassed around a cluster of villages that lie just west of the winding Euphrates River and had called on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces stationed there to redeploy their forces on the opposite bank of the river.

Overnight, SDF head Mazloum Abdi said his forces would withdraw early on Saturday morning to territory east of the Euphrates as a gesture of goodwill, leaving the river as a frontline between Syrian government troops to its west and Kurdish forces to its east.

By mid-day on Saturday, Syrian troops were in control of the main town of Deir Hafer and surrounding villages whose residents are predominantly Arab, according to statements from the military.

Some residents had left in recent days through a humanitarian corridor set up by Syria's army but those who stayed celebrated the army's arrival.

"It happened with the least amount of losses. There's been enough blood in this country, Syria. We have sacrificed and lost enough - people are tired of it," Hussein al-Khalaf, a resident, told Reuters.

SDF forces had withdrawn east, some on foot, towards the flashpoint town of Tabqa -- downstream but still on the western side of the river, according to a Reuters reporter in the area.

Syria's army announced it was aiming to capture Tabqa next. Some SDF forces regrouped in Tabqa and headed back west to defend some of their positions, the Reuters reporter said.

Clashes broke out in some towns as the SDF and Syria's army accused each other of violating the withdrawal agreement.

In a bid to calm tensions, U.S. envoy Tom Barrack traveled to Erbil in northern Iraq on Saturday to meet with both Abdi and Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, according to two Kurdish sources. There was no immediate comment from Barrack's spokesperson.

Weeks of tensions between government forces and the SDF have deepened the faultline between the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who has vowed to reunify the fractured country under one leadership after 14 years of war, and local Kurdish authorities wary of his Islamist-led administration.

The two sides engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, insisting repeatedly that they wanted to resolve disputes diplomatically.

But after the deadline passed with , clashes broke out last week in the northern city of Aleppo and ended with a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters.

Syrian troops then amassed around towns in the north and east earlier this week to pressure Kurdish authorities into making concessions in the deadlocked talks with Damascus.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:41:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XPWZGGZJVFNM7IGALPRPYQNXUE.jpg?auth=01ed9f6916a2aa946081fa738aed0061bff2cc885e8e09b9564c5679d9495111&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Hands off Greenland': Thousands protest in Denmark against Trump's land grab</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260117-large-crowds-expected-for-hands-off-greenland-protests</link><description>Large demonstrations are planned across Denmark and Greenland on Saturday to protest against US President Donald Trump 's designs to take over the Arctic island.

Thousands of people have indicated on social media that they intend to take part in marches and rallies organised by Greenlandic associations in Copenhagen, Aarhus, Aalborg, Odense and the Greenlandic capital Nuuk.

"The aim is to send a clear and unified message of respect for Greenland's democracy and fundamental human rights," Uagut, an association of Greenlanders in Denmark, said on its website.

The protests follow Trump's warning on Friday that he "may put a tariff" on countries that oppose his plans to take over Greenland, which is an autonomous territory of Denmark.

The demonstration in Nuuk is scheduled to begin at 4:00 pm (1500 GMT), to protest "against the United States' illegal plans to take control of Greenland", organisers said. Demonstrators would march to the US consulate carrying Greenlandic flags.

The Copenhagen rally was due to begin at 12:00 pm (1100 GMT), and make a stop outside the US embassy in the Danish capital around an hour later.

"Recent events have put Greenland and Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark under pressure," Uagut chairwoman Julie Rademacher said in a statement sent to AFP, calling for "unity".

"When tensions rise and people go into a state of alarm, we risk creating more problems than solutions for ourselves and for each other. We appeal to Greenlanders in both Greenland and Denmark to stand together," she said.

The protests come as a bipartisan delegation of US Congress members visited Copenhagen on a two-day trip to give backing to Denmark and Greenland, saying the US president's territorial ambitions were not shared by the American people.

Europeans have also been showing support for Greenland in a military reconnaissance mission that a Danish general said Washington was invited to.

Senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller told Fox News on Friday that "positive early talks" had taken place at a White House meeting between senior officials from the United States, Denmark and Greenland this week.

But he reiterated that Trump had been "clear" that he wanted the United States to control the island.

"They want us to spend hundreds of billions of dollars defending a territory for them that is 25 percent bigger than Alaska at 100 percent American expense, but they say while we do this, it belongs 100 percent to Denmark," Miller said.

Uagut, along with the citizens' movement "Hands Off Greenland", and Inuit, an umbrella group of Greenlandic associations, were staging the demonstrations to coincide with a visit to Copenhagen by a bipartisan delegation of US lawmakers.

On the event's Facebook page, at least 900 people in Greenland said they planned to take part in the territory, which has a total population of about 57,000.

"With this demonstration, we want to show that we are taking action, that we stand together and that we support our politicians, diplomats and partners," Kristian Johansen, one of the organisers, said in a statement.

"We demand respect for our country's right to self-determination and for us as a people," added Avijaja Rosing-Olsen, another organiser.

"We demand respect for international law and international legal principles. This is not only our struggle, it is a struggle that concerns the entire world."

According to the latest poll published in January 2025, 85 percent of Greenlanders oppose the territory joining the United States. Only six percent were in favour.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 12:43:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/02ba0f3a-f39b-11f0-b00c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/Copenhague.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy orders faster imports of electricity, power equipment</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-orders-faster-imports-electricity-power-equipment-2026-01-17/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 17 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Saturday that he had ordered imports of electricity and additional power equipment to be accelerated as much as possible as Ukraine confronts its worst wartime energy crisis.

The government has declared an energy emergency as the system, damaged by relentless Russian strikes, is meeting only 60% of electricity needs. The situation is exacerbated by exceptionally cold temperatures.

"All decisions for this are already in place, and the increase in imports must proceed without delay," Zelenskiy said in a post on X after a meeting with top government and military officials.

The energy ministry said scheduled power cuts were in effect in most regions. The situation was most challenging in and around the capital Kyiv, where residents faced long blackouts and dozens of apartment buildings were without heating as temperatures plunged to 16 Celsius (3 Fahrenheit).

Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said the government and the state energy company Naftogaz had discussed additional gas imports this year, but she gave no details on volumes.

Last year, Naftogaz imported 5.7 billion cubic metres of gas using state financing and funds provided by international partners, she said.

Ukraine was forced to start importing gas back in the spring of 2025, due to attacks by hundreds of Russian drones and missiles on gas production facilities.

Naftogaz said that Russia had struck its gas production facilities six times this week alone.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 13:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SDS4VYUXXZKG3CN6J4MEPINKEM.jpg?auth=cd80e203cd286602d643f58470ddff6852a7e22acc11e36038c91c222d941bc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Protesters in Denmark support Greenland after Trump's takeover threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/protesters-denmark-support-greenland-after-trumps-takeover-threat-2026-01-17/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters gathered across Denmark on Saturday in solidarity with Greenland amid U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to annex the Arctic island , demanding that the United States respect Greenlanders' right to self-determination.

Trump says Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and large supply of minerals and has not ruled out the use of force to take it. European nations this week sent military personnel to the island at Denmark's request.

Chanting "Greenland is not for sale" and holding banners with slogans such as "Hands off Greenland" alongside Greenland's red and white "Erfalasorput" flag, demonstrators assembled in Copenhagen's City Hall Square before marching towards the U.S. embassy.

"I am very grateful for the huge support we as Greenlanders receive ... we are also sending a message to the world that you all must wake up," said Julie Rademacher, chair of Uagut, an organization for Greenlanders in Denmark.

"Greenland and the Greenlanders have involuntarily become the front in the fight for democracy and human rights," she added.

Reuters video footage showed thousands of protesters. Spokespersons for organisers and police declined to provide a crowd estimate.

Protests were also ongoing in other locations across Denmark and are scheduled to take place in Nuuk, Greenland's capital, later on Saturday.

Trump's repeated statements about the island have triggered an unprecedented diplomatic crisis between the United States and Denmark, both founding members of the NATO military alliance, and have been widely condemned in Europe.

The Greenland territory of 57,000 people, governed for centuries from Copenhagen , has carved out significant autonomy since 1979 but remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark which controls defence and foreign policy, and funds much of its administration.

All five political parties elected to Greenland's parliament ultimately favour independence, but they disagree on the timeline of such a move and have in recent days said they would rather remain part of Denmark than join the United States.

The protests in Denmark were organised by Greenlandic groups in cooperation with ActionAid Denmark, an NGO.

"We demand respect for the Danish Realm and for Greenland's right to self-determination," said Camilla Siezing, chair of Inuit, the Joint Association of Greenlandic Local Associations in Denmark.

Some 17,000 Greenlanders live in Denmark, according to Danish authorities.

Just 17% of Americans approve of President Donald Trump's efforts to acquire Greenland, and large majorities of Democrats and Republicans oppose using military force to annex the island, a found.

Museveni, 81, won 71.65 percent of the vote in Thursday's election, the Electoral Commission said, amid reports of at least 10 deaths and intimidation of the opposition and civil society.

His victory allows him to extend his 40-year rule of the East African country.

He defeated opposition leader Bobi Wine , 43, a former singer-turned-politician who won 24.72 percent and said he was in hiding on Saturday after a raid by security forces on his home.

Wine has faced relentless pressure since entering politics, including multiple arrests before his first run for the presidency in 2021.

He stated his "complete rejection of the fake results" and said he was on the run after the raid on his home on Friday night.

"I want to confirm that I managed to escape from them," Wine posted on X on Saturday. "Currently, I am not at home, although my wife and other family members remain under house arrest."

"I know that these criminals are looking for me everywhere and I am trying my best to keep safe," he added.

There was a heavy police presence around the capital, Kampala, AFP journalists saw, as security forces sought to prevent the sort of protests that have hit neighbouring Kenya and Tanzania in recent months.

Electoral officials also face questions about the failure of biometric voter identification machines on Thursday, which caused delays in the start of voting in urban areas – including the capital, Kampala – that are opposition strongholds.

After the machines failed, in a blow to pro-democracy activists who have long demanded their use to curb rigging, polling officials used manual registers of voters. The failure of the machines is likely to be the basis for any legal challenges to the official result.

Police denied they had raided Wine's home but said they had "controlled access in areas we feel are security hotspots", adding they believed the opposition leader was still at home.

"We have not necessarily denied people accessing him but we cannot tolerate instances where people use his residence to gather and ... incite violence," police spokesman Kituuma Rusoke told reporters.

A stall-owner near Wine's home, 29-year-old Prince Jerard, told AFP he had heard a drone and helicopter at the residence the previous night, and saw numerous security officials.

"Many people have left (the area)," he said. "We have a lot of fear."

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, has emerged as the main challenger to Museveni in recent years, styling himself the "ghetto president" after the Kampala slum areas where he grew up.

He has accused the government of "massive ballot stuffing" and attacking several of his party officials under cover of the internet blackout, which was imposed ahead of the polls and remained in place on Saturday.

African election observers said on Saturday they saw no evidence of ballot stuffing but denounced "reports of intimidation, arrest and abductions" targeting the opposition and civil society.

This "instilled fear and eroded public trust in the electoral process", former Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan told reporters in Kampala.

He was representing election observers from the African Union , as well as regional bodies COMESA and IGAD for east and southern Africa.

Jonathan said the shutdown of the internet "disrupted effective observation" and "increased suspicion" but that the overall conduct of the polls on election day was "peaceful".

Museveni's ruling party, the National Resistance Movement, also had a commanding lead in parliamentary seats, according to provisional results. Ballots were still being counted.

Analysts have long viewed the election as a formality.

Museveni, a former guerrilla fighter who seized power in 1986, has total control over the state and security apparatus, and has ruthlessly crushed any challenger during his rule.

The other major opposition figure, Kizza Besigye, who ran four times against Museveni, was abducted in Kenya in 2024 and brought back to a military court in Uganda for a treason trial that is ongoing.

There were reports of election-related violence against the opposition.

Muwanga Kivumbi, member of parliament for Wine's party in the Butambala area of central Uganda, told AFP's Nairobi office by phone that security forces had killed 10 of his campaign agents after storming his home.

Police gave a different account, saying an "unspecified number" of people had been "put out of action" when opposition members planned to overrun and burn down a local tally centre and police station.

Yusuf Serunkuma, an academic and columnist for the local Observer newspaper, told the Associated Press on Saturday that Wine “didn’t stand a chance” against the authoritarian Museveni.

“He has quite successfully emasculated the opposition,” Serunkuma said of Museveni. “You would have to credit him for that.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:23:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9bc1677e-f39a-11f0-b7ab-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Yoweri-Museveni.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘Playing straight into Russia’s hands’: Expert warns Trump’s Greenland push strains NATO</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/playing-straight-into-russia-s-hands-expert-warns-trump-s-greenland-push-strains-nato</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 14:47:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/de6605c2-f3ad-11f0-a177-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260117-140325-141040-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia searching for missing surveillance plane with 11 onboard</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/indonesia-searching-missing-surveillance-plane-with-11-onboard-2026-01-17/</link><description>Jan 17 (Reuters) - Indonesian rescuers were searching on Saturday for an ATR 42-500 fisheries surveillance aircraft that went missing with 11 people on board, officials said.

The Indonesia Air Transport plane lost contact with air traffic control at about 1:30 p.m. (0530 GMT) around Maros region in South Sulawesi province, Andi Sultan, an official at the local rescue agency, told Reuters.

The aircraft had been heading to Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi, after departing from Yogyakarta province before contact was lost, Sultan said.

There were eight crew and three passengers on board, he added.

Around 400 personnel, including military and police units, were deployed to search for the plane and those on board, though the effort was being hampered by bad weather, Sultan said. He declined to comment on the possible cause of the incident.

"We suspect the plane came down near the peak of Mount Bulusaraung. We have deployed our personnel there," he said.

The plane had been chartered by Indonesia's Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries, ministry official Pung Nugroho Saksono told state news agency Antara.

Marine Affairs and Fisheries Minister Sakti Wahyu Trenggono said the three passengers were ministry staff conducting air surveillance on fisheries.

The ATR 42‑500 is a regional turboprop aircraft capable of carrying between 42 and 50 passengers.

According to unconfirmed Flightradar24 data, an aircraft matching the description was flying eastward over the Java Sea at about 11,000 feet before rapidly losing altitude and dropping off tracking systems.

He has imposed double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country on Earth as well as singling out specific industries, such as steel and autos, for levies of their own.

Critics warn raising tariffs to levels not seen since the Great Depression risks fuelling inflation and undermining US industries.

Canada broke with the United States on Friday by slashing its 100 percent import tax on Chinese electric vehicles in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products, particularly canola seeds.

“It’s a huge declaration of realignment in Canada’s economic relations,” said Edward Alden, who studies trade issues as senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

“The economic threat from the United States is now perceived by Canadians as far bigger than the economic threat from China . So this is a big deal.’’

Canada has repeatedly been the target of Trump’s wrath. In October, for instance, he said he was imposing a 10 percent tariff on Canadian imports as a reprisal for Ontario’s provincial government airing an advertisement that criticised the president’s go-to diplomatic tariff tool. He didn’t follow through on the increase, but tariffs on on some key Canadian sectors like steel and aluminium remain.

The deal with China is a potentially perilous one for Canada’s prime minister, Mark Carney , who risks retribution from Trump ahead of negotiations over the renewal of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which is crucial to Canadian businesses.

But Canada is not alone in looking for alternatives to America’s massive market as Trump slaps huge tariffs on imports in an attempt to strong-arm other countries into moving production to the United States.

The European Union is expected to formally sign a trade pact Saturday with the South American alliance known as Mercosur , which includes the region’s two biggest economies, Brazil and Argentina . The EU is also pursuing a trade deal with India .

China, pounded by US tariffs since Trump’s first term, has also diversified its exports away from the world’s biggest economy to markets such as Europe and Southeast Asia.

It seems to be working. China’s trade surplus with the rest of the world surged to a record $1.2 trillion in 2025, the Chinese government reported Wednesday, despite tumbling exports to the US.

Trump says tariffs will raise money for the US Treasury, protect American industries and bring investment into the United States. On Thursday, Taiwan agreed to invest $250 billion in the United States in return for Trump reducing the tariff on its products to 15 percent from 20 percent.

But the US president’s use of tariffs has often been arbitrary and unpredictable.

He targeted Brazil, for instance, for prosecuting his ally, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro . On Friday, he again threatened to slap tariffs on countries that don’t support his efforts to wrest control of Greenland from Denmark .

Friday’s deal in Beijing marks a turnabout in Canadian policy.

In 2024, Canada had followed the US lead by imposing 100 percent tariffs on EVs from China, reflecting fears that inexpensive Chinese cars would overwhelm domestic North American automakers.

But the deal with China delivers benefits to Canada.

First, its canola farmers need export markets, and this pact lowers China’s tariff on canola from 84 percent to 15 percent. Canola farmers are hailing Canada’s new trade deal with China as great news that could restore exports for the major crop.

Second, the Trump administration, favouring fossil fuels over green energy, “is actively hostile to EV production in North America’’, said economist Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

America’s opposition “threatens to make the North American [auto] industry obsolete in the future, as China moves ahead with rapid quality improvements in batteries and electronics for EVs", she said.

“China’s strengths in electric vehicle sector are undeniable,” Carney said Friday. “China produces some of the most affordable and efficient energy-efficient vehicles in the world. And in order for Canada to build our own competitive EV sector, we need to learn from innovative partners, access their supply chains, and increase local demand.’’

But Carney’s economic rapprochement with Beijing amounts to a gamble.

“This was an extraordinarily difficult thing for Carney to do,’’ Alden said. “Relations between Canada and China have been extremely fraught.’’

In 2018, China detained two Canadians in retaliation for Canada arresting an executive of the Chinese tech firm Huawei at the request of the United States. All three were released in a 2021 swap. Canada also launched an investigation three years ago into whether the Chinese interfered in Canadian elections in 2019 and 2021.

The deal has drawn criticism already for exposing Canadian autoworkers to competition from low-price Chinese EVs. Ontario Premier Doug Ford, leading the province that is the centre of Canadian auto production, blasted the deal.

“Make no mistake: China now has a foothold in the Canadian market and will use it to their full advantage at the expense of Canadian workers,” Ford posted on social media. “Worse, by lowering tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles this lopsided deal risks closing the door on Canadian automakers to the American market, our largest export destination.”

In response to the criticism, Carney noted that the deal is limited. China can only export 49,000 EVs to Canada at the reduced 6.1 percent tariff rate, rising to about 70,000 in five years.

But the biggest risk to Canada comes from its prickly southern neighbour.

The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) – a regional trade pact that allows many goods to cross North American borders duty free – comes up for renewal this year. Trump is almost sure to demand changes meant to shift manufacturing to the United States and might threaten to pull out of the deal altogether, especially if he is inclined to punish Carney for reversing his policy with China.

That’s a scary thought for Canada, which sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States.

The Canada-China deal Friday “will make the talks more complicated", said William Reinsch, a former US trade official now with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

"Trump will not be pleased with the Canadian action, will probably take some retaliatory measure, probably against the Canadian auto industry , and will certainly make it an issue in the USMCA talks.’’

On Friday anyway, Trump commended Carney: “If you can get a deal with China, you should do that.″ And Carney noted that the China deal is preliminary, potentially giving him flexibility to seek changes if necessary to head off a conflict with the US.

He also might be counting on getting a little help from US businesses.

American automakers depend on a network of plants across the US, Canada and Mexico and will fight hard to defend the USMCA. American farmers also rely on the pact for access to the Mexican and Canadian markets. And US tech companies like the way it liberalised digital trade in North America.

For now, Lovely said, Carney’s deal with China, sends “a big signal that Canada is looking to other partners and has options that would allow it to walk away from the USMCA before it makes humiliating compromises to serve only American interests".</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 15:43:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/911a3176-f3ad-11f0-9269-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-16T142317Z-2053981697-RC282JAAW1XS-RTRMADP-3-CHINA-CANADA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian troops clash with Kurdish forces as both sides trade blame for breaking withdrawal deal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260117-syrian-troops-clash-kurdish-forces-as-sides-trade-blame-breaking-withdrawal-deal</link><description>Syrian troops swept through towns in the country's north on Saturday following an agreed withdrawal by Kurdish fighters there , but clashes erupted when the army kept up its advance deeper into Kurdish-held territory.

For days, Syrian troops had amassed around a cluster of villages that lie just west of ​the winding Euphrates River and had called on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) stationed there to redeploy their forces on the opposite bank of the river.

Overnight, SDF ‍head Mazloum Abdi said his forces would withdraw early on Saturday morning as a gesture of goodwill, leaving the river as a front line between Syrian government troops to its west and Kurdish forces to its east.

But clashes broke out ​in some towns and oil fields on Saturday as the SDF and Syria 's army accused each other of violating the agreement, with Kurdish ​authorities saying Syrian troops were pushing into towns not included in the withdrawal deal.

Kurdish authorities in northern Syria ordered a curfew for the Raqqa region "until further notice", as government forces advanced and threatened to bomb sites in the area.

After taking control of territory outside Aleppo city earlier Saturday, the army designated a swathe of Kurdish-held territory in Raqqa province southwest of the Euphrates River, including the city of Tabqa, a "closed military zone".

In statements carried on state media, it announced it would target what it said were several military sites in the area – one of them near Raqqa city.

Syrian troops moved relatively smoothly into the main town of Deir Hafer and surrounding villages whose residents are predominantly Arab, according to statements from the military.

Some residents had left in recent days through a humanitarian corridor set up by Syria's army but those who stayed celebrated the army's arrival.

"It happened with the least amount of losses. There's been enough blood in this country, Syria. We have sacrificed and lost enough – people are tired of it," Hussein al-Khalaf, a resident of Deir Hafer, told Reuters.

SDF forces had withdrawn east, some on foot, towards the flashpoint town of Tabqa – downstream but still on the western side of the river, according to a Reuters reporter in the ‍area.

But when Syria's army announced it was aiming to capture Tabqa next, the SDF said it wasn't part of the original deal and that it would fight to keep the town, as well as oil fields in its vicinity.

Syria's army ​said four of its troops had been killed in attacks by Kurdish militants, and the SDF said some of its own fighters had been killed, but did not give a number.

US-led coalition planes flew over the flashpoint towns, releasing warning flares, according to a Syrian security source.

In a bid to end the fighting, ‌US envoy Tom Barrack travelled to Erbil in northern Iraq on Saturday to meet with both Abdi and Iraqi Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani, according to two Kurdish sources. There was no immediate comment from Barrack's spokesperson.

France 's President Emmanuel Macron and the president of Iraqi Kurdistan , Nechirvan Barzani, in telephone talks on Saturday urged a cessation of fighting in Syria, the French presidency said.

They "called on all parties for an immediate de-escalation and a permanent ceasefire", it said, after fighting between Syrian Kurdish forces and government troops in the country's north.

Weeks of tensions between Syrian troops and the SDF have deepened the ‍fault-line between the government of President Ahmed al-Sharaa , who has vowed to reunify the fractured country after 14 years of war, and local Kurdish authorities wary of his Islamist-led administration.

The two sides engaged in months of talks last year to integrate Kurdish-run military and civilian bodies into Syrian state institutions by the end of 2025, insisting repeatedly that they wanted to resolve disputes diplomatically.

But after the deadline passed with little progress, clashes broke out earlier this month in the northern city of Aleppo and ended with a withdrawal of Kurdish fighters.

Syrian troops then amassed around towns in the north and east to pressure Kurdish authorities into making concessions in the deadlocked talks with Damascus.

Kurdish authorities still hold key Arab-majority areas in the country's east, including some of Syria's largest oil ‍and gas fields. Arab tribal leaders in SDF-held territory have told Reuters they are ready to take up arms against the Kurdish force if Syria's army issues orders to do so.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain - all already subject to tariffs imposed by Trump.

Those tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1 and would continue until a deal was reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote.

The president has repeatedly said Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and large mineral deposits, and has not ruled out using force to take it. European nations this week sent military personnel to the island at Denmark's request.

"These Countries, who are playing this very dangerous game, have put a level of risk in play that is not tenable or sustainable," Trump wrote.

"The United States of America is immediately open to negotiation with Denmark and/or any of these Countries that have put so much at risk, despite all that we have done for them, including maximum protection, over so many decades," he said.

Protesters in Denmark and Greenland demonstrated on Saturday against Trump's demands and called for it to be left to determine its own future.

Prominent European Union countries have backed Denmark, warning that the U.S. military seizure of a territory in NATO could collapse the military alliance that Washington leads. Britain has also given its support.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 17:40:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DTINOUR3IRPOVCJSDAHLXRA76Q.jpg?auth=afc70aecd9f7e3879f4c7e449d683429a7c4d6183455359e914b32e8d8c53f66&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU and Mercosur sign trade deal after 25 years of negotiations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/eu-mercosur-sign-trade-deal-after-25-years-negotiations-2026-01-17/</link><description>ASUNCION, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Top officials from the EU and the South American bloc Mercosur signed a free trade agreement on Saturday in Paraguay, paving the way for the European Union's largest ever trade accord after 25 years of negotiations.

The agreement, designed to lower tariffs and boost trade between the two regions, must now gain the consent of the European Parliament and be ratified by legislatures of Mercosur members Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa joined the presidents of Mercosur countries at Saturday's ceremony, with the exception of Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who sent his foreign minister.

The deal was signed after receiving the green light from most European nations last week, despite concerns from farmer and environmental groups, who fear a surge of inexpensive South American imports and increased deforestation.

Von der Leyen, who met with Lula before heading to Asuncion for the signing, said the deal would create the largest free trade zone in the world.

"This agreement sends a very strong message to the world. It reflects a clear and deliberate choice. We choose fair trade over tariffs. We choose a productive, long-term partnership over isolation," she said on Saturday.

Trade between the two blocs, which encompasses a market of 700 million people, reached a value of 111 billion euros in 2024. European Union exports mainly consist of machinery, chemical products, and transport equipment, whereas Mercosur's exports are concentrated in agricultural goods, minerals, wood pulp, and paper.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 17:41:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PRWYY4ZS2RL7ZG55CP3KGIU7ME.jpg?auth=18bc91d16e54844f6685501ad2414ad99c48103c2f5e62c01f143cb72c84ceb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel says US Gaza executive board composition against its policy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-says-us-gaza-executive-board-composition-against-its-policy-2026-01-17/</link><description>TEL AVIV, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said on Saturday that this week's Trump administration announcement on the composition of a Gaza executive board was not coordinated with Israel and ran counter to government policy.

It said Foreign Minister Gideon Saar would raise the issue with U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.

The statement did not specify what part of the board's composition contradicted Israeli policy. An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment.

The board, unveiled by the White House on Friday, includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan. Israel has repeatedly opposed any Turkish role in Gaza.

Other members of the executive board include Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process; an Israeli‑Cypriot billionaire; and a minister from the United Arab Emirates, which established relations with Israel in 2020.

Washington this week also announced the start of the second phase of President Donald Trump's plan, announced in September, to end the war in Gaza. This includes creating a transitional technocratic Palestinian administration in the enclave.

The first members of the so-called Board of Peace - to be chaired by Trump and tasked with supervising Gaza's temporary governance - were also named. Members include Rubio, billionaire developer Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 17:41:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IXV2BANUPBIEZL3YQTQBKMRJJE.jpg?auth=39cebb0d26d453b1222b1338725333e894c3aeb6707ae27a4b251ff14a7dc1ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq takes full control of air base after US withdrawal, defence ministry says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraq-takes-full-control-air-base-after-us-withdrawal-defence-ministry-says-2026-01-17/</link><description>BAGHDAD, Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. forces have withdrawn from Iraq's Ain al-Asad Airbase, which housed U.S.-led forces in Western Iraq, and the Iraqi army has assumed full control, the Iraqi defence ministry said on Saturday.

In 2024, Washington and Baghdad reached an understanding , opens new tab on plans for the withdrawal of U.S.-led coalition forces from Iraq and a move towards a bilateral security relationship.

Ain al-Asad has hosted U.S. and coalition troops for years and has been repeatedly targeted by Iran-backed armed groups during periods of heightened regional tensions, including after the 2020 U.S. killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.

An Iraqi army colonel confirmed the U.S. forces withdrawal from the base, saying there were a few soldiers remaining due to some logistical issues. He did not give further details for security reasons.

It was not immediately clear when the withdrawal started, but the initial plan stipulated that hundreds of troops would leave by September 2025, with the rest departing by the end of 2026.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 18:29:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SBO25MQYB5MYFLYIMWT5JFPIJY.jpg?auth=61cf0a34811952a18f4b72674f99f6c38a2965737183dd4ba74ee6c45b52cd69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Minneapolis keeps guard over schools amid ICE arrests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/whistles-walkie-talkies-minneapolis-keeps-guard-over-schools-amid-ice-arrests-2026-01-17/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Peter Brown's gray mustache and beard were matted with ice as he stood watch on a frigid Friday afternoon outside Green Central Elementary, not far from where a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent fatally shot Renee Good last week.

Wearing a neon green vest and equipped with a whistle and walkie-talkie, Brown, an 81-year-old retired lawyer who lives nearby, kept his head on a swivel. His eyes were taking in each passing car and pedestrian near the campus as he stood ready to sound the alarm should federal immigration personnel approach the school, which teaches in English and Spanish and is around the corner from the spot where Good died.

"I never did like bullies, and that's what the federal government has become," Brown said, explaining why an octogenarian stood outside for four hours in -2 degrees Fahrenheit with wind chill (-19 Celsius). "What's happening in my city is nothing more than authoritarian intimidation, and me and my neighbors are not going to put up with it."

The Trump administration has deployed about 3,000 federal agents across the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, making it the latest region targeted by the president's mass deportation program . People who normally might be organizing parent-teacher association meetings are arranging security patrols at their kids' schools to watch for immigration agents.

Some parents not on patrol are escorting foreign-born teachers or staff members, driving them to and from their homes and schools to make them feel safer. Others are delivering groceries and prescription medicines to immigrant families who are too afraid to leave their homes or send their kids to class.

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat representing Minnesota, said on Friday she had met with school principals from her state "and heard horror stories of kids and parents 'under siege' by ICE."

"Little kids scared. Dangerous encounters. This is no longer about a fraud investigation," Klobuchar wrote on social media, as she urged residents to remain peaceful.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, said this week more than 2,500 people have been arrested during the effort that officials have dubbed Operation Metro Surge. DHS has repeatedly said its agents are not targeting schools.

“ICE is not going to schools to arrest children — we are protecting children," said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin in a statement. "Criminals are no longer able to hide in America’s schools to avoid arrest. The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement and instead trusts them to use common sense. If a dangerous illegal alien felon were to flee into a school, or a child sex offender is working as an employee, there may be a situation where an arrest is made to protect public safety. But this has not happened."

But parents and school leaders say otherwise.

A spokesperson for Saint Paul Public Schools said in a statement that two of its contracted student transportation vans were pulled over by ICE agents this week. Several schools and daycare centers have emailed parents to notify them of teachers and staff who have been detained, according to school leaders and parents.

Schools have notified the public that some parents have been detained at bus stops after dropping off kids. Border Patrol agents clashed with protesters on the grounds of Roosevelt High School in Minneapolis as classes ended, just a few hours after Good was shot and killed. DHS said the clash followed agents' pursuit of someone who had rammed one of their vehicles several miles away and fled to the school grounds.

Several school districts — including those in Minneapolis and St. Paul, the state's two largest — have cancelled classes some days and are allowing students to learn online instead of attending classes in person for the next several weeks in response to the immigration operations.

“Many families in my area are afraid to send their kids to school because ICE is staking out our bus stops,” state Representative Carlie Kotyza-Witthuhn, a Democrat and co-chair of the Minnesota House of Representatives' Children and Families Finance and Policy Committee, told the Star Tribune newspaper.

Nate Byrne, a spokesperson for Kids Count on Us, a coalition of 500 community-based childcare centers in Minnesota, said it is receiving daily reports about ICE officers on or near childcare center grounds, and that such centers in immigrant-heavy neighborhoods have seen a 50% reduction in attendance.

Kids Count on Us has received reports of childcare workers taken into ICE custody, Byrne said, though he did not have specific figures.

"Parents who are not fearful of being detained by ICE — typically because they are white — are forming teams to patrol outside their childcare centers during drop-off and pick-up and when staff need to come and go," Byrne said. "Parents who are fearful of being detained by ICE due to the color of their skin are being extremely cautious."

St. Paul parent Kelly, who spoke on the condition that her last name not be used, citing fears of retribution from the federal government, said she was helping deliver food to immigrant families that attend her children's school but were afraid to leave their homes. Parents are also raising money to help pay rent for the families across the metro area, as the parents are missing work, according to Kelly and other parents.

Kelly, who was attending a Friday night protest against ICE with her husband and two children, ages 6 and 9, said she was bewildered by what has become of her city amid the immigration raids. In years past, she volunteered for parent-teacher association events. Now, she carries a whistle everywhere she goes and said she is ready to confront federal agents if they approach her kids' school.

"There's no parenting handbook for this," Kelly said. "My parents never had to sit me down and explain that my classmates who are suddenly missing from school aren't there because their parents are afraid of being snatched by the government."</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 18:30:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VKEXBHJBABPE3MC3S5QN2KPNPY.jpg?auth=df979cd30aeb0582e974b0d1a46fb4f2ae5892cc1bffa0d1d72913f0d6f083ab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU and Mercosur sign landmark free trade deal after 25 years of negotiations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260117-eu-and-mercosur-sign-landmark-free-trade-deal-after-25-years-of-negotiations</link><description>Top officials from the EU and the South American bloc Mercosur signed a free trade agreement on Saturday in Paraguay , paving the way for ​the European Union 's largest ever trade accord after 25 years ‍of negotiations.

Although the accord eliminates more than 90 percent of tariffs on goods and services between the European and Mercosur markets, some tariffs will progressively be cut over 10-15 years and key farm products such as beef will be limited by strict quotas in a bid to assuage European farmers’ fears.

Those quotas, as well as safeguard measures and generous EU subsidies to cash-strapped farmers, pushed agricultural powerhouse Italy across the line earlier this month. France , however, remains opposed to the accord .

In creating one of the world’s largest free trade zones, the accord – pushed by South America 's renowned cattle-raising countries and Europe's industrial sectors craving new markets for cars and machines – brings together a market of more than 700 million consumers that accounts for a quarter of global gross domestic product.

A counter-protest organized by the People’s Action Coalition Against Trump is expected to take place nearby and clashes were feared, leading state authorities to put the Minneapolis National Guard on alert to respond if needed, officials said. Minneapolis police in SWAT gear boarded buses and armored carriers and headed downtown, where the protests were expected to kick off around 1 p.m. local time.

Jake Lang, one of more than 1,500 people pardoned by President Donald Trump after their criminal convictions related to the January 6 event, said his “anti-fraud” march would begin at Minneapolis City Hall, where he vowed to burn copies of the Koran and lead people on a march for about two miles to the Cedar Riverside neighborhood of Minneapolis, where many Somali immigrants live.

Residents vowed to blockade the neighborhood and not let the marchers into the area.

Trump has repeatedly invoked a scandal around the theft of federal funds intended for social-welfare programs in Minnesota as a rationale for sending thousands of immigration enforcement agents into Minnesota.

Lang, who has made anti-Muslim and antisemitic comments, has said he wants to secure the United States for white Christians. He has been present at small pro-ICE rallies in Minneapolis this week.

Some 3,000 agents from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Border Patrol agents have descended on Minneapolis and St. Paul in recent weeks. An ICE agent fatally shot Good , a U.S. citizen and mother of three, behind the wheel of her car on January 7, igniting large and heated protests against Trump’s deportation efforts in the metro area.

The situation has set Minnesota’s Democratic leadership at odds with Trump, whose Justice Department has opened an investigation into Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 19:17:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/43QNGYGG3JM7RJCSZSJHJEMY5Q.jpg?auth=063abf624fd0874dae7852cec43a1b7e8aa85f1655fc0fba638d8fdf11b6b757&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron says Trump tariff threat over Greenland unacceptable</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/macron-says-trump-tariff-threat-over-greenland-unacceptable-2026-01-17/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - France's President Emmanuel Macron said on Saturday that the threat of tariffs by U.S. President Donald Trump over Greenland was unacceptable and that if they were confirmed Europe would respond in a coordinated manner.

The Justice Department since December has been releasing caches of documents tied to its investigations of Epstein. But U.S. Representatives Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie have criticized the department's slow pace.

Khanna, a California Democrat, and Massie, a Kentucky Republican, last week said they asked U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmayer to permit them to file a brief that would argue for the appointment of a special master and independent monitor, given the Justice Department's failure to fully comply with a law that requires the DOJ to release all records related to Epstein by December 19.

In a six-page letter filed on Friday to U.S. District Court Judge Paul Engelmayer on Friday, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche argued that Khanna and Thomas Massie are not parties to the U.S. v. Ghislaine Maxwell case involving Epstein and should not be allowed to file a friend of the court request in the matter.

"Representatives Khanna and Massie do not have standing, their stated objectives are in-consistent with the role of an amicus as well as the role of the Court, and, in any event, there is no authority permitting the Court to grant the Representatives the relief they improperly seek," the DOJ said in the letter signed by Jay Clayton, US attorney for the Southern District of New York.

Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence for helping Epstein sexually abuse underage girls.

The Justice Department said at the end of 2025 that it had 5.2 million pages of Epstein files left to review and needs 400 lawyers from four different department offices to help with the process through late January.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 19:38:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ILFJKU4RBI2JEN73NHPR7JWBE.jpg?auth=9870531b243b02eb90743d6cbd5cb89d9c1eb3be566a5196ab8c69edad16adf1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US kills al-Qaeda affiliate leader tied to December attack in Syria, Centcom says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-kills-al-qaeda-affiliate-leader-tied-december-attack-syria-centcom-says-2026-01-17/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 17 (Reuters) - U.S. military forces on Friday killed an al-Qaeda affiliate leader linked to an Islamic State attack on Americans in Syria last month , U.S. Central Command said in a statement on Saturday.

The demonstrations were sparked by anger over economic hardship that exploded into the biggest protests against the Islamic Republic in more than three years.

But demonstrations have subsided after the crackdown that rights groups say left thousands of people dead under an internet blackout that has lasted more than a week.

Schools were set to resume Sunday, the ISNA news agency said, following a one-week closure, with postponed university exams set to be held in a week.

Authorities have said demonstrations they condemn as "riots" had been controlled and calm returned, with state-aligned media reporting thousands of arrests.

"By God's grace, the Iranian nation must break the back of the seditionists just as it broke the back of the sedition," supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told supporters during a televised address.

"We do not intend to lead the country to war, but we will not spare domestic criminals," he added, saying "international criminals" were "worse".

He alleged that "agents ... murdered a few thousand people. They murdered some with the utmost inhumanity, meaning pure savagery" – seemingly his first admission that thousands had died.

Iranian authorities have blamed the latest wave of demonstrations on arch-foes the United States and Israel , saying they fuelled a "terrorist operation" that hijacked peaceful protests over the economy.

Trump, who backed and joined Israel's 12-day war against Iran in June, had repeatedly threatened new military action against Tehran if protesters were killed.

Khamenei on Saturday lashed out at Trump, accusing him of being "guilty for the casualties, damages and accusations he has levelled against the Iranian nation".

"This was an American conspiracy," he said, adding that "America's goal is to swallow Iran ... the goal is to put Iran back under military, political and economic domination".

In response, Trump called for an end to Khamenei’s nearly 40-year reign.

“The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people,” Trump told Politico in an interview Saturday. “His country is the worst place to live anywhere in the world because of poor leadership.”

“It’s time to look for new leadership in Iran," he added.

While Washington has appeared to have stepped back, the US president has said he has not ruled out military options and made clear he was keeping a close eye on whether any protesters were executed.

Trump on Friday had struck a more conciliatory tone, saying on his Truth Social platform that Iran had called off the executions of hundreds of protesters and said to the clerical state: "Thank you!"

Asked on state TV about Trump's comment, Tehran prosecutor Ali Salehi said the US president "always talks a lot of nonsense" and that the government's response had been "firm, dissuasive and swift" with many cases leading to indictments and sent to court.

Rights groups have estimated up to 20,000 people have been arrested. Security officials cited by the Tasnim news agency on Friday said around 3,000 people were arrested.

Iranian authorities said on Saturday that "a 32-member network of the Bahai espionage cult who were active in the riots and acts of vandalism were identified and 12 main agents were arrested and 13 were summoned," according to Tasnim.

The Bahais, Iran's biggest non-Muslim religious minority, regularly experience persecution and the Islamic Republic has accused its members of being spies linked to Israel.

Alarm has mounted over the reported death toll during the crackdown, as verifying cases remains difficult under severe internet restrictions.

Eyewitnesses who left Iran after the protests told AFP of coming under fire and hearing numerous gunshots during protests.

Kiarash, who gave only his first name for security reasons, was fired on during protests on January 10 and said he saw thousands of bodies at a mortuary in Tehran.

"I saw the blood ... Thousands of people and thousands of dead bodies" of people "asking for their rights", he told AFP from Germany .

Norway-based rights group Iran Human Rights (IHR) says 3,428 protesters have been verified to have been killed by security forces, but warns the actual toll could be several times higher.

Other estimates place the death toll at more than 5,000 – and possibly as high as 20,000, IHR said.

The opposition Iran International channel based outside the country has said at least 12,000 people were killed during the protests, citing senior government and security sources.

Monitor Netblocks said on Saturday "internet connectivity continues to flatline in Iran despite a minor short-lived bump in access earlier today, when new reports of atrocities emerged".

People in Iran were reportedly again able to send text messages within the country and to outside numbers but were still often unable to receive texts from those abroad.

Rights groups say there have been no verifiable reports of protests in recent days and videos circulating on social media have shown a heavy security presence in some areas.

But Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of the shah ousted in the 1979 Islamic revolution, took to social media on Friday to call for Iranians to protest again on Saturday and Sunday evening.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 21:40:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b49106c6-f3ac-11f0-b3e8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/0b7dbc2ec8eda006799c1c1c4e6bf06634e9d54a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU warns of 'dangerous downward spiral'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-warns-downward-spiral-after-trump-threatens-tariffs-over-greenland-2026-01-17/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 17 (Reuters) - European Union leaders on Saturday warned of a "dangerous downward spiral" over U.S. President Donald Trump's vow to implement increasing tariffs on European allies until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.

"Tariffs would undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral. Europe will remain united, coordinated, and committed to upholding its sovereignty," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President Antonio Costa said in posts on X.

The bloc's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said tariffs would hurt prosperity on both sides of the Atlantic, while distracting the EU from its "core task" of ending Russia's war in Ukraine.

"China and Russia must be having a field day. They are the ones who benefit from divisions among allies," Kallas said on X.

"Tariffs risk making Europe and the United States poorer and undermine our shared prosperity. If Greenland’s security is at risk, we can address this inside NATO."

Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 countries will convene on Sunday for an emergency meeting to discuss their response to the tariff threat.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:22:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/35TURRJKS5OOPAB6Q2NLOWITQA.jpg?auth=9357ab30f7046186c9c8ae998283aae191725346ad13be364fabcc03d3224df7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'The goal is to destroy the Syrian Democratic Forces': Clashes break out between army and Kurds</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/the-goal-is-to-destroy-the-syrian-democratic-forces-clashes-break-out-between-army-and-kurds</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:23:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9913ee94-f3ee-11f0-93b4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260117-210522-210813-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A lot of contradictory information': Syrian and Kurdish forces clash along the Euphrates River</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/a-lot-of-contradictory-information-syrian-and-kurdish-forces-clash-along-the-euphrates-river</link><description /><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:23:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e08be9d0-f3ed-11f0-9e81-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260117-210232-210521-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rights group says 139 political prisoners released in Venezuela since January</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rights-group-says-139-political-prisoners-released-venezuela-since-january-2026-01-17/</link><description>Jan 17 (Reuters) - Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal said on Saturday that it has confirmed the release of 139 political prisoners in Venezuela since January 8.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 22:45:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D2GMANNVEZP4JKTHF2UAXBFMWQ.jpg?auth=46f9d60181c3849af60b51054cbd9b5ca917b21eb50220137b2804ab1a08c16d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guatemalan inmates riot at three prisons, taking 46 people hostage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/guatemalan-inmates-riot-three-prisons-taking-46-people-hostage-2026-01-17/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Jan 17 (Reuters) - Inmates at three prisons in Guatemala rioted on Saturday and took at least 46 people hostage, mostly guards but also a psychologist, officials said.

So far, there have been no reported deaths or injuries among the hostages, Interior Minister Marco Antonio Villeda said at a press conference.

Villeda said prisoners coordinated riots at three prisons, which he alleged were organized by the Barrio 18 gang, which was rioting because its leader is seeking a transfer to another facility to gain better conditions and special treatment.

“I am not going to make any deals with any terrorist group, I will not give in to this blackmail, and I will not restore their privileges in exchange for them stopping their actions,” Villeda added.

While hostage situations involving prison guards have occurred previously in Guatemala, the current number of hostages is notably higher than in past incidents.

The ministry said security forces, including members of the army, are maintaining full perimeter control and working to restore order and ensure the safety of surrounding areas.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 23:22:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heavy rains in eastern Australia spark flash floods, 20 rescued</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/heavy-rains-eastern-australia-spark-flash-floods-20-rescued-2026-01-17/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Australian authorities on Sunday said 20 people were rescued from floodwaters in the eastern state of New South Wales after torrential rains sparked warnings for residents to move to higher ground.

In state capital Sydney, Australia's largest city, residents and holidaymakers were evacuated late on Saturday after dangerous flooding hit the low-lying suburb of Narrabeen, authorities said.

Emergency crews responded to more than 1,400 incidents across the state since the rain hit on Saturday, the authorities said, adding that most rescues related to people driving through floodwaters.

"There has been a lot of flash flooding which has closed roads, and we anticipate some may remain closed for some time," State Emergency Services Assistant Commissioner Sonya Oyston said in a statement.

The authorities warned more thunderstorms were possible south of Sydney on Sunday. Some 72.4 mm (2.8 inches) of rain fell on Sydney's northern fringe in 2 hours on Sunday morning, the nation's weather forecaster said.

On Saturday, a woman died after being hit by a falling tree branch near Wollongong, about 66km (41 miles) south of Sydney, amid the wild weather, the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.</description><pubDate>Sat, 17 Jan 2026 23:43:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump wants nations to pay $1 billion to stay on his peace board, report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-wants-nations-pay-1-billion-stay-his-peace-board-report-says-2026-01-17/</link><description>Jan 17 (Reuters) - The Trump administration wants nations to pay $1 billion to stay on his peace board, Bloomberg News reported on Saturday, citing a draft charter.

The ATR 42-500 turboprop owned by aviation group Indonesia Air Transport lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday at about 1:30 p.m. local time (0530 GMT) around the Maros region in South Sulawesi.

There were eight crew members and three passengers on board the plane, which was chartered by Indonesia's Marine Affairs and Fisheries Ministry to conduct air surveillance on fisheries. The passengers were ministry staff members.

The head of South Sulawesi's rescue agency, Muhammad Arif Anwar, said on local television that after finding the wreckage, the rescuers would deploy 1,200 personnel to search for the missing passengers and crew.

"Our priority is to search for the victims, and we hope that there are some that we can evacuate safely," he said.

The aircraft had been heading to Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi, after departing from Yogyakarta province before contact was lost.

On Sunday morning, local rescuers found the wreckage in different locations around Mount Bulusaraung in the Maros region, said Andi Sultan, an official at South Sulawesi's rescue agency. The mountain is roughly 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of the sprawling island nation's capital, Jakarta.

"Our helicopter crews have seen the debris of the plane's window at 7:46 a.m.," Sultan told reporters.

"And around 7:49 a.m., we discovered large parts of the aircraft, suspected to be the fuselage of the plane," he said, adding the tail of the plane was also seen at the bottom of the mountain slope.

Rescuers have been deployed to the locations where the wreckage was discovered, Sultan said, adding the search was hampered by thick fog and mountainous terrain.

In video footage shared by the rescue agency, a window of the plane was found scattered on the mountain with thick fog and strong wind around it.

Sultan said Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee would lead an investigation into the crash. The cause remains unclear, and experts say most accidents are caused by a combination of factors.

The ATR 42‑500, manufactured by Franco-Italian planemaker ATR (AIR.PA) , opens new tab , (LDOF.MI) , opens new tab , is a regional turboprop aircraft capable of carrying between 42 and 50 passengers.

Flight tracking website Flightradar24 said on X that the plane was flying over the ocean at a low altitude so its tracking coverage was limited, and the last signal was received at 0420 GMT about 20 km northeast of Makassar airport.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 04:41:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pentagon readies 1,500 soldiers to possibly deploy to Minnesota, Washington Post reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-readies-1500-soldiers-possibly-deploy-minnesota-washington-post-reports-2026-01-18/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - The U.S. Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty soldiers to prepare for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the Washington Post reported on Sunday, citing defense officials.

The Army placed the units on prepare-to-deploy orders in case violence in the state escalates, the Washington Post report said.

The move comes after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to use the Insurrection Act if officials in the state don't stop protesters from targeting immigration officials.

"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ACT," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday.

The government appeared to be extending its grip on Kurdish-run areas after President Ahmed al-Sharaa issued a decree declaring Kurdish a "national language" and granting the minority group official recognition.

The Kurds have said Friday's announcement fell short of their aspirations.

The army advanced after implementation of a March deal –  intended to integrate Kurdish forces into the state – stalled.

Government troops drove Kurdish forces from two Aleppo neighbourhoods last week and on Saturday took control of an area east of the city.

On Sunday, Damascus announced the capture of Tabqa city in the Raqa region.

"The Syrian army controls the strategic city of Tabqa in the Raqqa countryside, including the Euphrates Dam, which is the largest dam in Syria," Information Minister Hamza Almustafa said, according to the official SANA news agency.

An AFP correspondent in Deir Hafer, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) east of Aleppo city, saw several fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) leaving the town and residents returning under heavy army presence.

Syria's army said four soldiers had been killed, while Kurdish forces reported several fighters dead. Both sides traded blame for violating a withdrawal deal.

Kurdish authorities ordered a curfew in the Raqa region after the army designated a swathe of territory southwest of the Euphrates River a "closed military zone", warning it would target what it said were several military sites.

A SANA correspondent reported Sunday that the SDF blew up a bridge over the Euphrates in Raqa city, which lies on the eastern bank of the river.

Raqa city's water supply was also reportedly cut off. The city's media directorate accused the SDF of blowing up the main water pipes.

Deir Ezzor governor Ghassan Alsayed Ahmed said on social media that the SDF fired "rocket projectiles" at neighbourhoods in government-controlled territories in the city centre of Deir Ezzor, Almayadeen, and other areas.

The SDF, for its part, said "factions affiliated with the Damascus government attacked our forces' positions in the towns of Gharanij, Abu Hammam, Alkishkiyah, Aldhiban, and Altayyanah leading to fierce clashes between our forces and those factions, which are still ongoing".

The towns are on the east bank of the Euphrates, opposite Al-Mayadin, and lie between Deir Ezzor and the Iraqi border.

In eastern Syria, government forces also seized the Omar oil field – the country’s largest – and the Conoco gas field, three security sources said on Sunday.

On Friday, Syrian Kurdish leader and SDF chief Mazloum Abdi had committed to redeploying his forces from outside Aleppo to east of the Euphrates.

But the SDF said Saturday that Damascus had "violated the recent agreements and betrayed our forces", with clashes erupting with troops south of Tabqa.

The army urged the SDF to "immediately fulfil its announced commitments and fully withdraw" east of the river.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil‑rich north and northeast, areas captured during the civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.

US envoy Tom Barrack met Abdi in Erbil on Saturday, the presidency of Iraq's autonomous Kurdistan region said.

While Washington has long supported Kurdish forces, it has also backed Syria's new authorities.

US Central Command on Saturday urged Syrian government forces "to cease any offensive actions in the areas between Aleppo and al‑Tabqa".

France 's President Emmanuel Macron and Iraqi Kurdistan leader Nechirvan Barzani also called for de-escalation and a ceasefire.

Sharaa's announcement on Friday marked the first formal recognition of Kurdish rights since Syria's independence in 1946.

The decree stated that Kurds are "an essential and integral part" of Syria, where they have suffered decades of marginalisation.

It made Kurdish a "national language" and granted nationality to all Kurds – around 20 percent of whom were stripped of it under a controversial 1962 census.

The Kurdish administration in Syria's northeast said the decree was "a first step" but "does not satisfy the aspirations and hopes of the Syrian people.

In Qamishli, the main Kurdish city in the country's northeast, Shebal Ali, 35, told AFP that "we want constitutional recognition of the Kurdish people's rights".

Nanar Hawach, senior Syria analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the decree "offers cultural concessions while consolidating military control".

Also Saturday, the US military said a strike in northwest Syria had killed a militant linked to a deadly attack on three Americans last month.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 06:33:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ba4dbbd0-f3fd-11f0-84da-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/1acb04bfa1da9ee24c03341d2187f0ddb4cd6648.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pentagon readies 1,500 troops as Minnesota protests grow</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260118-pentagon-readies-1-500-troops-as-minnesota-protests-grow</link><description>The Pentagon has ordered about 1,500 active-duty US soldiers to prepare ⁠for a possible deployment to Minnesota, the site of widespread protests against the government's deportation drive, the Washington Post reported on Sunday.

The Pentagon and the White House did not ​immediately respond to requests from Reuters for comment.

President Donald Trump threatened on Thursday to use the Insurrection Act to deploy military forces if officials in the state do not stop protesters from targeting immigration officials after a surge in Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.

Tensions are high in Minneapolis, Minnesota's most populous city, after an ICE agent shot Renee ‍Good dead on January 7.

"If the corrupt politicians of Minnesota don’t obey the law and stop ​the professional agitators and insurrectionists from attacking the Patriots of I.C.E., who are only trying to do their job, I will institute the INSURRECTION ‌ACT," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post on Thursday.

The soldiers subject to deployment are assigned to two US Army ‍infantry battalions under the 11th Airborne Division, which is based in Alaska, the Post reported.

The Insurrection Act is a federal law that gives the president the power to deploy the military or federalise National Guard troops inside the US to quell domestic uprisings.

The law can be invoked when there are "unlawful obstructions, combinations or assemblages or ‍rebellion" against federal authority. If the president deems those conditions have been met, he may ‌use the ​armed forces to take actions "to enforce those laws or suppress the rebellion."</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 07:21:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/77db6b50-f437-11f0-b71c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2256797539.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish PM Sanchez says US invasion of Greenland 'would make Putin happiest man on earth'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spanish-pm-sanchez-says-us-invasion-greenland-would-make-putin-happiest-man-2026-01-18/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said a U.S. invasion of Greenland "would make Putin the happiest man on earth" in a newspaper interview published on Sunday.

Sanchez said any military action by the U.S. against Denmark's vast Arctic island would damage NATO and legitimize the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.

"If we focus on Greenland, I have to say that a U.S. invasion of that territory would make Vladimir Putin the happiest man in the world. Why? Because it would legitimize his attempted invasion of Ukraine," he said in an interview in La Vanguardia newspaper.

"If the United States were to use force, it would be the death knell for NATO. Putin would be doubly happy."

President Donald Trump on Saturday appeared to change tack over Greenland by vowing to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain — all already subject to tariffs imposed by Trump.

Those tariffs would increase to 25% on June 1 and would continue until a deal was reached for the U.S. to purchase Greenland, Trump wrote.

Trump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have insisted the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 07:41:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4FQ37XY4W5PLNPK4MVOK5EQWMA.jpg?auth=8728b16739d8e4fa92738f98cfa9f9d6b8dbff58f4d941c00acd6ea445d3e7b7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone strike cuts power supply in Russia-held parts of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/drone-strike-cuts-power-supply-russia-held-parts-ukraines-zaporizhzhia-region-2026-01-18/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 18 (Reuters) - More than 200,000 consumers in the Russian-held part of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region were left without electricity on Sunday, the Moscow-installed regional governor said, after a Ukrainian drone strike on Saturday.

In a statement posted on Telegram, Yevgeny Balitsky said that work was ongoing to restore the power supply, but that almost 400 settlements remain without electricity.

Temperatures are well below freezing throughout the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region, around 75% of which is controlled by Russia.

Russia has frequently bombarded Ukraine's power infrastructure throughout its nearly four-year war, causing rolling daily blackouts, and has also targeted heating systems this winter.

Separately, in the Caucasus mountains region of North Ossetia, two children and one adult were injured when a Ukrainian drone struck a residential building in the town of Beslan, the regional governor said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 08:51:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JO4TLZ7PPZOARJ43TXA3MNJBCM.jpg?auth=187a92cfc066dbbbaaa0871b50dd8e0b7541458896ff9651ffe47ae251a08549&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two killed, dozens wounded in mass Russian drone attack on Ukraine: Zelenskiy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/two-killed-dozens-wounded-mass-russian-drone-attack-ukraine-zelenskiy-2026-01-18/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Two people were killed and dozens wounded in a mass Russian drone attack on Ukraine overnight, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday.

Polls predict Andre Ventura, leader of the far-right Chega ("Enough") party, could top the first round but would lose round two, regardless of which of the other candidates he encounters there.

This would be the first time in four decades that a candidate has not won outright in the first-round ballot, which requires securing more than 50 percent of the vote.

Among the record 11 candidates standing, only five have a realistic chance of making it to the decisive vote on February 8 to succeed conservative incumbent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.

In addition to Ventura, 43, they are: Socialist Antonio Jose Seguro, 63; liberal European Parliament lawmaker Joao Cotrim Figueiredo, 64; right-wing government candidate Luis Marques Mendes, 68; and Henrique Gouveia e Melo, a retired admiral who led Portugal's Covid vaccination campaign.

Pollsters predict any of the four of Ventura's potential rivals would trounce him in a second-round vote.

Polling stations open at 8:00 am on Sunday and exit polls will be announced at 8:00 pm.

Chega won 22.8 percent of the vote and 60 seats in a general election last May, overtaking the Socialists to become the biggest opposition party.

The president of Portugal has no executive powers but can, in times of crisis, dissolve parliament, call elections or dismiss a prime minister.

Ventura sees Sunday's vote mainly as a test of his popularity, according to experts, who believe that he has his sights set on eventually running the country as prime minister.

"Andre Ventura is running to keep his voter base," said Antonio Costa Pinto, a political scientist at Lisbon University.

A stronger far right would add pressure on the minority government of right-winger Luis Marques Montenegro, which relies on Chega for support for the implementation of some of its policies.

"Another solid result for the far right would confirm its domination over the political landscape," Teneo, a consulting firm, said in a note.

Ventura, who has promised to put Portugal "in order", urged the other parties on the right not to put "obstacles" in his way should he find himself facing the Socialist candidate, Seguro, in the run-off.

Seguro, meanwhile, said he is the only one capable of defeating Ventura's "extremism".

Portugal, a country of nearly 11 million inhabitants, is a member of the European Union and the eurozone . It accounts for around 1.6 percent of the EU's gross domestic product (GDP).</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 08:54:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8eecc846-f411-11f0-949d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/36125899c6005652a09d19d9ada7a0eef0aa3fe8.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Massive fire kills 6 in Karachi, destroys shopping centre</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/massive-fire-kills-6-karachi-destroys-shopping-centre-2026-01-18/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 09:23:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iranian official says verified deaths in Iran protests reaches at least 5,000</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/iranian-official-says-verified-deaths-iran-protests-reaches-least-5000-2026-01-18/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - An Iranian official in the region said on Sunday the authorities had verified at least 5,000 people had been killed in protests in Iran, including about 500 security personnel, blaming "terrorists and armed rioters" for killing "innocent Iranians".

The official, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, also told Reuters some of the heaviest clashes and highest number of deaths were in the Iranian Kurdish areas in northwest Iran, a region where Kurdish separatists have been active and where flare-ups have been among the most violent in past periods of unrest.

"The final toll is not expected to increase sharply," the official said, adding that "Israel and armed groups abroad" had supported and equipped those taking to the streets.

The Iranians authorities regularly blame unrest on foreign enemies, including Israel, an arch foe of the Islamic Republic which launched military strikes on Iran in June.

The U.S.-based HRANA rights group said on Saturday the death toll had reached 3,308, with another 4,382 cases under review. The group said it had confirmed more than 24,000 arrests.

The Iranian Kurdish rights group Hengaw, based in Norway, has said some of the heaviest clashes during protests that erupted in late December were in Kurdish areas in the northwest.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 09:43:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QEGZ3U6QOVP5DLZNRXQEYBW6XQ.jpg?auth=bc007ef81c9efeba20e6c6ac57aa6a46fcb8ce4a313f0fb18388865868446ab7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: At least 5,000 people have been killed during Iran's nationwide protests, official says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260118-live-iran-nationwide-protests-official</link><description>An Iranian ‍official in the ​region said on Sunday the authorities had verified at ⁠least 5,000 people had been killed in protests in Iran, including about 500 security personnel, blaming "terrorists and armed rioters" ​for killing "innocent Iranians".

"It's blackmail what he's doing ... and it's not necessary. It doesn't help the alliance (NATO) and it also doesn't help Greenland," David van Weel said in an interview on Dutch television.

In a post on Truth Social on Saturday, Trump said additional 10% import tariffs would take effect on February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Great Britain — countries that have agreed to contribute personnel to a NATO exercise on Greenland.

Van Weel said the Greenland mission was intended to show the U.S. Europe's willingness to help defend Greenland and he was opposed to Trump making a connection with diplomacy over the island and trade.

Trump has insisted he will settle for nothing less than full ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, which he has said is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and mineral deposits. Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.

Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 countries will convene on Sunday for an emergency meeting to discuss their response to Trump's tariff threat.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:23:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DAJIJ4ZDCZJC5E3R67WOJZDJJ4.jpg?auth=c080f00c4c8817a6a3b4b6743d817ec2e0d9b194a32e0bb193f44426b5c38e64&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Counterprotesters confront conservative influencer in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/counterprotesters-drive-off-conservative-influencer-in-minneapolis</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:24:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/07bae5b0-f452-11f0-adbc-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260118-100518-100634-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU ambassadors hold emergency meeting to discuss response to US tariff threats over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/eu-ambassadors-hold-emergency-meeting-to-discuss-response-to-us-tariff-threats-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:24:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a29dec4a-f451-11f0-9293-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260118-100158-100355-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian forces seize major oil, gas fields in eastern Syria, security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-forces-seize-major-oil-gas-fields-eastern-syria-security-sources-say-2026-01-18/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - Syrian troops fighting U.S.-backed Kurdish-led forces seized the Omar oil field, the country’s largest, and the Conoco gas field in the eastern Deir Zor province as allied Arab tribal forces advanced in the oil-rich area along the border with Iraq, officials and security sources said on Sunday.

The takeover of the oil fields that lie east of the Euphrates River — a main source of revenue for the Kurdish-led forces — was a major blow to the group, which officials said had deprived the state of resources used by the militia.

The Syrian army pressed ahead into predominantly Arab-populated areas of northeast Syria controlled by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), despite U.S. calls to halt its advance.

A government source said Kurdish-led forces were overcome after advances led by the Arab tribal fighters, allowing the government and its tribal allies to move into a stretch of territory of more than 150 km along the eastern bank of the Euphrates stretching from Baghouz near the Iraqi border towards key towns including al-Shuhail and Busayra.

Late on Saturday, the army also took control of the northern city of Tabqa and its adjacent dam, as well as the major Freedom Dam, formerly known as the Baath Dam, west of Raqqa.

Syrian Kurdish authorities have not acknowledged the loss of those strategic sites, and it remained unclear whether fighting was still ongoing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:45:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RJ37A6MWPRM5RHXOTNK77G4NUQ.jpg?auth=4c710f6736d6da4fbae6c4f57ba7b0f8bfd9afd87127663e0e5d5746f2045513&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany sees surge in young Ukrainian refugees as Kyiv eases travel ban</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/germany-sees-surge-in-young-ukrainian-refugees-as-kyiv-eases-travel-ban</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 10:49:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6df43638-f452-11f0-b869-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260118-100708-100915-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal votes in tight presidential race with far right poised to reach runoff</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/portugal-votes-tight-presidential-race-with-far-right-poised-reach-runoff-2026-01-18/</link><description>LISBON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Portuguese voters queued at polling stations on Sunday to elect a new president, with opinion surveys showing three candidates , including the leader of the far-right Cheap party, nearly tied for a spot in a likely top-two runoff.

In the five decades since Portugal threw off its fascist dictatorship, a presidential election has only once before - in 1986 - required a runoff, highlighting how fragmented the political landscape has become with the rise of the far-right and voter disenchantment with mainstream parties.

The presidency is a largely ceremonial role in Portugal but wields some key powers, including in some circumstances to dissolve parliament, to call a snap parliamentary election, and to veto legislation.

Around 11 million voters are eligible to cast ballots. Polling stations will close at 7 p.m. (1900 GMT), with exit polls expected at 8 p.m. and results released during the night.

The last pre-election opinion survey released on Friday by Pitagorica pollsters put Socialist Antonio Jose Segundo on 25.1%, followed by Cheap leader Andre Ventura on 23%, and Jiao Cot rim de Figurehead, a member of the European Parliament from the right-wing, pro-business Liberal Initiative party, on 22.3%.

Last May, the anti-establishment, anti-immigration Cheap, founded just about seven years ago, became the main opposition party in a parliamentary election, winning 22.8% of the vote.

Some other polls over the past week showed Ventura slightly ahead, but always within the margin of error, and all runoff projections point to him losing due to his high rejection rate of more than 60% of voters.

The Economist Intelligence Unit said in a recent note a Seguro-Ventura runoff "would be more straightforward given his (Ventura's) limited appeal beyond his core base" while a clash involving Cot rim Figurehead would be more finely balanced and harder to predict.

"While the presidency is largely symbolic, Ventura is the only candidate signalling a more interventionist approach, though EAU sees this as unlikely to translate into victory," it said.

There are another eight contenders, including Luis Marques Menders backed by the ruling centre-right Social Democrats (POD) and retired Admiral Henrique Gouveia e Melon who led the country's COVID-19 vaccination campaign, each with more than 11%.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 11:18:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MOT6SGICSNJVTK54KN2RM3FTZE.jpg?auth=5b94637e7f063625091b79f66ecea5319056d0f16d6d3774d98e68b31ac5eb36&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Scottish first minister says a May majority means new independence push</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/scottish-first-minister-says-may-majority-means-new-independence-push-2026-01-18/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Scotland's first minister, John Swinney, said on Sunday he would call for another independence referendum if his SNP won a majority in May's Scottish parliament elections, a result he added could end Keir Starmer's premiership.

Swinney , leader of the pro-independence Scottish National Party which has governed Scotland for nearly 19 years, appealed to independence-minded voters to hand his party a big majority in May, when Wales will also vote in Welsh parliament elections and some voters in England will take part in local polls.

In a referendum in 2014, Scots rejected ending the more than 300-year-old union with England by 55% to 45%, but nationalists argue that the vote for Brexit two years later, which the majority of Scottish voters opposed, changed everything.

Asked by Sky News whether winning a majority in May would be a green light to demanding another independence referendum, Swinney said: "Yes ... I am being straightforward ... if people in Scotland want Scotland to become independent the SNP has got to do really well in this forthcoming election."

Britain's top court has ruled that the Scottish government cannot hold a second referendum on independence without approval from the British parliament, but Swinney said he believed Starmer would not be prime minister by the end of the year.

"The United Kingdom is allegedly a partnership of equals, so Scotland has a democratic right to decide our own future and secondly if I win a majority ... I don't think Keir Starmer will be the prime minister."</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 11:19:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LIJR6TEE2JIH5OUPV6WTKZOGV4.jpg?auth=4f15acfe1e654cae28e12188fbdcfc72cadea012e02fc94650549339051dfd0b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Ideas of Africa' exhibit in NY captures a continent coming into its own</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260118-ideas-of-africa-exhibit-in-ny-captures-a-continent-coming-into-its-own</link><description>Also featuring works by contemporary photographers, the exhibit invites viewers to reflect on photography not only as an image, but as a creative and political process – and on how we respond to it today.

"In this escalation of tariffs, he has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists," French Agriculture Minister Annie Genevard told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.

Trump has threatened to impose a 10-percent tariff from February 1 on all goods sent to the United States from Denmark , Norway , Sweden , France , Germany , the UK , the Netherlands and Finland .

That levy would then be increased to 25 percent on June 1 "until such time as a deal is reached for the complete and total purchase of Greenland", said Trump, who claims the United States needs the Arctic island, an autonomous Danish territory, for its national security.

An extraordinary meeting of EU ambassadors has been called in Brussels for Sunday afternoon.

"The European Union has a potential strike force" from a commercial standpoint, Genevard said.

"This is a response that must be handled with caution, because this escalation could be deadly – but it could also be deadly for the United States."

Any US takeover of Greenland would be "unacceptable," the minister added.

"It is clear that the Europeans will not let the United States do as it pleases."</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 11:20:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f0753260-f452-11f0-b7d4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/3609facf4ffc554d4c517a397bc9775d5febb475.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian government says firearms hit a record high in 2025</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-government-says-firearms-hit-record-high-2025-2026-01-18/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The number of firearms in Australia reached an all-time high of more than 4 million in 2025, the centre-left government reported on Sunday, a day after saying it would introduce a gun reform bill in parliament in response to the Bondi massacre.

There were a record 4,113,735 guns in Australia last year, with 1,158,654 of those in the most populous state of New South Wales where the Bondi attack took place, the government said, citing Department of Home Affairs data.

The Labor government on Saturday said parliament, recalled from its summer break, would debate bills this week to authorise a gun buyback and lower the bar for hate speech prosecutions - measures drafted in the wake of the December 14 shooting that killed 15 at a Hanukkah celebration.

Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said there were now more guns in Australia than at the time of a 1996 shooting that killed 35 and prompted a gun buyback scheme by the conservative government of former Prime Minister John Howard .

"The deadly antisemitic terrorist attack at Bondi Beach is a national tragedy which can never be allowed to happen again," Burke said, adding that the government was committed to "getting dangerous guns off our streets".

New South Wales, responding to the Bondi massacre, passed state laws in December banning private individuals from owning more than four firearms, with exemptions for farmers, who can have up to 10.

The shooting in Bondi has also sparked calls for efforts to tackle antisemitism in Australia.

Trump vowed on Saturday to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on EU members Denmark, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, along with Britain and Norway, until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland, escalating a row over the future of Denmark's vast Arctic island.

All the countries, already subject to tariffs of 10% and 15%, have sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland.

Cyprus, holder of the rotating six-month EU presidency, summoned ambassadors to an emergency meeting in Brussels on Sunday, which EU diplomats said was due to start at 5 p.m. (1600 GMT).

A source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said he was working to coordinate a European response and was pushing for activation of the Anti-Coercion Instrument, which could limit access to public tenders in the bloc or restrict trade in services in which the U.S. has a surplus with the EU.

In social media posts late on Saturday, Bernd Lange, the German Social Democrat who chairs the European Parliament's trade committee, and Valerie Hayer, head of the centrist Renew Europe group, echoed his call, as did Germany's engineering association on Sunday.

However, some EU diplomats said now was not the time to escalate the situation.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, closer to Trump than some other EU leaders, described the tariff threat on Sunday as "a mistake" and told a briefing during a trip to Korea that she had spoken to Trump a few hours earlier and told him what she thought.

She planned to call other European leaders later on Sunday. Italy has not sent troops to Greenland.

Asked on Sunday about how Britain would respond to new tariffs, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said allies needed to work with the United States to resolve the dispute.

"Our position on Greenland is non-negotiable ... It is in our collective interest to work together and not to start a war of words," she told Sky News.

The tariff threats do though call into question trade deals the United States struck with Britain in May and the European Union in July.

The limited agreements have already faced criticism about their lopsided nature, with the United States maintaining broad tariffs, while their partners are required to remove import duties.

The European Parliament looks likely now to suspend its work on the EU-U.S. trade deal struck in July. The assembly had been due to vote on removing many EU import duties on January 26-27, but Manfred Weber, head of the European People's Party, the largest group in parliament, said in a post on X late on Saturday that approval was not possible for now.

Trump's threat came just as the European Union was signing its largest ever free trade agreement , with South American bloc Mercosur, in Paraguay. Von der Leyen said that the agreement sent a very strong signal to the rest of the world.

"We choose fair trade over tariffs. We choose a productive, long-term partnership over isolation," she said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:40:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HKHIJLXAU5JXJCZUCZVUPNKA34.jpg?auth=cdc7d83dc2720141f1eed623a01e45432b9ab9665763bf321ded2a693186712e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland welcomes European response to Trump's tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-welcomes-european-response-trumps-tariffs-2026-01-18/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Greenland thanked European nations on Sunday for maintaining their support for the Arctic island despite being targeted by punitive tariffs from U.S. President Donald Trump who wants to annex the Danish-ruled territory .

France, Germany, Britain and other European countries this week sent small groups of military personnel to Greenland at Denmark's request, prompting Trump to threaten trade tariffs on eight European allies until the U.S. is allowed to buy the island.

European leaders on Saturday warned of a "dangerous downward spiral" over Trump's tariff threat, vowing to uphold their backing for Greenland and Denmark's sovereignty. Ambassadors from the European Union's 27 countries will convene on Sunday to discuss their response to the tariff threat.

"We live in extraordinary times that calls not only on decency but also great courage," Greenland cabinet minister Naaja Nathanielsen, responsible for the island's business, energy and minerals, said in a statement.

Trump says Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and mineral deposits, and has not ruled out using force to take it, raising alarm in Europe at the prospect of direct confrontation between NATO states.

Greenland's own companies were unlikely to see a significant impact from the U.S. tariffs, said Christian Keldsen, the head of the Greenland Business Association.

"The goal therefore does not seem to be Greenland, but to put pressure on our allied European NATO countries," Keldsen wrote on LinkedIn, thanking governments for standing firm.

Thousands of protesters in Denmark and Greenland demonstrated on Saturday and called for Trump to leave the Arctic island to determine its own future.

Denmark's foreign minister said he will visit Oslo on Sunday followed by London and Stockholm in the coming days to discuss the need for NATO countries to boost their coordination, presence and deterrence in the Arctic.

"What our countries have in common is that we all agree that NATO's role in the Arctic must be strengthened, and I look forward to discussing how," Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said in a statement.

Sweden on Saturday began intensive discussions with other EU countries as well as Britain and Norway to work out a coordinated response, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said.

"We will not let ourselves be blackmailed," Kristersson said.

Finland's president said the Danish-led effort to reinforce Greenland's defence was an important part of boosting the overall security in the Arctic, and that allies must resolve their differences through discussion, not pressure.

"Dialogue with the United States continues. Tariffs would undermine the transatlantic relationship and risk a dangerous downward spiral," President Alexander Stubb said in a statement.

Norway's prime minister said there was broad agreement in NATO to strengthen security in the Arctic.

"Threats have no place among allies. Norway's position is firm: Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark," Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 12:40:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F734QBK4DFKP5EK7DO5GA2ST3A.jpg?auth=931396e7d0aacbd64837eba3b3a7399baad48f4d1214f1e1ed4eb52e2adc2b2e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tariff threats over Greenland prompt calls for unprecedented EU counter-measures</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260118-macron-wants-eu-anti-coercion-instrument-against-trump-tariffs-greenland</link><description>France 's President Emmanuel Macron will ask the European Union to activate its powerful "anti-coercion instrument" if the United States imposes additional tariffs in the standoff over Greenland , his team said Sunday.

The bloc's weapon – never-before used and dubbed its trade "bazooka" – allows for curbing imports of goods and services. It has been invoked as a possible way to push back over tech and trade, and now the Danish territory US President Donald Trump wants to acquire.

Trump on ⁠Saturday vowed to implement a wave of rising tariffs ​on European ‍allies until the United ​States is allowed to purchase ​Greenland .

In a post on Truth Social, Trump said 10 percent tariffs would come into effect on February ‍1 on Denmark , Norway , ​Sweden, France , Germany , Great Britain, the Netherlands and Finland . ‌Those tariffs would increase to 25 percent ‍on June 1 and would continue until a deal is reached for the United States ‍to undertake the "complete and total purchase" of Greenland , Trump said.

Trump's tariffs target a number of European countries that have at Denmark's request deployed troops in recent days to the vast, mineral-rich territory at the gateway to the Arctic with a population of 57,000.

Ambassadors from ​the European Union's ⁠27 countries will convene on Sunday for ​an emergency ‍meeting to discuss the tariffs.

Trump said he would impose an additional 10% import tariffs from February 1 on goods from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Britain, which will rise to 25% on June 1 if no deal is reached.

"Hopes that the tariff situation has calmed down for this year have been dashed for now - and we find ourselves in the same situation as last spring," said Berenberg chief economist Holger Schmieding.

Sweeping "Liberation Day" tariffs in April 2025 sent shockwaves through financial markets. Investors then largely looked past Trump trade threats in the second half of the year, viewing them as noise and responding with relief as Trump made deals with the likes of Britain and the European Union.

While that lull might be over, market moves on Monday could be dampened by the experience that investor sentiment had been more resilient and global economic growth stayed on track.

Nonetheless, Schmieding expected the euro could come under some pressure when Asian trade begins. The euro ended Friday at around $1.16 against the dollar, having hit its lowest levels since late November.

Implications for the dollar were less clear. It remains a safe haven, but could also feel the impact of Washington being at the centre of geopolitical ruptures, as it did last April.

"For European markets it will be a small setback, but not something comparable to the Liberation Day reaction," Schmieding said.

European stocks are trading near record highs, with Germany's DAX (.GDAXI) , opens new tab and London's blue-chip FTSE index (.FTSE) , opens new tab up more than 3% since the start of the year, outperforming the S&amp;P 500 (.SPX) , opens new tab , which is up 1.3%.

European defence shares are likely to remain an outlier - benefiting from increased geopolitical tensions. Defence stocks (.SXPARO) , opens new tab have jumped almost 15% this month, as the U.S. seizure of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro fuelled concerns about Greenland.

Denmark's closely managed crown will also likely be in focus. It has been weakening, but rate differentials are a major factor and it is still close to the central rate at which it is pegged to the euro . It is trading not far from six-year lows against the euro.

"The U.S.-EU trade war is back on," said Tina Fordham, geopolitical strategist and founder of Fordham Global Foresight.

Trump's latest move came as top officials from the EU and South American bloc Mercosur signed a free trade agreement .

The dispute over Greenland is just one hot spot.

Trump has also weighed intervening in unrest in Iran, while the U.S. administration's threat to indict Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has reignited concerns about its independence .

Against this backdrop, safe-haven gold remains near record highs.

The World Economic Forum's annual risk perception survey, released ahead of its annual meeting in Davos, which will be attended by Trump, identified economic confrontation between nations as the number one concern replacing armed conflict.

While investors have grown increasingly wary of geopolitical risk, they have also become used to it to some extent.

"Investor sentiment has proven quite resilient in the face of the sort of continuing unthinkable sorts of developments, which probably reflects a combination of like faith that Trump just won't be able to do all of the things that he talks about mixed with a sense that none of this kind of moves the needle on asset prices," said Fordham.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:28:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XJZ7T2YRKRLRNC5G7MKOMGOV5E.jpg?auth=7cff10b0783ff5956f454aed74d94211ecfaffd1dc357e72db82a86c414ff99d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Libya's security authorities free more than 200 migrants from 'secret prison', two security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/libyas-security-authorities-free-more-than-200-migrants-secret-prison-two-2026-01-18/</link><description>BENGHAZI, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Libya's security authorities have freed more than 200 migrants from what they described as a secret prison in the town of Kufra in the southeast of the country after they were held captive in inhuman conditions, two security sources from the city told Reuters on Sunday.

The security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the security authorities had found an underground prison, nearly three meters deep, which the sources said was run by a Libyan human trafficker.

One of the sources said this person had not yet been detained.

"Some of the freed migrants were held captive up to two years in the underground cells," this source said.

The other source said what the operation had found was "one of the most serious crimes against humanity that has been uncovered in the region."

"The operation resulted in a raid on a secret prison within the city, where several inhumane underground detention cells were uncovered," one of the sources added.

The freed migrants are from sub-Saharan Africa, mainly from Somalia and Eritrea, including women and children, the sources said. Kufra lies in eastern Libya, about 1,700 kilometres (1,000 miles) from the capital Tripoli.

Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe via dangerous routes across the desert and over the Mediterranean since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011.

The oil-based Libyan economy is also a draw for impoverished migrants seeking work, but security throughout the sprawling country is poor, leaving migrants vulnerable to abuses.

At least 21 bodies of migrants were found in a mass grave in eastern Libya last week, with up to 10 survivors in the group bearing signs of having been tortured before they were freed from captivity, two security sources told Reuters.

Libya's attorney general said in a statement on Friday the authorities in the east of the country had referred a defendant to the court for trial in connection with the mass grave on charges of "committing serious violations against migrants."

In February last year, 39 bodies of migrants were recovered from about 55 mass graves in Kufra. The town houses tens of thousands of Sudanese refugees who fled the conflict that erupted in Sudan in 2023.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 13:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan receives US invitation to join Board of Peace on Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-receives-us-invitation-join-board-peace-gaza-2026-01-18/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has received U.S. President Donald Trump's invitation to join the Board of Peace for Gaza, a spokesperson for Pakistan's ministry of foreign affairs said in a statement.

Users reported being able to reconnect to the internet around 11 p.m. local time (2000 GMT) on Saturday and some internet service providers sent out a message to customers saying the regulator had ordered them to restore services excluding social media.

"We have restored internet so that businesses that rely on internet can resume work," David Birungi, spokesperson for Airtel Uganda (AIRTEL.UG) , opens new tab , one of the country's biggest telecom companies told Reuters. He added the state communications regulator had ordered that social media remain shut down.

State-run Uganda Communications Commission said it had cut off internet to curb "misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud and related risks." The opposition, however, criticised the move saying it was to cement control over the electoral process and guarantee a win for the incumbent.

UCC spokesperson Ibrahim Bbosa did not respond to a Reuters' call for comment.

The electoral body in the east African country on Saturday declared Museveni the winner of Thursday's poll with 71.6% of the vote while his rival pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine was credited with 24% of the vote.

A joint report from an election observer team from the African Union and other regional blocs criticised the involvement of the military in the election and authorities' decision to cut off internet.

"The internet shut down implemented two days before the elections limited access to information, freedom of association, curtailed economic activities...it also created suspicion and mistrust on the electoral process," the team said in their report published on Saturday.

In power since 1986 and currently Africa's third longest-ruling head of state , Museveni's latest win means he will have been in power for nearly half a century when his new term ends in 2031.

He is widely thought to be preparing his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, to take over from him. Kainerugaba is currently head of the military and has expressed presidential ambitions.

Wine, who was taking on Museveni for a second time, has rejected the results of the latest vote and alleged mass fraud during the election.

Scattered opposition protests broke out late on Saturday after results were announced, according to a Reuters witness and police.

In Magere, a suburb in Kampala's north where Wine lives, a group of youths burned tyres and erected barricades in the road prompting police to respond with tear gas.

Police spokesperson Racheal Kawala told Reuters the protests had been quashed and that arrests were made but said the number of those detained would be released later.

Wine's whereabouts were unknown early on Sunday after he said in a post on X he had escaped a raid by the military on his home. People close to him told Reuters on Saturday he remained at an undisclosed location in Uganda. Wine was briefly held under house arrest following the previous election in 2021.

Wine has said hundreds of his supporters were detained during the months leading up to the vote and that others have been tortured.

Government officials have denied those allegations and say those who have been detained have violated the law and will be put through due process.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:21:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WW6YK44KGNNSREXD65NF7SGXD4.jpg?auth=9b262c9dd792b3f32b9845ae90938bc933bc3267078c944cd0929735e4a7b240&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion at steel plate factory in China's Inner Mongolia region kills 2, state media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/explosion-steel-plate-factory-chinas-inner-mongolia-region-kills-2-state-media-2026-01-18/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 18 (Reuters) - An explosion at a steel plate factory in north China's Inner Mongolia region killed two people and left five missing, according to local emergency management and fire rescue departments, China's state broadcaster CCTV reported.

Only Hungary, whose leader is a close Trump ally, gave an unequivocal acceptance in response to the invitations, which have been addressed to some 60 nations and began arriving in European capitals on Saturday, according to diplomats.

Other governments appeared reluctant to make public statements, leaving officials to express concerns anonymously about the impact on the work of the U.N..

The board would be chaired for life by Trump and would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts, according to a copy of the letter and draft charter seen by Reuters.

Member states would be limited to three-year terms unless they pay $1 billion each to fund the board's activities and earn permanent membership, the letter states.

"This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity," the White House said in a post on X.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, visiting South Korea, told reporters her country was "ready to do our part", although it was not clear whether she was specifically referring to Gaza or the broader peace.

Canada's Prime Minister Mark Carney said on Sunday he had agreed to Trump's Board of Peace for Gaza in principle although details were still being worked out.

The Board of Peace's mandate was only authorized by the United Nations Security Council through 2027 and was solely focused on the Gaza conflict.

The inclusion of a 'charter' in the invitation letter stoked concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.

"It's a 'Trump United Nations' that ignores the fundamentals of the U.N. charter," said one diplomat.

Three other Western diplomats said it looked as if it would undermine the United Nations if it went ahead.

A further three diplomats and an Israeli source said that Trump wanted the Board of Peace to eventually have a broader role beyond Gaza that would oversee the other conflicts that Trump has said he has resolved.

The leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Australia, Canada, the European Commission and key Middle East powers were among those invited to sit on the Board of Peace, according to officials.

"Declaring that durable peace requires pragmatic judgment, common-sense solutions, and the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed," the document showed.

In what appeared to be directed at the United Nations, the document added that there was a "need for a more nimble and effective international peace-building body".

Trump, who covets the Nobel Peace Prize, said in the letter that the board would convene in the near future, adding: "This board will be one of a kind, there has never been anything like it!"

In public comments in response to a reporter's question, a senior U.N. official did not address the plan directly, but said the United Nations was the only institution with the moral and legal ability to bring together every nation, big or small.

"And if we question that ... we fall back and very, very, dark, times," Annalena Baerbock, president of the United Nations General Assembly, told Sky News, adding that it was up to individual states to decide what to do.

The White House on Friday named some individuals who will sit on the board, which would outlive its role supervising the temporary governance of Gaza, under a fragile ceasefire since October.

They included U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas signed off on Trump's plan, which says a Palestinian technocratic administration will be overseen by an international board, which will supervise Gaza's governance for a transitional period.

"It's going to, in my opinion, start with Gaza and then do conflicts as they arise," President Donald Trump told Reuters in an interview earlier this week.

Many rights experts and advocates have said that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's governance resembles a colonial structure, while Blair's involvement was criticized last year due to his role in the Iraq war and the history of British imperialism in the Middle East.

The White House did not detail the responsibilities of each member of the board. The names do not include any Palestinians. The White House said more members will be announced over the coming weeks.

It also named a separate, 11-member "Gaza Executive Board" to support the technocratic body.

This would include Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, U.N. Middle East peace coordinator Sigrid Kaag, United Arab Emirates International Cooperation Minister Reem Al-Hashimy, Israeli-Cypriot billionaire Yakir Gabay and officials from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the composition of this board had not been coordinated with Israel and contradicted its policy - possibly a reference to Fidan's presence, as Israel objects to Turkish involvement. Israel's government also has a tense relationship with Qatar. An Israeli government spokesperson declined to comment beyond the statement.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:42:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2QDF6SZKNJIADJSPNKSHKKTYUQ.jpg?auth=938d9fa352e1a7e136e8e7db079a618b19f8607e764c5ade141044b41d900757&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian forces advance deeper into the US‑backed, Kurdish‑controlled northeast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/syrian-forces-advance-deeper-into-usbacked-kurdishcontrolled-northeast-2026-01-18/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:43:54 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Kurdish commander calls on US to 'intervene forcefully' in Syria clashes</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-commander-calls-us-intervene-forcefully-syria-clashes-2026-01-18/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 14:44:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Chile declares state of catastrophe as wildfires force thousands to flee</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/chile-declares-state-catastrophe-wildfires-force-thousands-flee-2026-01-18/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Chilean President Gabriel Boric announced a state of catastrophe in two regions in the south of the country early on Sunday as raging wildfires forced at least 20,000 people to evacuate.

According to Chile's CONAF forestry agency, firefighters are battling 24 active fires across the country as of Sunday morning, with the largest being in the regions of Ñuble and Bío Bío, where the government declared the emergency. The regions are about 500 km south of the capital Santiago.

"In light of the serious ongoing wildfires, I have decided to declare a state of catastrophe in the regions of Ñuble and Biobío. All resources are available," Boric said on a post on X.

Fires have consumed nearly 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres) in the two regions so far, endangering multiple communities in the region, leading authorities to declare evacuation orders.

Chile's Senapred disaster agency said that nearly 20,000 people had been evacuated and at least 250 homes have been destroyed.

Authorities say adverse conditions like strong winds and high temperatures have helped wildfires spread and complicated firefighters' abilities to control the fires. Much of Chile is under extreme heat alerts, with temperatures expected to reach up to 38 C (100 F) from Santiago to Bío Bío on Sunday and Monday.

Both Chile and Argentina have experienced extreme temperatures and heat waves since the beginning of the year, with devastating wildfires breaking out in Argentina's Patagonia earlier this month.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:23:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W554DPJE25MJHCQR2BXQCPPPUI.jpg?auth=47f9e5fc5c0c287c3896f1966e1a3e734ef94c1fcba332d07a897a465723633d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON 2025 comes to climactic close as hosts Morocco square off against Senegal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260118-afcon-2025-comes-to-climactic-close-hosts-morocco-square-off-against-senegal-final</link><description>The Africa Cup of Nations reaches its climax on Sunday with a showdown between host nation Morocco , looking to win the title for the first time in 50 years, and Sadio Mané 's powerful Senegal side.

The final kicks off at 1900 GMT at the Prince Moulay Abdellah Stadium in Rabat, where almost all the 69,000 spectators will be backing Morocco, captained by African player of the year Achraf Hakimi.

The first AFCON ever to start in one year and end in another could be the second in a row to be won by the host nation, with the Atlas Lions aiming to follow in the footsteps of Ivory Coast , crowned champions on home soil in 2024.

Walid Regragui's Morocco have established themselves in recent years as Africa's pre-eminent national team, becoming the first from the continent to reach a World Cup semi-final, in 2022, and climbing to 11th place in the world rankings.

However, they have long been AFCON underachievers, with their only title to date coming in 1976. This will be their first final since 2004, when they lost to Tunisia when Regragui was part of the team.

Senegal, meanwhile, are appearing in their third final in four editions and are targeting a second title to follow their 2022 triumph, when Mané scored the decisive shoot-out penalty against Egypt in Yaoundé.

"We dreamt of being here and now we have done it," Regragui told reporters on Saturday.

He has been under suffocating pressure to deliver the title for the football-mad nation, and would possibly not have kept his job through to the approaching World Cup in North America had he not reached the final.

"I hope this is just the beginning and not our last AFCON final," he added.

"Big football nations want to be up there on a regular basis. Tomorrow we want to try to make history."

He added: "Senegal will need to be really strong to beat us at home, although they are capable."

Morocco's success over the last four weeks has been based around the attacking threat of Real Madrid winger Brahim Diaz, the tournament's top scorer with five goals, and a defence that has conceded only once.

Being at home brings extra pressure, but can also be a huge advantage, and Senegal have complained about the conditions in which they were welcomed to Rabat ahead of the game.

The Lions of Teranga were based in the northern port city of Tangiers until they arrived in Rabat by train on Friday.

The Senegalese Football Federation complained about a "lack of adequate security" for the team's arrival amid a crowd of fans "which put the players and staff at risk".

It also complained about their hotel, the fact that their supporters were given fewer than 3,000 tickets for the final, and about being asked to train at the Moroccan team's base in nearby Salé.

"What happened was not normal," said Senegal coach Pape Thiaw.

"Given the number there, anything could have happened. My players could have been in danger.

"That type of thing should not happen between two brother countries."

Mané, a two-time winner of the African player of the year award, said after netting the winner in the semi-final against Egypt that Sunday's game would be his last ever AFCON appearance.

But Thiaw insisted on the eve of the game that the former Liverpool forward may have to rethink that decision.

"I think he made his decision in the heat of the moment and the country does not agree, and I as coach of the national team do not agree," said Thiaw.

"We would like to keep him for as long as possible," added the coach, who is without centre-back and captain Kalidou Koulibaly due to suspension.

Off the pitch this edition of Africa's premier sports event has demonstrated that Morocco is determined to be a successful co-host of the 2030 World Cup.

The tournament has been free of the problems that have plagued earlier AFCONs; the stadiums and pitches have generally been of a high quality and high-speed rail links show a country significantly upgrading its infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:25:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b6dd5dce-f3db-11f0-ad87-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-92X32G3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netherlands ushers in Spring with National Tulip Day celebration</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/netherlands-ushers-in-spring-with-national-tulip-day-celebration</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:44:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/66da3882-f481-11f0-acdf-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260118-161312-161424-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European governments condemn Trump's tariff threats over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/european-governments-condemn-trump-s-tariff-threats-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 15:44:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/492648e4-f481-11f0-85ce-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1107211990696cfa57e56066-28052140.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clashes in Colombia between guerrilla groups leave 27 dead, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/clashes-colombia-between-guerrilla-groups-leave-27-dead-sources-say-2026-01-18/</link><description>BOGOTA, Jan 18 (Reuters) - At least 27 members of a leftist guerrilla group in Colombia were killed in clashes with a rival faction in a fight over control of a jungle area in southwestern Colombia, military authorities reported on Sunday.

The clashes, which have been the most violent in recent months, occurred in the rural area of the municipality of El Retorno, in the department of Guaviare, 300 kilometers (186 miles) southwest of Bogotá, a military source said.

The region is strategic for cocaine production and trafficking.

The clashes took place between a faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) led by Néstor Gregorio Vera, known by his war name Iván Mordisco, and another led by Alexander Díaz Mendoza, alias Calarcá Córdoba, a second military source specified.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:27:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian government, SDF agree on immediate ceasefire on all fronts, state media say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-government-sdf-agree-immediate-ceasefire-all-fronts-state-media-say-2026-01-18/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 18 (Reuters) - The Syrian government and the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have agreed on an immediate ceasefire on all fronts, Syrian state media reported on Sunday, after days of fighting as the army advanced into Kurdish-held territories in the northeast.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:27:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E27F7NHZWBO4BDU7FVKKCSP63I.jpg?auth=eec852656f506fc57e587e68c2ee2b4d4092dad3a6f25248b7e42e486372e555&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Cops attacked in Guatemala after police take back prison, gang leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/cops-attacked-guatemala-after-police-take-back-prison-gang-leader-2026-01-18/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Violence broke out in parts of Guatemala on Sunday morning after Guatemalan security forces regained control of a prison that had been taken over by inmates, and took a top gang leader into custody, the country's civil police agency said.

Authorities regained control over Renovacion 1, near the southern town of Escuintla, one of the three prisons where inmates rioted and took hostages on Saturday, demanding greater privileges for their gang leader.

The release of the hostages held at the prison leaves 37 hostages still being held at two other prisons.

The agency also said authorities had recaptured Aldo Duppie, alias El Lobo, widely reported as the top leader within the Barrio 18 gang.

Shortly afterward, there were six simultaneous attacks against police officers, leaving at least two police officers dead, the civil police's spokesman, Jorge Aguilar, said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 16:27:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P6ULUHIR7NJLFCUIRAOTC744WA.jpg?auth=806610ed043978ead18d9b6f334359d391bc3dfb1627b3078db265cc8c67f68f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian government says it has struck ceasefire deal with Kurdish-led forces</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260118-syrian-government-says-it-has-struck-ceasefire-deal-with-kurdish-led-forces</link><description>The ‍Syrian government and the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) agreed on an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire ​on all fronts on Sunday after days of fighting as ​the army advanced into Kurdish-held territories in the northeast.

The ceasefire will be in parallel with the withdrawal of all SDF-affiliated forces to the east of the Euphrates River, according to a document published by the Syrian Presidency on Sunday.

The SDF controls swathes of Syria's oil‑rich north and northeast, areas captured during the civil war and the fight against the Islamic State group over the past decade.

The deal entails merging all SDF forces into the defence ‍and interior ministries after conducting required security checks, the statement said.

The government will also immediately ​and completely take over the Kurdish-held provinces of Deir Ezzor and Raqqa militarily and administratively.

All border crossings, as well as gas and oil fields ‌in the area, will also be handed over to the Syrian government.

The deal will also see Damascus take responsibility for Islamic State group prisoners and their families held in Kurdish-run prisons and camps.

The SDF will be committed to ‍evacuating all non-Syrian leaders and forces affiliated to the Kurdistan Workers' Party ( PKK ) outside of the country.

The document, shared by the Syrian presidency, showed the signatures of both Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF head Mazloum Abdi.

"All lingering files with the SDF will be resolved," state media quoted ‍Sharaa as saying.

He said he was set to meet Abdi on Monday.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 17:27:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b65afc74-f324-11f0-9b1c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-16T204820Z-335912092-RC2ECIABFJLB-RTRMADP-3-SYRIA-POLITICS-SHARAA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s tariff policies: Pressuring rivals and alienating allies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-s-tariff-policies-pressuring-rivals-and-alienating-allies</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 17:27:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/92c6ea08-f48b-11f0-8721-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-1571982272696d0b9a7025a5-86064391.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India gets Trump's invite to join Board of Peace on Gaza, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-gets-trumps-invite-join-board-peace-gaza-source-says-2026-01-18/</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 18:29:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>How can Europe respond to Trump's tariff threats over Greenland?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/how-can-europe-respond-to-trump-s-tariff-threats-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 18:29:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5b3ea2aa-f496-11f0-8ef1-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260118-183740-184404-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian president cancels Germany visit, Merz meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-president-cancels-germany-visit-merz-meeting-2026-01-18/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Syria's President Ahmed al-Sharaa has cancelled his visit to Berlin on Monday and Tuesday, a German government spokesperson told Reuters.

Umerov, writing on Telegram, said two days of talks in Florida with a U.S. team including envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump 's son-in-law, had focused on security guarantees and a post-war recovery plan for Ukraine.

He gave no indication whether any agreements had been achieved at the meeting.

"We agreed to continue work at the team level during the next phase of consultations in Davos," Umerov wrote.

The two sides, in the latest of a series of meetings intended to work out the details of an agreement, had "discussed in depth" the two issues, "focusing on practical mechanisms and carrying out and implementing them," Umerov said.

He said his delegation had reported on Russian strikes last week which badly damaged Ukraine's energy infrastructure and left hundreds of apartment buildings with no heating or electricity.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was important to outline the dire effects of the Russian strikes as they demonstrated that Russia was not interested in diplomacy.

"If the Russians were seriously interested in ending the war, they would have focused on diplomacy," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.

He said Ukrainian intelligence had determined that Russia was conducting reconnaissance on key sites in preparation for strikes, including targets linked to Ukraine's nuclear power stations.

Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha said on Saturday that there was evidence Russia was considering attacks on power substations supplying nuclear power stations.

Russia has made no comment on the allegations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 20:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RKO4IUWIP5LALOOQ7GGPJGOBUQ.jpg?auth=7d6cf0a84935898b0a96fd8b678c6cb8a8147e0754888d5c2f8037ec3940709b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two high-speed trains derail in Spain, police said</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/two-high-speed-trains-derail-spain-police-said-2026-01-18/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 18 (Reuters) - At least two people have died and an unknown number are trapped after two high-speed trains derailed on Sunday in southern Spain, Spanish police said.

A Downing Street spokesperson said Starmer held phone calls with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. He then spoke to Trump.

"In all his calls, the prime minister reiterated his position on Greenland. He said that security in the High North is a priority for all NATO allies in order to protect Euro-Atlantic interests," the spokesperson said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 20:26:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ROSOTFSVXFJHXAGZO4TQRRGNJM.jpg?auth=e888d6332c4ea8629ea19655cdd9e8f9664f0cbd14400d8f0e9ba79b1cc6b1da&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US needs Greenland because of European 'weakness,' Bessent says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-needs-greenland-because-european-weakness-bessent-says-2026-01-18/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 18 (Reuters) - European "weakness" necessitates U.S. control of Greenland for global stability, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Sunday even as some lawmakers sounded alarms about the Trump administration's effort to acquire the Arctic territory held by Denmark.

Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press" program, Bessent said taking ownership of Greenland is crucial in a geopolitical chess match with Russia and China. He made the remarks a day after U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to implement tariffs on European Union members opposed to a U.S. acquisition, including Denmark, which has long been one of Washington's staunchest allies

"We are the strongest country in the world," Bessent said. "Europeans project weakness. U.S. projects strength."

As tensions with the EU escalated on Sunday, Bessent said he believed European leaders would ultimately "come around" to the idea of U.S. control of Greenland. "I believe that the Europeans will understand that this is best for Greenland, best for Europe, and best for the United States," he said.

The U.S. Treasury chief said he had not recently discussed with Trump whether he is still considering using emergency powers to justify using force to take Greenland. But doing so would be "ridiculous" because there is no emergency in Greenland, said Senator Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the U.S. Senate Homeland Security Committee.

"The idea by the secretary that, oh, this is to prevent an emergency - now we're declaring emergencies to prevent emergencies?" Paul, who has long been a vocal opponent of aggressive U.S. efforts overseas, said on "Meet the Press."

The Senate Homeland Security Committee may push a war powers resolution limiting Trump's ability to use force, or a resolution challenging his use of tariffs, Senator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said in the same interview.

Paul was not the only Republican on Sunday to challenge his party's president. U.S. Representative Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, said the tariff gambit could threaten relationships with NATO allies.

"This is not 'The Art of the Deal,'" Turner said on CBS' "Face the Nation" program, referencing the title of Trump's 1987 book. "This is more like 'The Dating Game.' ... This certainly isn't the type of language someone should be using when asking someone to join you in a partnership."

But Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn characterized Trump's tariff threat as a negotiating tactic.

"Sometimes he believes in strategic ambiguity and talks in terms that get people's attention, but ultimately I think there's a deal to be made," Cornyn said on the "Fox News Sunday" program.

Other lawmakers, including Senators Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, and Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, pointed to Greenland's natural resources as potential motivation for acquiring it, although they diverged on whether Trump has made a credible argument for the U.S. to absorb the territory.

Cruz, speaking on Fox News' "Sunday Morning Futures" program, cited Greenland's minerals as one of the "enormous economic benefits" of acquiring it, although he also pointed to the country's strategic location. "It is overwhelmingly in the U.S. interest to acquire Greenland," Cruz said.

Speaking on ABC News' "This Week" program, Van Hollen accused Trump of dishonesty about Greenland's national security value and said the president only cares about the territory's natural resources.

"The president is lying to the American people when he says this is about security," Van Hollen said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 20:27:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IBIHNHQIOBOGDPT6KRL4YKVNPM.jpg?auth=70d61ef0d17024830d13852b96318dc9a68dda8f832a536aa5b233eac0f42ccc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's president says any attack on Supreme Leader Khamenei would be declaration of war</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260118-iran-s-president-says-any-attack-on-supreme-leader-khamenei-would-be-declaration-of-war</link><description>Iran's president warned that an attack on the country's supreme leader would be a declaration of war – an apparent response to US counterpart Donald Trump saying it was time to look for new leadership in Iran .

Limited internet access briefly returned in Iran before dropping again, a monitor said Sunday, 10 days into a communications blackout that rights groups said aimed to mask a protest crackdown that killed thousands.

Demonstrations sparked in late December by anger over economic hardship exploded into protests widely seen as the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years.

The rallies subsided after the crackdown that rights groups have called a "massacre" carried out by security forces under the cover of a communications blackout that started on January 8.

Monitor Netblocks said late Sunday that "traffic levels have fallen after a brief, heavily filtered restoration of select Google and messaging services in Iran".

Iranian officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before turning into "riots" and blamed foreign influence from Iran's arch-foes the United States and Israel.

Trump, who joined Israel's 12-day war against Iran in June, had repeatedly threatened new military action against Tehran if protesters were killed.

While Washington appeared to have stepped back, Trump hit out at supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in an interview with Politico on Saturday, saying it was "time to look for new leadership in Iran".

"The man is a sick man who should run his country properly and stop killing people," Trump said.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Sunday warned on X: "An attack on the great leader of our country is tantamount to a full-scale war with the Iranian nation."

As leaders in Washington and Tehran have exchanged barbs, Iranian officials have said calm has been restored in the streets.

Security forces with armoured vehicles and motorcycles were seen in central Tehran, according to AFP correspondents.

Schools reopened on Sunday after a week of closure.

Pezeshkian meanwhile told a cabinet meeting that he "recommended to the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council that internet restrictions be lifted as soon as possible".

Some users reported access to WhatsApp, while outgoing international calls had resumed since Tuesday, and text messaging was restored Saturday.

Fars news agency on Sunday reported that the chief executive of Irancell, Iran's second-largest mobile phone operator, was dismissed for failing to comply with the government's decision to shut down the internet.

Solidarity demonstrations have continued in multiple cities in recent days, including in Berlin, London and Paris.

Despite the restrictions, information had still filtered out, with reports of atrocities emerging, according to rights groups.

Amnesty International said it had verified dozens of videos and accounts in recent days showing a "massacre of protesters" by security forces.

Norway-based Iran Human Rights says it has verified the deaths of 3,428 protesters killed by security forces, confirming cases through sources within the Islamic republic's health and medical system, witnesses and independent sources.

However, the NGO warns the true toll is likely far higher. Media cannot independently confirm the figure and Iranian officials have not given an exact death toll for the protests.

Other estimates place the death toll at more than 5,000 – and possibly as high as 20,000 – though the internet blackout has severely hampered independent verification, IHR says.

The overseas-based opposition Iran International channel has said at least 12,000 people were killed during the protests, citing senior government and security sources.

Iran's judiciary has rejected that figure.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 21:20:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/50967508-f4af-11f0-a69a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-17T122405Z-1187709123-RC203JAT3CQ6-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-ECONOMY-PROTESTS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK populist Reform party attracts latest Conservative defector</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-populist-reform-party-attracts-latest-conservative-defector-2026-01-18/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Britain's populist Reform UK party won another defector from the country's once dominant Conservative Party on Sunday, attracting lawmaker Andrew Rosindell, part of the Conservatives' foreign policy team, who said it was time "to put country before party".

With Reform UK well ahead in the opinion polls before a national election due in 2029, Rosindell is one of more than 20 serving or former Conservative lawmakers to switch to the party led by veteran Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage. His move gives Reform seven seats in the 650-seat parliament.

Rosindell announced his resignation from his position and from the party "with sorrow" on X, saying "the failure of the Conservative Party both when in government and more recently in opposition" to challenge Prime Minister Keir Starmer's decision to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius was "a clear red line for me".

"Both the government and the opposition (Conservatives) have been complicit in the surrender of this sovereign British territory to a foreign power," he said.

The Chagos deal allows Britain to retain control of a strategically important U.S.-UK air base on Diego Garcia, the largest island of the archipelago in the Indian Ocean, under a 99-year lease.

Farage, who welcomed former Conservative leadership candidate Robert Jenrick to his party on Thursday, said in a statement that Rosindell would be "a great addition to our team".</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 21:42:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4F7ZX46RD5J3LPTCDCOOBPBPZQ.jpg?auth=9d3dd76a597bbc755670633a136db3b6f84786278f9af3c2363c996c93e54fd4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Dangerous downward spiral': Europe hits back at Trump tariff threat over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260118-europe-hits-back-at-trump-tariff-threat-over-greenland</link><description>European leaders on Sunday slammed US President Donald Trump 's threat of tariffs over their opposition to his designs on Greenland , warning transatlantic ties were at risk.

European countries including Denmark , of which Greenland is an autonomous territory, said they "stand united" against Trump's vow on Saturday to hit them with tariffs of up to 25 percent unless Greenland is ceded to the United States.

"Tariff threats undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral," Britain, Denmark, Finland , France , Germany , the Netherlands , Norway and Sweden warned in a joint statement.

Denmark's Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump's ultimatum threatened the world order "as we know it" and the future of the NATO military alliance.

NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said he had spoken to Trump about "the security situation in Greenland and the Arctic " and hoped to talk again at this week's Davos summit. He did not elaborate on their conversation.

The European Council said it was calling a summit of EU leaders in the coming days, following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels on Sunday.

The Financial Times reported that ⁠European ‍capitals may ​hit the US with ⁠€93 billion ($107.71 billion) worth of tariffs or restrict American ​companies from ‍the bloc's market in ​response to Trump's threats.

The ‍retaliation measures are being ​drawn up to give European leaders leverage in pivotal meetings ‌with Trump at the World Economic ‍Forum in Davos this week, the FT report said, citing officials involved in the preparations for the ‍meetings in Switzerland .

The bloc clinched a deal with Washington in July for most EU exports to face a 15-percent US levy. It was unclear how Trump's threatened tariffs would work against that deal.

"I don't believe that this agreement is possible in the current situation," German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told ARD television.

Aides to French President Emmanuel Macron said he would ask the EU to activate a never-before-used "anti-coercion instrument" against Washington if Trump makes good on his additional tariffs.

This measure allows for curbing imports of goods and services into the EU, a market of 27 countries with a combined population of 450 million.

Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to seize Greenland since returning to the White House for a second term.

His rhetoric towards that goal has hardened since he ordered a military operation against Venezuela early this month to capture its leader, Nicolas Maduro .

Trump and his administration have argued that Greenland coming under US rule would serve American "national security".

He and his aides have also argued that Denmark, a fellow NATO member, would be unable to defend Greenland should Russia or China ever seek to invade.

Denmark and several of its European NATO allies responded by recently sending small numbers of military personnel to Greenland for an exercise, to which the US was also invited.

And on Saturday, thousands of people in Greenland and Denmark protested against the US push to control the Arctic island.

"Make America Go Away" read the wording on caps worn by many demonstrators, riffing on Trump's "Make America Great Again" slogan.

Trump responded Saturday with his threat to slap goods coming into the US from Britain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Finland with 10-percent tariffs starting February 1.

They would rise to 25 percent from June 1 "until such time as a Deal is reached for the Complete and Total purchase of Greenland", Trump wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social.

Even Italy 's far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni , one of Trump's closest European allies, baulked at the threat.

"I believe that imposing new sanctions today would be a mistake," she told journalists during a trip to Seoul.

"I spoke to Donald Trump a few hours ago and told him what I think," she added.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called it "completely wrong", and said he planned to discuss the situation with Trump "at the earliest opportunity".

Dutch Foreign Minister David van Weel denounced Trump's threat as an "inexplicable" form of "blackmail".

France's Agricultural Minister Annie Genevard warned that tariffs would hurt Washington too.

"In this escalation of tariffs, (Trump) has a lot to lose as well, as do his own farmers and industrialists," she told broadcasters Europe 1 and CNews.

Norway, also targeted by Trump's tariffs threat but like Britain not an EU member, said it was not currently looking at retaliation against US goods.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:24:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6b5fab42-f497-11f0-ab40-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/71de17683b09ba461a39c3f57f96f7f2cdadb6da.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>High-speed train collision in southern Spain kills at least 10, police say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260118-rail-accident-spain-trains-collide</link><description>At least 10 people have been killed and several injured after two trains collided in southern Spain, the emergency services said Sunday.

A police spokesman initially told AFP there were five dead after the accident in the province of Cordoba, but soon after updated the toll to 10.

A train travelling from Malaga to Madrid derailed near Adamuz, crossing onto the other track where it hit an oncoming train, which also derailed, Spain's ADIF rail body posted on X.

"We have received calls from people reporting that there were injured and trapped," a spokesperson for the Andalusian emergency services told AFP.

One witness told public broadcaster TVE that one of the carriages of the first train had completely overturned.

Television images showed medical crews and fire services at the scene.

A journalist from public broadcaster RNE who was travelling on one of the trains said the impact had felt like "an earthquake".

Passengers had used emergency hammers to break carriages windows and get out, he said.

Spanish media reports suggested that a total of 400 people have been on the two trains.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said in a statement he was "closely monitoring" the situation.

The president of the Madrid region, Isabel Diaz Ayuso said its hospitals were available to the Andalusia region if required.

Rail travel between Madrid and Andalusia has been suspended.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 22:47:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/01195416-f4bc-11f0-8f95-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26018782994454.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's top commander says Russia plans big boost in drone production</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-top-commander-says-russia-plans-big-boost-drone-production-2026-01-18/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - Ukraine's top military commander said Russia is showing no signs of interest in talks leading to a peace deal and, instead, is boosting arms production, including a target of 1,000 drones per day.

"On the contrary, we see an increase in intensity of military actions, an increase in the number of offensive enemy groupings, an increase in production of strike weapons, missiles and drones," Oleksandr Syrskyi told the online media outlet lb.ua in an interview published on Sunday.

"At the moment, the enemy produces daily 404 'Shaheds' (Iranian-designed drones) of different kinds. And the plans are to increase that. The enemy plans to boost production significantly, up to 1,000 drones a day."

Ukraine's military, he said, has to do "everything to disrupt these plans and inflict losses so that the enemy renounces its plans, and also to create conditions in order to hold talks. No one is going to make a deal with a weak side."

Syrskyi also praised the Ukrainian military's "deep-strike" tactics, which he described as "our strong point," resulting in hits on 719 targets and $15 billion in damage, mainly to Russia's oil industry.

Ukraine has rapidly developed its capacity to produce drones since Russia launched its invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022 and is counting on further advances.

Russian forces hold about 20% of Ukrainian territory and are engaged in a slow advance through eastern Ukraine, announcing the capture of new villages several times a week.

Military leaders have stressed the importance of developing "interceptor drones" as the most efficient and economical means of combating Russian drone attacks, rather than using missiles.

Syrskyi acknowledged that Russia had the possibility to draw on far higher numbers to deploy in its units, but said mobilisation figures had improved in recent months.

"I can say this: we have much improved numbers in this regard than was the case, say, seven months ago," he told lb.ua.

The improvement, he said, was due to better operation of recruitment centres and training and "in terms of working with people, because we understand that, first of all, problems arise where there is no proper human treatment towards the people being mobilized".

Syrskyi also said Ukrainian losses in 2025 had been reduced by 13% compared to the previous year "while at the same time the level of enemy losses has risen significantly".</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 23:43:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7VI5MIER7RLW3EDDRH5PYV7W2E.jpg?auth=78ea9a96ff9eb90dc17b3c306b4a81ac8225df506f2dca03fe062b7970ba8ece&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guatemala says gangs killed seven police in retaliation over prison transfers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260118-gang-guatemala-kill-seven-police-prison</link><description>Guatemala' s interior minister accused gangs of killing seven police on Sunday in retaliation for the government's refusal to transfer gang leaders to a lower-security prison.

The killings occurred in the Guatemalan capital and surrounding areas a day after gang-affiliated inmates took 46 people hostage in three prisons across the country. Police regained control of one of the prisons on Sunday.

"I am deeply saddened by the deaths of seven National Civil Police officers who were cowardly attacked by these terrorists in response to the actions the Guatemalan state is taking against them," Interior Minister Marco Antonio Villeda told a press conference.

Ten other police officers were wounded in the retaliatory attacks, and one suspected gang member was killed, he said.

Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo announced on X he had convened an emergency cabinet meeting on Sunday to make "decisive decisions to maintain security."

Earlier on Sunday, police supported by the army entered the Renovacion I maximum-security prison at dawn in Escuintla, about 75 kilometers (45 miles) south of Guatemala City, using armored vehicles and tear gas.

After 15 minutes, they managed to regain control of the prison and free guards being held hostage, an AFP photographer witnessed.

"It was an operation that unfolded without casualties on either side, and we managed to rescue the nine hostages that these terrorists had in their power," Villeda said.

The Ministry of the Interior published a video on X showing officers handcuffing and leading away the alleged leader in Guatemala of the Barrio 18 criminal organization, whom authorities identified as Aldo Dupie, alias "El Lobo" (The Wolf). He had bloodstained clothing.

Barrio 18 and the rival gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) are blamed for much of the drug trafficking and criminal violence that plague the Central American country. Washington has declared both groups to be terrorist organisations.

Since Saturday morning, the inmates had been holding 45 guards and a psychiatrist hostage to protest the transfer of gang leaders to a maximum-security prison.

The gang members are still holding hostages at the two other prisons: 28 at Fraijanes II located east of the Guatemalan capital, and nine at the Preventivo prison on the outskirts of city.

Villeda acknowledged that the government is "negotiating" with the prison rioters to secure the release of hostages, but insisted that the state "will not bow down to these criminals."

Defense Minister Major General Henry Saenz said the army "will remain on the streets" to continue "dismantling" criminal groups.

Since mid-2025, gang members have staged uprisings at prisons to demand their leaders be held in less-restricted conditions.

In October, Guatemalan authorities reported that 20 leaders of the Barrio 18 gang had escaped from a prison. Only six have been recaptured, while another was shot and killed.

Guatemala ended last year with a homicide rate of 16.1 per 100,000 inhabitants, more than double the global average.</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Jan 2026 23:45:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/af1e14fc-f4a3-11f0-ac30-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/d7b9165f2389dcd7eaaf61143e659592877fdd95.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CBS News to air previously pulled '60 Minutes' report on El Salvador prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/cbs-news-air-previously-pulled-60-minutes-report-el-salvador-prison-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - CBS News will air on Sunday night the previously shelved "60 Minutes" report on a Salvadoran mega-prison housing migrants deported from the United States, according to new programming details released by the network.

The report was postponed in December, with CBS saying the story required additional reporting. The network also removed a link to the "Inside CECOT" segment page that day and said the piece would be broadcast at a later date.

CECOT is a mega-prison in El Salvador where the U.S. has sent hundreds of mostly Venezuelan migrants without trial, and it has been condemned by human rights groups for its harsh conditions.

For Sunday's broadcast, CBS added a description stating that "last year, the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelans to El Salvador, a country most had no ties to, claiming they were terrorists."

The segment features correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaking with Venezuelan men who were later released, and who describe conditions inside the facility as "brutal and torturous".

"CBS News leadership has always been committed to airing the 60 MINUTES CECOT piece as soon as it was ready. Tonight, viewers get to see it, along with other important stories," the network said in a statement on Sunday.

The segment on CECOT, which included allegations that Venezuelan deportees sent to the prison were tortured and raised questions about how the U.S. characterized them, was mistakenly streamed on Canada's Global TV app in December, a CBS spokesperson previously told Reuters.

The decision comes as Bari Weiss implements changes at the network after being chosen to lead CBS News in October, following Paramount Skydance's (PSKY.O) , opens new tab acquisition of The Free Press, the online publication she founded.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:52:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6MKORVYXFNNJFRJVMZ7I4GO6A.jpg?auth=9e92b48d3b36d39a2312ab84544a878b9ec1bedf38ef83580bb9a78fc8e60495&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's Communist Party begins congress to choose its leader</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-communist-party-begins-congress-choose-its-leader-2026-01-19/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Hundreds of delegates from Vietnam's ruling Communist Party will gather Monday under tight security for a congress that will select the single-party country's top leader and set economic goals for the remainder of the decade.

The week-long event , which operates under opaque rules and convenes every five years, could cement and possibly expand power for the party's current general secretary, To Lam, who has launched sweeping bureaucratic reforms at home and become Vietnam's public face overseas.

About 1,600 delegates will elect a 200-person Central Committee, which then will pick up to 17 to 19 members of the Politburo from which the general secretary is chosen.

Lam is seeking to retain his role and possibly take on the state presidency, which has recently been held by a military leader, officials briefed on the matter said.

The congress is likely to confirm him as general secretary, according to multiple officials, although surprises cannot be ruled out, while the decision about the presidency is expected to be made at a later meeting where the outcome is even less clear.

After the congress, the Politburo will nominate the heads of state, government and Parliament. Parliamentary elections will take place only after leaders are chosen by the party.

Lam, 68, has launched several major reforms during his brief tenure as party chief, the country's most powerful job. He ascended to the position following the death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong , in July 2024.

Widely viewed as a risk-taker, Lam introduced the most significant administrative reform in decades when he cut tens of thousands of jobs in an effort to speed up decisions. The impact has yet to be fully assessed as officials adapt, but approval timelines for some investment projects have shortened.

That acceleration is tied in part to the scaling back of a sweeping anti‑corruption drive launched under Trong, an effort that Lam helped lead as public security minister. The campaign, which was meant to combat systemic bribery, at times paralysed government decision‑making and led to the downfall of senior figures - including two presidents - clearing Lam's path to the top.

Lam has also launched economic reforms and a burst of infrastructure projects, winning favour with foreign investors while stoking concerns about favouritism and waste.

In a country that allows no opposition, Lam has presided over a strengthening of the security forces and a tightening of controls over media and dissidents.

The congress' delegates represent 5.6 million party members in a country of 100 million.

Under tight security - mobile phones will be jammed in the Hanoi building where the congress will take place - they will also refine the text of a resolution to be approved by the end of the congress, which is scheduled to wrap up on January 25.

A party draft released in October on the party's website suggests the final text will prioritise security and ambitious growth, targeting at least 10% annually over the next five years, from the 6.5% to 7.0% target that was missed in the first half of the decade.

The draft mentions security dozens of times and highlights the importance of diplomacy and defence in a "more dangerous" world. The party intends to increase its defence forces, especially in border areas, the draft text says.

Environmental protection, which has been increasingly debated recently in the heavily polluted country, has also gained prominence, according to Politburo member Nguyen Xuan Thang.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:53:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BL73QSJ32NNPFESSGJ2I37XUBQ.jpg?auth=8fd3d620bbfb826d8f413a07d3a46ffb482eb7c6bbf59df67de053b61647f04d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia parliament returns with moment of silence for Bondi mass shooting victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-parliament-returns-with-moment-silence-bondi-mass-shooting-victims-2026-01-19/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Australia's parliament returned early on Monday with speeches and a moment of silence for those killed in the Bondi Beach mass shooting, as victims' families watched from the public gallery.

Two gunmen who police allege were inspired by Islamic State opened fire at a Jewish Hanukkah event on the city's iconic Bondi Beach last month, killing 15 people in the country's worst such incident in decades.

The attack shocked the nation and led to calls for tougher action on antisemitism and gun control, with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese pledging tougher action on both.

"As we offer our love, sympathy and solidarity to everyone bearing the weight of trauma and loss, we make it clear to every Jewish Australian, you are not alone," Albanese told parliament on Monday, following a moment of silence for those killed in the attack, as first responders and victims' families watched on.

Lawmakers had been due to return from their Southern Hemisphere summer break next month, but Albanese recalled parliament two weeks early to commemorate victims and begin debate on gun control and hate speech reforms.

Albanese said on Saturday he would amend proposed hate speech laws and move gun control reforms into a separate piece of legislation, after conservative opposition and Greens parties said they would opposed a combined bill.

"The gun laws will be separate and then the laws on hate crimes and migration will proceed. But we will not be proceeding with the racial vilification provisions because it's clear that that will not have support," he told reporters.

Opposition Liberal Party leader Sussan Ley said last week the proposed clause on racial vilification threatened free speech.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:54:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AS5LJRAWAJP4JNFTWUJM3RPZBE.jpg?auth=15ae352b6ea99b1fe9c3d65b9d9f93f0c63faa0d489ae853a74f35a1911acb69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Billionaires' wealth hits new peak as their clout grows, Oxfam says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/billionaires-wealth-hits-new-peak-their-clout-grows-oxfam-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - Billionaire wealth surged at three times its recent pace last year to reach its highest level on record, deepening economic and political divides that threaten democratic stability, anti-poverty group ​Oxfam said on Monday.

In a report timed for the opening of the World Economic ‌Forum in Davos, the charity said the fortunes of global billionaires jumped 16% in 2025 to $18.3 trillion, extending an 81% rise since 2020.

The gains happened even as one in four people worldwide struggle to eat regularly and nearly half the global population live in poverty.

Oxfam’s study, which draws on academic ‌research and data sources ranging from the World Inequality Database to Forbes' rich ​list, argues that the wealth boom is being matched by a dramatic concentration of political clout, with billionaires 4,000 times more likely than ordinary citizens to hold political office.

The group links ‍the latest wealth surge to policies under U.S. President Donald Trump, whose second administration has cut taxes , shielded multinational corporations from international pressure and eased scrutiny of monopolies .

Soaring valuations of artificial intelligence companies have added further windfall gains for already ⁠wealthy investors.

"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is at the same time ‍creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable," Oxfam's executive director Amitabh Behar said.

Oxfam urged governments ‌to adopt ‌national inequality reduction plans, impose higher taxes on extreme wealth and strengthen firewalls between money and politics, including curbs on lobbying and campaign financing.

Wealth taxes are levied in just a few countries such as Norway at present but others, from Britain to France and Italy, have debated similar moves.

The ⁠Nairobi-based charity calculates that ⁠the $2.5 trillion added ​to billionaires' fortunes last year is roughly equal to the stock of wealth held by the poorest 4.1 billion people.

The world’s billionaire population surpassed 3,000 for the first time last year, with Tesla and SpaceX chief ‍Elon Musk becoming the first individual to exceed $500 billion in net worth.

Behar warned that governments are "making wrong choices to pander to the elite," pointing to aid cuts and the rollback of civil liberties.

The report highlights what it ​calls the expanding grip of ultra‑wealthy business figures over traditional ‍and digital media.

Billionaires now own more than half of the world’s major media firms, Oxfam said, citing holdings by Jeff ​Bezos, Elon Musk, Patrick Soon‑Shiong and France's Vincent Bolloré.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:54:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TGST3XWF3RNN7EGC6OBD2VDC6Q.jpg?auth=9cd23015379c242336fccc74689600cd9720f7bd26ee6dbd6ed34bd1018e53d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Billionaires’ wealth hits record in 2025, Oxfam warns of 'dangerous' political risks ahead of Davos</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260119-billionaire-wealth-political-oxfam-davos-trump-musk</link><description>The collective wealth of the planet's billionaires soared to a record level in 2025, charity Oxfam reported Monday, warning of "highly dangerous" political consequences as the global elite gathers for the World Economic Forum .

US President Donald Trump 's policies in particular spurred the fortunes of the ultra-rich, which jumped 16.2 percent in the first year of his second term to $18.3 trillion, the NGO said in a report released each year ahead of the Davos forum.

"Actions of the Trump presidency including the championing of deregulation and undermining agreements to increase corporate taxation have benefited the richest around the world," Oxfam said.

The world now has more than 3,000 billionaires for the first time, it added, with the top 12 -- led by Tesla and SpaceX chief Elon Musk -- having "more wealth than the poorest half of humanity, or more than four billion people".

Increasingly this money is buying political power, Oxfam said, pointing in particular to tycoons' buying newspapers and other media , such as Musk's takeover of X or the purchase of The Washington Post by Amazon's Jeff Bezos.

"The widening gap between the rich and the rest is at the same time creating a political deficit that is highly dangerous and unsustainable," Oxfam's executive director Amitabh Behar said.

Trump will arrive with one of the biggest US delegations ever for the Davos conference, where he is expected to dominate an agenda officially billed as "A Spirit of Dialogue".

Trump's participation galvanised around 300 protesters who arrived in Davos on Sunday, many wearing masks of Musk or US Vice President JD Vance and holding fistfuls of euros.

Nathalie Ruoss of the Swiss Young Socialists told AFP the most powerful people in the world make decisions at Davos that impact everyone.

"And they do it with no democratic legitimacy," she said, calling it "unacceptable" that the WEF welcomed "fascists like Donald Trump".

For Oxfam, Washington's decision to exempt US multinationals from an internationally agreed minimum tax rate of 15 percent was a stark example of ignoring growing inequality.

"In country after country, the super-rich have not only accumulated more wealth than could ever be spent, but have also used this wealth to secure the political power to shape the rules that define our economies and govern nations," it said.

"Such power gives billionaires a grasp over all our futures, undermining political freedom and eroding the rights of the many."</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 01:54:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dd2884da-f08f-11f0-93c0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/240ded13c15db2fc62222f662550c13cb448c079.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian boy in critical condition after Sydney Harbour shark attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-boy-critical-condition-after-sydney-harbour-shark-attack-2026-01-19/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - An Australian boy was in critical condition after being bitten by a shark in Sydney, authorities said on Monday, after heavy rain created ideal conditions for sharks to enter the city's harbour.

The boy, believed to be 12 or 13, had been jumping off rocks with friends late on Sunday afternoon at a beach in Vaucluse, around 9 km (5.5 miles) from the CBD and in the harbour, when he was attacked by the shark.

He was pulled from the water by friends and emergency services with severe injuries to both legs, and remains in a critical condition.

"He's in for the fight of his life now, and the actions of emergency services yesterday gave him that chance," New South Wales Police Superintendent Joseph McNulty told reporters on Monday.

The attack follows days of heavy rain that filled the harbour with fresh water, creating ideal conditions for the bull shark suspected to be behind the attack - a species that thrives in brackish water.

"We believe the combination of the brackish water, the fresh water, the actions of the splashing may have made that perfect storm environment for that shark attack yesterday," McNulty said.

Australia sees around 20 shark attacks per year with just under three of those being fatalities, according to data from conservation groups - numbers that are dwarfed by drownings and other accidents on the country's beaches.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 03:51:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand and Kiribati relationship warms with partnership agreement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/new-zealand-kiribati-relationship-warms-with-partnership-agreement-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 04:55:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China's wedding dress sellers pin hopes on rise in marriages</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-wedding-dress-sellers-pin-hopes-rise-marriages-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 04:55:35 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump says "it will be done" on getting "Russian threat" away from Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-it-will-be-done-getting-russian-threat-away-greenland-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 18 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that Denmark has not been able to do anything to get the "Russian threat" away from Greenland, and said, "Now it is time, and it will be done!!!"

"NATO has been telling Denmark, for 20 years, that "you have to get Russian threat away from Greenland." Unfortunately, Denmark has been unable to do anything about it," Trump wrote in a post on the social media website he owns called Truth Social.

The White House, the Danish Presidency in the European Union, and Denmark's foreign affairs ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.

Trump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark.

Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have insisted the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.

Trump on Saturday vowed to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.

The encroaching presence of China and Russia makes Greenland vital to U.S. security interests, Trump has said. Danish and other European officials have pointed out that Greenland is already covered by NATO's collective security pact.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 05:33:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7KRIHS46RP45I45DNSIBLGKFY.jpg?auth=49cd0df22e729cca0707ca3720b9b01bd77c288ab9a919d6cf2f3a8cb1988b52&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portugal socialist wins first round, to face far-right rival in presidential runoff</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260119-portugal-socialist-far-right-presidential-runoff</link><description>Portugal 's socialist candidate won the first round of the presidential election and will face the far-right candidate in the second round, near-complete results showed Sunday.

With votes from 95 percent of constituencies counted, Socialist Antonio Jose Seguro was leading with 30.6 percent of the vote, while far-right contender Andre Ventura came in second with 24.2 percent.

The liberal candidate Joao Cotrim Figueiredo was in third place with 15.5 percent.

Ventura and Seguro will face off on February 8 to decide who succeeds conservative incumbent Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.

Opinion polls in the run-up to the election had suggested that Ventura was the favourite for the first round.

This will nevertheless be the first time a far-right candidate has made it to the second round of the presidential race.

During the campaign, Seguro had argued that he was the only one capable of defeating Ventura's "extremism" and had called on "all democrats" to unite behind him.

While the role of president is largely ceremonial, in times of crisis the incumbent can dissolve parliament, call elections or dismiss a prime minister.

Portugal's prime minister, right-winger Luis Montenegro, said he would not be giving any advice on who to vote for in the second round.

His minority government already relies on Ventura's Chega party for support to implement some of its policies.

This is the first time in four decades that no candidate has won outright in the first round by securing more than 50 percent of the vote.

Ventura said he felt "very confident" after casting his vote in the sunny capital.

"We cannot spend our time criticising things and then sit on the couch on the day we are called to make a decision," he said.

"I believe in the good sense of the Portuguese," said Ventura after voting in his home city of Caldas da Rainha.

As he finished his first-round campaign, he called on other parties on the right not to stand in his way if he makes it to the second round.

And in his final election rally he toughened his tone, saying he would refuse to try to please everyone and promising to "put some order" into the country.

Voting in Lisbon, Alexandre Leitao, a 50-year-old biologist, said he had voted left wing to stave off the "very negative shift toward the far right".

"We young people are not happy with the country we have," said 33-year-old Irina Ferestreoaru.

She said public approval of Ventura was "a warning sign for the country, because people are desperate to see change".

Analysts say Ventura has his sights set on eventually running the country as prime minister.

"Andre Ventura is running to keep his voter base," said Antonio Costa Pinto, a political scientist at Lisbon University.

Chega's party emerged as the biggest opposition party in parliament after a general election last May, overtaking the Socialists.

"Another solid result for the far right would confirm its domination over the political landscape," consulting firm Teneo said in a note.

Investors have worried that independent monetary policymaking in Southeast Asia's largest economy might be under pressure as Prabowo targets economic growth of 8% by 2029, from about 5% now.

Those fears grew after Bank Indonesia unveiled a new burden-sharing deal last year to fund some government programmes.

Thomas Djiwandono, a deputy finance minister who is a former businessman, will soon face a fit-and-proper test by parliament for the new job, said the two sources, who sought anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to media.

The U.S.-educated Djiwandono will replace current BI board member Juda Agung, one of the sources added.

Djiwandono, Agung, the central bank's spokesperson, and the chairman of a paliamentary panel overseeing assessments for top central bank leadership did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Prabowo's spokesperson declined to comment.

The bank is set to hold its next monthly monetary policy review later this week.

Each member of the bank's board, comprised of a governor and several deputy governors, has a voting right to decide key interest rate levels and determines BI's policy.

Members are usually career central bankers, economists or former executives of commercial banks appointed by the president with parliamentary approval.

Domestic media IDNFinancials also reported the appointment, citing a source who said Djiwandono was expected to take up the new post in February, barring last-minute changes.

Last year, Djiwandono attended at least one central bank monetary policy review as a representative of the finance minister, but did not have a right to vote.

The move comes as parliament discusses a bill with provisions to strengthen the central bank's role in supporting economic growth.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 06:39:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4FFJS5NDIRN4RLTWFW5C5HXPGA.jpg?auth=fdb0f44be280c43c97e23f9554a33e80cda9effb4f83b29297f4c039f51db1f6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lawyer files impeachment complaint against Philippine President Marcos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/lawyer-files-impeachment-complaint-against-philippine-president-marcos-2026-01-19/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A lawyer filed an impeachment complaint against Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr on Monday, accusing him of betraying public trust by allowing his predecessor Rodrigo Duterte to be arrested and taken to The Hague to face trial.

The complaint, filed by Andre De Jesus, described the move against Duterte as an act of "kidnapping," echoing the narrative of the former president's family.

Duterte, president from 2016 to 2022, was arrested and taken to the International Criminal Court in the Hague in March over the thousands of killings that took place during his controversial war on drugs.

The complaint also accuses Marcos of constitutional violations over budget irregularities, failing to act against alleged graft involving flood control projects, and failing to answer allegations of drug use that have raised questions about his fitness to govern.

"We feel that this avenue would enable not just myself as complainant ... but the Filipino people to thrash out all these matters which are being raised and are not answered at all by the president and his cabinet and his officers," De Jesus told reporters in comments posted on X by DZRH radio.

Marcos' office said it respects this democratic process and would "trust that Congress, as a co-equal branch of government, will discharge its duties with honesty, integrity, and fidelity to the rule of law."

"While these processes take their course, the President will continue to govern, ensuring that public services remain uninterrupted and that the work of government stays focused on improving the lives of our people," the presidential communications office said in a statement.

The filing comes nearly a year after the lower house impeached Sara Duterte, Marcos' estranged Vice President and the daughter of his predecessor.

The impeachment was later struck down by the Supreme Court for breaching the Constitution's one‑year bar rule.

Although the lower house of Congress is no longer led by Marcos' cousin, Martin Romualdez, who resigned as House Speaker after being linked to the flood control corruption scandal, it remains dominated by the president's allies, raising doubts about whether the complaint against him can gain traction.

Marcos, elected in 2022, is serving a single six‑year term and is barred by the Constitution from seeking re‑election in 2028, leaving him with about two years remaining in office.

His vice president Sara Duterte is widely viewed as a strong contender for the 2028 presidential race.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 06:39:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DWHNUHMKVFMZ3IVLN6IPMG4J3Q.jpg?auth=6a83c9fac72aaffbfdfcf9874f13281cde33d6004f45b5c795610759e766bb91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll in Karachi mall fire jumps to 11</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/death-toll-karachi-mall-fire-jumps-11-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 06:40:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Live: EU leaders to meet 'in coming days' to discuss US tariffs over Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260119-live-eu-leaders-to-meet-in-the-coming-days-to-discuss-us-tariffs-over-greenland</link><description>The eight European countries targeted by US President Donald Trump for a 10% tariff for opposing American control of Greenland blasted the move Sunday, warning that his threats “undermine transatlantic relations and risk a dangerous downward spiral.”

The joint statement by some of America’s closest allies signaled a possible turning point in the recent tensions over sovereignty and security nearly 24 hours after Trump’s threat.

It was also the most forceful rebuke of Trump from the European allies since he returned to the White House almost a year ago. In recent months, Europeans have mostly opted for diplomacy and flattery around him, even when seeking an end to the war in Ukraine.

Sunday’s statement, as well as some European countries sending troops to Greenland for a Danish military training exercise, appeared to be a step away from that strategy.

Chapo wrote in a post on Facebook late on Sunday that Mozambique "is going through a tough time ... (and) the absolute priority at this moment is to save lives".

Heavy rains since mid-December have caused widespread floods in Mozambique's Gaza, Maputo and Sofala provinces, with several river basins above alert levels, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report on Sunday.

The OCHA report said authorities estimated that more than 400,000 people had been affected, with numbers expected to rise as rains continue.

Neighbouring South Africa has deployed an air force helicopter to Mozambique to help with search-and-rescue efforts.

Heavy rains have also affected parts of South Africa, including the northeast where its renowned Kruger National Park is located. On Monday Kruger reopened to day visitors after being closed for several days.

Flooding has become more frequent and severe in southeastern Africa as climate change makes storms in the adjacent Indian Ocean more powerful.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 07:31:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6LDRPCBZERNMTAJCLLLF23WPCE.jpg?auth=6991d0d0e4ef985327f2be9641ec91f94050e5f8d782a481b99c19289eeead99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll from high-speed train collision in Spain rises to 39, RTVE reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/death-toll-high-speed-train-collision-spain-rises-39-rtve-reports-2026-01-19/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The death toll from Sunday's collision between a derailing high-speed train and a second oncoming train in southern Spain has risen to 39, with 152 people injured, state broadcaster RTVE reported on Monday, citing police sources.

The accident happened at 7.45 p.m. local time (1845 GMT) on Sunday near Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, about 360 km (223 miles) south of the capital Madrid.

Over 200 trains between Madrid and the southern Andalucia region - including major cities Cordoba, Seville and Granada - have been cancelled throughout Monday, according to RTVE.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has cleared out his agenda for the day, his office said in a statement on Monday.

Video from the scene shared on social media on Sunday showed rescuers pulling passengers from twisted carriages lying on their side under the glare of floodlights. Some passengers climbed out of smashed windows, while others were wheeled away on stretchers.

There were around 400 passengers on the two trains, most of them Spaniards travelling back to and from Madrid after the weekend. It was unclear how many tourists could be onboard as January is not holiday season in Spain.

The cause for the crash is not yet known, Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente told reporters at a press conference at Atocha station in Madrid on Sunday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 07:31:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M7AZOUYYSZP2XLHKEB7SWT3PLQ.jpg?auth=864b7384f3d8a7da425aaf0badd82ba094d8dc904b5b997b3939c0dab085d862&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kazakhstan says Trump invited Tokayev to join the Gaza 'Board of Peace', Tengri news outlet reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kazakhstan-says-trump-invited-tokayev-join-gaza-board-peace-tengri-news-outlet-2026-01-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has been invited to join the Gaza "Board of Peace" proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and Tokayev has agreed, the Tengri news outlet on Monday quoted the Kazakh president's press secretary as saying.

The board would be chaired for life by Trump and would start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts, according to a copy of the letter and draft charter seen by Reuters.

Tokayev's spokesman, Ruslan Zheldibay, said that the Kazakhstan had been invited to become one of the founding states of the Board of Peace.

"The head of state sent a letter to the president of the United States expressing sincere gratitude and confirming his agreement to join this new association," Zheldibay was quoted as saying by Tengri.

Trump has invited 60 countries to join the "Board of Peace," of which he is to be the lifetime chairman, but permanent membership will be available to those who pay $1 billion.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 07:31:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JS7PDY4NOBN4FIRFZDRZFZHETA.jpg?auth=a450138d952231a34021c8449a1a4fe83de521eabe813cac8f532bba39432650&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan PM Takaichi to dissolve parliament Friday and call national election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-pm-takaichi-dissolve-parliament-friday-call-national-election-2026-01-19/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said she will dissolve parliament Friday and call a national election to seek voter backing for increased spending and a new security strategy expected to accelerate Japan's defence build up.

The snap vote will decide all 465 seats in parliament’s lower house and mark Takaichi's first electoral test since becoming Japan's first female premier in October.

Calling an early election would allow her to capitalise on strong public support to tighten her grip on the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and shore up her coalition’s fragile majority.

The election will test voter appetite for higher spending at a time when the rising cost of living is the public's top concern. A poll released by public broadcaster NHK last week found 45% of respondents cited prices as their main worry, followed by diplomacy and national security at 16%.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:36:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G3QSGQK34NPZPLSKQUKHMF6Q2E.jpg?auth=30b3e299ea30fdf59fe9e2d7cdf542a18fae8a01db1e10bf7cebd1a425fc6b87&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>No phones, pre-set tablets for delegates at Vietnam's Communist Party congress</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/no-phones-pre-set-tablets-delegates-vietnams-communist-party-congress-2026-01-19/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Delegates at Vietnam's Communist Party congress that started on Monday were given Samsung tablet computers without an internet connection, had no access to the mobile phone network and will have to stay in designated accommodation, two people briefed on the matter said.

The moves are part of tighter security for the week-long, once in five years event at which the 1,600 delegates will select the country's top leader for the remainder of the decade, with incumbent party chief To Lam seeking reconfirmation and more powers.

The foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In strict arrangements even by Vietnamese standards, where the one-party state monopolises information, mobile connections were jammed at the Hanoi congress venue and in surrounding areas, according to a Reuters reporter at the conference centre.

Delegates, who will vote on an unspecified day this week to elect the party's 200-strong central committee and will approve the congress resolution, were given tablets with only intranet functions to work on internal documents during the event, the two people said, declining to be named because information about the congress is deemed sensitive.

The delegates met on Monday for a preparatory session in a red-carpeted conference hall at the congress venue, with leaders on the stage under a towering statue of the party's founder Ho Chi Minh and the images of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin.

Delegates will also be prevented from carrying their mobile phones at the congress from Tuesday, a third person said, although the jamming of the mobile network will anyway make them useless for communication.

Representing roughly 5.6 million party members in the country of 100 million, delegates were also told to stay in designated accommodation during the week of the congress, including those from Hanoi, according to two sources.

Guidelines issued to reporters covering the congress prohibit them from carrying mobiles phones. They can use their own computers but can only connect to the event's network.

Journalists "shall not cause any negative impact on the image or reputation of Viet Nam, its senior leadership, or its delegates in any form," according to guidelines sent to foreign media by Vietnam's foreign ministry.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 09:36:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BNX2STO4ZFO2DPO5VDYWFU7NLM.jpg?auth=1021f955c7209841782e3456fae71b9b0a25beec03b4450e06cfe7c57d6c7468&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Trump would go down in world history if US took Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/kremlin-says-trump-would-go-down-world-history-if-us-took-greenland-2026-01-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that it was hard to disagree with experts who said that U.S. President Donald Trump would go down in the history of the United States and the world if he took control of Greenland.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said he was not discussing whether such a step would be good or bad - simply stating a fact.

Trump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He has said that if the United States does not take control of Greenland, then Russia or China will.

When asked to comment on Trump's remarks about the alleged Russian threat, Peskov said that there has been a lot of "disturbing information" lately but that the Kremlin would not comment on the alleged Russian designs on Greenland.

"Here, perhaps, it is possible to abstract from whether this is good or bad, whether it will comply with the parameters of international law or not," Peskov said.

"There are international experts who believe that by resolving the issue of Greenland's incorporation, Trump will certainly go down in history. And not only in the history of the United States, but also in world history."

Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have insisted the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.

Russia's foreign ministry last week said that it was unacceptable for the West to keep claiming that Russia and China threatened Greenland, and said the crisis over the territory showed the double-standards of Western powers which claimed moral superiority.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:29:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GP4NHJ22NIXBB4OTQENXOV5QI.jpg?auth=d9b56abca82753bfda71b66c775777aca715bb21faafffb1cfad89d6cf5e48a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran to consider lifting internet ban; state TV hacked</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/iran-consider-lifting-internet-ban-state-tv-hacked-2026-01-19/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Iran may lift its internet blackout in a few days, a senior parliament member said on Monday, after authorities shut communications while they used massive force to crush protests in the worst domestic unrest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

In the latest sign of weakness in the authorities' control, state television appeared to be hacked late on Sunday, briefly showing speeches by U.S. President Donald Trump and the exiled son of Iran's last shah calling on the public to revolt.

Iran's streets have largely been quiet for a week since anti-government protests that began in late December were put down in three days of mass violence.

An Iranian official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the confirmed death toll was more than 5,000 , including 500 members of the security forces, with some of the worst unrest taking place in ethnic Kurdish areas in the northwest. Western-based Iranian rights groups also say thousands were killed.

Opponents accuse the authorities of opening fire on peaceful demonstrators to crush dissent. Iran's clerical rulers say armed crowds egged on by foreign enemies attacked hospitals and mosques.

The death tolls dwarf those of previous bouts of anti-government unrest put down by the authorities in 2022 and 2009. The violence drew repeated threats from Trump to intervene militarily, although he has backed off since the large-scale killing stopped.

Ebrahim Azizi, the head of parliament's National Security and Foreign Policy Committee, said top security bodies would decide on restoring internet in the coming days, with service resuming "as soon as security conditions are appropriate".

Another parliament member, hardliner Hamid Rasaei, said authorities should have listened to earlier complaints by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei about "lax cyberspace".

Iranian communications including internet and international phone lines were largely stopped in the days leading up to the worst unrest. The blackout has since partially eased, allowing accounts of widespread attacks on protesters to emerge.

During Sunday's apparent hack into state television, screens broadcast a segment lasting several minutes with the on-screen headline "the real news of the Iranian national revolution".

It included messages from Reza Pahlavi, the U.S.-based son of Iran's last shah, calling for a revolt to overthrow rule by the Shi'ite Muslim clerics who have run the country since the 1979 revolution that toppled his father.

Pahlavi has emerged as a prominent opposition voice and has said he plans to return to Iran, although it is difficult to assess independently how strong support for him is inside Iran.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:30:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7BAA77MZEFLCBE3ALQZUTUACCI.jpg?auth=5ae69833ffd7195a71729814a58e837f2d6e8f01fa2a2bf09c02843618af0a31&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Passion and debts: the mixed legacy of the 2006 Turin Games</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/passion-debts-mixed-legacy-2006-turin-games-2026-01-19/</link><description>TURIN, Italy, Jan 19 (Reuters) - When Turin hosted the Winter Olympics 20 years ago, it transformed the city's image from grey industrial home of the troubled Fiat car-making empire to smart Mecca for food, culture and sport.

But the event - remembered in the north-western Italian metropolis for its "Passion lives here" slogan - left a legacy of large debts and unused infrastructure that offers a cautionary tale for Milano Cortina 2026.

"The 2006 Games were very positive in terms of Turin's morale and international visibility, but less so in terms of long-term infrastructure legacy," said renowned Turinese architect Carlo Ratti.

Marco Boglione, founder and chairman of Turin-based Basicnet (BCNT.MI) , opens new tab , which controls apparel and sportswear brands including Kappa and Superga, recalls the 2006 Olympics as a collective civic effort that reawakened his city.

"There was an incredible participation from everyone, public and private bodies, Olympic committee, everyone. That was our secret ... Turin was the first Olympic city to do something I'd call popular, collective, and it went very well," he said.

Milan, Italy's financial capital, and the Alpine resort of Cortina d'Ampezzo will co-host the 2026 Winter Games from February 6-22.

Turin's Olympic candidacy was dreamed up in the 1990s as part of efforts to reinvent the city and reduce its dependency on Fiat , the once-mighty Italian auto giant that is now a part of the global Stellantis (STLAM.MI) , opens new tab group.

The late Fiat boss Giovanni Agnelli, a towering business leader of postwar Italy and the grandfather of Stellantis Chairman John Elkann, was one of the main backers of the Olympics idea.

The Games gave Turin new or upgraded sporting venues, its first metro line, pedestrianised squares, better motorway connections to Alpine resorts that hosted part of the Olympics - and a new sense of local self-confidence.

"It put us on the map," said Marco Gay, head of local business lobby Unione Industriali. "It gave us the impetus to change, not to be a one-company city but a city that knows how to excel and does well in many sectors."

Boglione, who enlivened the 2006 Olympics with night-time side events, said Turin was the first Winter Games host that embraced the Summer Olympics format, with "a big city, a big event, lots of fun and entertainment for people in town".

Tourism has flourished, thanks to top-notch museums - including the world's oldest Egyptian museum - and a spruced-up city centre that bears witness to Turin's past as home to the royal Savoy family and as unified Italy's first capital.

In recent years Turin, home city of soccer clubs Juventus and Torino, hosted the Eurovision Song Contest and the ATP tennis finals, with both events staged at the Inalpi Arena, a venue originally built for the Olympics.

Another Olympic site, the Oval, is a candidate to host speed skating races for the French Alps 2030 Winter Olympics.

But other facilities have been abandoned, with the most egregious examples in mountain valleys near Turin: the bobsleigh track in Cesana, closed since 2011, and ski jumps in Pragelato, also closed and abandoned.

In Turin itself, one of the Olympic Villages has had a troubled history, with parts vandalised and occupied by migrants and drug addicts, until the area was cleared and turned into student and social housing.

"It took a month just to clear out all the garbage and debris. They did a great job, after the previous administration had literally forgotten about us. Now the neighbourhood is liveable," said Gilberto, a pensioner who lives in the area.

Another part of the village, the so-called "arcate" (arches) - near Fiat's historic Lingotto factory, now a shopping mall and museum venue - is abandoned, with draft plans to turn them into a biotech park and a sports centre.

"The area ... as it is now is a real waste, a real shame, it would be perfect for cultural initiatives," said Aurora, a 21-year-old nursery student. "I was born and raised here, it's my neighbourhood, but there is nothing here".

Francesco Ramella, a transport policy expert at the University of Turin and a fellow at the free-market Istituto Bruno Leoni think tank, has estimated that the Turin Olympics cost 3.3 billion euros ($3.8 billion).

They brought long-term benefits worth 2.5 billion euros, factoring in additional tourism and upgraded infrastructure, meaning a net economic loss of 1.3 billion euros, the professor said.

Milano Cortina is currently budgeted at 5.2 billion euros, including 3.5 billion euros of public money for infrastructure, and 1.7 billion euros in private funds to organise and hold the Games.

According to a study by Italian lender Banca Ifis, they should generate a 5.3-billion-euro "Olympic windfall", including 1.2 billion euros in extra tourism revenue and 3 billion euros from upgraded infrastructure.

Turin had offered to host the Games again in 2026, saying it would have been a low-cost alternative, re-using the 2006 infrastructure. Once that was rejected, the city turned down the chance to co-host along with Milan and Cortina.

"We did Turin a favour by not participating in the three-way Olympics," Antonino Iaria, urban planning councillor in 2019-2021 for the anti-establishment Five Star Movement (M5S), told Reuters.

He said the city would have seen little benefit from hosting "just two or three competitions".

Turin is today one of Italy's most indebted cities, largely due to the cost of investments made from the 1990s to prepare the city for the Games, even if the financial situation is easing.

Debt fell to 3.3 billion euros at the end of 2025 from 3.5 billion euros in 2024. Nevertheless, debt-servicing costs, standing at nearly 240 million euros, took up nearly a fifth of current cash expenditure.

Architecture Professor Guido Montanari, deputy mayor for the M5S in 2016-2019, said the post-Olympics financial hangover forced the city into harsh budget austerity, with social and welfare spending particularly affected.

Having seen what happened in Turin, he said he was "against any kind of Olympics, I think they are really something that should be avoided".

Needless to say, Milano Cortina backers are confident theirs will be a different story.

"Every euro (for the Olympics) is a euro well spent," Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, who hails from Milan, said in November.

The letter, seen by Reuters, came in response to a brief message to Trump from Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere and Finnish President Alexander Stubb opposing his decision to impose tariffs on European allies over their refusal to let the U.S. take control of Greenland, Stoere said in a statement.

"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America," Trump wrote in the letter.

Stoere said he had repeatedly told Trump that the Norwegian Nobel Committee, which awards the peace prize, is independent and that Norway's government has no control over it.

Trump has openly campaigned for the Nobel Peace Prize, which last year was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado.

Machado gave Trump her gold medal during a White House meeting last week, though the Norwegian Nobel Committee has said the prize cannot be transferred, shared or revoked.

In his letter, Trump also again questioned Danish sovereignty over Greenland , saying: "Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a 'right of ownership' anyway?

"There are no written documents, it's only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also."

"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland," Trump added.

Greenland, a vast, mineral-rich Arctic island, is an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:31:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KCDOH4LXLFOHNPFKV7ZFIP3GZE.jpg?auth=0958fed0e0e78c83c0372640dee4565c4a803ed719b177391166bcf04ed7506f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin’s special envoy Dmitriev to travel to Davos, meet members of U.S. delegation, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/putins-special-envoy-dmitriev-travel-davos-meet-members-us-delegation-sources-2026-01-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev will travel to the Swiss resort of Davos this week and hold meetings with members of the U.S. delegation on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, two sources with knowledge of the visit told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov said on Sunday that talks with U.S. officials on a resolution of the nearly four-year-old war with Russia would continue at the World Economic Forum (WEF) this week.

Trump will attend this year's annual meeting in person, after addressing the gathering by video link last year. He will be accompanied by a large U.S. delegation.

The Kremlin has said that it is preparing to welcome U.S. Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner to Moscow for peace talks on Ukraine, but that no dates have been set yet.

Dmitriev travelled to the U.S. in December and held two days of talks with Witkoff and Kushner. He briefed Putin after returning from the trip.

Witkoff and Kushner later met with officials from Ukraine and Europe, and then separately with the Ukrainian delegation, led Umerov. Witkoff called the talks "productive and constructive."

Trump and Putin discussed the Ukraine war during a telephone call on December 29 that was described by the White House as "positive."

In an interview with Reuters on January 14, Trump said that Ukraine, not Russia, is holding up a potential peace deal, in a statement that stands in marked contrast to that of the European leaders.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:31:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHIJGKFNIVPBFLAQKMECGARI6Q.jpg?auth=bf541580f7c05e624b64e6ce8c73b2efced5bbac8908dba3515a75746cf59ba1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>National security advisers to discuss Greenland in Davos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/national-security-advisers-discuss-greenland-davos-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - National security advisers from a number of countries are due to meet on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos on Monday, with Greenland among the subjects on the agenda, diplomatic sources said.

A Swiss foreign ministry spokesperson would only confirm that a meeting was due to take place but declined to comment on its content, timing or the participants.

One European diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said Greenland had been added to the agenda of the previously scheduled meeting since U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to impose extra tariffs on eight European countries until ownership of the Arctic island had been transferred to the United States.

Two other diplomatic sources said some of the security advisers would be represented by lower-level officials.

European leaders have called the Trump move wrong and are studying a number of possible trade retaliation measures.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HTYLGDRIFRKK7FHJMO3NCQVT2A.jpg?auth=6c236538e12a4902e8f1afa89c58a653217ce10cdda223cd6bb7dacb5403b318&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey sees Syria-Kurdish forces deal as "historic turning point", security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-sees-syriakurdish-forces-deal-historic-turning-point-security-sources-say-2026-01-19/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Turkey sees an integration deal between Syria's government and Kurdish forces there as an "historic turning point", ahead of which the Turkish intelligence agency played an intensive role to ensure restraint by parties involved, Turkish security sources said on Monday.

Turkey, a strong supporter of Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, sees the deal as critical to restoring state authority across Syria and to its own goal of eliminating terrorism at home, including advancing its long-running efforts toward securing peace with the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the sources said.

Ankara is the strongest foreign backer of the administration in neighbouring Damascus and had threatened its own military operation against the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Forces (SDF) in the north if the group did not agree to come under central government control.

On Sunday, Syria and the SDF struck a wide-ranging deal to integrate the Kurdish civilian and military authorities, ending days of fighting in which Syrian troops captured territory including key oil fields.

The Turkish security sources said the fight against Islamic State in Syria would continue uninterrupted despite the agreement.

Turkey's intelligence agency MIT had been in dialogue with the United States - which mediated the Sunday agreement - and the Syrian government ahead of the deal, the sources said. MIT also maintained intensive contacts to ensure restraint among parties, including protecting civilians and critical infrastructure, in Syria in the run-up to the deal, they added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IRMM6JBPVJP3RBCULWZUJX4ID4.jpg?auth=95fa15e49fd1f7ef7768627152f67695521a295053fcf5b1c74bb5476509eec5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 11 schoolchildren killed in South Africa minibus crash, reports say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-11-schoolchildren-killed-south-africa-minibus-crash-reports-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:24 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UK PM Starmer hopes calm discussion can avert trade war with Trump over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-pm-starmer-calls-calm-discussion-greenland-after-trump-tariff-threat-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:27 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Turkey sees Syria-Kurdish forces deal as "historic turning point", security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-sees-syriakurdish-forces-deal-historic-turning-point-security-sources-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:33 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>At least 11 schoolchildren killed in South Africa minibus crash, reports say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-11-schoolchildren-killed-south-africa-minibus-crash-reports-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:34 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UK PM Starmer hopes calm discussion can avert trade war with Trump over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-pm-starmer-calls-calm-discussion-greenland-after-trump-tariff-threat-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:32:37 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>National security advisers to discuss Greenland in Davos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/national-security-advisers-discuss-greenland-davos-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:01 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Turkey sees Syria-Kurdish forces deal as "historic turning point", security sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-sees-syriakurdish-forces-deal-historic-turning-point-security-sources-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>At least 11 schoolchildren killed in South Africa minibus crash, reports say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/least-11-schoolchildren-killed-south-africa-minibus-crash-reports-say-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UK PM Starmer hopes calm discussion can avert trade war with Trump over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uk-pm-starmer-calls-calm-discussion-greenland-after-trump-tariff-threat-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Residents left without power as Russia targets Ukraine's energy grid</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/residents-left-without-power-as-russia-targets-ukraine-s-energy-grid</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2a3b5d60-f51d-11f0-92ff-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-101549-101715-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Ultimate litmus test': Can the EU stand up to Trump over Greenland?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/ultimate-litmus-test-can-the-eu-stand-up-to-trump-over-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:33:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10ebe494-f51b-11f0-b61d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-100209-100830-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly wildfires in southern Chile force thousands to flee</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260119-wildfires-southern-chile-leave-dead-force-thousands-to-flee</link><description>Wildfires raging across central and southern Chile on Sunday left at least 19 people dead, scorched thousands of acres of forest and destroyed hundreds of homes, authorities said, as the South American country swelters under a heatwave .

Chilean President Gabriel Boric declared a state of catastrophe in the country’s central Biobio region and the neighbouring Ñuble region, around 500 kilometers (300 miles) south of Santiago, the capital.

The emergency designation allows greater coordination with the military to rein in over two dozen active wildfires that have so far blazed through 8,500 hectares (21,000 acres), according to the national forestry agency.

In a press conference from the hard-hit city of Concepción in the Biobio region, Boric expressed his support and condolences to the victims and warned that the government's initial reports of 19 people killed and 300 houses destroyed were expected to rise as the extent of the losses came into focus.

He estimated the total number of affected homes in the Biobio region alone to be “certainly more than a thousand, just so far”. Already the fires ravaging the hillsides forced 50,000 people to evacuate.

“The first priority, as you know, in these emergencies is always to fight and extinguish the fire. But we cannot forget, at any time, that there are human tragedies here, families who are suffering,” he said. “These are difficult times.”

His address followed complaints from local authorities that for hours, destruction was everywhere and help was nowhere.

“Dear President Boric, from the bottom of my heart, I have been here for four hours, a community is burning and there is no (government) presence,” Rodrigo Vera, the mayor of the small coastal town of Penco in the Biobio region, said on a local radio station earlier Sunday. “How can a minister do nothing but call me to tell me that the military is going to arrive at some point?”

Firefighters struggled to extinguish the flames, with the heat and strong winds hampering their efforts. Temperatures topped 38C (100F) on Sunday, and the scorching weather was expected to persist through Monday.

“Weather conditions for coming hours are not good and indicate extreme temperatures,” said Interior Minister Álvaro Elizalde.

Residents said the fires took them by surprise after midnight, trapping them in their homes.

“Many people didn’t evacuate. They stayed in their houses because they thought the fire would stop at the edge of the forest,” said John Guzmán, 55, surveying the scene in Penco, where smoke blanketed the sky in an orange haze. “It was completely out of control. No one expected it."

The fire engulfed most of Penco, burning cars, a school and a church. Thousands of people scrambled to take refuge in makeshift emergency shelters.

"We fled running, with the kids, in the dark,” said Juan Lagos, 52.

The government imposed a nighttime curfew in the area. Charred bodies were found across fields, homes, along roads and in cars.

“From what we can see, there are people who died ... and we knew them well," said Víctor Burboa, 54. "Everyone here knew them.”

Wildfires afflict central and southern Chile every summer, typically reaching a peak in February as temperatures surge and the country continues to reel from a yearslong drought. In 2024, massive fires ripping across Chile's central coastline killed at least 130 people, becoming the nation's deadliest natural disaster since a devastating 2010 earthquake.

President Donald Trump vowed on ‌Saturday to implement a wave of increasing tariffs on imports from European allies until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland, intensifying a dispute over the future of Denmark's vast Arctic island.

"Germany and France agree: we will not allow ourselves to be blackmailed," German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said at his ministry ‌where he received his French counterpart.

"Blackmail between allies of 250 years, blackmail between ​friends, is obviously unacceptable," French Finance Minister Roland Lescure said at the same event.

EU leaders are set to discuss options at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday. One ‍option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($107.7 billion) of U.S. imports that could automatically kick in on February 6 after a six-month suspension.

"We Europeans must make it clear: the limit has been reached," Klingbeil ⁠said. "Our hand is extended but we are not prepared to be blackmailed."

The other option is the so ‍far never used "Anti-Coercion Instrument", which could limit access to public tenders, investments or banking activity or restrict trade in ‌services, ‌in which the U.S. has a surplus with the bloc, including in digital services.

Lescure said that although the EU's anti-coercion instrument was above all a deterrent, it should be considered in the current circumstances.

"France wants us to examine this possibility, hoping, of course, that deterrence will prevail," Lescure said. ⁠He added that he hoped ⁠the transatlantic relationship ​will return to being "friendly and based on negotiation, rather than a relationship based on threats and blackmail".

Klingbeil said he was not interested in escalation, as it would come at the expense of economies on both sides of the ‍Atlantic.

Klingbeil and Lescure's U.S. counterpart Scott Bessent said on Sunday that European "weakness" necessitated U.S. control of Greenland for global stability.

Lescure said that Europe needed to adopt reforms to boost its technological edge and productivity in order to ​prove that Europe was strong and not weak.

"Our objective in the ‍coming days, weeks, quarters and years is to politely but firmly convince Scott Bessent that he is wrong," Lescure said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:56:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TXB63CZR3NOMHNARH75SEEOJ64.jpg?auth=3fcb4b50a0e4f92b99215740c03a0b1528477be098f0082765bb7d97dbbec46d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Harry's lawyer tells UK court Daily Mail complicit in unlawful acts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/prince-harry-elton-johns-lawsuit-against-daily-mail-publisher-begin-2026-01-19/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Prince Harry, Elton John and five other public figures were victims of widespread phone hacking and other unlawful acts by Britain's powerful Daily Mail with the complicity of executives and senior journalists, their lawyer told a court on Monday.

The British royal and other claimants accuse Associated Newspapers of unlawful behaviour from 1993 until 2011 and beyond in one of the most high-profile civil cases in the UK for years.
Associated calls the allegations part of a coordinated smear conspiracy against the press.
HARRY'S MISSION AGAINST PRESS

Over nine weeks, the legal team for Harry, singer John and the other claimants - John's husband David Furnish, actors Liz Hurley and Sadie Frost, anti-racism campaigner Doreen Lawrence and former lawmaker Simon Hughes - will argue private investigators instructed by the Mail unlawfully obtained material about them.

Their lawyer David Sherborne said practices included hacking voicemail messages, bugging landlines and obtaining private information by deception, known as "blagging".

"There can be little doubt that journalists and executives across the Mail titles engaged in or were complicit in the culture of unlawful information gathering that wrecked the lives of so many," Sherborne said in documents released at the start of the trial at London's High Court.

Harry, 41, who has long blamed the press for the death of his mother in a Paris car crash in 1997 as her vehicle sped away from paparazzi, listened on in court, sitting behind his lawyers with Frost and Hughes

Among those accused of involvement in wrongdoing were managing editors and senior journalists including the current editors of the Mail on Sunday and Sun newspapers.

Examples included finding out precise travel plans of Harry's former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, and a report about "private and intimate conversations" between Harry and his elder brother Prince William about a statement regarding images of their dead mother, the claimants' written submissions said.

In his witness statement, quoted in the submissions, Harry, whose case is based on 14 published newspaper stories, says the intrusion had been "terrifying" for loved ones, and created a "massive strain" on personal relationships, the submissions said.

Associated, whose titles had not previously been embroiled in the phone hacking scandal hanging over the British press for two decades until the case was filed in 2022, has denied wrongdoing and says the lawsuits should have been brought sooner.

It says evidence from former private detectives - some of whom have been convicted of crimes and whom Associated say have been paid by the claimants' legal team for their testimonies - was untrustworthy.

The publisher says the claimants, backed by rich supporters, were trying to reopen a public inquiry into press standards which was held almost 15 years ago after revelations of phone hacking caused public outrage.

Judge Matthew Nicklin's conclusions will not just put reputations on the line, but also determine legal costs running to tens of millions of dollars.

"This case asks whether Britain's most influential publisher truly sailed through the phone‑hacking era without touching the water — or whether it simply avoided the spotlight," media lawyer Mark Stephens said.

For Harry, it is the final instalment of his legal war on the British tabloids, having said it was his mission to clear up the press and hold those in senior positions to account.

He has already successfully sued Mirror Groups Newspapers (MGN) for damages while he won an apology and admission of some wrongdoing by Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper arm which settled ahead of a trial a year ago.

The prince is due to give evidence on Thursday, having become the first British royal to appear in a witness box in 130 years in 2023 during the MGN trial.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 10:58:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JL3A7VKR6ZNRTKST5BT6LLP7EA.jpg?auth=8ceccde57911f0c914e0dde3920c62fbb44482effe6f624b4ee173d271bab1d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Shooting at Czech town hall kills one, shooter also dead, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/shooting-czech-town-hall-kills-one-shooter-also-dead-police-say-2026-01-19/</link><description>PRAGUE, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A woman was killed and at least four other people including a police officer were wounded in a shooting at a Czech village's town hall on Monday, police said, adding the attacker had also been killed.

Trump stunned Europe on Saturday when he vowed to slap EU members Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden – and non-members Britain and Norway – with levies of up to 25 percent unless the Danish territory is ceded to the US.

French President Emmanuel Macron has raised the prospect of hitting back with the EU's trade weapon that was established in 2023 but has never been activated.

The leader of the liberal Renew group in the European Parliament , Valerie Hayer, also called for the weapon to be used.

Referred to as a "bazooka" or "nuclear" option, the instrument is intended to deter economic coercion against any of the EU's 27 member states.

The EU defines coercion as a third country "applying – or threatening to apply – measures affecting trade or investment", thereby interfering "with the legitimate sovereign choices" of the EU and member states.

The armoury allows the EU to take measures such as import and export restrictions on goods and services in its single market of 450 million people.

It also gives Brussels the power to limit American companies' access to public procurement contracts in Europe .

The EU last year threatened to use the weapon during difficult trade negotiations with Trump to avoid steep levies but the two sides struck a deal.

A major target could be American tech giants since the US has a services surplus with the EU.

Brussels previously drew up a list of US services to potentially target.

The instrument's creation came after Lithuania accused China of banning its exports because Vilnius allowed a Taiwanese diplomatic representation to be opened on its soil in 2021.

Both the commission and member states have the right to seek its activation, but it would then need the green light of at least 55 percent of the member countries voting in favour, representing 65 percent of the bloc's population.

Even if Brussels were to activate the weapon, it could take months before any measures were taken, according to the rules.

First, the European Commission has four months to investigate the third country accused of detrimental trade policies – then member states would have eight to 10 weeks to back any proposal for action.

Only then would the commission have a green light to prepare measures, to take effect within six months. The EU says the timeframe is indicative.

But even just triggering an investigation under the instrument would send a powerful message that Brussels is willing to fight back against its important ally.

"The United States is making a miscalculation that is not only dangerous but could be painful," Renew group's Hayer said in a statement.

"The anti-coercion instrument is our economic nuclear weapon," she said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:00:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dfd7a142-de57-11f0-9e40-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25353107331920.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Influential Israeli minister Smotrich calls for US-led centre for Gaza to be shuttered</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/influential-israeli-minister-smotrich-calls-us-led-centre-gaza-be-shuttered-2026-01-19/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday to shut a U.S.-led multinational coordinating centre that supports President Donald Trump’s plan to end the Gaza war .

Washington established the Civil Military Coordination Centre (CMCC) last October as a centre for civilian and military personnel from other countries to work alongside U.S. and Israeli officials on post-war Gaza planning.

"The time has come to dismantle the headquarters in Kiryat Gat," said Smotrich, the influential, far-right cabinet minister, in remarks shared by his office to media, referring to the Israeli city northeast of Gaza where the centre is based.

The Israeli prime minister's office, the U.S. State Department and the U.S. military's Central Command did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the remarks.

Smotrich also said that Britain, Egypt and other countries that are "hostile to Israel and undermine its security" should be removed from the CMCC. The British and Egyptian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Central Command in December said that 60 countries and organisations were represented at the centre. The CMCC has also been tasked with facilitating humanitarian aid entering Gaza.

The U.S.-led CMCC was established after Trump announced his 20-point plan to end the war. Germany, France, and Canada are also among countries that have sent personnel there.

Smotrich, speaking at an event marking the establishment of a new Jewish settlement in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, said that Hamas should be given a "very short" ultimatum to disarm and go into exile, and once that ultimatum expires, the military should storm Gaza with "full force" to destroy the militant group.

"Mr. Prime Minister, it's either us or them. Either full Israeli control, the destruction of Hamas, and the continued long-term suppression of terrorism, encouragement of the enemy's emigration outward and permanent Israeli settlement," he said.

The plan, announced by Trump in September, states that members of Hamas who commit to peaceful coexistence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Those who want to leave Gaza will be given safe passage to other countries.

The White House last week announced that the president's plan to end the war was moving to the second phase, which would include the demilitarization and reconstruction of Gaza.

Under the initial phase of the plan, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza that went into effect in October.

Hamas also released the remaining living hostages abducted from Israel during the October 2023 attack, who had been held in Gaza since then. The remains of all but one deceased hostage have been handed over as well.

Since the ceasefire started, Israel has repeatedly carried out air strikes in Gaza which it has said were responding to or fending off attacks carried out by Palestinian militants.

Over 460 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed in Gaza since the ceasefire came into effect.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:24:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RP7BVFFXUVNNPIJRGZRDWZHUSA.jpg?auth=01b3cd15347b5d2cadfaafb8124eeb751d768d4d8287f07446a78dbfcd862a8c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A year into his return, Trump wields executive power with few restraints</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/year-into-his-return-trump-wields-executive-power-with-few-restraints-2026-01-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday will mark his first year back in the White House after a shock-and-awe policy blitz that has expanded presidential power and reshaped America's relations with the world. As he enters his second year, he appears increasingly unconstrained, pursuing policies that have deepened divisions in the country.

In recent weeks, Trump ordered a more aggressive federal crackdown on illegal immigration in Minnesota that led to the shooting death of an unarmed woman motorist by a federal agent, oversaw an audacious military raid on Venezuela to capture President Nicolas Maduro , revived his controversial plan to take over Greenland , threatened to bomb Iran , and shrugged off concerns over a criminal investigation into Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.

"I don't care," Trump told Reuters in an Oval Office interview last week when asked about the potential economic fallout from the probe into Powell. Speaking to The New York Times on January 7, Trump said the only check on him as commander-in-chief to launch military strikes abroad was "my own morality."

Taken together, Trump’s comments underscore a view of the presidency in which he is constrained chiefly by his own judgment rather than institutional restraint.

Anna Kelly, a White House spokeswoman, said Trump's first instinct is diplomacy and he makes all decisions thoughtfully. But she added he keeps all options on the table and decided to send the U.S. military into Venezuela to capture Maduro, and to bomb three Iranian nuclear facilities last year, "after both failed to negotiate in a serious way."

When Trump triumphantly returned to the White House on January 20, 2025, for a second term, he vowed to remake the economy, the federal bureaucracy, immigration policy and much of U.S. cultural life. He has delivered on much of that agenda, becoming one of the most powerful presidents in modern U.S. history.

Like all U.S. presidents who cannot seek another term, Trump faces the almost inevitable waning of power in his second year. He remains a deeply unpopular figure: a growing number of Americans are unhappy with his handling of the economy and have concerns about his priorities. But opinions are deeply polarized and he still enjoys substantial support among his core supporters.

Trump's approval rating stands at 41% according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted last week, with 58% of U.S. adults disapproving of his job performance. The number is low for U.S. presidents in general but not the lowest of Trump's second term.

"Trump's total disregard for the rule of law or basic checks and balances has made Americans less safe across the board," said Democratic strategist Alex Floyd, adding that voters could punish Republicans for what he described as "lawless behavior."

In his interview with Reuters, Trump acknowledged that Republicans were in danger of losing control of Congress in the November elections, saying history does not favor the party of the president in midterms. Earlier, he told a gathering of Republican lawmakers to fight to retain control of Congress, or a newly empowered Democratic majority in the House of Representatives would impeach him for the third time.

When asked by Reuters about Americans' worries about high prices - the top issue for voters ahead of the elections - Trump repeated his claim the economy was the "strongest" in history, despite data showing stubbornly high inflation.

In recent weeks, Trump has tried to address concerns over the cost of living in speeches and with other actions, but has complicated that effort by simultaneously calling the issue of affordability a Democratic "hoax."

MOST POWERFUL PRESIDENT SINCE 1930s

In his first year back in the White House, Trump has cut the size of the federal civilian workforce , dismantled and closed government agencies, slashed humanitarian aid to foreign countries, ordered sweeping immigration raids and deportations, and sent National Guard troops into Democratic-run cities.

He has also triggered trade wars by imposing tariffs on goods from most countries, passed a massive tax-and-spending-cut bill, prosecuted political enemies , canceled or restricted access to some vaccines , and attacked universities , law firms and media outlets .

Despite promising to end Russia's war in Ukraine on the first day he was in office, Trump has made little progress toward a peace deal, while asserting he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots.

All modern presidents have sought to expand their presidential power, but this year Trump has increased executive might at a rate rarely seen before, historians and analysts say. He has done this through executive orders and emergency declarations that have shifted decision-making away from Congress and to the White House.

The conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court have mostly sided with Trump, and the Republican-controlled Congress has done little to stand in his way. And unlike his first term, Trump has total control over his cabinet, which is packed with loyalists.

Timothy Naftali, a presidential historian, said Trump has wielded power with fewer constraints in his second term than any president since Franklin Roosevelt.

In the first few years of his 1933-1945 White House tenure, Roosevelt, a Democratic president, enjoyed large majorities in Congress, which passed most of his domestic agenda to expand government with little resistance. He also enjoyed significant public support for his efforts to tackle the Great Depression and faced a fractured Republican opposition.

Analysts and party strategists say Trump's difficulty in convincing voters that he understands their struggles with high living costs could prompt some Republican lawmakers to distance themselves in an effort to protect their seats in November.

Aides say Trump will frequently hit the road this year to promote his economic agenda to try to convince voters he has a plan to reduce high prices, even though he is not on the ballot in November.

But his economic speeches in recent weeks have frequently been meandering and unfocused, and he has continued to focus much of his attention on foreign affairs, a lack of message discipline that alarms some Republican strategists and candidates.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:25:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BVPSGM2LUBNH5NHPI6TAB2AVTY.jpg?auth=ac02cea2cde55c35903149b41d2a27f03d80d569cc3b30b663c81f8e3c53b491&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian troops consolidate hold after abrupt Kurdish withdrawal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/syrian-troops-consolidate-hold-after-abrupt-kurdish-withdrawal-2026-01-19/</link><description>RAQQA/ Syria, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Syrian government troops tightened their grip on Monday across a swathe of northern and eastern territory abruptly abandoned the previous day by Kurdish forces, in a dramatic shift that consolidated President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rule.

After days of fighting with government forces, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), once the main U.S. allies in Syria, agreed on Sunday to withdraw from two Arab-majority provinces they had controlled for years, including oil fields.

It marks the biggest shift in Syria's control map since Islamist fighters led by Sharaa toppled President Bashar al-Assad in 2024. The balance of power had been tilting Sharaa's way after months of deadlock in talks with the SDF over government demands its forces merge fully with Damascus.

Neighbour Turkey, which has repeatedly sent forces into northern Syria to curb Kurdish power since 2016, welcomed the agreement signed by its ally Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi, voicing hope it would help bring stability and security.

Reuters journalists saw government forces deployed in the city of Raqqa that the SDF had captured from Islamic State in 2017, and at oil and gas facilities in the eastern province of Deir al-Zor - both areas the Kurdish forces had held for years.

The SDF, spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, had established control of wide areas of Syria during the 2011-2024 civil war, whilst fighting with the support of U.S. troops against Islamic State. The United States, which has since established close ties with Sharaa under President Donald Trump, has been closely involved in mediation between the sides.

In Raqqa, government internal security forces and military police were setting up checkpoints and checking IDs.

Security sources in Raqqa told Reuters that the city had been cleared of SDF fighters overnight, though some snipers had held out until Sunday evening.

In Deir al-Zor, a Reuters reporter saw state security forces at both the al-Omar oilfield – Syria’s largest – and the Conoco gas field. Al-Omar had long served as the SDF's main base in the area.

Two guards stood outside the Conoco field’s gate. A large Syrian military convoy was deploying to al-Omar. There was no visible SDF presence.

Abdi, the SDF commander, confirmed on Sunday that the SDF had agreed to withdraw from Deir al-Zor and Raqqa provinces, both of which have Arab majorities. The 14-point deal published by Syria's presidency showed his signature alongside Sharaa's.

Abdi said he is set to meet Sharaa in Damascus on Monday and would share the details of the agreement with the public after his return to SDF-held territory, Kurdish media reported.

Abdi said his group remained committed to protecting the "achievements" of the Kurdish region in the northeast.

“This war was imposed on us. We wanted to prevent it, but unfortunately, because it was planned by many forces, it was imposed on us," Kurdish media quoted him as saying.

The SDF retains control of the northeastern province of Hasaka, which includes the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli and the main camps and prisons holding Islamic State fighters and civilians captured after the group's defeat in Syria in 2017.

The deal stipulates that those sites, along with all border crossings and oil and gas fields, would be handed to Syrian government control, steps the SDF had long resisted. The timing of the handover of the prisons and camps was not announced.

The deal also says that all SDF forces will be merged into the central defence and interior ministries as "individuals" and not as whole units, as the SDF had sought.

The agreement commits the SDF to expel all non-Syrian figures affiliated to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a Kurdish militant group which fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey.

Senior figures from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling AK Party said this removed a major obstacle to Turkey’s peace process with PKK militants.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:25:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JAYWB52EWJIULOZNE4QV5YIAME.jpg?auth=773608aadc42cb306279c67e019e092ee3a70833bb351b5f33a66a18634d895a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia hits energy system in several regions of Ukraine, Kyiv says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-hits-energy-system-several-regions-ukraine-kyiv-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - Russia launched a barrage of drone strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure overnight on Monday, cutting off power in five regions across the country amid freezing temperatures and high demand, Ukrainian officials said.

The Ukrainian air force said that Russian troops had launched 145 drones. Air defence units shot down 126 of them, it said.

"As of this morning, consumers in Sumy, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv regions are without power," the energy ministry said in a statement. "Emergency repair work is underway if the security situation allows."

In the southern Odesa region, energy and gas infrastructure was damaged, the regional governor said, adding that one person was hurt in the attack.

DTEK, Ukraine's largest private energy company, said its energy facility in Odesa was "substantially" damaged, knocking out power for 30,800 households.

A local power grid company in northern Chernihiv region said that five important energy facilities were damaged, leaving tens of thousands of consumers without power.

Russia also hit Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv with missiles on Monday morning, significantly damaging a critical infrastructure facility, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said.

Moscow has stepped up a winter campaign of strikes on the Ukrainian energy system, including generation, electricity transmission and gas production facilities, amid freezing temperatures that complicate repair works.

The attacks have caused long blackouts.

"Being without electricity for more than 16 hours is awful," Serhii Kovalenko, CEO of energy distribution company Yasno, said on Facebook late on Sunday. "And it's not because of the energy companies, but because of cynical attacks by the enemy, who is trying to create a humanitarian disaster."

Ukraine declared an energy emergency last week as its grid crumbled due to accumulated wartime damage and a new targeted wave of Russian bombardments.

Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday the government would implement projects to improve electricity transmission from the western part of the country to its power-hungry east.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:25:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XRJTTJSBZNJEPFF4M4E5AJAQAY.jpg?auth=7bdcd5a41f6472377126b4a7801197e0c0fc1ebd18f05c15e8d768c2f47f188f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian airstrikes kill scores of militants in Borno, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-airstrikes-kill-scores-militants-borno-military-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Nigerian air force strikes destroyed about 10 canoes and killed more than 40 militants preparing attacks in Borno state, the military said late on Sunday, in the latest in a series of operations targeting groups around Lake Chad.

Borno, where fighters from militant groups Boko Haram and ISWAP have recently intensified attacks on military convoys and civilians, remains the epicentre of the 17-year Islamist insurgency in the northeast of the country.

Air force spokesperson Ehimen Ejodame said airstrikes on January 15 and 16 in the Musarram and Azir communities signalled renewed military pressure on insurgents who still use the region's rugged terrain to launch raids on troops and nearby communities.

The air force said it hit militants in Musarram on Thursday after intelligence showed they were massing in canoes to attack Baga town and the fish dam area of Lake Chad.

Three bombing runs broke up the group, with fleeing gunmen tracked into nearby trees and neutralised, Ejodame said in a statement.

Troops and local officials reported the airstrikes foiled the planned attack.

On Friday in Azir, close-air-support aircraft struck terrorists retreating from an earlier clash and regrouping under trees, killing several and restoring order, Ejodame said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:26:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Astronomers spot mysterious 'iron bar' in well-known Ring Nebula</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/science/astronomers-spot-mysterious-iron-bar-well-known-ring-nebula-2026-01-19/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Ring Nebula, a stunning celestial structure residing in our neighborhood of the Milky Way galaxy, was discovered by French astronomer Charles Messier in 1779 and has been studied extensively ever since. But that does not mean we have it all figured out.

Researchers have spotted a large cloud of iron atoms in the shape of a bar stretching about 3.7 trillion miles (6 trillion km) long across the face of the nebula, which is a glowing shell of gas and dust expelled by a dying star, and are searching for an explanation.

They said it is possible the iron atoms, collectively comparable to the mass of Earth's molten iron core , are the remnants of a rocky planet that was vaporized when the star threw off its outer layers, though they cautioned that such an explanation is mere conjecture at the moment. The inner rocky planets of our solar system, potentially even Earth, could face the same fate when the sun goes through these same death throes billions of years from now.

The researchers made the observation using a new instrument called WEAVE, short for WHT Enhanced Area Velocity Explorer, on the William Herschel Telescope, located on the Atlantic Ocean island of La Palma in Spain's Canary Islands.

"It is exciting to see that even a very familiar object - much studied over many decades - can throw up a new surprise when observed in a new way," said astronomer Roger Wesson of Cardiff University in Wales and University College London, lead author of the research published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society , opens new tab .

"It's a classic object for professional and amateur astronomers alike to observe," Wesson said. "Although it's too faint to see with the naked eye, it's quite easy to spot with binoculars. In a small telescope, you can see the ring-like appearance."

The Ring Nebula, also called Messier 57, is located about 2,600 light years from Earth in the constellation Lyra. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km). It is believed to have formed roughly 4,000 years ago, very recently in cosmic time.

It is familiar even to beginning students of astronomy.

"You'll find it in many astronomy textbooks," University College London astronomer and study co-author Janet Drew said.

That is why the iron bar is so intriguing.

"No other chemical element that we have detected seems to sit in this same bar. This is weird, frankly. Its importance lies in the simple fact that we have no ready explanation for it, yet," Drew said. "The origin of the iron might trace back to the vaporization of a planet. But there could be another way to make the feature that doesn't involve a planet."

"A planet like the Earth would contain enough iron to form the bar, but how it would end up in a bar shape has no good explanation," Wesson said.

The nebula formed when a star about twice the sun's mass ran out of nuclear fuel in its core, swelled up into what is called a red giant and expelled its outer layers before becoming a compact stellar remnant known as a white dwarf, approximately the size of our planet.

"From the perspective of Earth, it has the appearance of a ring, although it's believed that it's actually more like a cylinder of material that we are seeing end-on. It's made up mostly of hydrogen and helium, with small quantities of heavier elements," Wesson said.

About 3,000 such nebulas are known in our galaxy. Studying them lets astronomers examine the life stage of stars when chemical elements forged by nuclear processes inside them are released into interstellar space to be recycled and contribute to the next generation of stars and planets.

"We look forward to getting more data to follow up on this discovery, to try to unravel this new problem and work out where the iron bar has come from," Wesson said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 11:26:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2WQK7C75WFOWHDJYWBCNIAT27A.jpg?auth=aa47e8848ac07afbb4dbb090486fa2f4490368637fb13c1fc5fcea6b39298d07&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>BHP refused permission to appeal UK judgment over 2015 Brazil dam collapse</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/bhp-refused-permission-appeal-uk-judgment-over-2015-brazil-dam-collapse-2026-01-19/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 19 (Reuters) - BHP (BHP.AX) , opens new tab was on Monday refused permission to appeal against a ruling that it is liable for the 2015 collapse of a dam in southeastern Brazil, in a London lawsuit potentially worth tens of billions of pounds.

In November, London's High Court ruled BHP was legally responsible for the collapse of the Fundao dam in Mariana, southeastern Brazil, which was owned and operated by BHP and Vale's (VALE3.SA) , opens new tab Samarco joint venture.

BHP's application for permission to appeal that ruling was denied by the High Court, though BHP can still apply directly to the Court of Appeal.

The claimants' lawyers have previously valued the lawsuit, one of the largest in English legal history, at up to 36 billion pounds ($48.26 billion) and were seeking nearly 200 million pounds in legal fees after their initial victory.

The initial stage of the case was to determine whether BHP was liable to the claimants, with a further trial to decide on damages to be paid due to begin in October, with a ruling likely at some point in mid-2027.

Hundreds of thousands of Brazilians, dozens of local governments and around 2,000 businesses sued BHP over the collapse of the Fundao dam, which was Brazil's worst environmental disaster.

The collapse unleashed a wave of toxic sludge that killed 19 people, left thousands homeless, flooded forests and polluted the length of the Doce River.

Judge Finola O'Farrell ruled last year that BHP should not have continued to raise the height of the dam, which ultimately caused its collapse.

Bringing Ukraine's voter registry up to date and making the proper preparations for a vote will take significant time, Oleh Didenko, the head of Ukraine's Central Election Commission, told Reuters in a rare interview with international media.

Amid diplomatic efforts to end the war, U.S. President Donald Trump has demanded Ukraine hold elections, even though they are banned under martial law - in force since the invasion - and a majority of Ukrainians oppose a wartime ballot.

Organising elections as soon as possible is part of a 20-point peace framework that Ukrainian and U.S. negotiators have been working to finalise in recent months.

Under pressure from Trump, Zelenskiy said last month he was ready to hold elections if the United States and other allies could ensure the security of the vote. At his request, lawmakers and experts started a working group to draft proposals for the significant legal changes needed to hold an election.

A ceasefire and safe conditions for voters are prerequisites for any vote, Didenko said. Beyond that, Ukraine faces numerous challenges: millions of its citizens are abroad or at the front line, its infrastructure has been destroyed and its voter register does not reflect migration changes.

"Issues of electoral law are very complicated in peacetime in Ukraine: they were not resolved quickly or easily. So now these issues are even more complicated because there are significantly more challenges," Didenko said.

Ukraine last held presidential and parliamentary elections in 2019, when Zelenskiy won by a landslide to become president.

His five-year mandate expired last year and Russia has questioned his legitimacy, but Kyiv's allies have rejected Moscow's assertions and Zelenskiy's ratings are high.

In the 2019 presidential election, almost 19 million people cast their ballot from 30 million registered voters. At least 20% of those lived in parts of Ukraine now occupied by Russia, pre-war data shows.

President Vladimir Putin has said Ukrainians living in Russia must be able to participate - an idea rejected by Zelenskiy.

Voting in occupied territories is out of the question but Ukraine will ensure voting rights for people who manage to reach Kyiv-controlled territory, Didenko said.

The commission allowed voters to update their data online this month - a function suspended since 2022 for security reasons - as part of a broader effort to bring its registry up to date.

There are about 5.8 million Ukrainian refugees overseas, the majority in Europe, according to United Nations refugee agency data from January.

As of now, there is no final assessment of voter numbers abroad as many have not updated their registration.

"We need to locate the voters and create voting infrastructure," Didenko said.

Ukraine had 102 polling stations in its embassies and consulates before the war. That is insufficient to ensure refugees can vote, Didenko said.

The commission believes opening polling stations outside diplomatic premises is the most realistic solution, Didenko said, as online and postal voting are at risk of external interference and attempts to discredit the process.

Ensuring voting rights for servicemen is another challenge although Didenko said Ukraine could build on its experience in organising military voting.

In the 2019 elections, thousands of troops had already been deployed to eastern Ukraine to battle Russia-backed separatists who had seized territory five years earlier. The scale of the problem now is much greater, with about 800,000 Ukrainians serving in the army.

According to Ukraine's election commission, almost 2,000 of over 30,000 polling stations have been destroyed or damaged, mostly in the east.

While Zelenskiy has said security is a core issue for any elections, Russia has systemically rejected the idea of a ceasefire. Putin said in December that Moscow was ready "to think about" ensuring security in Ukraine during a vote.

Only 9% of Ukrainians back the idea of an election before a ceasefire, a poll by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology showed in December. About 57% see elections as possible only after a final peace deal and the end of the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:51:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DALV2S2BPBJL7EKSEJGNCV2OTI.jpg?auth=4f828b71943e65aa3b1555a0f3a6b02de86bc18ae1b652e1df8f76d2b98d9b57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed in blast in Afghan capital Kabul, Taliban interior ministry says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/several-killed-blast-afghan-capital-kabul-taliban-interior-ministry-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>KABUL, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Several people were killed in a blast in Afghan capital Kabul's Shahr-e-Naw area, the Taliban interior ministry said on Monday.

While weather conditions overnight helped control some fires, the largest were still active, with adverse conditions expected throughout the day, security minister, Luis Cordero, said at a news briefing on Monday.

"The projection we have today is of high temperatures," Cordero said, and the main worry was that new fires would be triggered throughout the region.

Parts of central and southern Chile were under extreme heat warnings with temperatures expected to reach up to 37 Celsius (99 Fahrenheit).

As of late Sunday, Chile's CONAF forestry agency said firefighters were combating 23 fires across the country, the largest of which were in regions of Ñuble and Bío Bío, where President Gabriel Boric declared a state of catastrophe.

Over 20,000 hectares (77 square miles) have been razed so far, an area about the size of Seattle, with the largest fire surpassing 14,000 hectares on the outskirts of the coastal city Concepcion.

The fast-moving blaze tore through the towns of Penco and Lirquen over the weekend, destroying hundreds of homes and killing several people, with authorities still assessing the damage.

Authorities are currently battling the fire as it threatened Manzano prison on the edge of Concepcion and the town of Tome to the north.

Both Chile and Argentina rang in the new year with heat waves which have continued into January.

"The context is very concerning... We are expecting things to be much worse in 2026," Julien Harneis, U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, told reporters in Geneva.

Some 21 million people will need humanitarian assistance this year, an increase from 19.5 million the previous year, according to the U.N. The situation has been aggravated by economic collapse and disruption of essential services including health and education, and political uncertainty, Harneis said.

Funding Yemen traditionally received from Western countries was now being cut back, Herneis said, pointing to hopes for more help from Gulf countries , opens new tab .

The U.S. slashed its aid spending this year, and leading Western donors also pared back help as they pivoted to raise defence spending, triggering a funding crunch for the U.N.

Yemen has been the focus of one of the world's largest humanitarian operations in a decade of civil war that disrupted food supplies. The country has also been a source of heightened tensions in recent months between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

"Children are dying and it's going to get worse," Harneis said. Food insecurity is projected to worsen across the country, with higher rates of malnutrition anticipated, he stated.

"For 10 years, the U.N. and humanitarian organisations were able to improve mortality and improve morbidity...this year, that's not going to be the case."

He said Yemen’s humanitarian crisis threatened the region with diseases like measles and polio that could cross borders.

In 2025 680 million dollars was afforded to the U.N. in Yemen, about 28% of the intended target, Harneis said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:51:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/73ZMBNYUPRM3PN5FIVLLCF6DF4.jpg?auth=c1ecd21a60b3b24e6ad39e9f94cba4c8edeb2a9cac9501271d89762f408eede5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungarian opposition taps former Shell executive for economics role ahead of April election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarian-opposition-taps-former-shell-executive-economics-role-ahead-april-2026-01-19/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar has tapped former Shell (SHEL.L) , opens new tab executive Istvan Kapitany for a senior economics role in his team, as he seeks to defeat nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban in an election in April.

How to revive the economy from its three-year slumber is a focus of campaigning ahead of the April 12 vote and Magyar's centre-right Tisza party leads over Fidesz in most polls, though many voters are still undecided.

Kapitany, a former global executive vice president at Shell who also led a Hungarian association of executives between 2020 and 2025, said the release of European Union funding and predictable policies would help revive the economy.

Instead of supporting manufacturing megafactories, which has been a key plank of Orban's policy since 2010, small local businesses should be made more competitive, he said in a Facebook video announcing his appointment.

A key task would be to restore confidence by creating a predictable investment environment, which Kapitany said had been marred by Orban's ad hoc policy changes and by windfall taxes on certain sectors to plug budget holes.

"I would like this country to perform better and I am willing to work for it," Kapitany said in the video.

"However, I would like to stress that there are no miracles. We need work, a decent approach, and corruption is obviously the death of business," he said, stressing the importance of "a level playing field."

Kapitany will work with Tisza fiscal and tax policy advisor Andras Karman, a former Erste Bank (ERST.VI) , opens new tab executive.

The EU has suspended billions of euros of funding over Orban's rule-of-law reforms, forcing the government to cut back on public investments in a blow to the economy. Orban, in power since 2010, has said Hungary was no more corrupt than other EU members.

"We need to bring the EU funds home ... We need to use them fairly and well," Kapitany said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:51:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HEIZLLXTZNMC5LTRGXR7NUKNTY.jpg?auth=fd7dec66e706622476e4713238b33813cc2b39129003f30c9c7582aa7c805aef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez travels to site of deadly train crash</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/spanish-pm-pedro-sanchez-travels-to-site-of-deadly-train-crash</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:52:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20d35ef2-f532-11f0-bb02-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-130155-130508-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trains collide in southern Spain, killing dozens</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trains-collide-in-southern-spain-killing-dozens</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 12:52:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/404a9e0a-f52b-11f0-a4e0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-120121-120252-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Benin opposition fails to secure seats in parliamentary election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/benin-opposition-fails-secure-seats-parliamentary-election-2026-01-19/</link><description>COTONOU, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Benin's political opposition has failed to win any seats in parliament, according to provisional election results released over the weekend, as two parties aligned with President Patrice Talon secured control over the entire body.

The January 11 election came just over one month after soldiers attempted to topple Talon in a failed coup bid and three months before the West African nation holds a presidential election that will end his 10-year tenure.

The Progressive Union for Renewal will hold 60 of 109 seats in the National Assembly, having won 41.15% of the vote, according to provisional results that still need to be validated by the Constitutional Court. The Republican Bloc will hold 49 seats, having won 36.64% of the vote.

The Democrats, the main opposition party linked to President Patrice Talon's predecessor and rival Thomas Boni Yayi, received 16.14% of the vote, failing to meet the 20% threshold required for parliamentary representation. That threshold was increased from 10% as part of electoral code reforms passed in 2024.

The Democrats previously held more than 20 seats.

The election outcome "deepens political exclusion and reduces institutional checks on the executive," Consultancy Signal Risk said in a note.

Nadin Kokode, a member of the Democrats, said last week that pro-Talon parties had done everything in their power to exclude the opposition from the political scene for the next seven-year term.

He complained of electoral irregularities including the late opening of polling stations, a lack of voting equipment and party supervisors' exclusion from the vote counting process.

The electoral commission reported a few minor logistical challenges during the poll but said incidents were promptly brought under control.

It said voter turnout was 36.73%.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:46:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NJV3OZAUJZKBLNOW7TDNUBYWX4.jpg?auth=975e53f34eeda24d0c58d13f5f5ed85d14a3206029aa6a5d47db44d9e8b37c7f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Army returns to strategic east Congo town after rebel withdrawal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/army-returns-strategic-east-congo-town-after-rebel-withdrawal-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - Congolese soldiers and combatants from a pro-government militia have re-entered the eastern town of Uvira, residents said on Monday, just over a month after it fell to Rwanda-backed M23 rebels in a blow to peace efforts mediated by the Trump administration.

M23 entered Uvira , an important base for the Congolese army near the border with Burundi, on December 10, days after Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi and Rwandan leader Paul Kagame met President Donald Trump in Washington and reaffirmed a U.S.-brokered peace deal .

The capture marked the rebels' biggest gains in months, fueling fears of regional spillover from fighting that has killed thousands and displaced hundreds of thousands in the last year.

M23 staged a lightning advance in January 2025 and still holds more territory than ever before, including Goma and Bukavu, the capitals of North and South Kivu provinces respectively.

After U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in December that Rwanda's actions in mineral-rich eastern Congo were violating the peace deal, M23 pledged to withdraw from Uvira to give peace talks a chance.

Heavy fighting has continued on the outskirts of Uvira, and M23 and the Congolese government on Sunday traded accusations of looting inside the town.

Two residents and a civil society activist based in Uvira said on Monday that Congolese soldiers and members of the Wazalendo militia returned over the weekend and were visible throughout the town, having retaken positions they occupied before M23's arrival.

Jean-Jacques Purusi, the Kinshasa-appointed governor of South Kivu province where Uvira is located, said the Gatumba crossing at the Congo-Burundi border, which closed when M23 took Uvira, would soon reopen.

Rwanda denies backing M23 and has blamed Congolese and Burundian forces for the renewed fighting. A report by a United Nations group of experts in July assessed that Rwanda exercised command and control over the rebels.

The United States has hosted talks between Congo and Rwanda, while Qatar has hosted separate talks between Congo and M23.

During a meeting in Togo focused on eastern Congo, African leaders on Saturday reaffirmed their support for the Doha talks and called for them to resume without delay.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:46:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DTS6XWSHQNPCPH4EC3XNGYUPFI.jpg?auth=0fd0a3d3afce698b1d4ebfbc4b36d6a4d1801f47fd321e0d335fdf9aed3d77ee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kurdish-led force says armed group attacks Syria prison holding thousands of Islamic State members</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-led-force-says-armed-group-attacks-syria-prison-holding-thousands-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said on Monday that an "armed group" was attacking Shaddadi prison in Hasaka in Syria's northeast where it said thousands of Islamic State militants were being held.

The SDF had said earlier in the day it was clashing with Syrian government forces near Al-Aqtan prison on the outskirts of the city of Raqqa that also held IS detainees. Raqqa was once the seat of a short-lived IS-declared "caliphate" in the region.

The SDF described the clashes as a "highly dangerous development" and said government forces seizing the prison "could have serious security repercussions that threaten stability and pave the way for a return to chaos and terrorism".

Under a sweeping integration deal between the SDF and Damascus agreed on Sunday, responsibility for prisons housing IS detainees was meant to be transferred to the Syrian government.

After days of fighting with government forces, the autonomy-minded SDF, once the main U.S. allies in Syria, agreed on Sunday to withdraw from two Arab-majority provinces they had controlled for years, including oil fields.

Syrian government troops tightened their grip on Monday across a swathe of northern and eastern territory abruptly abandoned on Sunday by the SDF in a dramatic shift that consolidated President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rule.

In the wake of the deal, government internal security forces and military police were setting up checkpoints and checking IDs in Raqqa. Security sources there said Raqqa had been cleared of SDF fighters overnight.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:46:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z2O43ZOY2ZOILNL524VA5MDH4A.jpg?auth=af5eef2a17b5a04d9578c3215158d78ab0974be3348093a4e05d997b34065ff6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's high-speed train crash: what happened?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/spains-high-speed-train-crash-what-happened-2026-01-19/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Sunday's train collision and derailment in southern Spain killed at least 39 people and left 122 injured, with officials highlighting the "tremendously strange" nature of the accident on a straight stretch of railway.

Here is what we know so far:

The accident happened at 7:45 p.m. (1845 GMT) near the town of Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, about 360 km (223 miles) south of the capital Madrid.

It involved two high-speed trains, one operated by the private consortium Iryo and the other by Alvia, run by Spain's public railway company Renfe.

The last two out of eight carriages of the trademark-red Iryo train going from Malaga to Madrid derailed on a straight stretch of railway and hit the oncoming Alvia, causing the latter's first two carriages to derail and fall down an up to five-metre (16.4 feet) embankment.

There was a 20-second interval between the first derailment and the impact, too short to activate the automatic braking system, according to Renfe chief Alvaro Fernández Heredia, who also said human error was practically ruled out.

"It must have been some kind of failure in the rolling stock or the infrastructure, and that will take time" to investigate, he said.

Officials said the Alvia had apparently hit the derailed carriages or undercarriage debris of the Iryo. The 27-year-old driver of the Alvia train died in the crash, the Renfe chief said.

The Iryo train was carrying around 300 people and had just left the historic city of Cordoba. Its speed at the moment of the accident was 110 kph, well below the maximum limit of 250 kph on that stretch.

The oncoming train, carrying 187 people, was travelling at a speed of 205 kph, Renfe said.

The derailed Alvia carriages had 37 people in the first and 16 in the second. Most of the dead and injured came from the first two Alvia carriages.

Transport Minister Oscar Puente said that the Iryo was less than four years old and that the railway track had been completely renovated last May with an investment of 700 million euros ($813.5 million). Iryo said the train was last inspected on January 15.

Puente called the accident "tremendously strange" and said that had it not been for the oncoming train, the derailment would have likely caused no deaths.

Jose Trigueros, president of the Association of Road Engineers, said his preliminary analysis of images and information released by the authorities suggested "failure of the undercarriage of the back units" of the Iryo train.

Train drivers union SEMAF had warned state-owned rail infrastructure administrator ADIF in a letter last August of severe wear and tear to the railway track where the two trains collided, according to a copy of the letter seen by Reuters, saying potholes, bumps, and imbalances in overhead power lines were causing frequent breakdowns and damaging the trains.

ADIF did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

According to a Reuters review of alerts on ADIF's X account, it has previously reported problems with infrastructure at Adamuz, from signalling failures to issues with overhead power lines, that caused delays to high-speed trains between Madrid and Andalusia 10 times since 2022.

The government was criticised last year for a series of delays on the network, caused by power outages and the theft of from the lines. The network is vulnerable to cable thefts as it crosses large swathes of empty countryside.

Spain's high-speed railway network, with 3,622 km of tracks, is the largest in Europe and the second-biggest in the world after China, according to ADIF.

Spain opened up its high-speed rail network to private competition in 2020 in a bid to offer low-cost alternatives to Renfe's AVE trains.

Iryo is a joint venture between Italian state railway operator Ferrovie dello Stato, airline Air Nostrum and Spanish infrastructure investment fund Globalvia. It began operating in November 2022, starting with the Madrid-Barcelona route and expanding to other major cities.

The Iryo ETR1000 train is manufactured by the partnership of Hitachi Rail-Bombardier in Europe for Ferrovie's unit Trenitalia. Renfe's Alvia trains are manufactured by local makers CAF and Talgo.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:46:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3S4UV53UDJNOTLPWEPFMIB7VXQ.jpg?auth=c94786562326648302295905bc24637482feff568078da348ef827763a5a0a86&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Sudan opposition forces call for march on Juba after battlefield gains</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-sudan-opposition-forces-call-for-march-juba-after-battlefield-gains-2026-01-19/</link><description>JUBA, Jan 19 - South Sudan's main opposition faction called on its forces on Monday to advance on the capital Juba after they captured a strategic town last week.

It was not clear whether the Sudan People's Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO), which battled forces loyal to President Salva Kiir during a 2013-18 civil war, could credibly threaten Juba.

But the call signalled an escalation in the SPLA-IO's rhetoric and ambitions following months of intense clashes around the country that the United Nations has said are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017.

The SPLA-IO seized the town of Pajut, which is more than 300 km (180 miles) north of the capital, in heavy fighting last week in the north of Jonglei State. Pajut's capture puts the state capital of Bor within striking distance of the SPLA-IO.

Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations Wisley Welebe Samson ordered SPLA-IO forces "to move to Juba from all directions of South Sudan and remove the anti-peace regime in Juba", SPLA-IO spokesperson Col. Lam Paul Gabriel said in a statement.

A spokesperson for South Sudan's military declined to comment. A government spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

Kiir's forces battled those loyal to his vice president, Riek Machar, in the 2013-18 war, which was fought along largely ethnic lines and cost about 400,000 lives. A peace deal in 2018 quieted the conflict, although localised clashes persisted.

Heavy fighting surged again last year after an ethnic militia with historic ties to the SPLA-IO overran an army base in the northeastern town of Nasir.

The government then arrested Machar, who had returned to the vice presidency under the peace deal, and charged him with treason and crimes against humanity for his alleged role in the incident.

Machar has denied the charges during an ongoing trial .

Bol Deng Bol, a civil society activist in Jonglei, said the fighting since last week had caused many people to flee their homes, many into uninhabitable swamps.

The U.N. Commission for Human Rights in South Sudan condemned the "deliberate sabotage" of the 2018 peace agreement, including what it said were indiscriminate aerial bombardments.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Billionaires' wealth hits new peak amid rising poverty, Oxfam says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/billionaires-wealth-hits-new-peak-amid-rising-poverty-oxfam-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5115d392-f537-11f0-babc-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-133425-133605-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sadio Mane leads Senegal to AFCON glory</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/sadio-mane-leads-senegal-to-afcon-glory</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eeeafdf0-f536-11f0-bb9d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-131705-131841-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu inches closer to passing budget bill without vote</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-pm-lecornu-inches-closer-to-passing-budget-bill-without-vote</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/78d8a536-f536-11f0-ba84-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-131111-131526-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Most challenging situation’ for transatlantic relations as Trump threatens EU with tariffs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/most-challenging-situation-for-transatlantic-relations-as-trump-threatens-eu-with-tariffs</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 13:47:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b1adb2b2-f535-11f0-8be0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-130546-131109-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's deadliest train disasters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spains-deadliest-train-disasters-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - At least 39 people died in southern Spain after a high-speed train derailed and collided with an oncoming one on Sunday night near Adamuz, in the province of Cordoba, in the worst railway accident in the country since 2013.

The collision left 122 people injured, with 48 still in hospital and 12 in intensive care, according to emergency services.

Here are some of Spain's deadliest train disasters, starting from most recent:

A railway accident in the summer of 2013 left 80 people dead and 145 injured when an eight-carriage high-speed train veered off the track on a sharp bend near the northwestern city of Santiago de Compostela, slamming into a concrete wall and bursting into flames.

A Transport Ministry commission concluded that the accident was caused by speeding and the driver being distracted by a call from a superior, but a victims association blamed the accident not only on human error but also on the railway's security systems.

On March 11, 2004, ten backpack bombs detonated on four Cercanias commuter trains, killing 193 and injuring thousands during Madrid's rush hour. The attacks were carried out by Islamist extremists opposing Spain's participation in the Iraq war.

An accident caused by a head-on collision between two trains in the Cadiz-Seville route left 86 people dead and more than 150 injured near the southern town of El Cuervo in 1972. The accident was caused by a driver's failure to stop at a red light at El Cuervo station, according to an investigation by state-owned rail operator Renfe.

A head-on collision of two trains killed 33 in the town of Urduliz, near the northern city of Bilbao, in the summer of 1970. A stationmaster was initially blamed for the accident, but it later emerged that he had been working 16-hour shifts for the previous four days.

A train on the Madrid-Barcelona route caught fire in 1965 in the town of Grisen, near northeastern Zaragoza, killing dozens of passengers. Though the train operator said at the time that 30 people died, later reports have claimed the real death toll was up to 80 and the Francoist regime tried to downplay it.

The 1944 crash of three trains in the El Bierzo region of Spain's León province is considered one of the deadliest railway disasters in Spain, with the estimated death toll of 78 still being debated due to censorship under the regime of late dictator Francisco Franco.

A train travelling from Madrid to A Coruña suffered a brake failure and collided with a locomotive inside a tunnel, just before a third train entered the same gallery and crashed into the wreckage.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:30:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7AU364VJSBIYFPZGD7XEJQT77A.jpg?auth=34f012990f126ba5b9b02cb726468d5cb449a7165aeb32f4fd38dcda97bffa3c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>On Saudi-backed tour, Yemeni officials accuse UAE of running secret prisons</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-backed-tour-yemeni-officials-accuse-uae-running-secret-prisons-2026-01-19/</link><description>Mukalla, YEMEN, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The Saudi-backed Yemeni government accused the United Arab Emirates on Monday of running a secret prison at an airbase near the south Yemeni port city of Mukalla, fueling tensions in a deepening row between the two Gulf oil states.

The allegations were made by Salem Al-Khanbashi, the governor of the eastern Yemeni province of Hadramout, during a rare media trip arranged by the Saudi government which flew international journalists including a Reuters team from Riyadh to the Riyan airbase near the Yemeni city of Mukalla.

Al-Khanbashi told a televised press conference that necessary measures would be taken against the UAE and the head of Yemen's main separatist group , the STC, who the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen alleged had been spirited out of Yemen by the UAE.

"All the measures will be taken to hold perpetrators of violations accountable, either Aidarous al-Zubaidi or the UAE - its elements, officials, or people working for them... to achieve justice for the victims and their families."

There was no immediate comment by the UAE foreign ministry.

The STC is fully committed to human rights and justice, an official of the group told Reuters in response to the accusation that the UAE-backed group had run a secret prison.

"We have continuously engaged constructively with U.N. and other human rights bodies to ensure the rights and protection of the Southern (Yemeni) people," he added.

Khanbashi's remarks are among the most severe accusations levied against the UAE in a war of words with Saudi Arabia . The dispute broke into the open last year when UAE-backed STC fighters pushed Saudi-backed forces aligned with the internationally-recognized Yemeni government out of key provinces.

Then, in late December, Saudi Arabia struck what it said was an Emirati shipment of weapons and equipment destined for the STC in the port of Mukalla, before backing an offensive that saw the STC collapse and the UAE withdraw after nearly a decade as the main force on the ground in Yemen.

Disagreements between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi span the region, where they back opposing sides in conflicts from Sudan to Somalia and Syria. They are also engaged in fierce economic competition, including over who can attract more foreign capital and visitors and take the biggest share of the global AI boom.

Over the past weeks, Saudi and Emirati pundits have traded attacks on social media in an unusually open display of discord. The Gulf monarchies have in the past kept their disagreements out of the public eye, partially in an effort to show a united front against their main common foe, Iran.

A post on X on Saudi state-run Ekhbariya TV on Sunday read: "With Abu Dhabi inciting against Saudi Arabia ... the kingdom will not hesitate to take the necessary steps and measures against it."

The Yemeni government has previously alleged that the UAE was running secret prisons in several areas under its control in Yemen, allegations the UAE has denied.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:30:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heat inequality: The toll of climate change in Rio de Janeiro's favelas</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/heat-inequality-study-measures-toll-climate-change-rio-de-janeiro-favelas-2026-01-19/</link><description>RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Michele Campos feels like crying every summer when temperatures in Rio de Janeiro climb above 40°C (100°F), heating up the cement that covers every corner of the favela of Chapeu Mangueira where she lives and making life unbearable in her windowless bedroom.

“Sleeping is the worst part," said the 39-year-old. "In the favela we experience the heat in a very different way from people who can afford air conditioning."

Researchers from Utrecht University in the Netherlands, together with local partners, are now trying to understand exactly how extreme heat strains the livelihoods of the 1.3 million people who, like Campos, live in Rio’s favelas, working-class neighbourhoods built by residents without any urban planning.

“We don’t have architects or engineers. We build out of necessity,” said Valdinei Medina, who heads the Percilia and Lucio Renewable Energy Cooperative, Brazil’s first solar energy cooperative based in favelas.

“When the heat comes, we suffer a lot,” he said.

The researchers have installed thermometers in people's homes in the favelas of Chapeu Mangueira and Morro da Babilonia to measure indoor temperatures and asked residents to keep “heat diaries,” documenting how high temperatures affect their bodies and daily routines.

The goal is to show how climate change affects people unevenly in a city known for its stark inequality, with working‑class homes sprawling across rolling hills above wealthy neighbourhoods.

The data the researchers collect could help inform public policy that takes into account not only heat levels on the streets but also conditions inside homes, said Francesca Pilo, the project’s coordinator and a professor of urban planning at Utrecht University.

Trade unions are pressing for more recruitment, pay and better maintenance of the vast former royal palace, and have launched several days of strikes in recent months.

Nearly 140 new hires have been announced since the start of the strike movement in mid-December, and another meeting was scheduled at the culture ministry on Thursday to discuss salary increases.

Some union leaders were also contesting museum director Laurence des Cars' management style which they view as remote and inflexible.

"If we get the pay but continue with this governance model, we won’t be out of the woods," Valerie Baud of the CFDT union said.

"There may be announcements, but we are still dealing with a management that digs its heels in and doesn’t recognise that it can sometimes be wrong,” added her colleague Elise Muller from the SUD union.

The two days of museum closures in December and earlier in January have resulted in a loss of "at least one million euros" in revenue, management said.

The security failures highlighted by a spectacular break-in at the museum on October 19 have cast a harsh spotlight on management of the institution and des Cars, who has apologised.

Footage of the heist was broadcast for the first time on French television on Sunday evening, showing the brazen jewel thieves breaking into display cases.

The images, filmed by surveillance cameras, were shown by the TF1 and public France Televisions channels on Sunday evening, three months after the hugely embarrassing break-in in October.

They show the two burglars, one wearing a black balaclava and a yellow high-visibility jacket, the other dressed in black with a motorcycle helmet, as they force their way into the Apollo Gallery.

After breaking in through a reinforced window with high-powered disk cutters, they begin slicing into display cases under the eyes of several staff members who do not intervene.

Managers at the Louvre have stressed that staff are not trained to confront thieves and are asked to prioritise the evacuation of visitors.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:31:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ba2d3828-f539-11f0-9d67-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/a47b642011cda7fa111cba5497922c52df012da9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Passengers tell of terror, screams and darkness after Spain train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/passengers-tell-terror-screams-darkness-after-spain-train-crash-2026-01-19/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A violent jolt, followed by screams, flying objects, blood and then darkness is how survivors of the train crash in southern Spain on Sunday night described the moment of impact in the high-speed collision that killed at least 39 people.

The trains were carrying about 400 people when the accident happened near Adamuz in the province of Cordoba, about 360 km (223 miles) south of the capital Madrid. It left 122 people injured, with 48 still in hospital and 12 in intensive care, according to emergency services.

Most survivors said on Monday they were unaware of the scale of the disaster until they made it outside and witnessed injured or dead passengers, and rescuers working under floodlights beside the tracks.

"I started to get up and thought, this isn't normal. Then I looked for my sister. That's the last thing I remember before everything went dark," said Ana Garcia Aranda, 26, who was travelling to Madrid from Malaga with her sister and their dog after visiting family.

Other passengers had broken windows and pulled her from the wrecked carriage.

"There were people who were fine and others who were very, very badly injured. You had them right in front of you and you knew they were going to die, and you couldn't do anything," she said, wearing sticking plasters on her face.

Firefighters later rescued her sister from the train and took her to hospital, where she is in intensive care.

Outside the crash site, sirens echoed through the night as emergency vehicles flooded the narrow roads. Residents of Adamuz said the whole town mobilised, bringing water, blankets and food to help the stranded passengers.

"That won't be forgotten," Salvador Jimenez, a journalist with Spanish public broadcaster RTVE, who was pulled from one of the trains, said. "In the end, it's a lottery. Many of us were lucky."

Paqui, who owns a farm in the area and rushed to the site with her husband, recalls horrific scenes in and around the trains.

"Pieces of people, it wasn’t people anymore, you found arms. My husband saw a child who died inside... another child calling for his mother, looking for his mother," she said. "I can’t sleep, those are images that stay with you."

Another passenger, Raquel, told radio station Cadena Ser: "I was thrown from the back cabin and opened the door with my head," she said, adding that she briefly lost consciousness before managing to walk towards where firefighters were working.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:57:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P75GOFVOGJMW3PMYVAR55STM7A.jpg?auth=1986badd69d9184544dc5adb2957d11d114c2b7aef3c3b5b30752ad0be311527&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African Republic court validates Touadera's re-election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-court-validates-touaderas-re-election-2026-01-19/</link><description>BANGUI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Central African Republic's Constitutional Court on Monday validated President Faustin-Archange Touadera's victory in a disputed December 28 presidential election that handed him a third term.

Even before provisional results were announced on January 5, Touadera's opponents had alleged fraud but the government denied that.

"On behalf of the Central African people, the Constitutional Court declares Faustin Archange Touadera president-elect in the first round with 77.9% of the vote," President of the Constitutional Council Jean-Pierre Waboe said.

Touadera's main rival, former Prime Minister Anicet-Georges Dologuele, received 13.5% of the vote, final results from the electoral commission showed.

The Constitutional Court said it rejected an appeal that Dologuele had lodged after the announcement of provisional results.

Another competitor, former Prime Minister Henri-Marie Dondra who got 2.97% of the vote, last week acknowledged Touadera's victory and said he decided not to appeal.

"I made this decision to preserve peace and avoid reigniting tensions. I call on the president-elect to take the necessary measures to reconcile the Central African people and organize a genuine dialogue to ease political tensions in the country," Dondra told Reuters.

Touadera, a 68-year-old mathematician who took power a decade ago, campaigned on his security record in the chronically unstable nation.

His victory will likely further the interests of Russia, which has traded security assistance for access to resources including gold and diamonds.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 14:57:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KBCNPGHFSZJK7J23RURLZN54JQ.jpg?auth=496f3c420086c9e73d25c2117b568e35a7161a5af398f2b918f1f75bf5530dc3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Investigators find broken joint on track at Spanish rail crash site, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/investigators-find-broken-joint-track-spanish-rail-crash-site-source-says-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:28:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Rising smoke, locked exits: How Karachi mall inferno trapped victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rising-smoke-locked-exits-how-karachi-mall-inferno-trapped-victims-2026-01-19/</link><description>KARACHI, Jan 19 (Reuters) - When smoke began seeping from ducts at the sprawling Gul Plaza shopping complex in Karachi late on Saturday, those inside thought a small fire had broken out in a corner of the mall.

But the flames spread rapidly, leaping through a structure that housed 1,200 stores in Karachi's historic centre.

"It engulfed the whole mall in front of our eyes," shopowner Shahbaz Iqbal, 27, told Reuters on Monday, after the blaze was largely extinguished following a 24-hour firefight. Authorities said more than 60 people were still missing and 21 have been killed.

"We thought it was a small fire. No one ever thought it would be this bad."

Iqbal and his co-workers ran upstairs and out of the mall from one of the basement exits, but those coming from the upper floors weren't as lucky. With the facility due to close soon, most of the mall's gates were locked.

Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters that all but three of the mall's 16 exits were locked.

"When I went in (to the building), I saw the locks," said rescue worker Aqeel, who declined to share his whole name as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

Gul Plaza's management did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

As rescue workers dug through mounds of debris, human remains were pulled out of the building in white cotton sheets turned into makeshift sacks.

Shafi Ahmed, who owned a store in the basement, stood holding his hands together in prayer.

When asked if anyone he knew was inside, he said five of his friends were left in the mall.

"These are all our people. These are all my people. These are our people," he said, breaking down in tears.

Police struggled to hold back grieving families and shopowners who said they had lost everything.

At one point, officials discovered a drawer full of money, causing a fight to break out among shopowners claiming it was theirs.

Hundreds of protesters gathered around the smouldering remains of the building on Monday calling for accountability from the authorities.

Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has promised an investigation into the fire and response time, while Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who arrived on the scene nearly 24 hours after the fire broke out, was met with jeers from the angry crowd.

Roads still under construction outside Gul Plaza were inundated with water after the firefight. Rescue officials sat in a tent outside the building, noting down the names of the missing.

Razia, 40, who goes by one name, said six of her relatives worked in the building.

"One of them jumped out with two of his friends. One of the friends broke his legs and the other died on the spot," she said, describing the account from the relative, her nephew.

Another of her family members, a flower shop worker named Ibrar, did not make it out. He broke down a door to help others escape, "but he is still stuck ... no one has heard from him since Saturday," Razia said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:29:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BKG3DVSQQRJD7HB4M5CVMPJUFY.jpg?auth=077e6ca16776672c6a261872db8512337995c7b77040be3f1aa61e331438b4be&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The exchange of messages between Norway's prime minister and President Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/exchange-messages-between-norways-prime-minister-president-trump-2026-01-19/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:29:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syria deal could remove main obstacle to Turkey-PKK peace, Turkish officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-deal-could-remove-main-obstacle-turkey-pkk-peace-turkish-officials-say-2026-01-19/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A deal under which Kurdish forces abandoned long-held territory in Syria to the Syrian government could pave the way for Turkey to advance its stalled effort to end its decades-long conflict with the PKK, Turkish politicians and officials said on Monday.

After days of fighting, the Syrian government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) agreed on Sunday to bring Kurdish authorities under the control of Damascus. By Monday, SDF fighters had pulled out of swathes of territory which were now under control of the Syrian military.

Neighbour Turkey has long considered the SDF in Syria to be an offshoot of the banned PKK, or Kurdistan Workers Party, which decided in May last year to and end its decades-long war against the Turkish state.

Turkish officials have long said that as long as the SDF controlled a swathe of territory across the border, it was difficult to end the war with the PKK. But now, with the SDF pulling out of two Syrian provinces, Turkish leaders see progress resuming.

Omer Celik, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's ruling AK Party, said Syrian government forces' recent advances had "thwarted" efforts by Kurdish groups to derail Turkey's peace process.

Feti Yildiz, a deputy leader of the government-allied Turkish nationalist MHP party, said Sunday's agreement in Syria would have "a favourable impact".

"Things will become easier," Yildiz told reporters in the Turkish parliament when asked how the Syrian deal affects the PKK process. "It had been standing like an obstacle, and for now it looks as though that obstacle has been removed."

The PKK itself had yet to comment on the SDF's withdrawal as of Monday afternoon. Turkey's pro-Kurdish DEM Party, which has previously criticised the Syrian offensive against Kurdish forces, has also not yet reacted.

Turkish security sources, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, called the deal a historic turning point and said stability in Syria was vital to Ankara's goal of eradicating terrorism in Turkey, where the PKK has fought an insurgency since 1984 in which more than 40,000 people have been killed.

Though the PKK in July, the peace process has since shown little sign of progress: a months-long parliamentary commission has so far revealed no details on legal or reform measures.

Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, said the deal ended the Kurdish hope of retaining a large measure of autonomy and would benefit Turkey.

"Erdogan is undoubtedly rejoicing at the news, which will greatly weaken the PKK and any lingering Kurdish aspiration for an independent Kurdistan. Syria will become stronger economically and militarily, and Turkey will profit from this," Landis said on X.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BLG5UHMGJZPUBMXXDLBZ4SWVEA.jpg?auth=c3e5d488282298469f07a79fb3d9a17bf59b726fa6e4947521ffdec3c7d186fa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump charges $1bn for permanent seat on Gaza ‘Board of Peace’, invites Russia’s Putin</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260119-trump-charges-1bn-for-permanent-seat-on-gaza-board-of-peace-invites-russia-s-putin</link><description>US President Donald Trump 's government has asked countries to pay $1 billion for a permanent spot on his "Board of Peace" aimed at resolving conflicts, according to its charter, seen Monday by AFP.

The White House has asked various world leaders to sit on the board, chaired by Trump himself, including Russian President Vladimir Putin , Hungarian premier Viktor Orban and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney .

Member countries -- represented on the board by their head of state -- would be allowed to join for three years -- or longer if they paid more than $1.0 billion within the first year, the charter says.

"Each Member State shall serve a term of no more than three years from this Charter's entry into force, subject to renewal by the Chairman," the board's draft charter says.

"The three-year membership term shall not apply to Member States that contribute more than USD $1,000,000,000 in cash funds to the Board of Peace within the first year of the Charter's entry into force."

The board was originally conceived to oversee the rebuilding of Gaza, but its charter does not appear to limit its role to the occupied Palestinian territory.

The White House said there would be a main board, a Palestinian committee of technocrats meant to govern devastated Gaza, and a second "executive board" that appears designed to have a more advisory role.

"The Board of Peace is an international organization that seeks to promote stability, restore dependable and lawful governance, and secure enduring peace in areas affected or threatened by conflict," the charter says.

It appears to take a swipe at international institutions such as the United Nations, saying that the board should have "the courage to depart from approaches and institutions that have too often failed."

Trump has regularly criticized the United Nations and announced this month that his country will withdraw from 66 global organizations and treaties -- roughly half affiliated with the UN .

Membership of the board would be "limited to States invited to participate by the Chairman," according to the draft charter.

Trump would have the power to remove member states from the board, subject to a veto by two-third of members, and choose his replacement should he leave his role as chairman.

The "Board of Peace" began to take shape on Saturday when the leaders of Egypt , Turkey , Argentina and Canada were asked to join.

Trump also named as members Secretary of State Marco Rubio , former British prime minister Tony Blair , senior negotiator Steve Witkoff and his son-in-law Jared Kushner .

Israel has objected to the line-up of a "Gaza executive board" to operate under the body, which includes Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and Qatari diplomat Ali Al-Thawadi.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fa636c6a-f547-11f0-b622-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26016765794544.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's Greenland ambitions lack domestic support, polls show</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-s-greenland-ambitions-lack-domestic-support-polls-show</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/608b5a9a-f546-11f0-814b-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-152718-152853-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French investigators expose failings in Dominique Pelicot mass rape case</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260119-french-investigators-expose-failings-in-dominique-pelicot-mass-rape-case</link><description>France 's General Inspectorate of Justice (IGJ) has exposed failings in an investigation into Dominique Pelicot, convicted in a high-profile rape case, for not acting on DNA evidence against him for a dozen years, in a report seen by AFP.

Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison in December 2024 in a case that shocked the country, after admitting to repeatedly drugging his then-wife Gisele Pelicot and inviting dozens of men to rape her while she was unconscious between 2011 and 2020.

During the trial, it emerged that he had been first apprehended in 2010 in a suburban Paris shopping centre while filming up women 's skirts, and had his DNA taken by police .

A few months later, he was connected with an attempted rape in the Seine-et-Marne area east of the capital on May 11, 1999.

Yet the DNA match was not acted upon by the justice system for more than 12 years.

In October 2022, he was finally placed under formal investigation by a cold case unit in Nanterre, west of Paris, for the 1999 incident as well as a 1991 rape and murder of a woman in Paris.

Last year, Justice Minister Gérald Darmanin called on the IGJ to look into why the investigation did not happen sooner.

The IGJ report seen by AFP this week found that the court investigating the 1999 rape had no receipt of receiving the evidence, which was sent by regular mail.

Furthermore, the court at the time was undergoing a structural re-organisation and "loss of documents was sometimes observed", the report said.

The IGJ report highlighted "vulnerabilities" and general malfunction in the handling of genetic profiles, prompting a list of recommendations to secure the receipt of reports issued by France's National Automated DNA Database (FNAEG).

Contacted by AFP, Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, Beatrice Zavarro, said "the work of justice had been undermined".

She also acknowledged that the rape case involving his ex-wife "could have been avoided" had police intervened earlier.

"If we take it at face value, yes, this case could obviously have been avoided," she said.

Pelicot has admitted to his involvement in the 1999 case after he was identified by his DNA, but has denied involvement in the 1991 rape and murder case.

Last week, the Nanterre cold case unit launched a broader investigation into Pelicot's "criminal trajectories" to identify other possible crimes and victims.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 15:30:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cec7aa2c-f541-11f0-a335-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25030386341588.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia gleeful at Trump-Europe split over Greenland, but also has concerns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-gleeful-trump-europe-split-over-greenland-also-has-concerns-2026-01-19/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Russia is watching with glee as U.S. President Donald Trump's drive to acquire Greenland widens splits with Europe even though his moves could have serious security ramifications for Moscow, which covets its own presence in the Arctic.

The Kremlin said Trump would go down in history if he took control of Greenland, an autonomous Danish territory. President Vladimir Putin's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev hailed the "collapse of the transatlantic union." Former President Dmitry Medvedev joked about Europe getting poorer.

Criticism of Trump over Greenland has been notably absent at a time when Russia wants to keep him onside to ensure any end to the war in Ukraine is on Moscow's terms, even though traditional Russian allies Venezuela and Iran are also in his crosshairs.

"There are international experts who believe that by resolving the issue of Greenland's incorporation, Trump will certainly go down in history. And not only in the history of the United States, but also in world history," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

"It's hard not to agree with these experts."

The daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said it was a pleasure to watch Europe being "at a total loss" after Trump said he would put rising tariffs on goods imported from some European countries until the United States is allowed to buy Greenland.

"Make America Great Again (MAGA) = Make Danmark Small Again (MDSA) = Make Europe Poor Again (MEPA). Has this idea finally sunk in, dimwits?" said Medvedev, who is now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council.

Dmitriev, who is involved in talks with the U.S. on the war in Ukraine, mocked European leaders in posts on social media.

"Collapse of the transatlantic union. Finally — something actually worth discussing in Davos," said Dmitriev, who is due to meet U.S. envoys on Ukraine during the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort this week.

Dmitriev said on X that "Putin understands the U.S. rationale on Greenland," linking to a speech in which Putin said U.S. designs on Greenland had deep historical roots.

Russian commentators said Trump's behaviour was putting unprecedented strain on the NATO military alliance, Moscow's longtime foe, and could cause economic and diplomatic pain for the European Union and Britain, seen by Moscow as obstacles to Russia having its way on Ukraine.

An article in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the Russian government's official newspaper, asked whether differences over Greenland would spell the end of NATO.

Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser, said Moscow should help Trump advance his ambitions "because almost all of Trump's enemies are also Russia's enemies."

For all its satisfaction, Moscow is treading a delicate line as Trump's moves could have an impact on Moscow's own ambitions in the Arctic, which is rich in natural resources and also seen by Russia as strategically important.

Russia has bridled at Trump's suggestion that Moscow poses a threat to Greenland - part of his rationale for wanting U.S. control of the island - while avoiding mentioning his name in its criticism.

The foreign ministry said last week it was unacceptable for the West to continue accusing Russia and China of being a threat to Greenland.

But Ukraine is a higher priority for Russia than Greenland, where the U.S. already has a military presence.

A transatlantic rift over Greenland that involves countries that have financed and armed Kyiv could work in Russia's favour, possibly seeping into other policy areas and overshadowing events in Ukraine.

Some Russian commentators have suggested Trump's behaviour is ushering in a new world order without rules, something that might benefit Moscow.

Others though have sounded the alarm over the unpredictability of his behaviour, citing the recent seizure of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.

They have also cautioned that Trump, who says the U.S. will reassert its dominance in the Western Hemisphere, has not shown a readiness for other nations to have their own spheres of influence.

"Russia can only have its own sphere of influence through strength," said Markov.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:31:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GP4NHJ22NIXBB4OTQENXOV5QI.jpg?auth=d9b56abca82753bfda71b66c775777aca715bb21faafffb1cfad89d6cf5e48a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel invited to join Trump's 'Board of Peace', sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-invited-join-trumps-board-peace-sources-say-2026-01-19/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Israel has received an invitation from the United States to join President Donald Trump 's "Board of Peace" initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts, two sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.

It was not immediately clear if Israel had accepted the invitation. The prime minister's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Trump originally proposed establishing the Board of Peace when he announced last September his plan to end the war in Gaza . But an invitation sent to world leaders last week, seen by Reuters, outlines a broad role ending conflicts globally.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office has criticised the composition of a Gaza Executive Board announced by the U.S. last week, saying that it ran counter to Israel's policy.

The Gaza Executive Board would fall under the authority of the Board of Peace, and the White House has said that it will focus on advancing stability and prosperity in Gaza. There are no Palestinians on the board.

Netanyahu's office did not specify the issue with the Gaza board, whose members include Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan and a Qatari official, among others.

Israeli officials have repeatedly objected to any Turkish involvement in Gaza, and Israel has a tense relationship with Qatar, which mediates between Israel and Hamas.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:32:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KA2TV422RFNIDANBYESUAKRSQI.jpg?auth=c281a5d2c107923e987dda09f4936afeede07419358af1cb5d5012b60e4d8969&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dozens abducted in Nigeria church attacks; church leader says more than 160 seized</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/dozens-abducted-nigeria-church-attacks-church-leader-says-more-than-160-seized-2026-01-19/</link><description>KADUNA, Nigeria, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Armed bandits abducted dozens of worshippers from two churches in Nigeria's Kaduna state, police said on Monday, while a senior church leader put the number of those missing at more than 160.

Kaduna state police said gunmen armed with "sophisticated weapons" attacked the two churches in Kurmin Wali, a forest community in Afogo ward, at about 11:25 a.m. on Sunday. They said officers were still trying to confirm how many people were taken.

A police spokesperson said the area was remote and difficult to reach due to bad roads, making it challenging to obtain reliable information in the immediate aftermath of such attacks.

The Chairman of the Christian Association of Nigeria in the northern part of the country, Reverend John Hayab, told Reuters by phone that 172 worshippers were kidnapped, and that nine later escaped, leaving 163 still held.

"Information came to me from the elders of the churches that one hundred and seventy‑two worshippers were abducted while nine escaped," Hayab said.

Initial figures in Nigeria often vary widely after mass kidnappings. Security agencies typically give conservative early numbers, while local community and religious groups sometimes cite higher tallies. A similar pattern occurred during the abduction at a Catholic school in Kaduna State in a previous incident.

Police said troops and other security agencies had been deployed to the area and that efforts were under way to track the abductors and rescue the captives.

Northwest Nigeria has seen a surge in mass kidnappings by armed gangs operating from forest enclaves, attacking villages, schools and places of worship.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:33:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dozens injured by train crash in southern Spain still in hospital</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/dozens-injured-by-train-crash-in-southern-spain-still-in-hospital</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 16:34:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c75b5ac4-f549-11f0-b0f3-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-160242-160642-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump invites Polish president to join Gaza Board of Peace, aide says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-invites-polish-president-join-gaza-board-peace-aide-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>WARSAW, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Polish President Karol Nawrocki has been invited to join the Gaza Board of Peace by U.S. President Donald Trump, the Polish president's foreign policy adviser said on Monday

Usually known only by his first name, Valentino was 93, and had retired in 2008 .

Founder of the eponymous brand, Valentino scaled the heights of haute couture, created a business empire and introduced a new colour to the fashion world, the so-called 'Valentino Red'.

"Valentino Garavani passed away today at his Roman residence, surrounded by his loved ones," the foundation said on Instagram.

The lying in state will be on Wednesday and Thursday, while the funeral will take place in Rome on Friday at 11 am (1000 GMT), it added.

Valentino was ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld as the last of the great designers from an era before fashion became a global, highly commercial industry run as much by accountants and marketing executives as the couturiers.

Lagerfeld passed away in 2019, while Armani died in September.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:31:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CLV55MKO7JMODJH4H5SWM7CISQ.jpg?auth=b29d9bf467653f633c8e9fcabbc2d5fb006c8fc0c0c0b4de894195b917188dee&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark, Greenland suggest Arctic NATO mission, Danish defence minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/denmark-greenland-suggest-arctic-nato-mission-danish-defence-minister-says-2026-01-19/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Denmark and Greenland have discussed the possibility of having a NATO mission in Greenland and the Arctic, Danish Defence Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said on Monday.

He spoke as U.S. President Donald Trump intensified his push to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, prompting the European Union to weigh hitting back with its own measures.

Poulsen made his remarks after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt in Brussels.

"We have proposed this. The NATO Secretary General has also taken note of this, and I believe we can now hopefully establish a framework for how this can be achieved," Poulsen said.

The news was first reported by the CBC News and the Globe and Mail newspaper.

Military officials have presented plans for the operation to the government and are awaiting a decision from Prime Minister Mark Carney, said the source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the matter.

Carney's office declined to comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump's threats to take Greenland pose a challenge for Carney, who is keen to show solidarity with European allies while trying to stay on the right side of Trump, who has in the past threatened to annex Canada.

"We're concerned about this escalation, to be absolutely clear... we always will support sovereignty and territorial integrity of countries, wherever their geographic location is," Carney told reporters in Doha on Sunday.

European countries sent small numbers of military personnel to Greenland last week.

Germany, France, Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands have said they are sending military staff to begin preparations for larger drills later this year.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:32:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R4JZS637XVIJ5LDMVBPPLKTULE.jpg?auth=6316cad1a8ca6d3dcf9c1df8a24c69bd614c3d4d9cf9ea5ad91eaf51831d7f18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu will use special power to force through budget with ‘regret’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260119-french-pm-lecornu-will-use-special-constitutional-power-to-pass-budget-without-parliamentary-vote</link><description>France 's ​Prime ⁠Minister Sébastien Lecornu on ​Monday said he will invoke the ​constitutional power defined in Article 49.3 to force a budget ‍for 2026 ​through parliament without a vote. Lecornu ‌had originally pledged ‍in October he would not invoke the Article 49.3.

The decision, he said, was made with "regret".

"It's a partial success, partial failure," said Lecornu, citing "a certain amount of regret and a little bit of bitterness" after budget negotiations came to an impasse.

As a result, the premier risks exposing himself to a non-confidence vote, but he is counting on the support of a key swing group in the lower chamber to survive.

Lecornu last year had pledged to seek parliament approval for a 2026 austerity budget and not force it into law, in a bid to avoid the fate of his two predecessors who were ousted over budget negotiations.

He managed to get a bill on social security spending approved by year end, but lawmakers failed to reach a compromise on state expenses.

Lecornu's centre-right government said last week it would be "impossible" to adopt a 2026 austerity budget by vote.

Any use of "Article 49.3", a constitutional power to push legislation through parliament without a vote, can trigger a no-confidence vote, which can topple the government.

The hard-left France Unbowed party swiftly announced it would table such a motion.

But Lecornu has sought to make concessions in the spending bill to please the Socialists, a key swing group in the hung parliament, in order to survive any vote to oust him.

"In 2026, the United States has entered into the most profound and searing debate about the moral foundation for America's actions in the world since the end of the Cold War," the three highest-ranking U.S. Catholic archbishops said in a rare joint statement.

The statement by Cardinals Blase Cupich of Chicago, Robert McElroy of Washington and Joseph Tobin of Newark, echoes Pope Leo's fiery Vatican speech earlier this month denouncing the world's "zeal for war".

Leo, the first U.S. pope, has previously criticized some of U.S. President Donald Trump's policies, in particular on immigration.

Citing recent developments in Venezuela , Russia's war in Ukraine and the threats against Greenland by the Trump administration, the archbishops said rights of nations to self-determination appeared "fragile".

"The events in Venezuela, Ukraine and Greenland have raised basic questions about the use of military force and the meaning of peace," the clerics said.

The joint statement did not directly name Trump. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Saying that the U.S. needs a "genuinely moral foreign policy," the archbishops renounced "war as an instrument for narrow national interests" and said that "military action must be seen only as a last resort in extreme situations, not a normal instrument of national policy."</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:51:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ESYHHVWKBJMEZJJ2L2DC2E5KFI.jpg?auth=5a4c1df8c77d1c8ca91265093991128c8a006ed6fb7ea4c33a49144c75234ad2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Celebrated Italian fashion designer Valentino dies aged 93</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260119-celebrated-italian-fashion-designer-valentino-dies-aged-93</link><description>Valentino Garavani, the jet-set Italian designer whose high-glamour gowns — often in his trademark shade of “Valentino red” — were fashion show staples for nearly half a century, has died at home in Rome, his foundation announced Monday. He was 93.

“Valentino Garavani was not only a constant guide and inspiration for all of us, but a true source of light, creativity and vision,″ the foundation said in a statement posted on social media.

His body will repose at the foundation’s headquarters in Rome on Wednesday and Thursday. The funeral will be held Friday at the Basilica Santa Maria degli Angeli e dei Martiri in Rome’s Piazza della Repubblica.

Universally known by his first name, Valentino was adored by generations of royals, first ladies and movie stars, from Jackie Kennedy Onassis to Julia Roberts and Queen Rania of Jordan , who swore the designer always made them look and feel their best.

“I know what women want,” he once remarked. “They want to be beautiful.”

Never one for edginess or statement dressing, Valentino made precious few fashion faux-pas throughout his nearly half-century-long career, which stretched from his early days in Rome in the 1960s through to his retirement in 2008.

His fail-safe designs made Valentino the king of the red carpet, the go-to man for A-listers’ awards ceremony needs. His sumptuous gowns have graced countless Academy Awards, notably in 2001, when Roberts wore a vintage black and white column to accept her best actress statue. Cate Blanchett also wore Valentino — a one-shouldered number in butter-yellow silk — when she won the Oscar for best supporting actress in 2004.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 17:54:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/beff9388-f55b-11f0-87a0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP20218540071518.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll from Guatemala gang attacks rises to nine police officers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/death-toll-guatemala-gang-attacks-rises-nine-police-officers-2026-01-19/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Jan 19 (Reuters) - The death toll from coordinated gang attacks in Guatemala has risen to nine police officers, an official confirmed on Monday, following a weekend of violence that began with prison riots.

The conflict started on Saturday when inmates from the Barrio 18 gang took 46 guards hostage at three prisons, demanding greater privileges.

The violence escalated on Sunday after security forces regained control of a prison holding the gang's leader, Aldo "El Lobo" Duppie. In apparent retaliation, gang members launched a series of attacks on police in and around Guatemala City.

Initially, seven officers and one gang member were killed in the Sunday attacks, with more than a dozen officers wounded. National police spokesman Jorge Aguilar told Reuters that an eighth officer died Sunday night and a ninth, Frallan Medrano, died early Monday from injuries sustained in an ambush.

In response, President Bernardo Arevalo declared a 30-day "state of siege," which expands the power of security forces and may temporarily limit some civil liberties.

"The attack suffered by the officers was not only against them... but against the entire country," Arevalo said during a wake for the fallen officers.

The president argued the violence was orchestrated by "political-criminal mafias" attempting to spread terror ahead of key judicial appointments.

El Lobo, the gang leader, is serving sentences totaling approximately 2,000 years and is married to the niece of Sandra Torres, Arevalo's main rival in the 2023 presidential election.

While streets in Guatemala City were mostly calm on Monday, police and military forces were patrolling heavily. Classes across the country were canceled as a precaution.

Last October, Guatemala's Congress officially classified the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs as terrorist organizations.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:34:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R2VE35BJUZN2HKRMHNVEUXHJDE.jpg?auth=68396034c53845d966ac0bc22ee282b18ee4d7b0aa6a526fbb64fe6858f630ea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Kurdish party says Syria deal leaves Ankara 'no excuses' on peace process</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/turkeys-kurdish-party-says-syria-deal-leaves-ankara-no-excuses-peace-process-2026-01-19/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Turkey's pro-Kurdish DEM Party said on Monday that the Turkish government had no more "excuses" to delay a peace process with the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) now that a landmark integration deal was achieved in neighbouring Syria.

On Sunday in Syria, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) agreed to come under the control of authorities in Damascus - a move that Ankara had long sought as integral to its own peace effort with the PKK.

"For more than a year, the government has presented the SDF’s integration with Damascus as the biggest obstacle to the process," Tuncer Bakirhan, co-leader of the DEM Party, told Reuters, in some of the party's first public comments on the deal in Syria.

"The government will no longer have any excuses left. Now it is the government's turn to take concrete steps."

Bakirhan cautioned President Tayyip Erdogan's government against concluding that the rolling back Kurdish territorial gains in Syria negated the need for a peace process in Turkey.

"If the government calculates that ‘we have weakened the Kurds in Syria, so there is no longer a need for a process in Turkey,’ it would be making a historic mistake," he said in the interview.

Turkish officials said earlier on Monday that the Syrian integration deal, if implemented, could advance the more than year-long process with the PKK, which is based in northern Iraq. Erdogan urged swift integration of Kurdish fighters into Syria’s armed forces.

Turkey, the strongest foreign backer of Damascus, has since 2016 repeatedly sent forces into northern Syria to curb the gains of the SDF - which after the 2011–2024 civil war had controlled more than a quarter of Syria while fighting Islamic State with strong U.S. backing.

The United States has built close ties with Damascus over the last year and was closely involved in mediation between it and the SDF toward the deal.

Bakirhan said progress required recognition of Kurdish rights on both sides of the border.

"What needs to be done is clear: Kurdish rights must be recognized in both Turkey and Syria, democratic regimes must be established, and freedoms must be guaranteed," he said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 18:34:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRQWQTLIFJITDPLF7FIHZ725HY.jpg?auth=c0b40b5d4628d6bf774944f4f87c380d5b959b79fb69bb4175b3946bd7647beb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>, Valentino, Italian haute couture 'emperor' who painted fashion red, dies at 93</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/valentino-italian-haute-couture-emperor-who-painted-fashion-red-dies-93-2026-01-19/</link><description>ROME, Jan 19 (Reuters) - ROME, Jan 19 (Reuters) - A mix of carmine and scarlet, with a hint of orange - a new hue, inspired by an elderly woman at Barcelona's opera house, whose elegance struck a young Valentino Garavani.

The colour, introduced to the fashion world several years later, in 1959, with a strapless cocktail dress of draped tulle, has carried his name - "Valentino red" - ever since, doubling as the eponymous Italian fashion group's signature.

"I think a woman dressed in red is always wonderful, she is the perfect image of a heroine," Valentino wrote in the book "Rosso" (Red), released in 2022. He would include at least one red dress in every one of his collections.

Valentino, the Italian fashion designer who built one of the country's most celebrated luxury houses and was known in the industry as "the emperor", died on Monday at his home in Rome, his foundation said. He was 93.

The cause of death was not immediately known.

Valentino ranked alongside Giorgio Armani and Karl Lagerfeld as the last of a leading generation of designers, from an era before fashion became a highly commercial industry run as much by financiers and marketing executives as by couturiers.

Scaling the heights of high fashion, he was the first Italian to feature on the exclusive Paris haute couture catwalks.

Passionate about film, he dreamed as a young man of dressing the "beautiful ladies of the silverscreen", as he called them, among them 1950s Hollywood stars Lana Turner and Judy Garland.

Valentino would eventually design Elizabeth Taylor's wedding gown, and was the first choice for numerous Oscar winners, including Sharon Stone and Penelope Cruz.

His romantic designs, simple at first glance, were full of intricate detail. "I love beauty," Valentino said. "It is not my fault. And I know what women want: they want to be beautiful."

The designer, who also dressed Jackie Kennedy, created a business empire under his own name before selling it off ahead of his retirement, in 2008.

Valentino was an only child, born into a well-to-do family in Voghera, south of Milan, where his father ran an electrical supplies company.

Having started drawing and appreciating high-end clothes from a young age, he studied couture in Milan and Paris, where he then worked as an apprentice for designer Jean Dessès. He returned home in 1960, opening his own fashion house in the heart of Rome.

That year, Elizabeth Taylor chose a white Valentino gown for the premiere of blockbuster "Spartacus".

Also in 1960, he met Giancarlo Giammetti in a Roman cafe. Giammetti would go on to be his partner in business and in life.

"To share life with a person for your whole existence - every moment, joy, pain, enthusiasm, disappointment - is something that cannot be defined," Valentino said of him.

Giammetti took on the managerial part of the business, leaving creative matters to the designer.

"To be with Valentino as a friend, as a lover and as an employee is a bit the same: you need a lot of patience," Giammetti said in "Valentino: The Last Emperor", a documentary that followed the designer in the last two years of his career.

Valentino's georgette fabrics, chiffon ruffles and ornate embellishments, including the exclusive budellini technique - where long strips of sheep's wool are hand rolled into tubes, wrapped in silk and stitched together - won him a multitude of awards, including France's highest civilian distinction in 2006.

"Fame and fortune didn't change him," Giammetti said at the time. "He is still the little guy I met 45 years ago."

Superstitious and introverted, Valentino loved chocolate, skiing and his pugs. He told Corriere in 2017 that he was afraid of death.

In 2007 he wowed Rome with lavish celebrations to celebrate his decades in fashion - a three-day event that included dinners, parties and exhibitions with thousands of guests flying in from around the world.

Months later he announced that he would stop designing for his company, which he no longer controlled after selling the firm almost a decade earlier for some $300 million.

"I have decided that this is the perfect moment to say adieu to the world of fashion," he said. "As the English say, I would like to leave the party when it is still full."

His last catwalk show was held in January 2008 in Paris, a city he called his second home and which he said had taught him to love fashion and life.

The business that bears his name was bought by Qatari fund Mayhoola for 700 million euros in 2012. French luxury group Kering bought a 30% stake in 2023, with a commitment to fully acquire the business from 2026, but then deferred the move to 2028 at the earliest.

Valentino and Giammetti remained active in supporting the arts. Their foundation opened the PM23 gallery in the centre of Rome in 2025, next to the Valentino headquarters.

The region continues to grapple with unrest amid tensions between the Syrian government and the autonomy-minded SDF.

Turkey, the strongest foreign backer of Damascus, has since 2016 repeatedly sent forces into northern Syria to curb the gains of the SDF, which over the course of Syria's 2011–24 civil war took control of more than a quarter of the country while fighting Islamic State militants with strong U.S. support.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 19:22:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>IS group prisoners are 'big issue' for Syrian government and Kurdish SDF</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/is-group-prisoners-are-big-issue-for-syrian-government-and-kurdish-sdf</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:28:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/acc90280-f565-11f0-b740-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-181924-182639-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland threats: Europe 'must be ready to respond in kind', expert says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenland-threats-europe-must-be-ready-to-respond-in-kind-expert-says</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:28:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0381072c-f574-11f0-93b9-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-210451-211139-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tributes pour in after death of Italian designer Valentino</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tributes-pour-in-after-death-of-italian-designer-valentino</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:28:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/170445ba-f570-11f0-a487-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-204044-204452-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain seeks answers as high-speed train crash toll rises to 40</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/spain-seeks-answers-as-high-speed-train-crash-toll-rises-to-40</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:28:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/98139f30-f56f-11f0-91eb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-201711-201901-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Replay: French PM Lecornu to trigger special power to break budget deadlock</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/replay-french-pm-lecornu-to-trigger-special-power-to-break-budget-deadlock</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:28:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6e49f16a-f559-11f0-8e50-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-173006-175737-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A head-spinning day of crisis meetings all over Europe' as Trump reiterates push for Greenland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/a-head-spinning-day-of-crisis-meetings-all-over-europe-as-trump-reiterates-push-for-greenland</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:28:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/459edba0-f56c-11f0-b340-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260119-201114-201606-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's Zelenskiy announces new air defence system</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraines-zelenskiy-announces-new-air-defence-system-2026-01-19/</link><description>Jan 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine's armed forces are introducing a new facet of air defence to transform their system, made up of small groups deploying interceptor drones, as the country braces for new mass Russian attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday.

Ukraine is still reeling from a wave of Russian strikes earlier this month that knocked out power and heating to thousands of apartment blocks, particularly in the capital Kyiv.

Zelenskiy has repeatedly called for air defences to be strengthened, including increased assistance from Ukraine's Western allies.

"There will be a new approach to the use of air defences by the Air Force, concerning mobile fire groups, interceptor drones and other 'short-range' air defence assets," Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address.

"The system will be transformed."

The president announced the appointment of a new deputy Air Force Commander, Pavlo Yelizarov, to oversee and develop the innovation.

Ukraine has rapidly developed its drone manufacturing system since Russia launched its invasion of its smaller neighbour in February 2022, and has emphasised interceptor drones as an effective and economical way to parry Russian strikes.

In his remarks, Zelenskiy warned Ukrainians to be "extremely vigilant" ahead of anticipated new Russian attacks.

"Russia has prepared for a strike, a massive strike, and is waiting for the moment to carry it out," he said, urging every region in the country to "be prepared to respond as quickly as possible and help people".

Both Zelenskiy and Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha warned at the weekend that Ukrainian intelligence had noted Russia was conducting reconnaissance of specific targets, particularly substations that supply nuclear power plants.

The president also said he had instructed Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko to make decisions this week regarding difficulties from the recent attacks, including bonuses for tens of thousands of emergency crew members restoring heating and electricity.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 20:46:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MQS75TTA7FNHTLPDO5SNVRXWQ4.jpg?auth=9cdf4932da9ab4cabe2cb1fe93f898cfab544dd38ba171b4ff4ef4a8bad7ee18&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Islamic State claims responsibility for attack on Chinese-run restaurant in Afghanistan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-attack-chinese-run-restaurant-afghanistan-2026-01-19/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Islamic State claimed responsibility on Monday for an attack on a Chinese-run restaurant in a hotel in Kabul.

But the government also pledged to tackle economic hardships that sparked the demonstrations, which were met with a crackdown that rights groups say has left thousands dead.

The protests constituted the biggest challenge to the Iranian leadership in years, with the full scale of the violence yet to emerge amid an internet blackout.

National police chief Ahmad-Reza Radan on Monday urged young people "deceived" into joining the "riots" to turn themselves in and receive lighter punishment.

Those "who became unwittingly involved in the riots are considered to be deceived individuals, not enemy soldiers" and "will be treated with leniency", he told state television .

Officials have said the demonstrations were peaceful before descending into chaos fuelled by Iran's arch-foes the United States and Israel in an effort to destabilise the nation.

The heads of the country's executive, legislative and judicial branches on Monday all pledged to work "around the clock" in "resolving livelihood and economic problems", according to a joint statement published by state television.

But they would also "decisively punish" the instigators of "terrorist incidents", said the statement from President Masoud Pezeshkian , parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei.

The scale of the crackdown has emerged piecemeal as Iran remains under an unprecedented internet shutdown that is now in its 11th day.

Despite difficulty accessing information, the Iran Human Rights NGO says it has verified that 3,428 protesters were killed by security forces.

The NGO's director Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam on Monday warned the death toll could be higher by many thousands.

"Information received from eyewitnesses, families and other citizens, together with other available evidence, indicates that the number of protesters killed may exceed even the highest media estimates," he said in a statement.

"There is no doubt that the Islamic republic has committed one of the largest mass killings of protesters in our time."

Alarm has grown over the possibility that authorities will use capital punishment against protesters.

The United Nations on Monday warned the country was using executions as "a tool of state intimidation".

Iran -- the world's most prolific executioner after China , according to rights groups -- reportedly executed 1,500 people last year, UN rights chief Volker Turk said in a statement.

Security officials cited by Iran's Tasnim news agency said late last week that around 3,000 people have been arrested in connection with the demonstrations, but rights groups say the number could be as high as 20,000.

Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Saturday that authorities "must break the back of the seditionists".

Internet access would "gradually" return to normal this week, Hossein Afshin, Iran's vice president for science, technology and the knowledge economy, said Monday on state television, after limited access briefly returned the day before.

Pezeshkian criticised the internet restrictions, urging "better governance" of cyberspace.

Images from the capital Tehran showed buildings and billboards destroyed during the rallies.

In Iran's second-largest city of Mashhad, damage to public infrastructure exceeded $15 million, Mayor Mohammadreza Qalandar Sharif told state television.

Outside Iran, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of neighbouring Turkey, in his first comments on the protests, described the unrest as a "new test" for Tehran, pledging Turkey would "stand against any initiative" that would drag the region into chaos.

"We believe that, with a... policy prioritising dialogue and diplomacy , our Iranian brothers will, God willing, get through this trap-filled period," he said in a televised speech.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 21:43:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3f593b2a-f55b-11f0-93d1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/cf1321f0d45aae92fa1e4dc2978bbe674174663c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sydney beaches close after three shark attacks in two days</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sydney-beaches-close-after-three-shark-attacks-two-days-2026-01-19/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Beaches in the north of Sydney remained closed on Tuesday after a shark bit a man in his 20s, the city's third shark attack in two days.

Emergency services were called to a beach in Manly in the north of the city on Monday evening following reports a surfer had been bitten by a shark, New South Wales police said in a statement.

He was treated for serious leg injuries and taken to hospital in a critical condition.

All beaches in the Northern Beaches, a council area straddling the city's northern coastline, will remain closed until further notice, police said.

Earlier on Monday a 10-year-old boy escaped unharmed after a shark knocked him into the water, biting a chunk out of his surfboard.

On Sunday a boy was left in a critical condition after being bitten by a shark at a city beach.

The attacks follow days of heavy rain that ran off into the harbour and beaches around the city, creating ideal conditions for the bull sharks suspected to be behind some of the attacks. The species thrives in brackish water.

Australia sees around 20 shark attacks per year with just under three of those being fatalities, according to data from conservation groups. Those numbers are dwarfed by drownings on the country's beaches.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:23:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S2V2TDOOWRKSRG7RM23DN7TQ2Q.jpg?auth=db2ac4a3f6c0ab2b4b706a2766b4699beb3d154abca58f7f84b09de2e3c5e0a7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moldova proceeds with withdrawal from Russia-led CIS group</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/moldova-proceeds-with-withdrawal-russia-led-cis-group-2026-01-19/</link><description>CHISINAU, Jan 19 (Reuters) - Moldova is proceeding with the necessary formalities to complete its withdrawal from the Russia-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Foreign Minister Mihai Popsoi said on Monday.

Pro-European President Maia Sandu, who is spearheading a drive for Moldova to join the European Union by the end of the decade, has denounced Russia's invasion of Ukraine and accused the Kremlin of trying to subvert her government.

Moldova, one of Europe's poorest states, located between Ukraine and EU member Romania, has ceased taking part in all CIS activities since 2023.

"Let me just say that we are in the process of confirming the denunciation of three agreements with the CIS," Popsoi told Radio Moldova, citing accords which underpinned the founding of the organisation in 1991.

"The denunciation of these three agreements will mean we can say that from a legal standpoint we are no longer a member. De facto, we suspended our participation for a time, but de jure we are still there."

Sandu was re-elected in 2024 and last year, her Party of Action and Solidarity retained its majority in parliamentary polls.

Over the past 150 years, Moldova has been part of the Russian empire, Greater Romania and the Soviet Union. In more than 30 years of independence its governments have been sometimes favourable to and other times opposed to close ties with Russia.

Sandu, in a radio interview last week, said that if a referendum on reunification with Romania were now held, she would vote 'yes', the first time a Moldovan leader has taken such a position.

The head of Moldova's pro-Russian opposition Socialist Party, former president Igor Dodon, denounced the decision to withdraw from the CIS as "unacceptable".

Political analyst Vitalii Andrievschii said the move to withdraw from the CIS in no way meant Moldova would end its relationship with other ex-Soviet states.

"We have to bring this process to a conclusion," he told Reuters. "We will develop ties on a bilateral basis. But there is no point in remaining in the CIS, run by Russia."</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:24:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F55WLNCUVZKCHCYY5PF7RZT76A.jpg?auth=e3147cf73d894969956fa297812f31ea34b51ddc8ed73bda3e4aff5181084ec7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Senegal awaits return of AFCON champions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/senegal-awaits-return-of-afcon-champions</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 22:25:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c92a983e-f57a-11f0-bb2b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL260119-2141-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kurdish Rudaw website reports around 1500 Islamic State members escaped from Syria's Shaddadi prison</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/kurdish-rudaw-website-reports-around-1500-islamic-state-members-escaped-syrias-2026-01-19/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Kurdish website Rudaw reported that a spokesperson for the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, Farhad Shami, said around 1500 Islamic State members escaped from Syria's Shaddadi prison.

Job vacancies requiring "AI agent" skills have surged by 1,587%, Randstad said in its yearly "Workmonitor" report, with survey data suggesting that AI and automation are increasingly replacing low-complexity, transactional roles.

Randstad (RAND.AS) , opens new tab , one of the world's largest recruitment agencies, surveyed 27,000 workers and 1,225 employers and covered more than 3 million job postings across 35 markets for the report.

Labour markets are under immense pressure as corporations around the globe ramp up job cuts as consumer sentiment dims, shaken by U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and aggressive foreign policy moves that have taken a wrecking ball to the rule-based world order .

AI-focused tech firms have started to replace jobs with automation, even as most companies still await tangible returns from an exceptional investment boom into AI that will shape the business world for years to come.

"What we generally see amongst employees is that they are enthusiastic about AI ... but they may also be sceptical in the sense that companies want what companies always want: they want to save costs and increase efficiency," Randstad CEO Sander van 't Noordende told Reuters.

"Gen Z is the most concerned generation, while Baby Boomers show greater self-assurance and are the least worried about AI’s impact and their ability to adapt," the report said.

Nearly half of the workers interviewed fear the nascent technology stands to benefit corporations more than the workforce, the data showed.

There is also a discrepancy with how employers and workers view business performance. Around 95% of surveyed employers forecast growth for this year, while only 51% of employees shared this optimism, according to the report.</description><pubDate>Mon, 19 Jan 2026 23:21:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6VU5636N2BPJFNGSPEI7FFSW64.jpg?auth=ebc451a8127caa4a687bdb1f79323908311b91a864b72cf451232d85d959791e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia's lower house passes tougher gun control laws in response to Bondi mass shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australias-lower-house-passes-tougher-gun-control-laws-response-bondi-mass-2026-01-20/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Australia’s lower house of Parliament on Tuesday passed laws to enable a national gun buyback and tighten background checks for gun licences in response to the country’s worst mass shooting in decades at a Jewish festival last month.

The bill, which was opposed by conservative lawmakers, passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 96 to 45 and will now go to the Senate.

The December 14 attack at Bondi Beach that killed 15 people was carried out by individuals who had "hate in their hearts and guns in their hands," Home Affairs Minister Tony Burke said as he introduced the new laws.

"The tragic events at Bondi demand a comprehensive response from government," Burke said. "As a government, we must do everything we can to counter both the motivation and the method."

The new measures would establish a national gun buyback scheme to purchase surplus and newly restricted firearms.

They would also introduce tougher background checks for firearm licences issued by Australia’s states by drawing on information held by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.

The government said on Sunday there were a record 4.1 million firearms in Australia last year, including more than 1.1 million in New South Wales, the country’s most populous state and the site of the Bondi attack.

New South Wales also passed new laws last month that limit the number of guns per individual to four and 10 for farmers, and mandate firearm owners to renew their licences every two years instead of five years.

"The sheer number of firearms currently circulating within the Australian community is unsustainable," Burke said.

The bill passed without the support of the conservative Liberal-National opposition coalition, who accuse Prime Minister Anthony Albanese’s Labor government of failing to adequately address rising antisemitism.

Parliament, which is sitting after Albanese recalled it early from its summer break to address issues following the Bondi attack, is also debating separate legislation that would lower the threshold for prosecuting hate speech offenses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:47:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7YD7VD4RUFM5FKNEWZBV4DK5DM.jpg?auth=1259b2f24fcb23da86762ad9548daae8cf60ed46991df0f63c36a4259ce95ac5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Content to die': Afghanistan's hunger crisis worsened by winter, aid cuts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/content-die-afghanistans-hunger-crisis-worsened-by-winter-aid-cuts-2026-01-20/</link><description>KABUL, Jan 20 (Reuters) - In the dull glow of a single bulb lighting their tent on the outskirts of Kabul, Samiullah and his wife Bibi Rehana sit down to dry bread and tea, their only meal of the day, accompanied by their five children and three-month-old grandchild.

"We have reached a point where we are content with death," said 55-year-old Samiullah, whose family, including two older sons aged 18 and 20 and their wives, is among the millions deported by neighbouring Iran and Pakistan in the past year.

"Day by day, things are getting worse," he added, after their return to a war-torn nation where the United Nations' World Food Programme estimates 17 million battle acute hunger after massive cuts in international aid.

"Whatever happens to us has happened, but at least our children's lives should be better."

He was one of the returned Afghans speaking before protests in Iran sparked a massive crackdown by the clerical establishment, killing more than 2,000 in ensuing violence.

Samiullah said his family went virtually overnight from its modest home in Iran to their makeshift tent, partially propped up by rocks and rubble, after a raid by Iranian authorities led to their arrests and then deportation.

They salvaged a few belongings but were not able to carry out all their savings, which would have carried them through the winter, Samiullah added.

Reuters was unable to reach authorities in Iran for comment.

"Migrants who are newly returning to the country receive assistance as much as possible," said Afghan administration spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid, in areas from transport to housing, healthcare and food.

It was impossible to eradicate poverty quickly in a country that suffered 40 years of conflict and the loss of all its revenue and resources, he added in a statement, despite an extensive rebuilding effort.

"Economic programmes take time and do not have an immediate impact on people's lives."

The WFP says Iran and Pakistan have expelled more than 2.5 million Afghans in massive repatriation programs.

Tehran ramped up deportations last year amid a flurry of accusations that they were spying for Israel. Authorities blamed the expulsions on concerns about security and resources.

Islamabad accelerated deportations amid accusations that the Taliban was harbouring militants responsible for cross-border attacks on Pakistani soil, allegations Afghanistan has denied.

As winter spreads across Afghanistan's arid landscape, work opportunities have dried up, while the wave of returning Afghans has swelled the population by a tenth, said John Aylieff, the WFP's country director.

"Many of these Afghans were working in Iran and Pakistan and they were sending back remittances," he told Reuters, adding that 3 million more people now face acute hunger. "Those remittances were a lifeline for Afghanistan."

Cuts to global programmes since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House have sapped the resources of organisations such as the WFP, while other donor countries have also scaled back, putting millions at risk worldwide .

"Last year was the biggest malnutrition surge ever recorded in Afghanistan and sadly the prediction is that it's going to get worse," added Aylieff, estimating that 200,000 more children would suffer acute malnourishment in 2026.

At the WFP's aid distribution site in Bamiyan, about 180 km (111 miles) from Kabul, the capital, are stacks of rice bags and jugs of palm oil, while wheelbarrows trundle in more food, but it is still too little for the long queues of people.

"I am forced to manage the winter with these supplies; sometimes we eat, sometimes we don't," said Zahra Ahmadi, 50, a widowed mother of eight daughters, as she received aid for the first time.

At the Qasaba Clinic in the capital, mothers soothed their children during the wait for medicine and supplements.

"Compared to the time when there were no migrants, the number of our patients has now doubled," said Dr. Rabia Rahimi Yadgari.

The clinic treats about 30 cases of malnutrition each day but the supplements are not sufficient to sustain the families, who previously relied on WFP aid and hospital support, she said.

Laila, 30, said her son, Abdul Rahman, showed signs of recovery after taking the supplements.

"But after some time, he loses the weight again," she said.

After the Taliban takeover, she said, "My husband lost his (government) job, and gradually our economic situation collapsed. Life never remains the same."

The United States led a hasty withdrawal of international forces from Afghanistan in July 2021, after 20 years of war against the Taliban, opening the doors for the Islamists to take control of Kabul.

As dusk gathers and the temperature falls, Samiullah brings in firewood and Bibi Rehama lights a stove for warmth.

"At night, when it gets very cold, my children say, 'Father, I'm cold, I'm freezing.' I hold them in my arms and say, 'It's OK.' What choice do we have?" Samiullah said.

"(When) I worked in Iran, at least I could provide a full meal. Here, there is neither work nor livelihood."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 01:47:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7P55PJCU4ROBPL6VIZSEUAPJCI.jpg?auth=8106aef172ed6b50d9cd17f39fb07aff5fd3375273c5417af6b7be494c93b9b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia hits Kyiv with drones and missiles, cutting power, water supplies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-hits-kyiv-with-drones-missiles-cutting-power-water-supplies-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Russian forces launched a combined drone and missile attack on the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv early on Tuesday, triggering cuts in power and water supplies, the city's mayor said.

Mayor Vitali Klitschko, writing on Telegram, said a strike on the east bank of the Dnipro River had disrupted both power and water supplies. A non-residential building had been hit and one person injured, he said.

Unofficial Telegram news channels posted photos of darkened high-rise apartment buildings.

M23, an anti‑government group, launched an offensive in early December in South Kivu province in eastern DRC and seized Uvira, a city of several hundred thousand people on the border with Burundi, just after the DRC and Rwanda signed a peace agreement overseen by US President Donald Trump.

On December 17, the armed group said it was pulling its troops out of Uvira, claiming to be responding to a US request, but M23 police and military personnel remained in the lakeside city.

On Thursday, the M23 said it planned to withdraw its remaining forces from Uvira and declared its intention to place the city "under the full and entire responsibility of the international community".

Local sources then reported troop movements on Saturday as M23 units left the city.

On Sunday morning, "wazalendo" forces -- the local pro‑Kinshasa militias -- entered southern districts of Uvira, followed later in the day by elements of the Congolese special forces, according to local and government sources.

Congolese army (FARDC) spokesman Mak Hazukay announced the city's full recapture in a statement on Monday.

Residents cheered the arriving fighters as sporadic gunfire echoed through the city. Their arrival was also marred by looting of shops and homes, according to several local sources.

"About 20 looting civilians were arrested," Hazukay said.

The FARDC "continue their deployment in the city of Uvira and its surroundings in order to consolidate their positions", the statement added.

On Sunday, the governor of the surrounding South Kivu province, Jean Jacques Purusi, said M23 troops had "positioned themselves on the heights" above Uvira "to point their weapons at the city", as well as in nearby localities, according to a message circulated to the media.

North Korea said earlier this month that a drone from South Korea was flown into its airspace recently, showing photographs of debris and aerial pictures of buildings that it alleged the drone had taken.

A South Korean task force investigating the incident has called in a civilian suspect for questioning, police said.

"It should not happen for a civilian to send a drone to North Korea for an illegal purpose," Lee told a televised cabinet meeting. "How did we fail to check that a drone had been flown to the North?"

Lee said such action was "akin to starting a war" and created unnecessary tension with North Korea that could have a negative impact on the South Korean economy. He called for a thorough investigation and to ensure it never happened again.

Lee said that while a probe was ongoing if a South Korean citizen was found to have flown the drone they could be criminally charged for provoking Pyongyang.

Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, last week urged Seoul to investigate the incident, warning that any provocations could result in terrible situations.

Lee's administration has been seeking to improve ties with Pyongyang since he took office last year, but so far its overtures have been rebuffed by the North.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:46:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NR4VOIEQI5PHHNNV27DMYEWQLQ.jpg?auth=ef2f5d95b88de6e1bf1e4a5f99a6b42993770d29142de811084df5fed5975261&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Vietnam's Lam pledges growth above 10% despite global challenges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnams-lam-pledges-growth-above-10-despite-global-disruptions-2026-01-20/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Vietnam's top leader To Lam pledged annual economic growth of more than 10% for the remainder of the decade despite global disruptions, as he addressed delegates at the Communist Party congress on Tuesday.

The week-long event, which started on Monday in Hanoi, will select the party chief, the country's most powerful position, and set economic goals up to 2030.

The congress is taking place amid "many overlapping difficulties and challenges, from natural disasters, storms and floods to epidemics, security risks, fierce strategic competition, and major disruptions in energy and food supply chains," Lam told delegates at the start of his speech.

The former head of state security, who is seeking to retain his role as party chief and possibly take on the state presidency, promised to further reform the public administration after he launched the bureacracy's most significant overhaul in decades during his brief tenure as party chief.

A party document submitted to the congress and reviewed by Reuters set the annual growth goal at no less than 10% until 2030, above a missed target of 6.5%-7.0% for the first half of the decade.

Lam, 68, said Vietnam was also determined to cut red tape and expand global trade to ensure the country's independence and national interests were protected.

The 20% tariffs imposed on Vietnam in August by the Trump administration have not prevented Vietnamese exports to the United States from growing, leading to a record trade surplus with Washington.

However, the country is seeking to boost trade ties with other partners, with the impact of U.S. duties likely to be felt over the coming months.

Lam promised to continue the fight against corruption, although during his tenure the anti-bribe drive launched by his late predecessor Nguyen Phu Trong has abated, as Lam sought to speed up project approvals to boost growth.

"Infrastructure must be developed to adapt to climate change and ensure strong regional, inter‑regional, and global connectivity," Lam also said.

He has presided over a splurge in infrastructure projects, which has supported economic growth, but has also raised concerns about favouritism and waste.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:47:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDU6WCGXUFNAVMN5NG3Q6UHT3U.jpg?auth=733518ec1e0c1ded91cdb08520d5878fe2a5e7fea7e4d2a89709fbf93e605c0d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim purges vice premier, slams ‘incompetent’ officials</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260120-north-korea-s-kim-purges-vice-premier-slams-incompetent-officials</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has fired his vice premier and railed against "incompetent" officials in a rare and very public broadside against apparatchiks at the opening of a critical factory, state media said Tuesday.

Vice Premier Yang Sung Ho was sacked "on the spot", the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said, in a speech in which Kim attacked "irresponsible, rude and incompetent leading officials".

"Please, Comrade Vice Premier, resign by yourself when you can do it on your own before it is too late," Kim reportedly said.

Nuclear-armed North Korea, which is under multiple sets of sanctions over its weapons programmes, has long struggled with its moribund state-managed economy and chronic food shortages.

Kim has been quick to scold lazy officials for alleged mismanagement of economic policy but such a public dismissal is very rare.

Touring the opening of an industrial machinery complex on Monday, Kim blasted cadres who for "too long been accustomed to defeatism, irresponsibility and passiveness".

Yang was "unfit to be entrusted with heavy duties", Kim said, according to KCNA.

"Put simply, it was like hitching a cart to a goat -- an accidental mistake in our cadre appointment process," the North Korean leader explained.

"After all, it is an ox that pulls a cart, not a goat."

And he urged a quick turnaround in the "centuries-old backwardness of the economy and build a modernised and advanced one capable of firmly guaranteeing the future of our state".

Images released by Pyongyang showed a stern-looking Kim delivering a speech at the venue in Hamgyong Province in the country's frigid northeast, with workers in attendance wearing green uniforms and matching grey hats.

The impoverished North has long prioritised its military and banned nuclear weapons programmes over providing for its people.

It is highly vulnerable to natural disasters including flood and drought due to a chronic lack of infrastructure, deforestation and decades of state mismanagement.

The new machine complex makes up part of a large machinery-manufacturing belt linking the northeast to Wonsan further south, "accounting for about 16 percent of North Korea's total machinery output", according to Yang Moo-jin of the University of North Korean Studies.

Kim's public dismissal of Yang mirrors past cases such as Jang Song Thaek, Kim's uncle, who was executed in 2013 after being accused of plotting to overthrow his nephew, Yang said.

The North Korean leader is "using public accountability as a shock tactic to warn party officials", he told AFP.

Pyongyang is gearing up for its first congress of its ruling party in five years, with analysts expecting it in the coming weeks.

Economic policy, as well as defence and military planning, are likely to be high on the agenda.

Last month, Kim vowed to root out "evil" at a major meeting of Pyongyang's top brass.

State media did not offer specifics, though it did say the ruling party had revealed numerous recent "deviations" in discipline -- a euphemism for corruption.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:47:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54c06540-f5a3-11f0-90c8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/3d05bc0e43c3bcb5463fa919406e06d92b88b61f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Islamic State group claims deadly blast at Chinese restaurant in Kabul</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260120-islamic-state-group-claims-deadly-blast-at-chinese-restaurant-in-kabul-afghanistan-china</link><description>A blast at a Chinese restaurant in central Kabul on Monday killed at least seven people and wounded more than a dozen others, emergency services said.

An AFP journalist saw police vehicles and an ambulance at the scene following the explosion on a street known for its flower sellers in the Shahr-e-Naw area.

Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran said the explosion occurred at the Chinese Noodle restaurant, which he said mainly served Chinese Muslims.

"A Chinese Muslim, Ayub, and six Afghans were killed, and several others were wounded. The blast occurred near the kitchen," Zadran said in a statement.

The police spokesman, who said the cause was under investigation, had earlier said the blast hit a hotel.

The Islamic State armed group claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement, the SITE Intelligence Group reported, saying it was a suicide attack targeting Chinese nationals.

"The Islamic State in Afghanistan has placed Chinese nationals on its list of targets, especially in light of the escalating crimes committed by the Chinese government against the oppressed Uyghur Muslims," the IS statement said.

Italian NGO EMERGENCY said its hospital near the targeted restaurant had received "seven people dead on arrival", with 13 others admitted to the surgical department.

"Among the wounded are four women and a child," Dejan Panic, the NGO's country director, said in a statement.

The owner of a flower shop, requesting anonymity for security reasons, said the blast happened at around 3:30 pm (1100 GMT) at the other end of the street from his business.

He told AFP he heard the "strong sound" of a blast in the crowded area.

"It was an emergency situation. Everybody feared for his own life," he said.

"I could see at least five wounded."

Within hours of the blast the street was reopened to traffic, with cars streaming past the restaurant's covered entrance.

Windows in the building opposite were smashed, according to an AFP photographer.

Taliban officials have vowed to restore security to the country and are courting foreign investors to secure crucial revenue streams as foreign aid funding dries up.

Chinese business visitors have flocked to Afghanistan since the Taliban government took power in 2021 for the second time.

The following year, the Islamic State group claimed a deadly attack on a Kabul hotel popular with Chinese guests.

China, which shares a rugged 76-kilometre (47-mile) border with Afghanistan, has close ties with the Taliban government.

Trump is set to dominate the week at the Swiss ski resort, with a US delegation already on the ground to promote an American agenda that has unsettled the global order cherished by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron will address the forum on Tuesday, along with Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, whose countries have their own disputes with Trump.

Trump will deliver a speech on Wednesday and participate in other events on Thursday.

Europe is weighing countermeasures after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on eight European countries over the Greenland standoff.

US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is leading the US contingent in Davos, warned that EU retaliation "would be very unwise".

Von der Leyen met with a bipartisan US congressional delegation in Davos on Monday and said on social media that she had "addressed the need to unequivocally respect the sovereignty of Greenland and of the Kingdom of Denmark".

While Macron will leave on Tuesday without seeing Trump in Davos, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said he would seek to meet the US president at the forum on Wednesday.

Merz said Germany and other European countries agreed "that we want to avoid any escalation in this dispute if at all possible".

Leaders from the 27-nation bloc will hold an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss their response to one of the gravest crises in years to hit transatlantic ties.

At a news conference in Davos, Finland's President Alexander Stubb said "tariff threats at the allied level are unacceptable. They weaken our transatlantic relationship and, in the worst case, can lead to a vicious cycle".

When asked if the United States might use force, Stubb said: "I don't believe that the United States will take control of Greenland militarily."

Denmark has proposed that NATO start surveillance operations in Greenland to confront security concerns.

Other prominent foreign leaders addressing the WEF on Tuesday include Carney, who has sought to reduce his country's reliance on the United States as Trump has raised tariffs on Canadian products.

As US ties fray, Carney turned the page on years of diplomatic tensions with China during a visit to Beijing last week, securing a preliminary trade agreement to reduce tariffs.

Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, whose country has had long-running trade spats with Trump, will also address the WEF.

Other flashpoints on the WEF agenda include the crises in Venezuela, Gaza, Ukraine and Iran.

The United States has sent an unusually large delegation to Davos, in a sign that it wants to make its presence felt at the gathering for global economic and political leaders.

Bessent and other US officials will attend panels at the forum's congress centre but also at the "USA House", a venue inside an old church on the glitzy promenade of the mountain retreat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 03:47:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/958a9c9e-f59e-11f0-9811-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/d4e168388e1a20126e943459d9ed31017af3faea.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hong Kong to call 10 witnesses in case over Baltic Sea undersea cable damage</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/hong-kong-call-10-witnesses-case-over-baltic-sea-undersea-cable-damage-2026-01-20/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Ten witnesses will be called to testify in a "criminal damage" case against a Chinese captain of a Hong Kong-registered ship alleged to have damaged undersea cables in the Baltic Sea, his lawyer told reporters in Hong Kong after a hearing on Tuesday.

The 19-year-old woman was found on Monday after telling friends she was going for a swim on K'Gari, an island off the Queensland coast, police said.

"At this stage it's too early to confirm how the young lady lost her life. We are investigating all possibilities," Queensland police inspector Paul Algie told a press conference, but gave no details of the woman's identity.

"People travelling down the beach noticed the group of dingoes, stopped very quickly and obviously scared those dingoes away and uncovered the young lady's body," he added.

The wild dogs roam the island freely, emboldened by growing human contact, the state's environment ministry has said.

Myanmar has been ravaged by conflict since the military staged a coup against a civilian government in 2021.

The election, which began in December last year, has been criticised by the United Nations, many Western countries and rights groups as a ploy to legitimise military rule through political proxies - a charge the junta has denied.

In a low turnout , voters cast their ballots in the second stage of the poll earlier this month, with the military-allied Union Solidarity and Development Party leading after securing 88% of the lower house seats contested over the first phase.

Speaking in parliament, Minister Mohamad Hasan said ASEAN had rejected a request from Myanmar to send election observers during the annual leaders' summit in Kuala Lumpur last year, though some individual member states had decided to do so on their own.

"We have said that ASEAN will not send observers, and by virtue of that, we will not certify the poll," Mohamad said in response to a question from another lawmaker about Malaysia and ASEAN's position on the election.

Separately, Mohamad also said ASEAN was in the final stages of concluding a long-proposed code of conduct with Beijing this year concerning activities in the South China Sea.

"We hope we are able to do it by this year," he said.

ASEAN and China pledged in 2002 to create a code of conduct but took 15 years to start discussions, and progress has been slow.

Beijing claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, including parts of the 200-nautical mile exclusive economic zones of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam, complicating fishing and energy exploration activities by those countries.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 04:48:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3NJD7XBAZRJRJGD7ZSDS23GZOU.jpg?auth=0e933fdca3b9bc056ebc2209a9a58cb9ed70f07f2b85be6a3dca05c11aafff80&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Wave of low temperature brings rare snowfall to Shanghai</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/wave-low-temperature-brings-rare-snowfall-shanghai-2026-01-20/</link><description>SHANGHAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A wave of low temperature sweeping southern China brought rare snowfall to Shanghai on Tuesday, delighting residents of the financial hub as authorities warned that the frigid weather could last for at least three days.

The city, on China's east coast, last experienced a heavy snowfall in January 2018. And just last week, Shanghai basked in unusually high temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), which local media said had caused some osmanthus trees to bloom.

"The weather seems rather strange this year," said 30-year-old resident Yu Xin.

"In general, the temperature fluctuations have been quite significant, so some people might feel a bit uncomfortable," she said.

Chinese state media said other areas experienced sharp temperature drops, including Jiangxi and Guizhou provinces, which sit south of China's Yangtze and Huai rivers. Guizhou province is expected to experience temperature drops of 10 to 14 degrees Celsius, the Zhejiang News reported.

Across China, authorities have also shut 241 sections of major roads in 12 provinces including Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang due to snowfall and icy roads, state broadcaster CCTV said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 05:30:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S4OIA6MB2BKNJO7VVP5MCEJFCQ.jpg?auth=64e9639fd70649735aa48dfea3ed5287f2f13b634274478b7d7c8edb1baabfd3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canada's Carney aims to lead new global trading order less reliant on US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/canadas-carney-aims-lead-new-global-trading-order-less-reliant-us-2026-01-20/</link><description>OTTAWA/DOHA/DUBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney is trying to foster a new global trading order by working more closely with China and inking smaller trade deals, but faces constraints from Canada's still overwhelming economic dependency on the United States.

Last week, Carney took his trade diversification push further than his allies in Europe by signing a deal with China , and aims to project Canada as a potential leader in a new global trading order after U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs upended long-standing relationships.

Forging new alliances and trading partnerships has taken on new urgency for countries like Canada as Trump's foreign policy grows more aggressive and unpredictable. Trump has intensified his push to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, prompting the European Union to weigh hitting back with its own measures.

Carney, the former head of both the Bank of England and the Bank of Canada, won an election last year promising to create new economic alliances to help Canada survive Trump's tariffs and threats to annex Canada.

Before arriving at an annual gathering of the global elite in Davos on Monday, he circled the world and visited countries previously overlooked by Canada.

"A number of the multilateral relationships, institutions, rules-based systems, are being eroded by various decisions of various countries, the United States included," Carney said in Doha on Sunday, where he pledged more cooperation on defense and security and said progress had been made on an investment promotion agreement.

"Where there is progress, and where Canada and like-minded countries are looking to make progress, is through plurilateral deals," Carney said, advocating for agreements between a smaller number of countries.

Carney said Canada was already advocating to be a bridge between the European Union and Pacific Rim nations.

"In this moment of volatility, Canada will step up and lead. We will make sure that we are bringing countries to the table who will assist in this role," Foreign Minister Anita Anand told Reuters in an interview in Doha.

The European Union is also intensifying its trade diversification efforts - signing a deal with South American trade bloc Mercosur after 25 years of talks, concluding a deal with Indonesia in September and updating agreements with Mexico . The EU has resumed trade agreement negotiations with Malaysia, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates and India.

But while the EU relies on the U.S. for just over 20% of goods exports, Canada still sends close to 70% of its exports south of the border.

For Canada to reduce merchandise exports to the U.S. by 10%, it would have to double its exports to China, Germany, France, Mexico, Italy and India or find similar countries of that size, said Prince Owusu, senior economist with Export Development Canada.

Carney has pledged to double Canada's non-U.S. exports over the next decade. Trade experts and economists say to achieve this, Canada has to heavily rely on China, currently its No. 2 trade partner.

"We have to be very cautious... Moving too quickly and integrating too quickly with China also creates some issues around long-term stability for the economy," said William Pellerin, partner and co-head for international trade at law firm McMillan.

Chinese manufacturers have the ability to flood the Canadian market overnight in just about every category of goods, he said.

China's shipments to the U.S. fell last year but rose sharply to the rest of the world.

Canada's share of exports to the U.S. fell to their lowest ever level outside the COVID-19 pandemic years in October, according to official data. But the U.S. still accounted for 67.3% of all exports. While the government hopes to sell more oil to Asia, 90% of Canadian crude goes to the U.S.

Economists say the U.S. share of Canadian exports is unlikely to decline much more anytime soon, with many companies awaiting the outcome of negotiations over the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement this year.

Carney last week became the first Canadian prime minister to visit Qatar and the first to visit China since 2017.

In Beijing, Carney said China had become a more predictable partner than the U.S. He is expected to visit India soon, after the two countries restored diplomatic ties and agreed to restart trade talks that had stalled under his predecessor Justin Trudeau.

Canada has also wrapped up trade deals with Ecuador and Indonesia and signed investment agreements with the United Arab Emirates.

Carney's Trade Minister Maninder Sidhu said Canada will next focus on the Philippines, Thailand, Mercosur and Saudi Arabia, as well as India.

"Normally, the government of Canada signs one trade agreement a year," Sidhu said in an interview in Dubai. "We want to make sure we get those done as soon as possible."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 06:37:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SF7GIQBNW5POFPDSVTK5STODVM.jpg?auth=da65a6c83570831532146900d86650911dfec89df2d769af97a2412d316c5cf3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says had a telephone call with NATO's Rutte concerning Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-had-telephone-call-with-natos-rutte-concerning-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had a "very good" telephone call with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte concerning Greenland.

US President Donald Trump said Monday he thought European leaders would not "push back too much" on his attempt to buy Greenland.

"I don't think they're gonna push back too much. We have to have it. They have to have this done," he told a reporter in Florida who asked what Trump planned to say to European leaders who opposed his plans.

Red baseball caps spoofing Donald Trump’s iconic MAGA hats have become a symbol of Danish and Greenlandic defiance against the U.S. president's threat to seize the frozen territory.

The caps reading “Make America Go Away” — parodying Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan — have gained popularity along with several variants on social media and at public protests, including a weekend demonstration held in freezing weather in the Danish capital.

European governments are rallying behind Denmark, citing the need to defend Arctic regions and warning that threats against Greenland undermine Western security.

Protesters, however, are less diplomatic.

“I want to show my support to Greenland and also show that I don’t like the president of the United States,” said 76-year-old Copenhagen resident Lars Hermansen, who wore one of the red caps at a protest Saturday.

Store owner Jesper Rabe Tonnesen wears a red cap for sale that he created with the slogans "Make America go away," on the side, and on the front: "Nu det NUUK!," a twist on the Danish phrase “Nu det nok,” meaning “Now it’s enough,” substituting Nuuk, Greenland’s tiny capital, in Copenhagen, Denmark, Thursday, Jan. 15, 2026.

Donald Trump warned he no longer feels obliged to think "purely of peace" after being snubbed for a Nobel prize, in a text message published Monday as the US president ramps up his campaign to take over Greenland.

In an extraordinary exchange with Norway's prime minister, Trump questioned Denmark's right to the vast Arctic island, over which he said he wanted "complete and total control".

"Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 Wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace," Trump wrote to Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store.

"Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a ‘right of ownership’ anyway? There are no written documents.

"The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland."

NATO will keep working with Denmark and Greenland on security, the military alliance's Secretary General Mark ​Rutte said.

Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store on Monday said he received a message from Trump about rising tensions over Greenland in which the US president reportedly said he no longer felt obligated to think purely of peace since he did not receive the Nobel Peace Prize .</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 06:40:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a19e01d0-f2f4-11f0-9a9b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2256603455.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia jails U.S. citizen for five years after he carried rifle on yacht</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-jails-us-citizen-five-years-after-he-carried-rifle-yacht-2026-01-20/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A Russian court sentenced a U.S. citizen to five years in jail for crossing the border with a weapon when he sailed from the United States to meet a Russian woman he met over the Internet, Russia's court service said.

The man, identified as Charles Wayne Zimmerman, pleaded guilty but told the court that the weapon was stored on his yacht for self-defence and he had not been aware of the Russian law, the service said in Monday's statement.

Russian prison ends a long voyage for Zimmerman, who sailed off in July 2024 from North Carolina to Portugal, and then through the Mediterranean and Black seas to arrive in June 2025 at the southern port of Sochi.

"Zimmerman told the court he had met a woman from Kazan over the internet and had decided to sail to meet her on his yacht," the court service added, referring to the southern city.

"When setting off, he did not bother to study the laws of the Russian Federation and believed that the weapons stored on his yacht for self-defence should simply always remain on board."

Found guilty, he was sentenced to five years in jail by a court in Sochi in the Krasnodar region, the service said.

It released video showing a rifle and Remington cartridges seized from the yacht, on which Zimmerman was seated with a bottle of water.

Reuters was unable to reach Zimmerman for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:28:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump shares messages from France's Macron offering G7 meeting after Davos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-shares-messages-frances-macron-offering-g7-meeting-after-davos-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron told U.S. President Donald Trump that he could set up a G7 meeting in Paris on Thursday afternoon and that he did not understand what Trump was "doing on Greenland," in a screenshot of the messages that Trump posted on Truth Social and said was a note from Macron.

The east African country's veteran leader Yoweri Museveni, 81, was declared the landslide winner of the January 15 poll with 71.6% of the vote against his opponent Bobi Wine with 24%.

Wine, the pop star-turned-politician, and his party, the National Unity Platform have rejected the results, alleging widespread irregularities including ballot stuffing, enforced disappearance of polling agents and intimidation by security forces. Wine's whereabouts remain unknown after he said he had escaped a raid by the military on his home.

In a video on NTV Uganda on Monday night Wine accused police of vandalising his home and said leaving his residence would free him "to speak to the world." He did not disclose his location.

At least 118 members of the NUP were taken to various courts in the capital Kampala on Monday and charged with offences including unlawful assembly, conspiracy and unlawful possession of election materials, NUP lawyer Kato Tumusiime told Reuters and court documents showed.

David Rubongoya, NUP's secretary general, denied their supporters were involved in violent activity.

"Majority of them were polling agents, they even had their letters confirming that they are polling agents of NUP, they were targeted, arrested violently," Rubongoya told local broadcaster NTV Uganda late on Monday.

Scattered protests broke out around the capital on Saturday shortly after the electoral body declared Museveni the winner, although they were quickly quashed by police using teargas and detentions.

Ahead of voting, the U.N. Human Rights Office accused Uganda's military and police of using live ammunition to disperse peaceful rallies, carrying arbitrary detentions and abduction of opposition supporters.

In power since 1986 and currently Africa's third longest-ruling head of state, Museveni's latest win means he will have been in power for nearly half a century when his new term ends in 2031.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:28:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KN2RQA4TARIPLFIYJN3GZZCLP4.jpg?auth=1ed9a7391a433f937fee25e74094a895e8a52abdc5e15174727b4407c512c697&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens 200% tariff on French wine over Macron's refusal to join 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-threatens-200-tariff-french-wine-macron-refusal-join-board-of-peace</link><description>US President Donald Trump said ⁠he will impose a 200 percent tariff on French wines and Champagnes , a move he claimed would push French President Emmanuel Macron to ​join Trump's Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving ‍global conflicts.

When asked by a reporter about Macron saying he will not join the ​board, Trump said, "Did he say that? Well, nobody wants him ​because he will be out of office very soon."

"I'll put a 200 percent tariff on his wines and Champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join," Trump said.

France intends to decline the invitation to join the initiative, at this stage, a source close to Macron ‍said on Monday.

Trump originally proposed establishing the Board of Peace when he announced last ​September his plan to end the war in Gaza . But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlines a broad role ‌ending conflicts globally.

A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the US administration calls for ‍members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.

The island of Diego Garcia houses a strategically important U.S.-UK air base in the Indian Ocean.

Britain and Mauritius last year struck a deal to pass on the sovereignty of the Chagos islands to Mauritius while allowing Britain to retain control of the air base under a long-term lease.

Trump wrote on his Truth Social account: "Shockingly, our 'brilliant' NATO Ally, the United Kingdom, is currently planning to give away the Island of Diego Garcia, the site of a vital U.S. Military Base, to Mauritius, and to do so FOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER."

Trump said there was no doubt that "China and Russia have noticed this act" by Britain.

The UK government did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment on Tuesday.

Trump has previously said that the encroaching presence of China and Russia makes Greenland vital to U.S. security interests, and repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland.

Britain's deal with Mauritius was delayed after the Trump's inauguration in January 2025, with London wanting to give the new administration time to examine the details of the plan.

In February of that year, Trump indicated he was "inclined to go along" with Britain on the agreement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 07:50:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIMWSN4XWNGXVPTO5N74QYT2XA.JPG?auth=c8143363cc516af47b32604023f92d6aac27dd7563947467cc110155d1447cc0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rescue workers clearing Karachi inferno ruins, 63 missing feared dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rescue-workers-clearing-karachi-inferno-ruins-63-missing-feared-dead-2026-01-20/</link><description>KARACHI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Firefighters were clearing the charred ruins of a Karachi mall on Tuesday as they tried to locate 63 people still missing after a fire that burned for nearly two days and killed 21 people.

Police have said most of the missing are feared dead and rescue workers were trying to locate bodies in the debris.

The city's largest fire in over a decade started late on Saturday and quickly spread through the sprawling Gul Plaza shopping complex, famous for its 1,200 family-owned stores that sold wedding clothes, toys, crockery and much else.

Firefighters battled the flames that created an inferno inside the mall throughout the night and late into Sunday before bringing the blaze under control, although small fires continued to break out across the ruins.

Kosar Bano, a woman standing near the site, said six of her family had gone to the mall to shop for a wedding. The last time she heard from them, they said they would be home in 15 minutes.

"The only hope we have is how many hands we will find, how many fingers we will find, and how many legs we will find. That's it," she said.

Much of the once-imposing structure, larger than a football field, was reduced to a pile of ash and debris scattered across the street as rescue workers searched for a growing list of missing people.

Rizwan Ahmed from the Rescue 1122 group said on Tuesday that 21 people were killed in the blaze while another 63 were still missing, nearly three days after the fire began.

Relief workers dug through the rubble and brought out human remains in sacks before sending them for DNA testing.

Senior police official Syed Asad Raza told Reuters that 15 DNA samples had been collected by Monday night to help identify the bodies.

There was also rising anger at the scene with people blaming a delayed rescue effort and jeering the city's mayor when he showed up at the site nearly 24 hours after the fire began.

The government has said it will investigate the cause of the fire and the response.

Police also said that all but three of the mall's 16 exits were locked when the fire began around the mall's closing time.

Gul Plaza's management did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

Islamabad has held talks with 13 countries, six to eight of which are in an advanced stage, for deals involving JF-17 jets made jointly with China as well as training aircraft, drones, and weapons systems, said three Pakistani sources who have knowledge of defence sales.

Pakistan's military and defence ministry did not provide details on any deals but the country's defence production minister confirmed that several countries were interested in jets and other military equipment.

China's defence ministry did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Analysts believe countries are searching for new supply chains following disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East. Pakistan's weapons have become a viable alternative after they were tested in a massive air battle with India in May, in which Pakistan's air force squadrons flew JF-17s alongside the advanced Chinese-made J-10s.

Reuters spoke to six sources privy to defence deals, three retired air force officials, and a dozen analysts who provided insight into Pakistan's rising weapons industry, including unreported details of negotiations.

While some expressed scepticism about whether Pakistan could navigate geopolitical pressures and increase production capacity, there was consensus that interest in Pakistani military hardware had surged. However, most analysts cautioned talks would not necessarily lead to signed deals.

"These talks are taking place (but) they can fall through due to international pressures," Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj told Reuters, terming any negotiations "guarded secrets".

"There are a lot of queries but we are negotiating," he said, adding interest had been expressed in air force equipment, ammunition and training.

Harraj also stressed the price difference between Pakistani jets and weapons and alternatives made in the U.S. and Europe. While some Western options may be more technologically advanced, they cost more than three times as much as an approximately $30 million to $40 million JF-17.

The sources said countries engaged in talks include Sudan, Saudi Arabia , Indonesia , Morocco, Ethiopia, and Nigeria as well as the government in eastern Libya led by Khalifa Haftar. Discussions on JF-17s and other weapons with Bangladesh and Iraq have been publicly acknowledged by Pakistan's military, although more details have not been made public.

Almost all the potential buyers are Muslim-majority nations, like Pakistan. Many are from the predominantly Muslim Middle East, where Pakistan has historically been a security provider.

Asim Suleiman, a retired Air Marshal who remains briefed on defence sales, said "there are also three African countries lined up" as buyers, which do not include deals with the Libyan National Army and Sudan previously reported by Reuters.

Three defence sources said among the most advanced talks is a wide-ranging arms, defence cooperation and intelligence-sharing deal with Bangladesh, which gained independence from Pakistan after the 1971 civil war.

The talks include JF-17 Block III multi-role fighter jets, MFI-17 Mushshak aircraft, Pakistani-made drones including the Shahpar reconnaissance and attack UAVs, air defence systems, and Mohafiz mine-resistant armoured vehicles, two of the sources said.

A key hurdle will be whether Pakistan can scale production of the JF-17, which has become the cornerstone of its weapons production programme, with training aircraft and drones also in demand.

Suleiman said that by the end of 2027 Pakistan's jet production rate will increase significantly, even possibly double from the current 20 or so aircraft manufactured annually
 , due to upgrades and expansions at the main factory.

Analysts said there were few visible constraints on increasing defence manufacturing and with backing from Beijing, Pakistan should be able to overcome most hurdles.

Pakistan "is becoming more relevant as a flexible, mid-tier provider of defence capacity," said Andreas Krieg, a lecturer at King's College London's security studies department.

"It can train forces, provide advisers, run joint exercises, support maritime operations, and offer a menu of cost-effective platforms. For fragile African partners, that combination can be attractive: it is faster than Western capacity-building, less politically encumbered, and often cheaper."

Partnerships with a rising private sector specialising in defence, particularly drones, will also speed up growth.

At Sysverve Aerospace in the city of Rawalpindi, where Pakistan's army also has its headquarters, workers build hundreds of kamikaze and reconnaissance drones a year that are primarily supplied to the military.

"The trend in the army is naturally moving toward engaging the private sector," company director Saad Mir told Reuters.

Siemon Wezeman, a senior arms transfer researcher at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said it was unclear how many reported talks over JF-17 sales would firm into hard deals, adding that Beijing could object to sales to certain clients.

While Pakistan was a natural partner for China to market the aircraft across the Middle East and Africa, "it's the ones to Sudan and Libya that are really problematic".

Both Libya and Sudan's Darfur region are subject to U.N. arms embargoes.

Alongside juggling ties with China, Pakistan is navigating Middle East tensions between allies Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Islamabad has signed a mutual defence pact with Riyadh and is discussing another defence agreement involving Saudi Arabia and Turkey, although details have not been made public.

"On the ideological side, Islamabad is more aligned with Saudis on overall narrative," said Emadeddin Badi from the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime.

"But where things get murkier is on the business, ports, mineral sides, all those supply chains are very much dominated by UAE, that's where the battle is playing out and Saudis have to play catch-up."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:35:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ROUKOLMVPRKY5MZJPS6FK5ZIVI.jpg?auth=c67ba8a9c535927877429504b606f374e37389d359b04318725dc7c4c7e0710a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China invited to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-invited-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-20/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 20 (Reuters) - China on Tuesday confirmed that it had been asked to join U.S. President Donald Trump 's "Board of Peace," an invitation that Washington had extended to dozens of countries in his bid to launch a global initiative aimed at resolving conflicts.

But Beijing, which recently struck a delicate trade truce with Washington, stopped short of saying whether it would accept or decline the invitation.

Governments from around the world have so far reacted cautiously to Trump's invitation to join the initiative, which diplomats say could undermine the United Nations.

The initiative would kick off by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other situations. The initiative's board would be chaired for life by Trump. Member states would be limited to three-year terms unless they paid $1 billion each .

"The Chinese side has received the invitation from the U.S.," said Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry, at a regular news conference.

He declined to comment when asked if China would accept the invitation.

Asked how China would evaluate Trump's presidency in the past year, especially in light of his stance on Venezuela and threat to annex Greenland, the spokesperson refrained from giving an assessment.

"Over the past year, China-U.S. relations have experienced ups and downs, but have achieved overall dynamic stability," said Guo, explaining that occasional variability in their relationship could be expected.

China is willing to work with the U.S. on further stabilising ties while safeguarding its own interests, Guo said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:36:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XWONIJSWTNKUHD2K4L52UC7IKA.jpg?auth=f77f9030ee297e634794b70af2b057dae2ab348234880de3b98a6799360dbb3c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China invited to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-invited-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:37:09 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>More than 5,600 Kyiv residential buildings left without heat after Russian attack</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260120-more-than-5-600-kyiv-residential-buildings-left-without-heat-after-russian-attack</link><description>A Russian aerial attack overnight on the Ukrainian capital has left thousands of residential buildings without heating in minus 14C temperatures , mayor Vitaly Klitschko said Tuesday.

"After this attack, 5,635 residential buildings are without heating," he said on Telegram, adding that a large part of the city was also without running water.

A woman was wounded and hospitalised, Klitschko said, adding that several buildings, including a primary school, were damaged.

These new strikes come some 10 days after Moscow 's worst attack on Kyiv 's energy grid since the start of its invasion of Ukraine four years ago.

The attack carried out at dawn on January 9 targeted energy facilities, depriving half the city of heating and leaving many residents without electricity for days in freezing temperatures.

In the night of Monday to Tuesday, Russia fired long-range combat drones before launching cruise missiles towards the city and its region.

Multiple explosions were heard in the city centre, AFP journalists reported.

"Municipal and energy services are working to restore heating, water , and electricity in city homes," Klitschko added.

Russia has been pounding Ukraine 's energy system since the start of its invasion – an attempt, according to Kyiv, to sap morale and break Ukrainians' resistance.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 08:37:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1eef0490-f5d4-11f0-98e9-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T072155Z-180216772-RC2T4JAXW0G3-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ATTACK-KYIV.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel demolishes buildings in UN Palestinian agency's East Jerusalem compound</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-demolishes-buildings-un-palestinian-agencys-east-jerusalem-compound-2026-01-20/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Israel demolished structures inside the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency's East Jerusalem compound on Tuesday after seizing the site last year, in an act condemned by the agency as a violation of international law.

Surrounded by Israeli forces, bulldozers razed several large buildings and other smaller structures inside the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's compound, where dozens of agency staff once worked.

UNRWA, which has been accused of bias by Israel, has not used the building since the start of last year after Israel ordered it to vacate all its premises and cease its operations.

A spokesperson for UNRWA, Jonathan Fowler, told Reuters that Israeli forces entered the compound around 7 a.m. local time (0500 GMT), forced out the compound's security guards and then brought in bulldozers to begin demolishing buildings inside.

"This is an unprecedented attack against UNRWA and its premises and it also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the privileges and immunities of the United Nations," Fowler said.

Some former UNRWA staff said the structures that were demolished on Tuesday had been used to store aid for the West Bank and Gaza.

Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the agency.

Israel has alleged that some UNRWA staff were members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and took part in the attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 Israelis and led to Israel's war against Hamas , in which Gaza authorities say more than 71,000 Palestinians have been killed.

UNRWA has fired several staff members but said Israel had not provided evidence for all the allegations against its staff.

In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said the "compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law."

Israel's Jerusalem municipality raided the compound last year, saying UNRWA had failed to pay property taxes of 11 million shekels ($3.4 million) after multiple warnings were issued and all necessary procedures were followed.

UNRWA says the East Jerusalem compound remained U.N. premises despite the Israeli ban on its operations and that the agency had no debts to the municipality.

The agency operates in East Jerusalem, which the U.N. and most countries consider territory occupied by Israel. Israel considers all Jerusalem to be part of the country.

UNRWA also operates in Gaza, the West Bank and elsewhere in the Middle East, providing schooling, healthcare, social services and shelter to millions of Palestinians.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:34:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ECOS4VVJAVJF3AIUQPA6EFRAHE.jpg?auth=9ba74bcc802e614a7078c32405963991f358400d15614843647add158f835057&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>FACTBOX Key facts about Chagos Islands deal signed by UK and Mauritius</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/factbox-key-facts-about-chagos-islands-deal-signed-by-uk-mauritius-2026-01-20/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has called Britain's deal to cede sovereignty of the island of Diego Garcia in the Chagos Islands to Mauritius an "act of total weakness", putting the agreement back into the spotlight eight months after it was signed.

Britain signed the multi-billion dollar deal after a last-gasp injunction was overturned, which secured it a lease for the strategically important UK-U.S. air base on Diego Garcia over the next century.

Here are some key points about the islands and the contentious deal:

The Chagos Archipelago is a group of six atolls with more than 600 islands in the Indian Ocean, 500 km (300 miles) south of the Maldives and halfway between Africa and Indonesia.

Around 4,000 people are currently stationed on the islands.

No indigenous inhabitants, often referred to as Chagossians or Ilois, have lived there since Britain forcibly displaced up to 2,000 people, mostly former agricultural workers, from the islands in the late 1960s and early 1970s to establish the Diego Garcia base.

Under increasing international pressure, Britain agreed in October 2024 to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, a former colony that gained independence in 1968. The deal, however, drew criticism from lawmakers as well as Britons born on Diego Garcia.

In May 2025, Britain said it would pay Mauritius 101 million pounds ($136 million) per year - calculated to be worth 3.4 billion pounds over the lifetime of the deal - to secure the future of the Diego Garcia military base under a 99-year lease.

At the time, the U.S. said it "welcomed the historic agreement", commending both countries' leaders for their vision. In February 2025, ahead of the signing, Trump also expressed preliminary support for the deal.

Canada, Australia, New Zealand and India have also backed the agreement.

Diego Garcia serves as a key military base in the Indian Ocean for the U.S. and Britain.

Recent operations launched from Diego Garcia include bombing strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen in 2024 and 2025, humanitarian aid deployments to Gaza and attacks against Taliban and al Qaeda targets in Afghanistan in 2001.

China also has a growing reach in the region, including close trade ties with Mauritius.

Britain split the archipelago off from its colonial island territory of Mauritius in 1965, three years before granting independence to Mauritius - minus the islands.

In 2019 after a request by the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice issued a non-binding ruling calling on Britain to give up control, saying it wrongfully forced the population to leave to make way for the base.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio raised concerns in February 2025 about potential threats to U.S. security, particularly in light of China's influence in the region.

Mauritian Prime Minister Navin Ramgoolam, who was elected after the initial agreement was reached, also questioned the deal when he took office. Ramgoolam had wanted Trump to look at the plan and say whether it was a good arrangement.

Some Chagossians, many of whom ended up living in Britain after being removed from the archipelago, have protested against the agreement on the grounds that they were not consulted.

Kemi Badenoch, leader of the opposition in Britain, said on Tuesday on X that the deal was "complete self sabotage" that made "us and our NATO allies weaker".

Before the deal was signed, a UK High Court judge issued a last-minute injunction sought by Bernadette Dugasse and Bertrice Pompe, British nationals who were born in Diego Garcia and criticised the deal for excluding Chagossians.

The injunction was overturned hours later by Britain's High Court, clearing the way for the deal to be signed.

Spaniards are reeling following the first-ever deadly accident on Spain's extensive high-speed rail network, which occurred on Sunday evening near Adamuz in Cordoba province, about 360 km (223 miles) south of Madrid. Experts say a faulty rail joint might be key to determining the cause of the derailment that led to the collision between two trains.

Another body was found overnight within the wreck of the first derailed train that belonged to private consortium Iryo, elevating the death toll to 41, authorities said on Tuesday.

At least three bodies have been seen still trapped inside the wreckage, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told state broadcaster TVE late on Monday.

He said that police had received 43 missing-person reports, which broadly matched the provisional death toll, but cautioned that the final number would not be confirmed until rescue teams had lifted the derailed carriages.

The collision occurred in rolling, olive-growing countryside in the foothills of a mountain range. The site is only reachable by a single-track road, making it difficult for rescuers to access with heavy machinery.

King Felipe and Queen Letizia were set to visit the site along with Deputy Prime Minister Maria Jesus Montero later on Tuesday, the government's public agenda showed.

Tales by survivors of tragedy and fortune were beginning to emerge on Tuesday.

Lola Beltran told TVE she had changed carriages minutes before the crash, moving from her assigned seat in one of the hardest-hit cars to another carriage to sit with a colleague.

"We had to break the windows with emergency hammers and pry open the doors to get out," Beltran said, describing scenes of chaos, screams, and torn-out seats.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:35:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5TFK6JVGPFOCVC63RA226IEBYQ.jpg?auth=7df4742df7cdeebbbeebdd41d7c25325fb6e1ed1f88c0caafdfcb48ef3f53882&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Moscow says it expects U.S. to release Russian crew from seized Venezuela-linked tanker</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/moscow-says-it-expects-us-release-russian-crew-seized-venezuela-linked-tanker-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:04 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Egypt's Sisi to meet Trump on the sidelines of Davos, presidency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/egypts-sisi-meet-trump-sidelines-davos-presidency-says-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>India PM Modi's party elects youngest-ever president with eye to youth vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-pm-modis-party-elects-youngest-ever-president-with-eye-youth-vote-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:07 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US Treasury Secretary Bessent brushes off 'hysteria' over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/us-treasury-secretary-bessent-brushes-off-hysteria-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Moscow says it expects U.S. to release Russian crew from seized Venezuela-linked tanker</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/moscow-says-it-expects-us-release-russian-crew-seized-venezuela-linked-tanker-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Egypt's Sisi to meet Trump on the sidelines of Davos, presidency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/egypts-sisi-meet-trump-sidelines-davos-presidency-says-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>India PM Modi's party elects youngest-ever president with eye to youth vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/india-pm-modis-party-elects-youngest-ever-president-with-eye-youth-vote-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:19 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US Treasury Secretary Bessent brushes off 'hysteria' over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/us-treasury-secretary-bessent-brushes-off-hysteria-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:21 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran crackdown: 'Can a government willing to kill its own people be trusted to reform?'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/iran-crackdown-can-a-government-willing-to-kill-its-own-people-be-trusted-to-reform</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4859ddec-f5dd-11f0-a793-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260116-133344-133942-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump shares private message from Macron offering G7 meeting in Paris</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-shares-messages-france-macron-g7-meeting-paris-after-davos</link><description>Macron sent a "private message" to Donald Trump offering to organise a G7 summit in Paris on Thursday in which Russia could be invited on the sidelines, the French president's entourage confirmed.

Trump posted this message on his Truth Social network in which Macron also proposes inviting Ukraine to the meeting as well as Denmark to discuss disagreements over Greenland .

The offer comes as Europe is weighing countermeasures after Trump threatened to impose tariffs on eight European countries in a bid to pressure the EU over Greenland.

"My friend, we are completely aligned on Syria . We can do great things in Iran . I don't understand what you are doing in Greenland," Macron said in his message.

"I can organise a G7 meeting in Paris on Thursday afternoon after Davos," Macron wrote, referring to the gathering of global elites in Switzerland where the US president is set to be in attendance.

"I can invite the Ukrainians, the Danes, the Syrians and the Russians on the sidelines" of the meeting, he added.

It was not immediately clear when the messages from Macron to Trump were sent.

Trump's relations with Macron hit a new low Monday when the US president threatened 200 percent tariffs on French wine over France's intention to decline an invitation to join his " Board of Peace ".

"Tariff threats to influence our foreign policy are unacceptable and ineffective," a source close to Macron said on Tuesday.

Macron is scheduled to arrive at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland on Tuesday morning, and return to Paris on Tuesday evening, Elysée aides said on Monday, adding there were no plans to extend his stay to  Wednesday, when Trump arrives in the Swiss town.

In December the French president ‍said Europe will have to re-engage in direct talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin if the latest US-led efforts to broker ‌a Ukraine peace deal ​founder.

Last week, Macron said that France was now providing two-thirds of intelligence information to Ukraine , largely replacing the US.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 09:36:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e869a306-f2d9-11ef-958e-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000_36YL4PQ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights council to hold emergency session on Iran, document shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-human-rights-council-hold-emergency-session-iran-document-shows-2026-01-20/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Council will hold an emergency session on Iran on Friday, with proponents aiming to discuss "alarming violence" used against protesters, a document showed on Tuesday.

An Iranian official said authorities have verified at least 5,000 deaths in the protests which are the biggest demonstrations since 2022, prompting U.N. rights chief Volker Turk to condemn the violence.

"A special session is needed because of the importance and urgency of the situation, in particular due to credible reports of alarming violence, crackdowns on protesters and violations of international human rights law across the country," according to a letter written by Iceland's ambassador Einar Gunnarsson on behalf of a group of countries including Germany and Britain, and seen by Reuters.

The special session will happen on Friday, the U.N. confirmed, adding that 21 countries so far have supported the proposal.

Human Rights Watch has denounced mass unlawful killings and is asking for an existing U.N. probe, set up by the council in 2022 after the last wave of protests, to investigate the deaths and be given extra financing to do so.

Iran's diplomatic mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Diplomats said Iran had sent to missions pages of rebuttal against allegations of a crackdown, saying the clashes followed armed attacks on security forces.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:29:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NKQ3SU34TVNYZPIWFWCKUZS7NQ.jpg?auth=678ff3d14b62b2332bd46b1bd09b95b9053901d8219593f99ab1568e0515946e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens 200% tariffs on French wines to get Macron on Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-threatens-tariffs-french-wines-get-macron-join-board-peace-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON/PARIS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to hit French wines and champagnes with 200% tariffs in an apparent effort to cajole French President Emmanuel Macron into joining his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts.

Trump's initiative, which would start by addressing Gaza and then expand to deal with other conflicts, raises questions about the role of the United Nations and a source close to Macron said the French president intended to decline the invitation to join.

When asked about Macron's stance, Trump said, "Did he say that? Well, nobody wants him because he will be out of office very soon."

"I'll put a 200% tariff on his wines and champagnes, and he'll join, but he doesn't have to join," Trump said.

Macron is due in Davos for the day on Tuesday before a scheduled return to Paris in the evening. Elysee aides have said there are no plans to extend his stay to Wednesday, when Trump arrives in the Swiss mountain resort town.

In another shot at the French leader, Trump published a private message from Macron in which he said he did not understand Trump's actions over Greenland . France holds an election to replace Macron in 2027.

Wines and spirits exported to the United States from the European Union currently face a 15% tariff - a rate the French have been lobbying hard to reduce to zero since Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed a U.S.-EU trade deal in Scotland last summer.

The United States is the largest market for French wine and spirits, with shipments to the U.S. at 3.8 billion euros in 2024.

"The fact that we're getting more threats is going to make the industry harder to invest in, it's going to make it harder for companies to make decisions for their own investments," said Laurence Whyatt, head of European beverages research at Barclays.

"They will have to be more reserved, keep a bit of cash back, not invest, because they need to be able to weather the storms as and when they come."

Shares in luxury conglomerate LVMH (LVMH.PA) , opens new tab , which owns major champagne producers including Moet &amp; Chandon, were down 2% in early trading.

Gabriel Picard, chairman of the French wine and spirits export lobby FEVS, told Reuters on Monday, before the new threat, that the industry had seen a 20% to 25% hit to U.S. activity in the second half of last year from previous trade measures.

A Macron aide said the Elysee took note of Trump's remarks and stressed that tariff threats to influence a third party's foreign policy were unacceptable.

Europeans are weighing their own 93 billion euro tariff riposte and even the use of the bloc's " Anti-Coercion Instrument " to retaliate against a separate threat of tariff hikes against a group of European states over Greenland.

"It's brutal, it's designed to break us, it's a tool for blackmail. All of this is outrageous," French Farm Minister Annie Genevard told news channel TF1.

"We have the tools; Europeans must take responsibility. We cannot allow such an escalation."

Trump has threatened a 200% tariff on wine and other alcoholic beverages imported from the EU before, including last year in March as transatlantic trade tensions escalated.

Governments have reacted cautiously to Trump's Board of Peace invitation, a plan that diplomats said could harm the work of the United Nations.

Speaking at a news conference in Moscow, Lavrov said Russia had no interest in interfering in Greenland's affairs and that Washington knew that Moscow itself had no plans to take control of the island.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:31:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PO2T3OEY3JLQZDXXPICPL42FHU.jpg?auth=3eeb461a48cc6c087d77f287393edd6b11e4460fb0449863b582f2999e1049cf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>House Speaker Johnson: UK and U.S. can work through differences</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/house-speaker-johnson-uk-us-can-work-through-differences-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:31:56 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Russia says Moldova's plans to merge with Romania would destroy its statehood</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-says-moldovas-plans-merge-with-romania-would-destroy-its-statehood-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:31:58 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Trump's first year back in office: Relationship between Europe and US 'changed forever'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-s-first-year-back-in-office-relationship-between-europe-and-us-changed-forever</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:32:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/28a8183a-f5e5-11f0-b510-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-100456-101042-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s Gaza 'Board of Peace': A covert bid to replace the UN?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-s-gaza-board-of-peace-a-covert-bid-to-replace-the-un</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:32:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f9a8eb6c-f5e5-11f0-b281-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-101202-101626-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s health under scrutiny: Speculation, signals and silence</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260120-trump-health-under-scrutiny-speculation-signals-and-silence</link><description>It took only a few minutes of footage to reignite the debate. During a 9/11 commemoration in September, cameras caught what appeared to be a pronounced droop on the right side of Trump’s face.

The images quickly went viral. “So this guy like 100% had a stroke, right?” podcaster Jeremy Kaplowitz wrote on X that same day, a post later liked more than 272,000 times. The White House did not immediately comment. On January 15, however, the Daily Beast reported a theory from Professor Bruce Davidson of Washington State University’s Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, suggesting a medical episode “ six months ago or more, earlier in 2025 ”. Davidson also noted that Trump began shuffling his feet while walking and was “garbling” his words.

Washington quickly pushed back, dismissing the report as a “BS fake news story.”

Since returning to the Oval Office, close scrutiny of Trump’s public appearances have sparked numerous rumours about his declining health. The White House has sometimes offered rather unexpected explanations. Bruises seen on his hands during a February meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron were attributed to the fact that he is “constantly working and shaking hands all day, every day”, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.

When images showed Trump with swollen ankles and struggling to walk steadily, Leavitt said the president suffers from a “chronic venous deficiency”, adding that there was “no evidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or arterial disease”. But unlike previous presidents, no full medical records have been released – only summarised memoranda from White House physician Dr Sean Barbabella have been made public.

“Let’s be clear: we have no idea what his health condition is. All we can really assess is what we see,” presidential historian Barbara Perry says. “And what we witness is an almost octogenarian man who keeps nodding off at public events, and whose speeches can be … quite strange.”

Trump’s lifestyle has also drawn significant attention. He has long dismissed the value of exercise and openly embraces fast food. After returning to the Oval Office following his inauguration, he quickly had the famous Diet Coke button – a red button on his desk that summons staff to deliver his preferred soda – reinstalled, echoing the setup of his first term.

When Trump’s controversial health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was asked about Trump’s diet, he reportedly replied : “I don’t know how he is alive.”

Trump’s family history – his father Fred died after suffering from Alzheimer’s disease – is frequently cited by critics including his niece , psychologist Mary Trump. But doctors warn against drawing simplistic conclusions based loosely on genetics. The Alzheimer’s Association notes that, although family history can affect the level of risk, lifestyle factors play a significant role.

To fend off questions about his mental fitness, Trump has repeatedly boasted that he “ aced ” several cognitive exams, claiming “ perfect ” scores not just as proof of his fitness for office but as evidence of exceptional sharpness. “I got the highest score possible,” he has said at rallies, in interviews, and on Truth Social, claiming that no other president had been willing to take such tests.

The US president even declared in December that he is “ sharper than I was 25 years ago ” – in response to a New York Times article about how he seemed to be slowing down – before apparently dozing off at a cabinet meeting.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment , which Trump took in 2018 and then twice in 2025, is a screening tool rather than a diagnostic test, with limited scope. “Any adolescent could easily pass it,” argues emeritus political scientist Denis Lacorne, who has followed US presidents since the 1960s.

“Constantly invoking it is anything but reassuring.”

“We’ve just lived through this with President Biden,” says Perry. “We saw it with our own eyes, yet it was covered up until it became impossible to deny,” she says. “Presidents can decline very quickly. Some draw energy from crowds and public appearances, which can mask fatigue or deterioration.”

Trump thus fits into a long American tradition. “Woodrow Wilson governed after a debilitating stroke in 1919 and the last year of his presidency was managed by his wife. Franklin D. Roosevelt had suffered polio and was in a wheelchair, though not impaired cognitively. John F. Kennedy suffered from Addison's disease and a bad back; he was heavily medicated and this was concealed,” University of Texas at Austin professor James Galbraith said in an email.

The high-pressure nature of the job also plays a role.

“Presidents operate in a cocoon. The public never has full certainty about their condition,” Galbraith said. “Erratic decisions can reflect impairment – or simply bad information and extreme pressure.”

“The presidency makes you age faster,” adds Olivier Richomme, a political scientist at Lyon 2 University. “It’s not a job designed for someone close to 80.”

“With Trump,” he adds, “there is also a culture of loyalty and courtisanship that prevents honest discussion”.

The constitutional safeguard of the 25th Amendment theoretically allows for a transfer of power in case of incapacity. In practice, few believe it could be invoked today.

“It’s a nuclear option,” Richomme says. “Politically, it is almost unimaginable in a polarised system, because it requires two-thirds of Congress to agree.”

Trump’s frequent dozing and tendency to veer off topic into sometimes bizarre tangents have long fuelled his critics.

His supporters cite his packed schedule, frequent rallies and constant media exposure as evidence of his stamina.

“They refuse to see it, while those who oppose him can only see the opposite,” Richomme says. Trump’s impulsive rhetoric and erratic policy signals make questions about his health unavoidable.

Within the Republican Party, and ahead of midterms that could hand the Democrats a landslide victory , the subject remains taboo.

“No one around him has an interest in raising the issue,” Richomme says. “Silence is safer.”

“The danger isn’t only decline,” Perry warns. “It’s decline combined with secrecy, loyalists and the absence of independent advisers.”

As with several presidents before him, the full truth about Trump’s health may only emerge after his tenure in office.

Surrounded by Israeli forces, ​ bulldozers razed several large buildings and other smaller structures inside the United Nations Relief and Works Agency's compound, where dozens of ‍agency staff once worked.

UNRWA, which has been accused of bias by Israel , has not used the building since the start of last year after Israel ordered it to vacate all its premises ​and cease its operations.

A spokesperson for UNRWA, Jonathan Fowler, told Reuters that Israeli forces entered the ​compound around 7am local time (0500 GMT), forced out the compound's security guards and then brought in bulldozers to begin demolishing buildings inside.

"This is an unprecedented attack against UNRWA and its premises and it also constitutes a serious violation of international law and the privileges and immunities of the United Nations," Fowler said.

Some former UNRWA staff said the structures demolished on Tuesday had been used to store aid for the West Bank and Gaza .

"The destruction today by the Israeli occupation is another message to the world that Israel is the only country that can demolish international law and get away with it," said Hakam Shahwan, ‍former chief of staff at UNRWA's East Jerusalem headquarters.

Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the ​agency.

Israel's far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir posted a video on social media standing in front of the UNRWA compound as a bulldozer began to tear it down.

"This is a historic day, it's a holiday," said Ben-Gvir.

Israel has alleged that some UNRWA ‌staff were members of the Palestinian militant group Hamas and took part in the attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed about 1,200 Israelis and led to Israel's war against Hamas, in which Gaza authorities ‍say more than 71,000 Palestinians have been killed.

UNRWA has fired several staff members but said Israel had not provided evidence for all the allegations against its staff . Fowler previously told Reuters that Israel had been conducting a "sustained disinformation campaign" against UNRWA.

In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry said the "compound does not enjoy any immunity and the seizure of this compound by Israeli authorities was carried out in accordance with both Israeli and international law."

Israel's Jerusalem municipality raided the compound last year, saying UNRWA had failed to pay property taxes after multiple warnings.

UNRWA says the East Jerusalem compound remained UN premises ‍despite the Israeli ban on its operations and that the agency had no debts to the municipality.

The agency operates in East Jerusalem, which the UN and most countries ‌consider territory occupied by ​Israel. Israel considers all Jerusalem to be part of the country.

UNRWA also operates in Gaza, the West Bank and elsewhere in the Middle East , providing schooling, healthcare, social services and shelter to millions of Palestinians.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:32:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/970bb4b4-f5de-11f0-946a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T085319Z-724829281-RC2W4JAX95KF-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-JERUSALEM-UNRWA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel orders Gaza families to move in first forced evacuation since ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-orders-gaza-families-move-first-forced-evacuation-since-ceasefire-2026-01-20/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Israeli forces have ordered dozens of Palestinian families in the southern Gaza Strip to leave their homes in the first forced evacuation since October's ceasefire, as residents and Hamas said on Tuesday the military was expanding the area under its control.

Residents of Bani Suhaila, east of Khan Younis, said the leaflets were dropped on Monday on families living in tent encampments in the Al-Reqeb neighbourhood.

“Urgent message. The area is under IDF control. You must evacuate immediately,” said the leaflets, written in Arabic, Hebrew, and English, which the army dropped over the Al‑Reqeb neighbourhood in the town of Bani Suhaila.

In the two-year war before the U.S. brokered ceasefire was signed in October, Israel dropped leaflets over areas that were subsequently raided or bombarded, forcing some families to move several times.

Residents and a source from the Hamas militant group said this was the first time they had been dropped since then. The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ceasefire has not progressed beyond its first phase, under which major fighting has stopped, Israel withdrew from less than half of Gaza, and Hamas released hostages in return for Palestinian detainees and prisoners.

Virtually the entire population of more than 2 million people are confined to around a third of Gaza's territory, mostly in makeshift tents and damaged buildings, where life has resumed under control of an administration led by Hamas.

Israel and Hamas have accused each other of major breaches of the ceasefire and remain far apart on the more difficult steps planned for the next phase.

Mahmoud, a resident from the Bani Suhaila area, who asked not to give his family name, said the evacuation orders impacted at least 70 families, living in tents and homes, some of which were partially damaged, in the area.

"We have fled the area and relocated westward. It is maybe the fourth or fifth time the occupation expanded the yellow line since last month," he told Reuters by phone from Khan Younis, referring to the line behind which Israel has withdrawn.

"Each time they move it around 120 to 150 metres (yards) inside the Palestinian-controlled territory, swallowing more land," the father-of-three said.

Ismail Al-Thawabta, director of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, said the Israeli military had expanded the area under its control in eastern Khan Younis five times since the ceasefire, forcing the displacement of at least 9,000 people.

“On Monday, 19 January 2026, the Israeli occupation forces dropped warning leaflets demanding the forced evacuation of the Bani Suhaila area in eastern Khan Younis Governorate, in a measure that falls within a policy of intimidation and pressure on civilians,” Thawabta told Reuters.

He said the new evacuation orders affected approximately 3,000 people.

“The move created a state of humanitarian disruption, increased pressure on the already limited shelter areas, and further deepened the internal displacement crisis in the governorate,” Thawabta added.

Israel's military has previously said it has opened fire after identifying what it called "terrorists" crossing the yellow line and approaching its troops, posing an immediate threat to them.

It has continued to conduct air strikes and targeted operations across Gaza. The Israeli military has said it views "with utmost severity" any attempts by militant groups in Gaza to attack Israel.

Under future phases of the ceasefire that have yet to be hammered out, U.S. President Donald Trump's plan envisages Hamas disarming, Israel pulling out further, and an internationally backed administration rebuilding Gaza.

More than 460 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the ceasefire took effect.

Israel launched its operations in Gaza in the wake of an attack by Hamas-led fighters in October 2023 which killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 people, according to health authorities in the enclave.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:57:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6QDTMVCHKNLQZBK5GOEOWUA53Q.jpg?auth=d34028749ca383d97b104ffaa255e411ded40d288aca9601c3ee53409b7f8aa8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says it has no specific contacts with US on expiring nuclear treaty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-says-it-has-no-specific-contacts-with-us-expiring-nuclear-treaty-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 10:57:57 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>UN chief Guterres cancels Davos trip due to bad cold, spokesperson says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/un-chief-guterres-cancels-davos-trip-due-bad-cold-spokesperson-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.N.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) warned the severe geomagnetic storm could potentially cause problems with technology, including issues with voltage control and impacts on satellite operations.

NOAA officials said those in northern and central states of the continental US "can look for the aurora ... at night, and should weather conditions permit".

"Auroras may become visible over much of the northern half of the country and maybe as far south as Alabama to northern California."

The storm is a result of "an eruption of solar material and magnetic fields" that left the sun on Sunday.

The severity of this geomagnetic storm is "very rare", NOAA said.

Shawn Dahl of NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center said the last time a solar radiation storm of this intensity showered the earth was in 2003.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:00:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/073e981a-f5e3-11f0-96c6-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T071733Z-1768893448-DPAF260120X99X223849-RTRFIPP-4-ENVIRONMENT-NATURE-AURORABOREALIS-ALPS-TREES-PINK-GREEN-PURPLE-PROJECT.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK approves China plan for its largest embassy in Europe despite espionage fears</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-approves-china-plan-its-largest-embassy-europe-despite-espionage-fears-2026-01-20/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Britain's government gave approval on Tuesday for China to build its largest embassy in Europe in London, hoping to improve ties with Beijing despite British and U.S. politicians' warnings that it could be used as a base for spying.

China's plans to build a new embassy on the site of the two-century-old Royal Mint Court near the Tower of London have stalled for three years over opposition from local residents, lawmakers and Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners in Britain.

The decision was announced before an expected visit to China by Prime Minister Keir Starmer this month, the first by a British leader since 2018. Some British and Chinese officials said the trip was dependent on the embassy being approved.

"All material considerations were taken into account when making this decision," the government said in a statement. "The decision is now final unless it is successfully challenged in court."

The Chinese government purchased Royal Mint Court in 2018 but its requests for planning permission to build a new embassy on the site were rejected by the local council in 2022. Chinese President Xi Jinping asked Starmer last year to intervene.

The government took control of the planning decision last year and an inquiry was held last February to hear arguments about whether the embassy should be approved.

Some politicians in Britain and the United States have said China should be barred from building on the site near London's historic financial district because it might enable Beijing to eavesdrop on fibre-optic cables that are used by finance firms and travel underneath the area.

British security officials have also warned that allowing China to build a much larger embassy would mean more Chinese spies in Britain as well as more diplomats, an assertion dismissed by the Chinese embassy in London.

The head of Britain's MI5 domestic spy agency said in October his spy agency had more than a century of experience dealing with foreign embassies, suggesting any security risks could be managed.

But MI5 has also warned of a threat posed by attempts by China to recruit and cultivate people with access to the British government.

The agency issued a warning to lawmakers in November about Beijing trying to interfere in British politics, and the collapse of a trial of two British men charged with spying on members of parliament for China led to criticism the government was prioritising better relations over national security.

The government has approved the new embassy - after years of diplomatic pressure from China - as Starmer tries to reset relations with Beijing, which is one of his foreign policy priorities.

Britain has in the past decade moved from saying it wanted to be China's biggest supporter in Europe to being one of its fiercest critics, and is now trying to improve relations again. Starmer said last month closer business ties were in the national interest.

Some local residents who oppose China building a large embassy in the area are considering whether to ask for a judicial review against the decision.

The new embassy would be one of the largest diplomatic outposts in the world with a footprint of about 55,000 square metres (600,000 square feet), according to the planning application.

That is almost 10 times the size of China's current embassy in central London and considerably bigger than its embassy in the United States.

Before Tuesday's decision, China had blocked plans by Britain to expand its embassy in Beijing, officials involved in the talks said.

Chinese officials say that when Beijing purchased the site for 255 million pounds ($343.54 million), it received assurances from the then Conservative government that it could build its embassy.

Royal Mint Court was from the early 19th century until 1967 the site of the Royal Mint, where coins are produced.

Starmer said the government was prepared to take robust action, a day after it said it would examine whether features such as infinite scrolling and the age at which children can access platforms should be restricted.

The Labour government said it would examine evidence from around the world on suggested proposals including looking at whether a social media ban for children would be effective and how best to make such a ban work if it were imposed.

"This is a hugely complex issue – so it's important it's properly considered," Starmer said on Substack.

Ministers will visit Australia, which last month became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, to learn from their approach, it said on Monday.

The government did not specify an age threshold, saying it was exploring a ban "for children under a certain age" and other measures such as better age checks and looking into whether the current digital age of consent was too low.

The proposals come as governments and regulators worldwide contend with the risks of exposing children to social media, as well as the impact of screen time on their development and mental health.

The recent rapid explosion of AI-generated content online has exacerbated those concerns, highlighted this month by a public outcry over reports of Elon Musk's Grok AI chatbot generating non-consensual sexual images, including of minors.

The British government has already set out plans for an outright ban on artificial intelligence nudification tools, while working to stop children being able to take, share or view nude images on their devices, it said in Monday's statement.

The government said it was also considering removing or limiting functionalities that could drive addictive or compulsive use of social media.

Britain's recently enforced Online Safety Act, one of the strictest safety regimes, has increased the share of children encountering age checks online to 47% from 30%, while cutting visits to pornography sites by a third, according to the government.

"These laws were never meant to be the end point, and we know parents still have serious concerns," Technology Secretary Liz Kendall said.

Starmer said childhood should not mean judgement from strangers or pressure to perform for likes, adding that "for too many today, it means being pulled into a world of endless scrolling, anxiety and comparison".

"We will work with experts to identify the most effective measures we can take to do more," he said, reiterating that "no option is off the table".

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that several Ukrainian electrical substations vital for nuclear safety were affected by the military activity, while power lines to some other nuclear power plants were also impacted.

Russia launched a combined drone and missile attack on Ukraine early on Tuesday, knocking out power and heating supplies to thousands of apartment buildings in Kyiv amid freezing temperatures, Ukrainian officials said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:27:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian govt says 120 Islamic State detainees escaped prison</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/syrian-govt-says-120-islamic-state-detainees-escaped-prison</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:29:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/21ea2afe-f5f1-11f0-8ae8-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-110830-111017-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why did the ceasefire fail in Syria and what about IS group detainees?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/why-did-the-ceasefire-fail-in-syria-and-what-about-isis-detainees</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:29:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d1ab971c-f5f0-11f0-b010-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-103751-104212-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU Commission working on package to support Arctic security, von der Leyen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-commission-working-package-support-arctic-security-von-der-leyen-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday that the bloc's executive arm is working on a package to support Arctic security and warned that tariffs proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump over Greenland are a mistake.

"Arctic security can only be achieved together, and this is why the proposed additional tariffs are a mistake, especially between long-standing allies," von der Leyen said in a speech at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos.

"The European Union and the United States have agreed to a trade deal last July, and in politics as in business – a deal is a deal," she said.

"Plunging us into a downward spiral would only aid the very adversaries we are both so committed to keeping out of the strategic landscape, so our response will be unflinching, united and proportional."

Trump has intensified his push to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark, prompting the European Union to weigh hitting back with its own measures .

Von der Leyen said the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Denmark and Greenland is non-negotiable and that work is underway to boost security in the high north.

"We are working on a package to support Arctic security," she said.

The EU is also working on a "massive European investment surge in Greenland", she said, to support the local economy and infrastructure.

The Commission president also said the EU will work with the US and other partners on wider Arctic security, adding that the planned surge in defense spending could be used on a "European icebreaker capability and other equipment vital to the Arctic security."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:46:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O4QISWEUMFJPRBEE6M3SNCUTTI.jpg?auth=b99441ee361f0533c248e7f6715e9d2136f55386c5a242479f803a2da09dcf70&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Lavrov says Britain should no longer be called 'Great' Britain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-lavrov-says-britain-should-no-longer-be-called-great-britain-2026-01-20/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that Britain should no longer be called Great Britain as it was the only country in the world to officially name itself "Great".

"I think that Britain should be called simply Britain because 'Great Britain' is the only example of a country which calls itself 'Great'," Lavrov told reporters as he spoke about colonialism following comments on Greenland .

His spokeswoman then gave Ivor Bennett, a correspondent from Britain's Sky News, a question. "No offence," Lavrov said.

Lavrov said another example of a country which called itself "great" was the "Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya" led by Muammar Gaddafi.

"But it no longer exists."

The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is usually called "Velikobritaniya", or Great Britain, in Russian.

As the U.S. under Donald Trump seeks to reset ties with Moscow and broker peace between Russia and Ukraine, Britain has been granted the status of Russia's public enemy number one .

On Russian state television, "Perfidious Albion", a term used frequently by news anchors, is cast as a scheming global intelligence power that is meddling behind the scenes from Washington to Iran in a duplicitous bid to undermine Russian interests across the world.

Britain says Russia is a threat to Europe. Amid the war in Ukraine, Russia and the West have repeatedly accused each other of unfurling espionage campaigns of an intensity not seen since the depths of the Cold War.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:46:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AYJT74MECNLA7GZTHEMQV6YXBA.jpg?auth=40bf6062421ce167b86551fbb3271ada46bfdbe9ac6c3ec84564926de868a954&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US-led coalition negotiating Al-Hol camp handover, Syrian sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-led-coalition-negotiating-al-hol-camp-handover-syrian-sources-say-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S.-led coalition against the Islamic State was negotiating a handover of the Al-Hol camp, which houses IS-linked civilians, to Syrian authorities, three Syrian sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

The Marina de Cudeyo Town Council confirmed the incident on Sunday through their social media accounts, describing the disappearance as "an unfortunate event" and suggesting foul play. "Everything indicates that it was a theft," the council stated.

The statue, which has been a focal point in tiny Pedrena as a tribute to Ballesteros' enduring legacy, vanished sometime over the weekend, local police told Reuters, indicating that they are now working to identify those responsible and recover the tribute.

“If anyone has observed any suspicious activity, especially in the last 24 hours, please report it to the police,” the town council urged in a post on Facebook.

The life-size statue of the late golfer was located in La Barquería Park and was created in 2009 by sculptor Salvador García Ceballos. It was permanently installed in 2017.

The statue is made of bronze and depicts him in one of his most characteristic poses, with his fist raised in a triumphant gesture after winning the 1984 British Open at St Andrews.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 11:47:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UE6HKTFIHJNSHIKRJWNNJO5HJE.jpg?auth=58e8781535d753f7a93e0dd2fc1ae935e3e20f7a12eb62d7f993af6696f13ff7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan will soon decide whether to join Trump's Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-will-soon-decide-whether-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-20/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan will soon decide whether to join U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace initiative after having received an invitation, Turkey's foreign minister said on Tuesday.

The Civil-Military Coordination Centre was established in southern Israel in October under President Donald Trump 's plan to end the war in Gaza . It was tasked with monitoring the Israel-Hamas ceasefire, facilitating the entry of aid and developing post-war policies for the Palestinian territory.

Dozens of countries, including Germany, France, Britain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, sent personnel including military planners and intelligence officials to the centre as they sought to influence discussions on Gaza's future.

But eight foreign diplomats told Reuters that officials from some European countries had not returned to the CMCC, located near the Gaza border, since the Christmas and New Year holidays. Several nations were questioning the purpose of the centre, with one Western diplomat describing it as "directionless".

"Everybody thinks it's a disaster, but there is no alternative," said another Western diplomat.

The European rethink, which has not been previously reported, is the latest sign of unease among Washington's allies as Trump pursues unorthodox foreign policies towards Gaza, Greenland and Venezuela.

Some European governments were now considering whether to reduce their CMCC presence or even to stop sending personnel altogether, the diplomats said. The diplomats declined to say which governments were reassessing their position.

The White House and U.S. State Department did not respond to requests for comment on this story.

The CMCC is run by a U.S. general and also hosts both American and Israeli military personnel. Its establishment was a key element of the first phase of Trump's ceasefire plan, which has been shaken by repeated Israeli airstrikes in Gaza against what Israel says have been Hamas attempts to carry out attacks.

As Trump pursues the next phase of his plan, including by setting up a "Board of Peace" to supervise Gaza policy, it is unclear whether the CMCC will retain any influence over policy formation or aid distribution.

The diplomats said it was also not known how the CMCC would work with the Board of Peace's Gaza-focused bodies, including its committee of Palestinian technocrats .

Washington last week announced Trump's plan had moved to the second phase, which would include demilitarisation and reconstruction. But there was no mention of further Israeli military withdrawals, beyond a partial pullback that has left 53% of Gaza still in Israeli hands.

In November, Reuters reported U.S. partners were concerned that Gaza could be effectively partitioned as efforts to advance Trump's plan beyond the ceasefire stalled.

There was also no mention in Trump's second phase announcement of the expected deployment of a multinational stabilisation force into the enclave.

Gaza's border with Egypt has yet to reopen, although this was supposed to have happened during the plan's first phase that took effect in October, amid repeated Israeli objections.

The diplomats said there had been no significant increase in humanitarian aid entering Gaza since the truce took hold, contradicting White House assertions, despite widespread homelessness and malnutrition.

Many trucks entering Gaza were in fact carrying commercial goods, they said, and Israel remained effectively in control of Gaza's aid policy, despite the U.S.-led CMCC being tasked with helping boost relief supplies into the enclave.

Israel bans or restricts supplies from entering Gaza on the grounds they are "dual-use", or could be repurposed for military as well as humanitarian purposes. The diplomats said Israel has so far made no concessions on dual-use items, which include metal poles for tents to house the largely displaced population.

An official at COGAT, the Israeli government agency that coordinates civilian policy in Gaza, said that 45% of all trucks that have entered Gaza since the October ceasefire were commercial vehicles transporting food and other everyday goods.

The official said humanitarian trucks were prioritised, and that commercial shipments supplemented the aid effort. If additional humanitarian trucks were available, they would be allowed to enter Gaza, the official said.

The COGAT official acknowledged that Israel continues to restrict dual-use items, but said alternatives are being sourced, such as tent poles made of wood.

Beyond humanitarian aid, the eight diplomats said, CMCC personnel had drafted a number of "white papers" on Gaza on a range of topics including on reconstruction and governance but that it was unclear if they would be implemented.

It is unlikely that countries would formally leave the CMCC, in part out of fear of drawing Trump's ire but also out of a desire to be able to ramp up their involvement in the centre if it gains relevance, the diplomats said.

There is also a concern that quitting the CMCC could give Israel greater influence over policies for post-war Gaza, they said. There are no Palestinians at the CMCC, and a European presence could help put more emphasis on Palestinian interests.

Trump's 20-point peace plan provides no timeline or mechanism for implementation, and since the ceasefire started in October more than 460 Palestinians and three Israeli soldiers have been killed in fighting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:51:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FCUBDDODZRJUXFSBJIS6RSTFTM.jpg?auth=fde7630740976155c9aad8f823c2e6b5609c5a6d7e6d306c362b3b1a8e43021f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Treasury Secretary Bessent brushes off 'hysteria' over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-treasury-secretary-bessent-brushes-off-hysteria-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence on Tuesday that the United States and European countries would find a solution over the U.S. administration's aim to take over Greenland, brushing off "hysteria" about a possible trade war.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced tariffs on Saturday on imports from European allies that oppose the United States taking over Greenland, an autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark.

European countries say new tariffs would violate a trade deal reached with Trump last year, and EU leaders are set to discuss possible retaliation at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday. One option is a package of tariffs on 93 billion euros ($108 billion) of U.S. imports that could automatically kick in on February 6 after a six-month suspension.

Bessent said the issue had only recently emerged and a solution would be found that ensures national security for the United States and Europe.

"It's been 48 hours. As I said, sit back, relax," Bessent told reporters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland. "I am confident that the leaders will not escalate and that this will work out in a manner that ends up in a very good place for all."

Asked about the prospect of a prolonged trade war between the United States and Europe, Bessent replied: "Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case?... Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath."

Trump has repeatedly insisted he will settle for nothing less than ownership of Greenland. Leaders of both Denmark and Greenland have said the island is not for sale and does not want to be part of the United States.

Bessent dismissed the possibility the EU would for the first time tap its Anti-Coercion Instrument, a powerful trade measure which could limit U.S. access to public tenders, investments or banking activity, or restrict trade in services.

"Well, having worked with the Europeans, my guess is their next move will be to form a working group, the dreaded 'European working group'," Bessent said in an interview with CNBC. "We've seen a lot of working groups."

In his earlier briefing, Bessent also dismissed market speculation that European governments might sell U.S. Treasury bonds they own as reserves, making it more expensive for the U.S. government to finance itself.

"(U.S. government debt) is the most liquid market, it is the basis for all financial transactions and I am sure that the European governments will continue holding it," Bessent said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 12:51:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNKO5ICTVJMW3HXR7JG5XWGN7Y.jpg?auth=19f223b1216ef74aff5258d15e39ecf056354145fb924e19e8950b5e01fcda08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Far East buried in snow, transport disrupted in China and Japan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/russias-far-east-buried-snow-transport-disrupted-china-japan-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Russia's Far East was buried under metres of snow by its heaviest snowfall in 60 years on Tuesday as a winter blast swept across Asia, dusting Shanghai white and grounding flights in Japan's northwest .

The cold snap disrupted transport across the region, closing roads in China, stranding air travellers in Japan and leaving parts of Russia’s Far East paralysed.

Scientists said the weather was related to waves of cool air coming in from the Arctic, which was simultaneously affecting Eastern Russia and Asia, and a second, affecting Eastern Europe.

"You've got these two simultaneous bursts of cool air coming down from the Arctic due to a waviness in the jet stream," said climate scientist Theodore Keeping, referring to air currents in the upper atmosphere which define weather patterns.

"The Arctic polar vortex, which is this massive cold air which circulates the Arctic is relatively weak right now, and what that means it drives the jet stream less intensely, and that leads to waves of cool air coming down from the Arctic," said Keeping, an extreme weather researcher for World Weather Attribution at London's Imperial College Centre for Environmental Policy.

In Russia’s Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula , vast snowdrifts several metres high blocked building entrances and buried cars, after more than 2 metres (6.5 feet) of snow fell in some areas in the first half of January, following 3.7 metres in December, according to weather monitoring stations.

Some vehicles were almost completely submerged, four-wheel drives struggling for traction or immobilised entirely, as residents dug narrow paths through the snow to reach apartment entrances. In the port city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, locals were filmed walking atop snowbanks beside traffic lights, with some jumping from the drifts for fun.

"It's like a sand dune," resident and blogger Polina Tuichieva said of the mammoth snow in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, 6,800 km (4,200 miles) east of Moscow.

The same system swept south into China, where a wave of low temperatures brought rare snowfall to the financial hub of Shanghai as authorities warned the frigid weather could last for at least three days. The east coast city last experienced heavy snowfall in January 2018.

"It was the first time I have seen such heavy snowfall in Shanghai," 23-year-old student Li Meng said.

The wintry scenes marked a sharp reversal from just a week earlier, when Shanghai basked in unusually high temperatures of 20 degrees Celsius (68 degrees Fahrenheit), prompting some osmanthus trees to bloom, local media reported.

"The weather seems rather strange this year," 30-year-old Shanghai resident Yu Xin said. "Last week, it was still over 20 degrees Celsius, but this week it dropped below zero and started snowing. In general, the temperature fluctuations have been quite significant, so some people might feel a bit uncomfortable."

Chinese state media said sharp temperature drops also hit provinces south of the Yangtze and Huai rivers, including Jiangxi and Guizhou. In Guizhou, temperatures are expected to fall by 10 to 14 degrees Celsius, Zhejiang News reported.

As icy conditions spread, authorities shut sections of major roads across 12 provinces — including Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Heilongjiang — due to snowfall and icy roads, state broadcaster CCTV said.

In Japan, strong winds and heavy snowfall disrupted travel along its northwestern coast, grounding dozens of flights and hitting popular ski regions at the height of winter.

The Japan Meteorological Agency warned that heavy snow would hit northern and western regions between January 21 and 25, urging people to avoid non-essential travel.

ANA Holdings (9202.T) , opens new tab cancelled 56 flights affecting around 3,900 passengers, while Japan Airlines scrapped 37 flights affecting 2,213 travellers.

The cloudbursts inundated streets, submerged vehicles and disrupted daily life in multiple governorates (provinces) of the North African country, with emergency services struggling to respond to the scale of the flooding.

Civil protection teams said several areas were cut off by rising waters, particularly in low-lying neighbourhoods.

Schools were closed in the capital Tunis and in the towns of Nabeul, Sousse and Beja, and court sessions were suspended and public and private transport crippled in some districts.

Videos shared on social media showed fast-moving floods sweeping debris through residential streets, with seawater inundating neighbourhoods in the coastal town of Menzel Temime.

Meteorological officials said the rainfall levels in some regions were the heaviest recorded since 1950.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:51:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F5VKCUW4IVMNLGJE6FTBEIG2RU.jpg?auth=e44aa8b87a6335bb3d80a6812ea4091bdf02479574c747a04fa9f2ef79e56587&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lawmakers quit Dutch far right leader Wilders' faction in threat to leadership</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/lawmakers-quit-dutch-far-right-leader-wilders-faction-threat-leadership-anp-says-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:52:22 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Macron tells Davos of a 'shift towards a world without rules'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-tells-davos-shift-towards-world-without-rules-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:52:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Saudi state TV says King Salman chairs cabinet days after leaving hospital</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-state-tv-says-king-salman-chairs-cabinet-days-after-leaving-hospital-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:05 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Togo expels ex-Burkina Faso leader after coup plot claim, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/togo-expels-ex-burkina-faso-leader-after-coup-plot-claim-sources-say-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Myanmar junta 'can't last forever': military in 'worse position now' than ever before</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/myanmar-junta-can-t-last-forever-military-in-worse-position-now-than-ever-before</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/22cf963e-f605-11f0-b304-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260111-130847-131606-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen takes the stand in high-stakes appeals trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-far-right-leader-marine-le-pen-takes-the-stand-in-high-stakes-appeals-trial</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e9c55160-f601-11f0-8312-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-133541-133736-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump publishes Macron's message, threatens French wine tariffs</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-publishes-macron-message-threatens-french-wine-tariffs</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0d065f3a-f601-11f0-b1b0-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-133150-133349-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump’s first year back in office: Mass layoffs, deportations and global moves</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-s-first-year-back-in-office-mass-layoffs-deportations-and-global-moves</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 13:53:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7cd26fd0-f600-11f0-979e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-130140-130412-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland crisis shows time for flattering Trump is over, former NATO boss Rasmussen says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/greenland-crisis-shows-time-flattering-trump-is-over-former-nato-boss-rasmussen-2026-01-20/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The time for flattering Donald Trump is over and Europe should hit back hard economically if the U.S. imposes tariffs on NATO allies that sent troops to Greenland , ex-NATO boss and former Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Tuesday.

Rasmussen said Trump's insistence that Greenland - a semi-autonomous Danish territory - should become part of the United States represented the biggest challenge to NATO since its establishment in 1949.

"It's really the future of NATO that is at stake," said Rasmussen, who offers a unique perspective on the crisis as a former leader of both Denmark - from 2001 to 2009 - and NATO, where he served as secretary general from 2009 to 2014.

"The time for flattering is over. It doesn't work. The fact is Trump only respects force and strength. And unity. That's exactly what Europe should demonstrate right now," he told Reuters from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Rasmussen said he was not criticising leaders such as current NATO boss Mark Rutte, who has lavished praise on Trump. But he said it was time for a new approach from Europe.

He said the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument - the so-called "bazooka" that confers broad powers to retaliate against economic pressure - should be on the table after Trump threatened tariffs on eight European nations until the U.S. is allowed to buy Greenland.

Trump says U.S. ownership of Greenland is vital for national security .

He told Norway's prime minister on Sunday, in an exchange of text messages , he had "done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States".

Rasmussen proposed a three-point plan to defuse the crisis. It includes an update of a 1951 agreement between the United States and Denmark that allows U.S. forces and military bases on Greenland to include a strengthened NATO presence there.

It also includes an investment pact to help U.S. and European firms extract minerals in Greenland and "a stabilisation and resilience compact" to prevent Chinese and Russian investments in critical sectors there, he said.

Rasmussen said he had not presented the plan to Danish or other government officials but would discuss it with delegates in Davos.

"I hope that an infusion of something concrete could bring this whole discussion into a more constructive phase," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:32:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L2QKUTAUFZJYZNTX4R6E4X6VVQ.jpg?auth=51be4347a993c7ec60376486b118952fcec2482dbad925dba39bc1fe9caac489&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supreme Court weighs Trump's firing of the Fed's Lisa Cook by social media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/supreme-court-weighs-trumps-firing-feds-lisa-cook-by-social-media-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - In the battle over President Donald Trump 's effort to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook that is set to go before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday, the justices may focus on the president's use of social media to carry out this unprecedented action.

The justices are due to hear arguments over Trump's request to lift a lower court judge's decision barring ​him from firing Cook while her legal challenge to the removal continues. The justices in October agreed to hear the dispute, a decision , opens new tab that left Cook in her role for the time being.

Trump's prolific use ‌of social media is well-established. The Republican president long has used social media not only to voice opinions but also to announce major decisions and official government policies.

Here too, just after 8 p.m. last August 25, Trump posted to his Truth Social account a letter addressed to Cook informing her that "you are hereby removed" from the role of Fed governor. No president since the central bank's founding in 1913 has ousted a Fed governor.

That action, Cook and her lawyers argue, violated her rights under the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, which provides that no person may be "deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law."

The case, which could imperil the independence of the world's most important central bank, prominently tests whether Trump had adequate "cause" under federal law to remove Cook. But it also is a ‌fight over whether the way Trump sought to oust Cook was fair. Lower courts agreed with Cook that Trump's action likely was not.

The president has based his bid to ​fire Cook on allegations by Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee, that she committed mortgage fraud. Cook, who was appointed in 2022 by Democratic former President Joe Biden as the first Black woman to serve in the post, has denied the allegations.

Cook's lawyers contend that the allegations are a pretext to fire her based on her monetary policy stance. Trump has repeatedly demanded lower interest rates, also frequently lashing out at Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not doing so more quickly.

The Trump administration ‍this month opened a criminal investigation into Powell over remarks he made to Congress last year about a Fed building project, a move the central bank chair similarly called a pretext aimed at gaining more influence over interest rates.

In creating the Fed, Congress passed a law called the Federal Reserve Act that included provisions to shield the central bank from political interference, setting out that governors could be removed by a president only "for cause" - though the law does not define the term or establish procedures for removal.

Cook's case raises thorny questions concerning the scope of presidential power, the ⁠validity of Trump's decisions that impact the central bank, and the authority of the judiciary to second-guess the president.

But the case also offers the court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority and has backed Trump in numerous decisions since he returned to ‍the presidency last year, a way of deciding the case on procedural grounds that could leave some of those contentious, substantive questions to another day.

Cook's lawyers have said that Trump's letter on social media purporting to fire her without either notice in advance or an ‌opportunity to respond ‌to the allegations did not satisfy the constitutional requirements of due process.

"One way for the court to side with Cook would be to say that the process she received - generally characterized in such cases as notice and an opportunity to be heard - was insufficient," said Jane Manners, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York who has studied the history of laws governing officer removal.

Although it is not entirely clear what kind of hearing would be required, Manners said legal precedents in this area show that removals need to follow a "judicial-type hearing involving the presentation of evidence and testimony, including from the officeholder."

Trump's Justice Department urged the Supreme Court to reject Cook's argument, contending that a government officer's position is not a form of property protected ⁠by the Constitution's due process provision.

"Officers exercise significant government power, ⁠and no individual has a property right to such ​power," the administration said in its written filing.

Even if the due process provision does protect someone in Cook's position, the administration said Trump gave her the required notice when on August 20 he referenced on social media Pulte's referral of the mortgage allegations to the Justice Department for criminal investigation, writing, "Cook must resign, now!!!"

Trump also gave her an opportunity to respond given that he did not post his letter firing her until five days later, the administration added.

"Cook had an opportunity to explain why no misconduct occurred, and she spurned it," the filing ‍stated.

Cook sued Trump in August after the president announced he would remove her.

U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb in September temporarily blocked Trump from carrying out his directive, ruling that he likely violated Cook's due process rights and that the mortgage allegations likely were not a legally sufficient cause to remove her under the Federal Reserve Act as they relate to conduct that occurred before she was confirmed to the post by the Senate.

The Washington-based judge called it "doubtful that Cook should have been required to piece together the evidentiary basis for a 'for cause' removal from a scattered assortment of social media ​posts and news articles."

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused Trump's bid to put Cobb's order on hold, prompting ‍the administration to seek the Supreme Court's intervention.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:33:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CHCF2OEAL5OTHKNAHBXKWATQFQ.jpg?auth=758c4cb558a63307c437636db9150be3cb3093ec46ab755f2867731757e261e5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE becomes early supporter of Trump’s ‘Board of Peace’ with formal acceptance</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-becomes-early-supporter-trumps-board-peace-with-formal-acceptance-2026-01-20/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) accepted an invitation to join U.S. President Donald Trump's newly proposed “Board of Peace,” the UAE foreign ministry said on Tuesday, placing Abu Dhabi among the first governments to publicly endorse the initiative.

The ministry said the UAE stood ready to “contribute actively to the mission of the Board of Peace, supporting greater cooperation, stability, and prosperity for all,” marking Abu Dhabi's formal alignment with Washington’s new conflict‑resolution effort.

Abu Dhabi's acceptance comes as governments worldwide react cautiously to Trump’s plan, which aims to begin with the Gaza conflict before widening to tackle other conflicts, according to a copy of the letter and draft charter seen by Reuters.

Some leaders offered ambiguous responses. Italy’s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said her country was “ready to do our part,” while Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney said Ottawa had agreed “in principle” pending further details.

The inclusion of a 'charter' in the invitation letter triggered concerns among some European governments that it could undermine the work of the United Nations, which Trump has accused of not supporting his efforts to end conflicts around the world.

The board would be chaired for life by Trump. Member states would be limited to three-year terms unless they pay $1 billion each to fund the board's activities and earn permanent membership, the letter states.

"This simply offers permanent membership to partner countries who demonstrate deep commitment to peace, security, and prosperity," the White House said in a post on X.

Hungary has also issued an unequivocal acceptance, while most governments have refrained from public comment, voicing concerns privately about the plan’s implications for the U.N.’s authority.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:34:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FESITBFK6NKS7COIIJJRREJRDU.jpg?auth=58c129a3ee3d321a351bd0013d08dfd1414d7c4a8716add7a91f58bee46c55a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's China embassy gamble shows changing calculations in divided West</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-china-embassy-gamble-shows-changing-calculations-divided-west-2026-01-20/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - By approving China's plans for a mega-embassy in London , British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has gambled on winning closer trade ties and investment from China at the risk ​of angering politicians in Britain and the United States.

Beijing's desire to build China's biggest embassy in Europe in the heart of historic London had become a flashpoint in relations, testing ‌Britain's ability to navigate the security risks and trade potential of a relationship with China.

The government ignored warnings from British and U.S. politicians, local residents and British-based Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners who said the new building could be used as a base for espionage and to intimidate Chinese dissidents.

Since taking office in 2024, Starmer has made reviving Britain's economy his priority and wants closer relations with China to boost foreign investment and deliver on an election pledge to improve living standards.

Some U.S. politicians objected to the new embassy location, near sensitive underground communication cables, questioning whether there would be security implications for one of Washington's partners in the Five ‌Eyes alliance with Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

"This will be seen for what it is, which is a base for hostile activity inside the United ​Kingdom," Tom Tugendhat, security minister in Britain's last Conservative government, told Reuters. "This is, I am afraid, further indication that this British government has no idea of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) it is dealing with."

China has 146 registered diplomats in Britain, second to the United States, British government records show.

Opponents of China's plans to build a much bigger embassy say it will mean more ‍diplomatic staff and therefore more spies, with the new site serving as a symbol of China's power and as a warning.

Local residents said they would seek a legal challenge, saying Tuesday's decision would be unlawful if British officials privately gave China assurances the project would be approved before the planning process had been completed.

Six current and former British officials told Reuters most of the espionage fears were exaggerated or could be managed. They said the consolidation of ⁠China's existing diplomatic premises, spread across London, could make it easier to track suspected spies.

Two of the former officials said security services could typically look for the unexpected loss of signals within the ‍cables to see whether they were being tapped, other cables could be re-rerouted and sensitive information encrypted.

They said much of Beijing's spying activity was conducted from China, such as cyberattacks, and many of its spies work in business, ‌think tanks or ‌academia rather than at the embassy, where officials are easier to track.

China's embassy in London has accused British officials of exaggerating fears about Chinese spies and cyberattacks.

The embassy decision shows the trade-offs Britain faces navigating relations with China, a powerful adversary but possible source of economic help at a time when the U.S. - Britain's biggest single trading partner - has threatened to impose new tariffs as it tries to acquire Greenland.

Starmer is expected to travel to China this month, alongside a business delegation, after Beijing made clear the trip was conditional on approval for the new embassy, British and ⁠Chinese officials said.

Approval of the new embassy could ⁠leave Starmer vulnerable to criticism in Britain and ​alienate London's most powerful ally when opinion polls suggest he is Britain's least popular prime minister.

In a parliamentary debate last week, 30 members of the chamber spoke out against the embassy expansion plans. None spoke in favour.

Julian Lewis, a former chair of parliament's intelligence committee, said that in almost three decades in parliament he had never seen such an occasion "where every question asked on both sides of the House was deeply hostile".

Mike Johnson, Speaker ‍of the U.S. House of Representatives, is among U.S. politicians who have raised concerns about the embassy expansion.

Nicholas Eftimiades, a former U.S. intelligence officer and specialist on Chinese intelligence, said British security services might be underestimating the risks.

"The U.S. has intelligence capabilities several orders of magnitude larger than the UK and yet is unable to effectively counter China's intelligence collection," he said.

Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigners who fled the former British colony are among vocal opponents of expanding the embassy.

Chloe ​Cheung, who received a special British visa to move from Hong Kong and has a bounty on her head from ‍China on charges of incitement to secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces that she denies, said she felt betrayed.

She said the new embassy with its Regency-style columned facade and huge flags would look like a little Chinese "castle" and send the message ​that "the Chinese government is very powerful", intimidating Chinese dissidents.

"I thought the UK would be a safe haven," she said.

The red caps resemble the "Make America Great Again" caps of Trump's supporters but feature slogans like "Make America Go Away" and "Already Great".

Store co-owner Michael said the caps had languished unsold for months before swiftly gaining popularity. "We only made one hundred to begin with," said Michael, who declined to give his surname. "When it went viral it was very, very popular."

Principal owner Jesper Rabe Tonnesen devised one of the caps' slogans, "Nu det NUUK" - a Danish pun that sounds like "Nu det nok," meaning "Now is enough," but substitutes the "nok" with "Nuuk," the capital of Greenland.

"I thought, 'How can you communicate in an easy way while putting your foot down?'," Tonnesen told Reuters, adding that he had distributed 300 caps by cargo bike at a protest held in Copenhagen on Saturday.

Tens of thousands of people rallied in Copenhagen and Nuuk at the weekend chanting "Greenland is not for sale" and marching to U.S. diplomatic posts, many of them wearing the protest caps.

Trump says Greenland is vital to U.S. security because of its strategic location and mineral deposits, and he has not ruled out using force to take control of the island. His threats have triggered a diplomatic crisis between the NATO allies.

"People have an urge to get out there with a message. We've just had enough and we're fed up, sad and tired," Tonnesen said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 14:35:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ENYOGUYAQJK45LUTPW535PHLIQ.jpg?auth=fbd863de9fa374e6bb5da3924b24217c14c4381064605e6639b757459f683cc6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine to share wartime combat data with allies to help train AI</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-share-wartime-combat-data-with-allies-help-train-ai-2026-01-20/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Ukraine will establish a system allowing its allies to train their artificial intelligence models on Kyiv's valuable combat data collected throughout the nearly four-year war with Russia, newly appointed Defence Minister Mykhailo Fedorov has said.

Fedorov - a former digitalisation minister who last week took up the post to drive reforms across Ukraine's vast defence ministry and armed forces - has described Kyiv's wartime data trove as one of its "cards" in negotiations with other nations.

Since Russia's invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has gathered extensive battlefield information, including systematically logged combat statistics and millions of hours of drone footage captured from above.

Such data is important for training AI models, which require large volumes of real-world information to identify patterns and predict how people or objects might act in various situations.

"Today, frontline data has extraordinary value," Fedorov told reporters in comments cleared for release on Tuesday, adding that there was demand for this data from allies. "We will build a system on which they can train their software products using our data."

Fedorov has previously said Ukraine was using AI technology from U.S. data analytics firm Palantir for both military and civilian applications.

Outlining his plans for the wartime defence ministry after his appointment, he said he wanted to "more actively" integrate allies into projects.

He said his team was receiving advice from the Center for Strategic and International Studies and RAND in the U.S., as well as Britain's Royal United Services Institute.

Fedorov also said Ukraine would test its homegrown replacement for China's DJI Mavic drone this month, which is widely used for aerial reconnaissance on the front lines by both sides. He did not disclose the manufacturer.

Ukraine has previously raised concerns about reliance on Beijing for drones and components, given China's deepening diplomatic ties with Russia.

"We will have our own Mavic analogue: the same camera, but with a longer flight range," Fedorov said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:32:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JS2HTGYCR5L33JOT6QF36LQCKE.jpg?auth=4895884458f75e5b711dbec60a76231180a2163944864053d6459368813ab62c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Supreme Court does not issue ruling on Trump's tariffs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-supreme-court-does-not-issue-ruling-trumps-tariffs-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court issued three decisions on Tuesday but did not decide the closely watched dispute over the legality of President Donald Trump 's global tariffs.

Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Reuters external processing centres, such as Italy’s plan to detain migrants in Albania , were "no magic solution" as they posed significant legal challenges and could strain relationships with third countries.

Meanwhile, Spain's strategy of working with transit nations before arrivals occur was proving effective, he said.

In contrast to many EU states tightening their immigration policies amid the rise of the far right, Spain's leftist government has been an outlier by treating migration as an economic asset, promoting legal immigration pathways , while simultaneously reducing irregular migration.

Irregular arrivals to Spain fell 42% last year - to around 36,000 compared to Italy’s little-changed 66,000.

"I believe that our figures and migration policy overall doubtlessly ... greatly strengthen Spain's role in defining migratory policy within the European Union," Grande-Marlaska said.

Denmark said last month that a majority of EU countries supported the processing of asylum requests "in safe third countries" to deter arrivals. The European Parliament is expected to restrict migration rules this year.

To bolster its strategy, Spain has increased its presence in West African nations Mauritania, Senegal and the Gambia— deploying nearly 100 police officers and various surveillance assets.

Rights groups, however, have said Spain's and the EU's support to West African countries to prevent migrants from boarding precarious boats to Spain's Canary Islands has led to abuses, notably in Mauritania where Spanish police were allegedly present during abusive detention of migrants, according to Human Rights Watch.

Grande-Marlaska said Spain had "not seen any illegal action or action against refugees' fundamental rights" and said Spain was working on beefing up its teams in Mauritania and Senegal and delivering more drones and vehicles to local forces.

Migrant arrivals to the Canaries fell 62% last year from record-breaking 2024 levels, Spanish data shows.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRM4P4J5ZFMRLDXYNWUVA6L34M.jpg?auth=925c134ab7b9adc9f19787f14abb8fdb0d1d2d83bccc45618f86195bca6a3765&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Norway won't take part in Trump's "Board of Peace", deputy foreign minister tells Aftenposten</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/norway-wont-take-part-trumps-board-peace-deputy-foreign-minister-tells-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China says it drove away Philippine aircraft over disputed shoal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-drove-away-philippine-aircraft-over-disputed-shoal-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:13 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Syrian government forces advance in northeast as Kurds vow to resist</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260120-syrian-government-forces-advance-in-northeast-as-kurds-vow-to-resist</link><description>Syrian government troops thrust deeper into areas held by Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria on Tuesday, Syrian military sources said, pressing rapid gains against Kurdish fighters who vowed to defend their remaining enclaves.

Government forces have this week taken swathes of northern and eastern Syria long held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), once the main US ally in Syria, advancing President Ahmed al-Sharaa 's effort to bring all the country under centralised authority.

The swift reversal for the SDF along one of Syria's main faultlines marks the biggest shift in territorial control in Syria since Islamist fighters led by Sharaa toppled President Bashar al-Assad in 2024.

Amid reported clashes, three Syrian sources said the US-led coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group was negotiating for the government to take over an SDF-guarded camp housing thousands of civilians linked to the jihadist group near the town of al-Hol, close to the Iraqi border. The Syrian military said it was advancing on al-Hol.

The US military's Central Command did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

One of the sources, a Syrian official, said talks were focused on a smooth transition to avoid any security risks or detainees fleeing.

The SDF had established control of a quarter or more of Syria during the 2011-2024 civil war , while fighting with the support of US troops against Islamic State.

The Syrian military sources said government troops had advanced on Tuesday in eastern areas of Hasakah province - where al-Hol is located - and south of the town of Kobani, also known as Ain al-Arab, which lies on the border with Turkey .

A spokesperson for the Syrian Kurdish YPG, the dominant component of the SDF, said "enemy forces were trying to advance" near al-Hol camp but Kurdish forces were maintaining a defensive line in the area. The spokesperson did not respond to a question about the advances reported near Kobani.

The SDF said it had inflicted heavy losses on government forces trying to advance on the village of Tel Baroud in Hasakah. Neither side announced overall casualty figures.

Earlier on Tuesday, the SDF reported four attacks at dawn by " Damascus factions" in areas near Kobani, saying the attacks had been repelled. "Our forces ... confirm their complete readiness to confront any aggression," the SDF said in a statement.

Tensions between the SDF and Damascus spilled into open conflict this month, including in Aleppo , after months of deadlock over the fate of the SDF's fighters and territory, with the Kurdish force resisting government demands that it fully dissolve into the defence ministry.

After days of fighting, the SDF said on Sunday it would withdraw its forces from the Arab-majority provinces of Raqqa and Deir al-Zor. On Monday, government forces pushed into the SDF-controlled Hasakah province, saying they had seized control of one of several jails holding Islamic State prisoners.

Reports indicated that SDF commander Mazloum Abdi and Sharaa held a rocky meeting on Monday, after Abdi's signature appeared on a 14-point agreement with the government.

YPG spokesperson Farhad Shami said claims of an agreement being reached were "lies".

"I believe that when Mazloum Abdi went to Damascus, he knew that this government would try again to force our people to surrender," Shami said in an interview with Kurdish broadcaster Rudaw on Monday evening.

"We have decided that we will defend ourselves even if we are alone," he said.

The United States, which has since established close ties with Sharaa under President Donald Trump , has been closely involved in mediation between the sides.

The government and the SDF have traded blame over the escape of IS group prisoners from a prison in the town of Shaddadi on Monday, with each accusing the other of releasing them.

The Syrian Interior Ministry said on Tuesday that about 120 IS group detainees escaped, 81 of whom had been recaptured. The Syrian government has said that it is now in control of the prison in Shaddadi.

The SDF has previously said it was guarding some 10,000 IS group fighters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/27be6718-f611-11f0-a781-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020518687801.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Greenland tipped the balance': Macron and Trump's shifting relationship</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/greenland-tipped-the-balance-macron-and-trump-s-shifting-relationship</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ee939a62-f610-11f0-ac0e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-152347-153126-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French opposition parties expected to file votes of no-confidence</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/french-opposition-parties-expected-to-file-votes-of-no-confidence</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 15:34:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a6b167c0-f60f-11f0-9ec0-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-153214-153553-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM forces part of budget bill through lower house without vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-pm-forces-part-budget-bill-through-lower-house-without-vote-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:38:17 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Turkey probing flag burning at protests along Syrian border</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/turkey-probing-flag-burning-protests-along-syrian-border-2026-01-20/</link><description>NUSAYBIN, Turkey, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Turkey said on Tuesday it was investigating the burning of its flag during protests along its border with Syria by pro-Kurdish groups, coinciding with clashes there between the Damascus government army and Kurdish-led forces.

Syrian government forces pushed deeper into northeast Syria's Kurdish-held areas on Tuesday after taking swathes of territory long held by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) this week, advancing President Ahmed al-Sharaa's effort to bring all the entire country back under centralised authority.

Ankara, the main foreign supporter of Sharaa's government, deems the SDF a terrorist organisation linked with outlawed Kurdish PKK militants in Turkey, and has repeatedly said the SDF must integrate into Syria's state apparatus under a 2025 accord.

Turkish authorities have been engaged in a peace process with the PKK for months under which it says the group - and its extensions - must lay down weapons and disband to end a four-decade PKK insurgency in Turkey.

Footage from the protests showed participants, whom Ankara said supported Kurdish militants, trying to climb fenced walls along the Turkish-Syrian border in the Nusaybin-Qamishli region, while some burned or tore down Turkish flags in the area and chanted slogans.

Police used water cannon and pepper spray in attempts to disperse the crowds, amid scuffles with some protesters.

Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said on X that prosecutors had launched inquiries into the events, while the defence ministry said investigations were underway against PKK supporters trying to cross the border illegally at Nusaybin.

"With this attack in question, it is evident that dark forces aiming to sabotage the goal of a terror-free Turkey have once again come into play. These attempts will neither weaken the determination of our state nor harm the unity and solidarity of our nation," Burhanettin Duran, the Turkish presidency's communications director, said on X.

Omer Celik, spokesman for President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, vowed the "clearest and strongest response".

Turkey has since 2016 repeatedly sent forces into northern Syria to curb the gains of the SDF - which during Syria's 2011–24 civil war took control of more than a quarter of the country while fighting Islamic State with strong U.S. backing.

The SDF has said the peace process between the Turkish state and PKK does not apply to it.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:38:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YKFIXWEQ6FMYRGZM4GEPARZXJ4.jpg?auth=fb1b7535e63559750f6863619795d0b4daecd02062c6820e011835d5e838c49c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian defence ministry announces four-day ceasefire after new accord with Kurdish force</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-defence-ministry-announces-four-day-ceasefire-after-new-accord-with-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:39:00 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Italian ski resort Courmayeur bans indoor sparklers after deadly Swiss fire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italian-ski-resort-courmayeur-bans-indoor-sparklers-after-deadly-swiss-fire-2026-01-20/</link><description>MILAN, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Courmayeur, an exclusive Italian ski resort at the foot of Mont Blanc, has banned the use of sparklers and other naked flame items in closed spaces following the deadly blaze in a bar in Switzerland's Crans-Montana.

The Crans-Montana fire on New Year's Eve killed 40 people, most of them teenagers, including six Italians, and injured 116. Authorities believe it was caused by "fountain candle" sparklers carried too close to the ceiling.

Courmayeur's town hall said in a statement on Tuesday that the ban would apply to "open flames and pyrotechnic items in all enclosed spaces, in particular in public venues".

Italian local authorities have intensified inspections of nightclubs and other public venues since the Crans-Montana catastrophe, checking capacity limits, emergency exits and fire safety measures.

Several clubs and discotheques have been closed in Rome this month following safety inspections, including Piper, one of the capital's most popular and historic venues which rose to fame during the 1960s.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said her government is considering introducing a nationwide ban on the use of sparklers indoors. Several Swiss cantons have banned the sparklers since the Crans-Montana disaster.

Courmayeur Mayor Roberto Rota said the resort's ban was "necessary and urgent" due to the widespread use of open flames in public venues during celebrations.

Francesco Lenzi, a 20-year-old ski enthusiast from Milan, said more cities should follow Courmayeur's example.

"I have often witnessed the use of flaming objects in bars and discos in Courmayeur and elsewhere," he told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:39:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CLENXBE3OBJGDKWEZC5A4WBF5M.jpg?auth=8a83f56334dd0d64815236dfafa9b8f28221ce394f8866960b5540b10af90e44&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Peru's president embroiled in scandal over failure to disclose meetings with Chinese businessman</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/perus-president-embroiled-scandal-over-failure-disclose-meetings-with-chinese-2026-01-20/</link><description>LIMA, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Peruvian President Jose Jeri is facing a preliminary investigation by the country's prosecutor as Congress looks to begin impeachment proceedings, after his recent meetings with a Chinese businessman outside of his official agenda erupted into a fresh political scandal.

Jeri, who assumed power in October after the expulsion of former President Dina Boluarte, said on Monday night he would make himself available to the prosecutor's office and the congressional oversight committee to "provide statements and clarifications" on the matter, according to the president's press office.

Jeri's meetings with businessman Zhihua Yang, who owns commercial stores and a concession for an energy project, and his failure to publicly disclose them as part of his agenda, prompted criticism over a lack of transparency and potential corruption. In Peru, the president's meetings are traditionally included in the official agenda.

Jeri met with Zhihua Yang on December 26 and January 6, according to local media.

Opposition lawmakers have said they will present a motion to impeach or censure Jeri, 39, whose popularity remains high despite dipping to 44% in January, according to the local polling firm CPI.

Jeri issued a public apology for the initial meeting, a dinner at a Chinese restaurant in Lima, via a recorded message on Sunday. He said he went to coordinate the celebration of another anniversary of Peruvian-Chinese friendship and denied having received an "irregular request" to meet.

"I admit my mistake," he said. "And I publicly apologize for entering the meeting with the businessman the way I did, hidden, and for that, giving rise to suspicions and doubts about my behavior," Jeri said.

Hours after Jeri's apology, a second meeting with Zhihua Yang, whose business has been suspended by Lima's authorities for selling unauthorized products, was made public.

An attorney representing Zhihua Yang told radio station RPP on Monday night that the encounters were a "friendly meeting in which President Jeri broke some protocols."

Although a censure of Jeri requires fewer votes than impeachment (87 out of 130), his removal is unlikely, political experts have said. Two-thirds of Peru's lawmakers are seeking reelection and will likely opt for stability before the April general elections, analysts said.

Peru has been reeling from an ongoing political crisis, with a revolving door of seven presidents since 2018 due to resignations or dismissals.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZKFKQZ66DVKYJEYT7JT34R35RE.jpg?auth=67df6820c9a04d87cb3bf7371068367a57ae371657ef1be2324d8a7c73a0f9b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney tells Davos Canada 'strongly opposes' tariffs over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/carney-tells-davos-canada-strongly-opposes-tariffs-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:06 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Peru's president embroiled in scandal over failure to disclose meetings with Chinese businessman</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/perus-president-embroiled-scandal-over-failure-disclose-meetings-with-chinese-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:14 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Carney tells Davos Canada 'strongly opposes' tariffs over Greenland</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/carney-tells-davos-canada-strongly-opposes-tariffs-over-greenland-2026-01-20/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:18 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu forces 2026 budget through parliament without a vote</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260120-french-pm-lecornu-forces-2026-budget-through-parliament-without-a-vote</link><description>France 's Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu made use of a special constitutional power on Tuesday to force part of his 2026 budget ​bill through the deeply divided lower house of parliament ‍without a vote.

Lecornu invoked Article 49.3 of the Constitution on the income side of the ​legislation to get it through the lower house, where it had ​become deadlocked after three months of discussions.

In response, opposition parties the hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) and far-right National Rally (RN) were expected to file no-confidence motions against the government.

Lecornu and his government, however, appear to have won enough political backing, notably from the Socialists, to survive the no-confidence votes, which are likely to take ‍place on Friday.

The legislation is due to head to the Senate next before returning to the ​lower house. Lecornu will also need to force the spending side of the budget bill through the lower house before a final push ‌on the overall package.

Lecornu's minority government expects the budget to be definitively passed in the first half of ‍February, one official has said. He had previously promised to abstain from forcing the budget bill through parliament without a vote but was forced to do so after failing to win over enough lawmakers to pass the legislation with a vote, despite offering a series of concessions.

Lecornu's move nevertheless brings France closer to ‍a conclusion to getting a 2026 budget through parliament that keeps the fiscal deficit ‌to a maximum ​of 5% of its projected economic output for the year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 16:41:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/07d05bae-f61c-11f0-9f32-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T160933Z-924940248-RC245JA1ZX0W-RTRMADP-3-FRANCE-POLITICS-BUDGET.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crypto investments and conflicts of interest: Trump's very profitable year in office</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260120-crypto-investments-and-conflicts-of-interest-trump-s-very-profitable-year-in-office</link><description>In his second inaugural address , US President Donald Trump promised a “golden age of America” was about to begin.

One year later, many Americans still find themselves in the grip of price hikes , but Trump’s personal fortune has flourished, according to estimates from US media and monitors.

The US president has increased his wealth by $3 billion in the past 12 months – up to a total of $7.3 billion, according to Forbes. The New Yorker meanwhile estimates his fortune shot up $3.4 billion in the first six months of his second term alone, largely from “pocketing off the presidency”.

Almost $2 billion-worth of cash and gifts have boosted the Trump family fortune according to the Trump's Take tracker , run by the Center for American Progress (CAP) policy institute.

No one knows exactly how much Donald Trump is worth. Since he first took office in 2017, he has refused to comply with the decades-old tradition of US presidents releasing their tax returns. He has also been accused by a US court of lying about his net worth to make himself look richer.

Historically Trump’s fortune came from the Trump Organisation family conglomerate focused on real estate and tourism, but much of his new wealth is thought to come from crypto ventures that have boosted his fortunes by billions of dollars in just a few months.

The sums are unprecedented for a president in office. “There is no historical parallel for this. Nothing comes close,” said Will Ragland, vice president of research at CAP.

While former presidents have gone to great lengths to avoid conflicts of interest, such as Jimmy Carter putting his peanut farm into a blind trust, Trump seems to embrace the grey area.

Trump is “a president who appears to actively use his businesses as a vehicle for blatant conflict of interest for personal gain,” said Ragland.

During Trump’s first term, the infamous dealmaker lost money. According to Forbes, Trump was worth $3.5 billion when he was first inaugurated. By 2021, the figure had slumped to $2.4 billion .

The loss was largely due to the impact of the Covid pandemic on his commercial real-estate interests, including hotels, resorts and office blocks , as well as devaluations in his fleet of planes and golf courses.

By the time Trump was poised to run for a second presidential term in 2024, his portfolio of investments had diversified.

The vast majority of his new wealth has come from crypto investment projects run by the Trump family including World Liberty Financial, stablecoin USD1, meme coin tokens and NFTs (non-fungible tokens).

Although many of these are run by Trump’s sons, Forbes estimates that Trump himself has made $2.4 billion from cryptocurrencies since 2024 while Trump’s Take estimates the total value of the Trump family’s crypto assets has grown by $7.4 billion since his returned to the White House .

This, despite Trump's claim back in 2019 that he was “not a fan” of cryptocurrencies as their value was “highly volatile and based on thin air” and that they could also facilitate “illegal activity”.

Six years later, the mercurial nature of crypto has played to his advantage.

Meme coins, for example, are cryptocurrencies that generally emerge from internet jokes and are often bought as a novel way to engage with online trends, rather than as a serious investment.

When Trump launched his $TRUMP meme coin days before his second inauguration, buying in was a way for his supporters to ride a wave of excitement – but it was also a money spinner. By March, Trump had made $350 million off the coin, according to the Financial Times.

Next to launch was the $MELANIA meme coin, named after the first lady, which quickly earned $65 million in sales and trading fees – with particular benefits for a few early investors.

In the minutes before it’s official launch, 24 unidentified wallets bought up $2.6 million of the $MELANIA coin and within days flipped them for $100 million , the Financial Times reported.

Trump’s other crypto ventures have benefitted from similar boosts since he became president.

Since 2025, World Liberty Financial – a platform for borrowing, lending and trading cryptocurrencies – has sold more than $1 billion of its own tokens, Trump NFT’s have netted him around $13 million and the USD1 stablecoin is now worth an estimated $235 million .

The advantage of an association with the White House is especially clear for Trump's stablecoin.

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that aim to maintain a stable value through links to specific assets – in USD1’s case it comes with a presidential guarantee that it is backed by short-term US government treasuries and dollar deposits.

The safeguard has encouraged foreign investment. In May 2025, the UAE’s ruling family bought up $2 billion of USD1.

Weeks later the White House gave the UAE access to thousands of the world’s most advanced and scarce computer chips .

Although the two incidents are not explicitly linked, there are indications – some more blatant than others – that those who invest in Trump’s crypto ventures are being given preferential treatment.

In April 2025, it was announced that the top 25 $TRUMP coin holders would be invited to a reception and VIP tour of the White House, a clear opportunity to pay for access to the President.

Among those on the guest list was China-born crypto billionaire Justin Sun, who is thought to own hundreds of millions of Trump’s meme coins, and is also the second-largest known investor in World Liberty Financial.

He was also the subject of a 2023 investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which charged him with finding illicit ways of trading in the US including enlisting celebrities to endorse his cryptocurrency.

The Trump administration has since ended nearly all regulation against crypto traders and, in 2026, the SEC put its charges against Sun on hold.

Such deals are not necessarily illegal, but they “certainly transgress the ways in which things have been done in the past,” said Emma Long, associate professor in American history and politics, at the University of East Anglia.

It is not unusual for US presidents to use their profile for lucrative ends: most do this after they leave office, via book deals and speaking fees worth tens of millions of dollars.

But while in office, “presidents usually divest themselves of any financial arrangements that might be a conflict of interest or that might be seen as trading on their official position”, Long added.

While crypto ventures are the main source of Trump’s rapidly increasing fortune, there are other ventures that operate in this grey area.

On the 2024 campaign trail, Trump became the only presidential candidate to run an online merchandise store redirecting funds – that supporters may have believed were going to his campaign – into his own pocket.

Since his re-election, there have been claims that Trump’s hotels and resorts have benefitted from their association with the White House and from Trump holding official events there. Membership fees for Trump’s most famous resort, Mar-a-Lago in Florida, have now risen to $1million .

Then there are a host of other eyebrow-raising deals, such as a $40 million agreement signed with Amazon giving the corporation access to film a documentary with Melania Trump .

There's also the $400 million luxury jet that Trump accepted from Qatari government, which he has been allowed to keep even though it “appears to violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution, which essentially prohibits accepting profits or gifts from foreign countries without congressional approval”, said Ragland.

US Congress has so far failed to take action against the exceptionally expensive gift, making it part of a wider cash grab that indicates the country's “ethical guardrails are no longer functional,” said Ragland.

“We aren't just looking at one man’s fortune; we’re looking at a systemic failure that leaves the American public completely vulnerable to industrial-scale corruption,” he added.

French President Emmanuel Macron said the European Union should not bend to "the law of the strongest", adding that it was "crazy" that the bloc was having to contemplate using its "anti-coercion instrument" against the United States.

"We do believe that we need more growth, we need more stability in this world, but we do prefer respect to bullies," Macron told the World Economic Forum's annual meeting, the day before Trump's arrival in Switzerland.

Without referring directly to Trump, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted a need to respond to seismic shifts in the world and said the speed and scale of change had driven a consensus in Europe on independence.

"It is time to seize this opportunity and build a new independent Europe," she said in a speech.

Belgium's Prime Minister Bart De Wever said the 27-member bloc was "at a crossroads" where it must decide on how to get out of a "very bad position" after trying to appease Trump to get his support for the Ukraine war .

"So we should unite and we should say to Donald Trump ... 'You're crossing red lines here.' We either stand together or we will stand divided," De Wever said on a panel discussion.

Trump announced tariffs on Saturday on imports from European allies that oppose the U.S. acquiring Greenland, an autonomous part of Denmark.

European governments, which are facing growing challenges from populist, nationalist parties, have been at odds over how to respond to the tariff threat while maintaining U.S. support for Ukraine.

Macron said Europe should not accept a world where might was right and called for bold moves to defend European industries.

"Let's not be shy. Let's not be divided. Let's not accept a global order, which will be divided by those who claim to have the bigger voice," Macron said.

Macron also appeared to see an opportunity for Europe in Trump's chaotic policies.

"We have a place where the rule of law and predictability is still the rule of the game, and my guess is that it is under-priced by the market," he said in his speech.

However, some senior bankers and executives in Davos, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they saw the response from European leaders to Trump's moves as emotional rather than pragmatic. Two suggested the continent needed to look beyond the way the U.S. president delivers his message and have a negotiation.

"But they won't even want to have that conversation, because they're so offended by the style. And so what you have in Europe is a very, very, delicate balance of a continent that cannot move together," one senior banker told Reuters.

European countries say Trump's threat of new tariffs would violate a trade deal reached with the U.S. last year, and EU leaders are set to discuss possible retaliation at an emergency summit in Brussels on Thursday.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, however, voiced confidence that the United States and European countries would find a solution and avoid what some have warned could become a prolonged trade war.

"Why are we jumping there? Why are you taking it to the worst case? ... Calm down the hysteria. Take a deep breath," he said.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that he was ready to join other global leaders in Davos, but only if the U.S. was ready to sign documents on security guarantees for Ukraine and a post-war prosperity plan.

"Ukraine is ready for meetings ... if those meetings are actually effective," he wrote on X.

His comments came as CEOs, including finance industry executives, are expected to meet on Wednesday to discuss post-war reconstruction, a source familiar with the matter said.

But any decisions were unlikely, the source told Reuters, adding: "You need peace in order to reconstruct the place."

Zelenskiy urged the U.S. to pile more pressure on Russia after its latest massive air attack on Ukraine cut heating to half of the capital and affected substations the United Nations' atomic watchdog said are vital for nuclear safety.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:30:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EPO2RX5PRONTC3RDIJCXBQ6CM.jpg?auth=8e9543263e090b354d7cb131edfbf0b54f18bd0a6627113bd8fd899c6a6f94dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE crackdown creates double-edged campaign issue for Republicans and Democrats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ice-crackdown-creates-double-edged-campaign-issue-republicans-democrats-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown is fast becoming a double-edged campaign issue in November's hotly contested midterm congressional elections because of mounting public unease over aggressive tactics by federal immigration officers.

After an ICE officer shot and killed 37-year-old Renee Good in Minneapolis on January 7, sparking protests , opinion polls showed most Americans disapprove of the conduct of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, including a Reuters/Ipsos survey that pointed to a Republican split over whether federal immigration agents should try harder to avoid hurting people.

Criticism about ICE's use of force appears to have diminished the ability of Republican candidates to pivot away from economic pessimism among voters by stressing the party's traditionally strong standing on crime and security. Democrats could benefit, despite the party's historic weakness on border security issues, if voters decide Trump has moved beyond what they elected him to do, said Nathan Gonzales, editor of analysis firm Inside Elections.

The polling data has raised Republican concerns that souring public views of ICE operations could cloud Trump's success at securing the U.S.-Mexico border. Record numbers of migrants flowed into the U.S. under former President Joe Biden, a topic Republicans view as a key campaign asset.

But with some Democratic candidates calling for ICE's abolition, Democratic groups are concerned that voters worried about immigration and security could turn against them come November.

Republicans control both the Senate and the House of Representatives but face voter frustration over high prices and the economy in an election cycle that often punishes the ruling party as voters cast ballots for all 435 House seats and 35 of the 100 Senate seats.

"This is kind of a fluid situation that we're in right now that reminds me a bit of where we were after George Floyd, where public opinion moved pretty dramatically," said Amy Walter, editor-in-chief of the Cook Political Report.

The 2020 police killing of Floyd in Minneapolis spurred nationwide anger that brought about reforms in many U.S. states but also proved to be a political liability for both Republicans and Democrats.

Members of the public have expressed outrage over immigration enforcement tactics such as ICE agents wearing masks, zip-tying children and arresting and injuring or killing U.S. citizens. Over the weekend in Minneapolis, a naturalized U.S. citizen said immigration agents with guns drawn broke down his door and dragged him into the snow wearing shorts and . ChongLy Thao, 56, who goes by the name Scott, said he was returned home later without explanation or apology.

The Department of Homeland Security has said ICE officers, whom it oversees, have also faced violence .

DEMOCRATS COULD RETAKE HOUSE: ANALYSTS

Analysts say Democrats are in a strong position to gain control of the House and could cut into the 53-47-seat Republican Senate majority, if not seize the chamber outright. Losing either chamber would hinder Trump's ability to enact his agenda and also would enable congressional investigations into administration policies and actions.

"Is (ICE) an issue that people care enough to vote on? I don't know," Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporters last week.

The Trump administration is poised to ramp up immigration enforcement this year with funds Congress gave ICE to hire thousands of agents, detain more than 100,000 migrants at any given time and expand surveillance to track down possible immigration offenders. The push is expected to include more enforcement against employers, a move that could pressure businesses in sectors known to hire workers who are in the U.S. illegally.

In the coming months, ICE's aggressive tactics could undermine Republican support among Latino voters and influence toss-up Senate races in Democratic-leaning states such as Maine and Michigan, Walter said.

Senator Susan Collins of Maine, the most vulnerable of this year's Republican incumbents, criticized what she considered "excessive" ICE tactics, including wearing masks and targeting immigrants without criminal records, which she said have been ordered by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.

"It's not the ICE officers' fault," Collins told Reuters. "Some of the tactics that the secretary has had ICE use in cities are not where the focus should be."

Some Senate Democrats hope to use government funding legislation to impose new curbs on ICE's actions. But Collins, who oversees funding issues as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said she instead favored oversight hearings with Noem.

In response, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said, "President Trump and Secretary Noem are delivering on the American people's mandate to deport illegal aliens."

McLaughlin's statement to Reuters cited opinion polls released months before Good's shooting that showed most Americans favoring deportation of people in the country illegally, though one New York Times survey also said most voters thought Trump had gone too far on immigration enforcement.

The statement asserted that 70% of those arrested by ICE have been charged with or convicted of crimes, a claim that has been disputed by independent researchers, advocacy groups and journalists.

Democrats could find themselves debating whether to reform ICE or abolish the agency altogether, a question some fear could backfire on the party.

"The task ahead is not to eliminate enforcement, but to reclaim it from those who are abusing it for political gain," the Democratic centrist think tank Third Way warned in a public memo.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:30:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BM5MVL4CQRKSVC4QCUD5QPSAZY.jpg?auth=6bb5a87ae36812fb5427ff2cf3668f8460b856017688a5f101ff9c3826d48680&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Six-year-old girl who went to see Lion King is family's sole survivor of Spanish train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/six-year-old-girl-who-went-see-lion-king-is-familys-sole-survivor-spanish-train-2026-01-20/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 20 (Reuters) - A six-year-old girl was found walking alone along the tracks on Sunday night after her parents, brother and cousin all died in the high-speed crash between two trains in southern Spain. She had been on a family outing to see the Lion King musical in Madrid.

The girl, who has not been officially named, suffered only a minor head wound. The family had been returning to their home in Aljaraque, on the Atlantic coast near Huelva, according to Spanish media.

The trip to the musical had been a present for the feast of Epiphany, which Spain celebrates along with Christmas. The family also visited Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium, according to regional broadcaster Canal Sur.

The girl's survival was described by the mayor of Aljaraque as "a miracle".

"The town is broken by grief and with hardly any words of comfort," Adrian Cano said.

The girl was cared for overnight by a police officer before being reunited with her grandmother in Cordoba, authorities said.

Hers is among a series of stories told by grieving family members or worried relatives on social media or to local broadcasters about those missing or killed in one of Europe's deadliest train crashes .

Alberto Garcia told Antena 3 his daughter, who is five months pregnant, is in intensive care because of serious injuries sustained in the crash. Doctors have placed her under sedation and on a ventilator, he said, keeping watch over the unborn child, which still has a heartbeat.

Firefighters pulled her unconscious from the twisted wreck of the carriage, relatives told El Pais, after passengers smashed windows to escape from the train. Her sister , Ana, who was travelling with her and their dog, suffered lighter injuries. Relatives say the dog, named Boro, is still missing.

Ana said she believes her sister may have been injured while trying to protect the animal. "If I can’t do anything for her, at least I hope I can find Boro," she told local newspaper El Mundo.

Spain's government has declared three days of national mourning and high-speed rail services between Madrid and cities in Andalusia are suspended while tracks are cleared and combed over by investigators and rail safety experts.

Julio Rodriguez, 16, was among the first residents of Adamuz, where the trains crashed, to help with rescue efforts after passing the site on his return from a fishing trip.

"I arrived here and my body became someone else’s. All I could think about was helping. I walked the 800 metres back and forth six or eight times. I didn’t stop to think about tiredness," he told reporters after King Felipe thanked him and others during a visit to the crash site on Tuesday.

Many are still searching for their relatives. Families have filed a total of 47 missing reports but so far only 10 of the victims have been identified, official data says.

Relatives and colleagues were appealing online for news of Jesus Saldana, a cardiologist who has not been found among the injured or dead in any hospital or official lists, his sister told Cadena Ser radio. While they have recovered his mobile phone, they still have no news of him, she added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:31:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LPSTZL76VFKBHC2BI6UBQWSAUQ.jpg?auth=3cd24f5eff914f9aff629856e5ac35bcf4263d2544912cdf9f83f6ef68c39d9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lukashenko joins Trump's 'Board of Peace' as US eases his isolation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/lukashenko-joins-trumps-board-peace-us-eases-his-isolation-2026-01-20/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed an agreement on Tuesday to join U.S. President Donald Trump's Board of Peace, the latest step in a rapprochement with Washington after years of international isolation.

A presidential Telegram channel published video of Lukashenko signing the document, and quoted him as saying he hoped to contribute towards peace in Ukraine.

Lukashenko, in power since 1994, was long shunned by the West because of his poor human rights record and backing for Russian President Vladimir Putin in the war in Ukraine .

But Trump last year began easing sanctions on Belarus in return for the release of political prisoners. He has called Lukashenko a "highly respected" leader - a description that jars with the exiled Belarus opposition, which sees him as a dictator.

The invitation to join the Board of Peace marked a further stage in the U.S. rehabilitation of Lukashenko as it continues to negotiate with him on further prisoner releases and a normalisation of ties.

Trump originally proposed establishing the Board when he announced his plan last September to end the war in Gaza. But an invitation sent to world leaders last week outlines a broad role for the body in ending conflicts globally.

A draft charter sent to about 60 countries by the U.S. administration calls for members to contribute $1 billion in cash if they want their membership to last more than three years, according to the document seen by Reuters.

On Monday Trump said he had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to be a member of the Board.

On Tuesday, Armenia said it would also join. Trump has claimed credit for ending a long-running conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, which have fought two wars since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:32:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RIVW7ZNXNNJ6FMEB5JV77OKBB4.jpg?auth=09173f074c3aa17e76e3b2d7eb90a3fa9d61afca36009b84b6fd26653b9a4e8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Portuguese police arrest 37 suspected ultra-right militants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/portuguese-police-arrest-37-suspected-ultra-right-militants-2026-01-20/</link><description>LISBON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Portuguese police on Tuesday arrested 37 people suspected of belonging to an ultra-right group responsible for hate crimes, with links to similar international groups, in a large operation that involved around 300 officers.

"Those detained ... promoted Nazi ideology, inherent to the national-socialist culture and the radical and violent extreme right, acting out of racist and xenophobic motives with the aim of intimidating, persecuting and assaulting ethnic minorities, namely immigrants," the Judicial Police said in a statement.

Searches found weapons of different kinds and neo-Nazi propaganda materials.

Police sources said the group in question was "1143", named after the year Portugal became a kingdom. The group's leader, Mario Machado, is serving a prison sentence after being convicted of racial discrimination, hate speech and related violence.

In June, police arrested several suspected neo-Nazis believed to be seeking to create an illegal armed militia , and seized firearms and explosives.

Human rights groups have long raised concerns about increasing hate speech and attacks against immigrants in Portugal, where the far-right, anti-immigration party Chega last year became the second-largest parliamentary group - 50 years after the country overthrew its fascist dictatorship.

On Sunday, Chega leader Andre Ventura came in second in the first round of a presidential election, proceeding to a runoff against Socialist candidate Antonio Jose Seguro.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:33:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK approves new Chinese ‘mega embassy’ in London despite security concerns</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260120-uk-approves-new-chinese-mega-embassy-in-london-despite-security-concerns</link><description>Britain’s government on Tuesday approved a huge new Chinese embassy in central London, despite strong criticism from lawmakers across the political spectrum that it could become a base for espionage and intimidation of opponents.

Local Government Secretary Steve Reed formally signed off on plans for the building near the Tower of London , after years of delays and legal challenges.

Critics have long expressed concerns that the supersized embassy, set to be the biggest Chinese embassy in Europe, will heighten risks of Chinese intelligence-gathering as well as amplify the threat of surveillance and intimidation of Chinese dissidents in exile.

The heads of two UK spy agencies said that while it's not realistic to eliminate all risk, appropriate “security mitigations” were in place.

Plans for the embassy have been plagued by objections and protests since 2018, when China’s government bought the site at Royal Mint Court, where Britain's money was once made, for 225 million pounds (around $300 million.)

Opponents say the huge site sits too close to underground fiber optic cables carrying sensitive financial information between London’s two main financial districts. British media have reported that the 20,000 square-meter (around 215,000 square-foot) complex would include 208 secret basement rooms close to the data cables.

Dissidents have been among those who have protested the plans, saying a mega embassy housing large numbers of officials would further China’s repression of activists abroad.

Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, joined hundreds of protesters  who chanted “no China mega embassy” at the site Sunday.

Critics argue that approving the embassy was a mistake that went beyond security at the building — they say it sends a signal that Britain bows to pressure from Beijing to avoid economic repercussions.

“The government has capitulated to Chinese demands," Conservative security spokesman Chris Philp said.

Security Minister Dan Jarvis insisted: "We don’t trade off security for economic access.”

Helena Kennedy, a human rights lawyer and Labour Party member of the House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, said that the decision was a dangerous step.

“We cannot reinforce the dangerous notion that Britain will continue to make concessions — such as granting a mega embassy — without reciprocity or regard for the rule of law,” she said.

Local residents said they were “determined to keep fighting today’s decision” and planned to challenge the approval in the courts.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s government has repeatedly postponed its decision in recent months after multiple cases of alleged Chinese spying and political interference underlined concerns about the proposed embassy.

In November, the domestic intelligence agency MI5 issued an alert to lawmakers warning that Chinese agents were making “targeted and widespread” efforts to recruit and cultivate them using LinkedIn or cover companies.

Beijing has strongly denied those claims, calling them “pure fabrication and malicious slander.”

The UK government also has faced questions about whether it interfered in the trial of two men accused of spying on Parliament for Beijing, and whose prosecution collapsed last year.

The heads of the domestic security service MI5 and the electronic intelligence agency GCHQ said in a letter to ministers that “as with any foreign embassy on UK soil, it is not realistic to expect to be able wholly to eliminate each and every potential risk.”

“However, the collective work across UK intelligence agencies and (government) departments to formulate a package of national security mitigations for the site has been, in our view, expert, professional and proportionate,” MI5 chief Ken McCallum and GCHQ director Anne Keast-Butler said.

They said there were “clear security advantages” to consolidating China’s current seven diplomatic premises in London onto one site.

The government said that “no bodies with responsibility for national security ... have raised concerns or objected to the proposal on the basis of the proximity of the cables or other underground infrastructure.”

Starmer has stressed that while protecting national security is nonnegotiable, Britain needs to keep up diplomatic dialogue and cooperation with the Asian superpower.

The approval is widely expected to pave the way for a long-anticipated trip by Starmer to China, and an expansion of the UK Embassy in Beijing. The closely watched visit would be the first made by a British prime minister since 2018.

China has complained about the seven-year delay in approving the project, saying the UK was “constantly complicating and politicising the matter.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5485ef58-f2ee-11f0-aa22-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014481909047.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's PM invokes Article 49.3 to force through budget bill</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france-s-pm-invokes-article-49-3-to-force-through-budget-bill</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:34:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/71cbda3c-f61d-11f0-bf3d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-171443-171641-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mass kidnapping at Kaduna churches adds to pressure on Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/mass-kidnapping-kaduna-churches-adds-pressure-nigeria-2026-01-20/</link><description>KADUNA, Nigeria, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Afiniki Moses thought her ordeal was over when armed abductors released her on January 15 after her family paid a ransom in a village in northern Kaduna state. She was wrong.

The armed gang returned to Kurmin Wali village on Sunday and seized more than 170 people during a church service from two churches, including her husband and two children.

The children later escaped, she said, but her husband is among 163 people that the Christian Association of Nigeria says are still missing.

"They kidnapped a large number of people in the community and my husband happened to be among them. As you can see me now, I am not feeling fine," she said.

The attack on the churches is the latest in a series of abductions in the West African country, adding to pressure on the government.

It is under scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump who over what he says is persecution of Christians before launching an airstrike on Christmas Day. The Nigerian government has denied there is any systematic persecution of Christians.

It says it is working hard to tackle Islamists and other violent groups that have attacked both Muslim and Christian civilians often for ransom.

It has also hired a Washington-based consulting firm to help communicate its effort to protect Christians.

Kidnappings have spread over the years mostly in remote parts of northern Nigeria and are carried out by armed gangs who ride into villages on motorcycles and seize villagers.

Inside one of the churches targeted in Kurmin Wali, named the Evangelical Church Winning All, a Reuters reporter saw signs of disturbance, with some plastic chairs on the floor. A Bible lay on one chair, and musical instruments that appeared to have been used in a lively church service.

Idris Madami said he was outside Albarika Cherubin and Seraphin Movement Church nearby when the gunmen arrived with guns.

He managed to escape but said about 20 of his family members who were attending service were taken away and he has not heard from them.

"I have two wives (and) three children among those kidnapped," he told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 17:58:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5OGNMYLOQFLSTPEOUFTAD6KMEQ.jpg?auth=5229cdc9829389c40978a479ab6bcb17b605bbd3718dac991901abee08468457&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lithuania president says joint security deal could end Greenland row</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/lithuania-president-says-joint-security-deal-could-end-greenland-row-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - An agreement on sharing responsibility for the security of the Arctic and the North Atlantic could provide a way out of the stand-off between the United States and Europe over Greenland, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said on Tuesday.

Nauseda told Reuters an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting that the Greenland row was overshadowing the war in Ukraine and playing into Russia's hands, and urged Washington to de-escalate tensions.

"The best outcome would be just to agree on common responsibility on the security of the Arctic region and North Atlantic region. Is it possible to achieve? We should do our best to go this way, because this is the best way," he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday there was "no going back" on his aim of acquiring Greenland, refusing to rule out taking the Arctic island by force and rounding on allies.

Trump's ambition to wrest sovereignty over Greenland from fellow NATO member Denmark has threatened to blow apart the alliance that has underpinned Western security for decades.

EU leaders are due to discuss their options at an emergency summit on Thursday which Nauseda said would show whether Europe can present a united front over Greenland. He said the next two weeks would probably show how the dispute is resolved.

Nauseda said he hoped countries that can be sceptical about supporting Ukraine would understand that Europe has reached a critical juncture, arguing NATO's future is at stake.

Trump is due to speak in Davos on Wednesday, and Nauseda said his hope was that the U.S. President would send out some signals towards de-escalating tensions over Greenland.

Describing upholding territorial integrity as an "untouchable principle," Nauseda said there was always room to de-escalate.

"But of course the precondition is that both sides want this de-escalation, and now I'm not sure. Europe is obviously willing to de-escalate. I hope that the United States will be too."

The Lithuanian president said the Greenland dispute had diverted attention away from Russia's invasion of Ukraine, posing additional challenges for Europe's eastern flank.

Ongoing support from Washington was vital while Europe set about taking on responsibility for its own security, he said.

"Europe needs time in order to implement this strategic autonomy, not only on paper, but in reality," Nauseda said.

"We need 10 to 15 years' time," he added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:41:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NQMHK3BRP5MEJGEFBQNZRU4DN4.jpg?auth=ff643bb005ad4794fc7230bd6cb7a3226ba9c4151c0abb17ee0a9103f3a3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela calls for 'symbolic' social media action after Trump post</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-calls-symbolic-social-media-action-after-trump-post-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Venezuela's government on Tuesday called on citizens to post its official map on social media as a "symbolic action" after U.S. President Donald Trump posted an altered image showing U.S. flags over Venezuela, as well as Canada and Greenland.

The image, posted on Trump's Truth Social just before 1 a.m. Eastern Time (0600 GMT), shows an altered version of an August 2025 photo of European leaders in the Oval Office with Trump, with the original map replaced with one showing U.S. flags over Venezuela and much of North America.

"In light of this situation, the Venezuelan State calls on all citizens to take symbolic action in unity, with the aim of defending territorial integrity and countering misinformation," Venezuela's government said in a statement.

It urged its population to post on social media its official map of Venezuela, which includes Esequibo - some two-thirds of neighboring Guyana that is claimed by Venezuela, though this is not recognized by any major country or by the U.N.

Since the U.S. attack on Caracas on January 3, when it captured President Nicolas Maduro, the Trump administration has said it plans to "run" Venezuela and that it is cooperating with Maduro's vice-president and interim successor, Delcy Rodriguez.

While decrying the attack at home, which Venezuelan authorities say killed 100 people, Rodriguez has said she plans to pursue diplomatic channels with the U.S. She also agreed to a deal under which Venezuelan oil revenues are channeled to U.S.-controlled bank accounts .

Canada's prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Nearly three-quarters of the global population live in countries classified as "water insecure" or "critically water insecure", and 4 billion people face severe water scarcity at least one month per year, the United Nations University Institute for Water, Environment and Health warned in a report , opens new tab .

"Many regions are living beyond their hydrological means, and many critical water systems are already bankrupt," said Kaveh Madani, lead author and director of the institute.

"By acknowledging the reality of water bankruptcy, we can finally make the hard choices that will protect people, economies and ecosystems," he said.

The report said water supplies are "already in a post-crisis state of failure" after decades of unsustainable extraction rates that have drawn down water "savings" contained in aquifers, glaciers, soils, wetlands and river ecosystems, with supplies also degraded by pollution.

More than 170 million hectares of irrigated cropland - an area larger than Iran - are under "high" or "very high" water stress, and economic damage from land degradation, groundwater depletion and climate change amounts to more than $300 billion a year worldwide, the report said.

Three billion people and more than half of global food production are concentrated in areas already facing unstable or declining water storage levels, while salinisation has also degraded more than 100 million hectares of cropland, it said.

The researchers wrote that the current approach to solving water problems was no longer fit for purpose, and the priority was not "returning to normal" but a new " global water agenda " designed to minimise damage.

However, Jonathan Paul, geoscience professor at Royal Holloway, University of London, said the report did not address one major factor behind the crisis.

"The elephant in the room, which is mentioned explicitly only once, is the role of massive and uneven population growth in driving so many of the manifestations of water bankruptcy," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:43:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EIBL34MG7VPQPFZZFGJX5K3HVU.jpg?auth=3d66a5330100edbf1e3ab153c28bd2b2754593f94a5130d47c8cc45ec7805b31&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French far-right leader Le Pen takes the stand, denies party had ‘system’ to embezzle EU funds</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260120-french-far-right-leader-le-pen-takes-the-stand-denies-party-had-system-to-embezzle-eu-funds</link><description>French far-right leader Marine Le Pen at an appeals trial on Tuesday rejected her party having had any "system" to embezzle European Parliament funds, as she seeks to save her 2027 run for president.

A French court last year barred Le Pen, a three-time presidential candidate from the far-right National Rally (RN), from running for office for five years over a fake jobs scam at the European institution.

It found her, along with 24 former European Parliament lawmakers, assistants and accountants as well as the party itself, guilty of operating a "system" from 2004 to 2016 using European Parliament funds to employ RN staff in France.

Le Pen, 11 others and the party are appealing.

"The term 'system' bothers me because it gives the impression of manipulation," Le Pen said in the dock on Tuesday.

"The parliamentary assistant cases must be examined one by one, because it seems to me they reflect very different realities," she added.

The appeal hearings are to last until mid-February, with a decision expected this summer.

If the court upholds the first ruling, Le Pen will be prevented from running in the 2027 election, widely seen as her best chance to win the country's top job.

She made it to the second round in the 2017 and 2022 presidential polls, before losing to Emmanuel Macron . But he cannot run this time after two consecutive terms in office.

Le Pen was also handed a four-year prison sentence, with two years suspended, and fined 100,000 euros ($116,000) in the initial trial.

She now again risks the maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a one-million-euro ($1.16 million) fine if the appeal fails.

Le Pen is hoping to be acquitted -- or at least a shorter election ban and no time under house arrest.

As the appeals trial opened last week, Le Pen said her party had "no sense" they were committing any offence, and sought to shift the blame on the European Parliament.

"If indeed any wrongdoing was committed, the European Parliament did not play the warning role it should have," she said on Tuesday last week.

On Thursday, EU Parliament official Didier Klethi said the legislature's rules were clear.

EU lawmakers could employ assistants with the monthly staffing stipend the parliament gave them -- which was 21,379 euros in 2024, he said.

Assistants could also engage in political activism, he added, but this was forbidden "during working hours".</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 18:43:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d31dc68c-f628-11f0-884f-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020371867428.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump considers role in Venezuela for Machado</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-considers-role-venezuela-machado-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he was considering involving Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado in some capacity in her country, but did not say what role she could play.

“We're talking to her and maybe we can get her involved some way. I'd love to be able to do that; Maria, maybe we can do that,” Trump told reporters at the White House, referring to Machado, who met Trump last week and gave him her Nobel Peace Prize.

Trump’s comments marked a tone change for the president, who previously questioned Machado's popularity and ability to lead in Venezuela after the United States captured President Nicolas Maduro in a raid earlier this month. In 2024, Machado's party said it had won 70% of the vote in the presidential election.

The United States has held talks with Russia, and separately with Kyiv and European leaders, on for ending the war in Ukraine , but no deal has yet been reached despite Trump's repeated promises to clinch one.

Ukraine's European allies, currently arguing in public about Trump's threats against Greenland, are concerned the United States could demand Ukrainian accept territorial concessions.

"Dialogue is constructive and more and more people understand the fairness of Russian position," Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev said after talks with Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son in law Jared Kushner in the "USA House" at Davos.

Witkoff said: "We had a very positive meeting," Russia's RIA news agency reported.

The meeting lasted for two hours, a source who spoke on condition of anonymity said.

At stake is how to end the deadliest war in Europe since World War Two, the future of Ukraine, the extent to which European powers are sidelined and whether or not a peace deal brokered by the United States will endure.

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 after eight years of fighting in eastern Ukraine, triggering the biggest confrontation between Moscow and the West since the depths of the Cold War.

Russia controls about 19% of Ukraine, including the Crimea peninsula which it annexed in 2014, as well as most of the eastern Donbas region, much of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions, and slivers of four other regions.

Russia says Crimea, Donbas, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia are now parts of Russia. Ukraine says it will never accept that, and almost all countries consider the regions to be part of Ukraine.

Ukraine and European leaders say that Russia cannot be allowed to achieve its aims after what they cast as an imperial-style land grab. If Russia wins, European powers say, then it will one day attack NATO. Moscow says such claims are ridiculous and that it has no intention of attacking a NATO member.

Russia says that European leaders are intent on scuttling the peace talks by introducing conditions that they know will be unacceptable to Russia, which took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukrainian territory per day in 2025.

Putin casts the war as a watershed moment in relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence.

He has repeatedly said he is open to peace but one based on the realities of the battlefield.

The United States says a total of a million Russian and Ukrainian men have been killed or injured in the war. Russia and Ukraine do not publish losses.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:13:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KXAY5AGSHNLCPOFJJUQ5VCGTAU.jpg?auth=a4e70ec0d7262c880e63a06706ffe17ce759616ec6bec774e96f77dd84ef9393&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US will soon target drugs coming in by land, Trump says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-will-soon-target-drugs-coming-by-land-trump-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said his administration would "very shortly" start targeting drugs coming into the United States by land, after he claimed strikes by U.S. forces on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean have reduced the amount of drugs coming into the U.S. by water.

The South American country recorded 9,216 murders last year, a sharp rise from 7,063 in 2024, ministry data showed. The increase reversed a positive trend from the previous year, when murders had fallen by 15%.

The government has attributed the spiraling violence to turf wars between splintered gangs vying for control following the capture or death of their leaders.

Police said they captured 20 "high-value" targets in 2025. The bulk of the violence was concentrated in the coastal province of Guayas, home to the major port city of Guayaquil.

Noboa, who has declared several states of emergency, recently mobilized over 10,000 soldiers to the country's three most violent provinces in response to the crisis.

Speaking at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Noboa told attendees that Ecuador was fighting a "complete war against evil and narco-terrorism."</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU vows 'unflinching' response to Trump's Greenland gambit</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/eu-vows-unflinching-response-to-trump-s-greenland-gambit</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/013b9692-f639-11f0-9625-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203249-203437-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Almost half of Kyiv without heat, power, after Russian attack</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/almost-half-of-kyiv-without-heat-power-after-russian-attack</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54cc4bf4-f638-11f0-8228-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203452-203642-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After Trump salvo, Macron says: we don't give in to bullies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/after-trump-salvo-macron-says-we-don-t-give-in-to-bullies</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:16:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f8a678d2-f636-11f0-9bd8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-202619-202806-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>State Department approves potential sale of aircraft, torpedoes to Singapore for $2.3 billion, Pentagon says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/state-department-approves-potential-sale-aircraft-torpedoes-singapore-23-billion-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved the potential sale of maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft and lightweight torpedoes and related equipment to Singapore in a deal valued at an estimated $2.3 billion, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

The players and coaches brandished their trophy from an open-top bus which inched its way through immense crowds across the capital, winding towards the country's presidential palace.

As the players travelled the final stretch of their journey along the city's oceanside highway, the Corniche, fans walked and sometimes ran alongside the bus, with throngs of people lining the sidewalks.

Downtown was overcome by a fever pitch of almost deafening noise -- revving engines, horns, vuvuzelas and shouting -- as the players neared the palace, where they will be officially received.

In the morning, thousands had gathered at the parade's starting point in Patte d'Oie, a working-class neighbourhood across town, wearing team jerseys, chanting, whistling and blowing vuvuzelas.

All along the route old and young, men and women turned out decked in the country's green, yellow and red colours, sometimes watching on from buildings and bridges, or even climbing on top of cars and billboards.

Security forces were also present in large numbers, including anti-riot police.

The Senegal team made its way across the capital after arriving on a special flight from Morocco shortly before midnight on Monday, where they were greeted by President Bassirou Diomaye Faye , Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko and other members of the government.Senegal won the Africa Cup of Nations when they beat hosts Morocco 1-0 in a chaotic final in Rabat on Sunday that saw the eventual champions storm off the pitch late in the game.

"I wouldn't have missed this moment for the world," 26-year-old fan Doudou Thiam told AFP from the parade's sidelines in the Bourguiba neighbourhood, wearing a Senegal jersey.

"The Lions are our pride and they deserve all the honours. Even if it meant staying here all day, I would have done it", he said.

A ruckus of whistles and horns has been almost constant since Senegal's victory on Sunday night, when fans flooded the streets, filling the air with honking, fireworks and the deafening roar of vuvuzelas.

The win marked Senegal's second title, after their 2022 victory over Egypt in Cameroon . It was the team's third final in just the last four editions.

Hortense Kenny brought her five-year-old child to Patte d'Oie to watch the parade.

"The Lions made an entire nation proud, beating the host country in those circumstances," she told AFP, referring to the end of the match.

"Now, all that's left is to win the World Cup. With Sadio Mane, anything is possible," she said, referencing the team's biggest star.

His role as peacemaker during the final -- he was the one who stayed on the pitch and persuaded his teammates to return -- has been widely praised.

Nearby Abdulai Sy, a 49-year-old, told AFP he felt personally touched by the victory which gave him a "big sense of pride to also be Senegalese".

Tuesday's crowd seemed unphased by a cloud of controversy surrounding their team's decision to storm off the pitch late in normal time in protest at a penalty awarded to Morocco.

Prompted by Mane, they returned to the pitch and an attempted 'Panenka' penalty from Morocco's Brahim Diaz was easily saved by Senegal's goalkeeper before Pape Gueye won the game with a superb shot in extra time that stunned the Moroccan crowd.

The Moroccan FA said it had referred the incidents, including protests from Senegal players and fans, to the Confederation of African Football and FIFA .

Far from Morocco, football's lucrative business side had trickled down even to the streets of Dakar on Tuesday.

Amath Ndiaye, a 36-year-old street vendor who usually sells tissues, told AFP he has switched to hawking jerseys, flags, vuvuzelas and whistles for the duration of AFCON and the celebratory aftermath.

On Tuesday, he was basking in the wisdom of his decision.

"I'm doing well," he told AFP from Patte d'Oie, near the joyous crowd decked out in patriotic Senegalese gear and waving flags.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:55:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f1055096-f620-11f0-a539-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-20T163356Z-1425771790-UP1EM1K1A0IXA-RTRMADP-3-SOCCER-NATIONS-SEN-MAR-PARADE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How has Trump's one year in office weighed on the war in Ukraine?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/how-has-trump-s-one-year-in-office-weighed-on-the-war-in-ukraine</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 20:55:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9a061e5e-f63b-11f0-a67c-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-203845-204040-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Standoff with Iran over inspections cannot go on forever, IAEA chief says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/standoff-with-iran-over-inspections-cannot-go-forever-iaea-chief-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The standoff with Iran over accounting for its stock of highly enriched uranium and inspecting nuclear facilities bombed by the United States and Israel cannot go on forever, U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has inspected all 13 declared nuclear facilities in Iran that were not bombed, but has been unable to inspect any of the three key sites that were bombed in June - Natanz, Fordow or Isfahan - Grossi told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

Iran must first file a report to the IAEA on what happened to those sites and material, including an estimated 440.9 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level. That is enough material, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick.

Iran has not submitted that special report to the IAEA.

"This cannot go on forever because at some point, I will have to say, 'Well, I don't have any idea where this material is,'" which would mean there was no guarantee the material had not been diverted or hidden, Grossi said.

"I do not have that conviction or conclusion at the moment, but what we are saying to Iran is that they need to engage."

Iran says it is fully cooperating with the IAEA. Its government could not immediately be reached for comment.

It is now at least seven months since the IAEA last verified Iran's stock of highly enriched uranium. Its own guidance is that it should be done monthly.

Grossi said he was exercising "diplomatic prudence," but that Iran had to meet its obligations as a party to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

"This cannot go on like this for a long time without me, unfortunately, having to declare them in non-compliance," he said, noting that parties to the NPT do not have an "a la carte" option where they can pick and choose what to comply with.

Asked if the issue could be resolved this spring, he said: "That is a reasonable time frame."

One of the "real world" realities Grossi said he must face is the influence of diplomatic efforts aimed at reaching a broader agreement between Iran and the United States that have been spearheaded by U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff.

"I cannot ignore it, and I wish it well so that there can be an understanding without the looming threat of new military activity over there or something of the sort," he said.

The IAEA said in November it had inspected most of Iran's nuclear facilities that were not struck in the U.S. and Israeli attacks. It has since carried out further inspections until late December, Grossi said.

It was not possible, however, to carry out inspections during civil unrest, he said, referring to recent protests that prompted a severe crackdown by the Islamic Republic. Iranian officials have indicated the unrest has stopped, he said.

Governments around the world have reacted cautiously to Trump's invitation to join that initiative that the U.S. president says aims to resolve conflicts globally, a plan that diplomats said could harm the work of the United Nations.

"Might," Trump said when asked by a reporter if he wanted the "Board of Peace to replace the U.N."

"The U.N. just hasn't been very helpful. I am a big fan of the U.N. potential but it has never lived up to its potential," Trump said in a briefing.

"I believe you got to let the U.N. continue because the potential is so great," he added.

The White House on Friday named some individuals who will sit on the board, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, former British prime minister Tony Blair and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

A U.N. Security Council resolution , adopted in mid-November, authorized the so-called "Board of Peace" and countries working with it to establish an international stabilization force in Gaza, where a fragile ceasefire began in October under a Trump plan on which Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas had signed off.

Under Trump's Gaza plan, the board was meant to supervise Gaza's temporary governance. Trump thereafter said the board would be expanded to tackle conflicts around the world.

Observers say such a board could undermine the United Nations. Many rights experts and advocates have also said that Trump overseeing a board to supervise a foreign territory's affairs resembled a colonial structure, while Blair's involvement has been criticized due to his role in the Iraq war and the history of British imperialism in the Middle East.

The ceasefire in Gaza reached under Trump's plan has also been fragile. Over 460 Palestinians, including more than 100 children, and three Israeli soldiers have been reported killed since the truce began in October.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DM24MFBS6RIHTACGKYFGKIXFKQ.jpg?auth=47d55ff1369bc8e5a515ad46e04478ad7c06d89bb4aa112f8ae37a4a81b65020&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela has received $300 mln in funds from oil sales, acting president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelas-top-lawmaker-says-oil-reform-will-add-partnership-model-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez said on Tuesday that the country has received $300 million from oil sales, the first proceeds from U.S. President Donald Trump's announced 50-million-barrel oil supply deal with Caracas, following the capture of President Nicolas Maduro earlier this month.

Trump said separately on Tuesday his country had taken the 50 million barrels out of Venezuela, and was selling some of it in the open market, though shipping records show that volume has not yet been exported.

Reuters reported last week that four Venezuelan banks had been notified by the country's government that they would split $300 million of oil revenues deposited in an account in Qatar, enabling them to sell dollars to Venezuelan companies that need foreign exchange to pay for materials.

"We should inform you that we have gotten funds, from the sale of oil, and we have gotten, of the first $500 million, $300 million," Rodriguez said at an event in Caracas. "These first funds will be used through the exchange market in Venezuela, by national banks and the central bank, to consolidate and stabilize the market and protect the incomes and purchasing power of our workers."

Elsewhere on Tuesday, Rodriguez's brother, lawmaker Jorge Rodriguez, said a reform of the country's main oil law expected to be debated for the first time this week will be based on a partnership structure first introduced during President Nicolas Maduro's administration, though he provided no details.

Interim president Rodriguez told lawmakers last week that the government supported changes to the hydrocarbons law to boost foreign investment. The law has a single contract model of joint ventures controlled by state company PDVSA, but the country has been introducing so-called 'productive participation contracts' for new partnerships in recent years, whose terms have not been fully disclosed.

Those contracts are "a fundamental element to be expressed in the law's reform," Jorge Rodriguez told journalists.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3J5QIJA4TVNQHHWTPTALVVAGRE.jpg?auth=3e0cc6398f3b967a12178a3a8eb8c0132a330c05b5af45d6422d8dc0f80fcba1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US subpoenas Minnesota leaders in criminal grand jury probe over opposition to immigration crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-subpoenas-minnesota-leaders-criminal-grand-jury-probe-over-opposition-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice served grand jury subpoenas to the offices of Minnesota's governor and attorney general, and the mayor of Minneapolis, as it weighs whether their public opposition to President Donald Trump's surge in immigration enforcement amounts to a crime.

One of the subpoenas, shared by Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, orders his office's custodian of records to produce documents since the beginning of 2025 related to "cooperation or lack of cooperation with federal immigration authorities." Six offices were served with subpoenas, according to a Justice Department official, including those of Governor Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison.

Trump, a Republican, has sent thousands of immigration agents into the Minneapolis area in recent weeks in a highly visible, sometimes violent surge that has little modern precedent. The agents have carried guns through the city's snowy streets, dressed in military-style camouflage gear and masks, drawing loud protests from residents. Trump administration officials have blamed Walz and Frey for the protests, accusations they deny.

The hostility by many residents has only deepened after one agent fatally shot an American woman, Renee Good, in her car nearly two weeks ago. Federal agents have used tear gas and other chemical irritants on protesters, and have drawn outrage for questioning or arresting Black, Latino or Asian U.S. citizens, including a man who was wrongly arrested and pulled out of his home on Sunday dressed in underpants and sandals.

The subpoenas arrived a few days after it became public that the U.S. Justice Department was investigating Walz, Frey and other Democrats and outspoken critics of Trump.

Democratic politicians in Minnesota have called for calm, but have also been sharply critical of what they see as a politically motivated crackdown by Trump, and have sued his administration, asking a judge last week to order an end to what they call the unconstitutional excesses of his enforcement surge.

Walz called the federal investigation "a partisan distraction" that "does not seek justice."

"Minnesotans are more concerned with safety and peace rather than with baseless legal tactics aimed at intimidating public servants standing shoulder to shoulder with their community," his statement said.

Frey said in a statement that the federal government was trying "to intimidate local leaders for doing their jobs" and that "every American should be concerned."
"We shouldn't live in a country where federal law enforcement is used to play politics or crack down on local voices they disagree with," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 21:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3GJDFWQTCBJLRC5CZT7HXF42NA.jpg?auth=2a2a7dc66bf3325f621193e797c9f7f19f21888156e5f6b9b3395ad7d01694d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan court to rule in trial of man charged with killing ex-PM Abe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japan-court-rule-trial-man-charged-with-killing-ex-pm-abe-2026-01-20/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A Japanese court will on Wednesday deliver its verdict on a man accused of fatally shooting former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, three and a half years after the assassination of the country's longest-serving premier stunned the nation.

Tetsuya Yamagami, now 45, was arrested on the spot in July 2022 after fatally firing at Abe with a homemade gun while the former prime minister was delivering a campaign speech in the western city of Nara. Abe was 67.

Although he was no longer Japan's leader at the time, Abe remained a powerful and binding force within the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. His absence has left a vacuum within the party, which has since seen two leadership races and by extension, a revolving door of prime ministers.

Abe himself served as prime minister for a total of 3,188 days over two separate terms, stepping down in September 2020 citing health reasons.

His protegee Sanae Takaichi now leads Japan and the LDP, but the party's grip on power has considerably diminished.

Abe's killing also brought to light a deep link between his party and the Unification Church, an organisation many consider a cult. An in-party investigation found that more than a hundred lawmakers had dealings with the group, leading many voters to shun the LDP, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-war period.

Media have quoted Yamagami as telling the court that he held a grudge against the Unification Church after his mother's large donation to it caused financial hardship for their family, and that he took out his anger on Abe because the former prime minister had once sent a video message to an event held by a group affiliated with the church.

Founded in South Korea in 1954, the Unification Church is famous for its mass weddings and counts Japanese followers as a key source of income.

A guilty verdict is all but certain after Yamagami admitted to killing Abe in the first court hearing at the Nara District Court in October, and attention is on the severity of the sentence.

Prosecutors sought a life sentence last month, calling the act an "extremely grave incident that is unprecedented in post-war history".

Yamagami's lawyers, meanwhile, argued that the family's misfortune caused by the donation to the Unification Church should be taken into consideration and limit his prison term to 20 years at most.

While Abe was a divisive figure domestically, he was among the few global leaders to have a strong rapport with U.S. President Donald Trump.

Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his 2016 election victory and the two went on to forge a close bond over rounds of golf in the United States and Japan. Prime Minister Takaichi has repeatedly referenced their friendship in her own dealings with Trump.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:23:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M2LJFLYKQRJQTFWINFD4INZK6U.jpg?auth=29e19204b93ca8621c4de77775ef7fd4731257e46566db026b00039170e92d3f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military seizes another Venezuela-linked tanker in the Caribbean</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-military-seizes-another-venezuela-linked-tanker-caribbean-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it seized a Venezuela-linked tanker on Tuesday in the Caribbean, marking the seventh such apprehension since the start of U.S. President Donald Trump's month-long campaign to control Venezuela's oil flows.

As part of the move, which the Trump administration has communicated to some European capitals, the U.S. will eliminate roughly 200 positions from the NATO entities that oversee and plan the alliance's military and intelligence operations, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private diplomatic conversations.

Among the bodies that will be affected, said the sources, are the UK-based NATO Intelligence Fusion Centre and the Allied Special Operations Forces Command in Brussels. Portugal-based STRIKFORNATO, which oversees some maritime operations, will also be cut, as will several other similar NATO entities, the sources said.

The sources did not specify why the U.S. had decided to cut the number of staff dedicated to the NATO roles, but the moves broadly align with the Trump administration's stated intention to shift more resources toward the Western Hemisphere.

The Washington Post first reported the decision.

The changes are small relative to the size of the U.S. military force stationed in Europe and do not necessarily signal a broader U.S. shift away from the continent. Around 80,000 military personnel are stationed in Europe, almost half of them in Germany.

But the moves are nonetheless likely to stoke European anxiety about the future of the alliance, which is already running high given U.S. President Donald Trump's stepped-up campaign to wrest Greenland away from Denmark, raising the unprecedented prospect of territorial aggression within NATO.

On Tuesday morning, the U.S. president, who is scheduled to fly to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in the evening, shared another user's post on social media that identified NATO as a threat to the United States. The post described China and Russia as merely "boogeymen."

Asked for comment, a NATO official said changes to U.S. staffing are not unusual and that the U.S. presence in Europe is larger than it has been in years.

"NATO and U.S. authorities are in close contact about our overall posture – to ensure NATO retains our robust capacity to deter and defend," the NATO official said.

The White House and the Pentagon did not respond to requests for comment.

Reuters could not obtain a full list of NATO entities that will be affected by the new policy. About 400 U.S. personnel are stationed within the entities that will see cuts, one of the sources said, meaning the total number of Americans at the affected NATO bodies will be reduced by roughly half.

Rather than recalling servicemembers from their current posts, the U.S. will for the most part decline to backfill them as they move on from their positions, the sources said.

The drawdown comes as the alliance traverses one of the most diplomatically fraught moments in its 77-year history.

Trump famously threatened to withdraw from NATO during his first presidential term and said on the campaign trail that he would encourage Russian President Vladimir Putin to attack NATO members that did not pay their fair share on defense.

But he appeared to warm to NATO over the first half of 2025, effusively praising NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and other European leaders after they agreed to boost defense spending at a June summit.

In recent weeks, however, his administration has again provoked alarm across Europe.

In early December, Pentagon officials told diplomats that the U.S. wants Europe to take over the majority of NATO's conventional defense capabilities, from intelligence to missiles, by 2027, a deadline that struck European officials as unrealistic.

A key U.S. national security document released shortly after called for the U.S. to dedicate more of its military resources to the Western Hemisphere, calling into question whether Europe will continue to be a priority theater for the U.S.

In the first weeks of 2026, Trump has revived his longstanding campaign to acquire Greenland, an overseas territory of Denmark, enraging officials in Copenhagen and throughout Europe, many of whom believe any territorial aggression within the alliance would mark the end of NATO.

Over the weekend, Trump said he would slap several NATO countries with tariffs starting February 1 due to their support for Denmark's sovereignty over the island. That has caused European Union officials to mull retaliatory tariffs of their own.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:25:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HS2QET6Y6JNCRDHJOGC2WDFL44.jpg?auth=d9fe88693e715a4f63c1d3504eb8f8daab7c382ec2a87c438692ca4bb6ecd1c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump has a 'unique, sometimes strange affinity' with Vladimir Putin</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/trump-has-a-unique-sometimes-strange-affinity-with-vladimir-putin</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb8e9b02-f64a-11f0-a200-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-223119-224318-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain’s train crash death toll rises to 42, casts a shadow on world-class rail system</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260120-spain-s-train-crash-death-toll-rises-to-42-casts-a-shadow-on-world-class-rail-system</link><description>The deadly train wreck in southern Spain has cast a pall over one of the nation’s symbols of success.

Sunday's collision killed at least 42 people and injured dozens more, according to officials on Tuesday.

“It is undoubtably a hard blow, and I have to work so it doesn’t affect the credibility and strength of the network,” Spanish Transport Minister Oscar Puente told Spanish national radio RNE when asked about the knock to the reputation of the rail system.

On Tuesday night, a Barcelona commuter train crashed after a retaining wall fell onto the tracks, Spanish emergency services reported. Officials said 15 people were affected, but did not specify if they were injured. The incident happened just two days after the deadly collision in southern Spain.

Here's a look at the history of a rail network that became a crown jewel of contemporary Spain, by the numbers.

The time since Spain inaugurated its first high-speed AVE, which means “bird” in Spanish.

Both before and after that milestone, successive Spanish governments devoted tax revenues and European Union development aid to its high-speed rail network that quickly caught up with and surpassed high-speed pioneers Japan and France .

The first high-speed train to speed across Spain preceded the opening of the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona by two months.

Both marked high points in Spain’s recent history after it emerged from the economic doldrums and cultural and political isolation of the 20th-century dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco .

The length, equal to 2,400 miles, of high-speed rail that Spain has laid over the past three-plus decades for its 49 million residents.

Only China — with 45,000 kilometers (28,000 miles) for its 1.4 billion people — has more high-speed track, according to the International Union of Railways.

Spain's commitment to high-speed rail, which the railway union defines as rails for trains going 250 kph (155 mph), has helped Spain shed its reputation of often being behind the industrial curve compared to other leading economies.

Spain’s train builders have been able to capitalize on its domestic expansion. A Spanish consortium built Saudi Arabia’s high-speed line connecting the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that opened service in 2018.

The approximate time a train trip took between Madrid and Barcelona before and after the 2008 adoption of high-speed rail.

On an old, slow train, the 600-kilometer (385-mile) journey between Spain’s biggest cities used to take around seven hours, meaning many business travelers opted to take a plane.

Now that trip can be done in 2½ hours, and Spain announced plans in November to modernize the Madrid-Barcelona line to allow trains to reach 350 kph (218 mph), matching the fastest Chinese trains. That would bring the transit time down to less than two hours.

The AVE has helped unite a country whose main population centers other than Madrid are located on its coasts, separated by some of the most sparsely populated areas in Europe.

Every region and provincial capital has pushed hard for its own high-speed line. Some critics say the administrations may have spent too much on questionable lines to the detriment of investing in local commuter lines, which suffer many more delays than high-speed rail does.

Missing out on an AVE line and stop has become synonymous with economic decline for a provincial city.

“The high-speed train has proven to be a catalyst for the nation’s society and economy,” Zacarias Grande, professor of civil engineering of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya told The Associated Press.

“It has tightened links between Spain’s different regions over its three decades, significantly boosting business relations and their cultural, technological and professional development.”

The move away from air travel to rail also remains a key plank of Spain’s green energy and electrification plan to fight climate change .

The number of deadly crashes on a stretch of high-speed rail tracks in Spain’s history. One official described Sunday’s collision as transforming a train into a “mass of twisted metal.”

Spanish officials say they are still at a loss to understand what went wrong Sunday night when one high-speed train jumped the track and collided with another fast train going in the other direction.

Álvaro Fernández, the president of public train company Renfe, told Spanish public radio station RNE that both trains were traveling well under the speed limit and “human error could be ruled out.”

One of the two trains was operated by Renfe and another by a private company.

Spain’s worst train crash this century occurred in 2013, when 80 people died after a train derailed in the country’s northwest on a track that wasn't designed for high speeds. While the train itself was capable of high-speed travel, an investigation concluded that it was going 179 kph (111 mph) on a stretch with an 80 kph (50 mph) speed limit when it left the tracks.

The number of operators with high-speed trains in Spain.

Only recently did Spain open its rail network to private companies to compete against Renfe.

The first private company to get into Spain's high-speed rail market was the French-owned Ouigo in 2021. The Italian-owned Iryo followed in 2022.

It was an Iryo train that first derailed on Sunday, knocking the Renfe train off its track. Iryo has said that it's working with officials to determine the causes of the crash.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f3b3b384-f646-11f0-b309-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020623207379.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How has Trump reshaped the White House?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/how-has-trump-reshaped-the-white-house</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d73e55ec-f641-11f0-8494-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-210313-211456-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'A lot of rosy rhetoric, but the jobs numbers are just not there for Trump'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/a-lot-of-rosy-rhetoric-but-the-jobs-numbers-are-just-not-there-for-trump</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:26:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bb6dd3c6-f63f-11f0-93c6-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/EN-20260120-211851-212652-CS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands protest against Trump immigration policies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/thousands-protest-against-trump-immigration-policies-2026-01-20/</link><description>Jan 20 (Reuters) - Thousands of U.S. workers and students marched through cities and university campuses on Tuesday in opposition to the immigration policies of President Donald Trump.

On the first anniversary of Trump's second term, protests sprang up across the country against his aggressive immigration crackdown that prompted outrage after federal agents dragged a U.S. citizen from her car and shot dead activist Renee Good in Minneapolis in past weeks.

Hundreds of protesters gathered in Washington and smaller cities like Asheville, North Carolina, where demonstrators marched through the downtown shouting "No ICE, no KKK, no fascist USA," according to online videos.

The Trump administration says it has a mandate from voters to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally. Recent polls show most Americans disapprove of the use of force by officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies.

University students demonstrated in Cleveland, Ohio, chanting "No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here" while high schoolers in Santa Fe, New Mexico, left class to attend a "Stop ICE Terror" rally at the state capitol, according to protest organizers and school officials.

The actions were organized by left-leaning groups such as Indivisible and 50501, as well as labor unions and grassroots organizations opposed to immigrant detention camps, like one in El Paso, Texas, where three detainees have died in the last six weeks, according to federal authorities.

The demonstrations were set to roll west to cities such as San Francisco and Seattle, where afternoon and evening protests were planned.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 22:46:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DD6WW5YG6ZIWLL4KIY3APILJ5Y.jpg?auth=6d6cbb910a2b326c2444c9e22c4de0e7d3745be4188ab18e8f8967ac68fdb32e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Severe weather in New Zealand's North Island prompts evacuations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/severe-weather-new-zealands-north-island-prompts-evacuations-2026-01-20/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Authorities urged evacuations in some low-lying areas of New Zealand's North Island on Wednesday and police searched for a missing man who was swept away in a river after continued heavy rain and strong winds triggered flooding, swollen rivers and landslides.

Local councils across the north asked residents in flood-prone areas to move to higher ground and others to prepare to evacuate if needed. Several roads were closed because of slips and flooding, the New Zealand Transport Agency said.

Images shared on news sites showed flooded farmland and surface water across roads.

Police said a man was missing after he was washed away with his vehicle during a river crossing near Warkworth earlier on Wednesday.

Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell told Radio New Zealand he was most concerned about the Northland region, including the town of Oakura and surrounding areas.

"They're basically fully saturated in terms of the ground ... and we've got more coming," Mitchell said.

National forecaster MetService issued warnings for much of the top half of the North Island, saying there was a threat to life from dangerous river conditions, significant flooding and landslides, with travel disruption likely and some communities potentially isolated.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:23:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military seizes seventh Venezuela-linked tanker amid Trump oil crackdown</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260120-us-military-venezuela-trump-oil</link><description>US military forces boarded and took control of a seventh oil tanker connected with Venezuela on Tuesday as part of the Trump administration's broader efforts to take control of the South American country's oil.

US Southern Command said in a social media post that US forces apprehended the Motor Vessel Sagitta “without incident” and that the tanker was operating in defiance of President Donald Trump ’s "established quarantine of sanctioned vessels in the Caribbean.”

The military command did not say whether the US Coast Guard took control of the tanker as has been the case in prior seizures. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for more details. Southern Command said it had nothing to add to its post.

The Sagitta is a Liberian-flagged tanker and its registration says it is owned and managed by a company in Hong Kong. The ship last transmitted its location more than two months ago when exiting the Baltic Sea in northern Europe.

The tanker was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department under an executive order related to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

The post from US Southern Command indicated the ship had taken oil from Venezuela. It said the capture of the tanker “demonstrates our resolve to ensure that the only oil leaving Venezuela will be oil that is coordinated properly and lawfully.”

The military command posted what appeared to be aerial footage of the Sagitta sailing on the ocean, but unlike in prior videos the clip did not show US forces flying toward it in helicopters or landing on the deck of the ship.

Since the US ouster of Venezuela President Nicolás Maduro in a surprise nighttime raid on Jan. 3, the Trump administration has set out to control the production, refining and global distribution of Venezuela’s oil products.

Officials in Trump’s Republican administration have made it clear they see seizing the tankers as a way to generate cash as they seek to rebuild Venezuela’s battered oil industry and restore its economy.

Trump met with executives from oil companies nearly two weeks ago to discuss his goal of investing $100 billion in Venezuela to repair and upgrade its oil production and distribution. He said at the time that the US expected to sell at least 30 million to 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil.

Trump told reporters on Tuesday that the US already has taken 50 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela.

“We’ve got millions of barrels of oil left,” he said at the White House. “We’re selling it on the open market. We’re bringing down oil prices incredibly.”

The first tanker was seized off the coast of Venezuela on Dec. 10. Most of the other tankers also have been captured in the waters near Venezuela, with the exception of the Bella 1, which was captured in the North Atlantic.

The Bella 1 had been cruising across the Atlantic and nearing the Caribbean when on Dec. 15 it abruptly turned and headed north, toward Europe. The ship was ultimately captured on Jan. 8.

Speaking at the White House briefing room podium, Trump repeatedly veered off message. He mused about the Nile River being in Egypt, joked about renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of Trump, made demeaning comments about Somali Americans, complained about not getting enough credit for his record and professed admiration for the controversial Hells Angels motorcycle club. "They voted for me," Trump said.

The surprise appearance shortly before he was due to fly to Switzerland to join other world leaders at the World Economic Forum was meant to focus on Trump's achievements during his first year back in office.

But in an 81-minute opening monologue full of superlatives, he veered between self-congratulatory and defensive, and his core message was often lost. He then took questions from reporters for 24 minutes, for a total time behind the podium of one hour and 45 minutes.

Immigration and crime dominated Trump's remarks. He described U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, especially those currently involved in an immigration crackdown in Minnesota, as patriots and decried people protesting against them as paid agitators. A federal agent shot and killed a U.S. citizen there this month.

Trump this year has deployed the National Guard to Democratic-run cities, and he has threatened to deploy the regular military to Minnesota, moves that have drawn opposition from local officials. "To me a town, it looks better when you have military people," Trump said.

Without providing data, he also said Washington had less crime since National Guard troops arrived in the U.S. capital last summer. "Your lover's not going to be killed" walking through the city, Trump said.

In remarks that echoed a 2024 campaign speech, Trump repeated many talking points from the last election. He castigated his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, and again falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him.

Trump paged through a thick wad of printouts entitled "365 Wins in 365 Days," a compilation of what the administration cited as daily achievements since his second inauguration on January 20, 2025.

It pointed to accomplishments from drastically reducing the number of immigrants entering the country illegally to improving consumer choice for shower heads and toilets.

At one point, Trump took a large binder clip off the sheaf of papers and joked it could have taken his finger off, saying it had probably been meant to hurt him. "I wouldn't have shown the pain," he said.

He spent the first 15 minutes displaying mugshots of Minnesota residents who he said were in the country illegally and had been arrested for serious crimes. After he finished, he tossed the pictures onto the floor next to him.

Trump demonized Somali immigrants, calling them "very low IQ people" and repeated his false assertion that Somalia was not even a country. Trump has justified his Minnesota immigration crackdown partly as a response to fraud involving federal hunger programs by charities and organizations linked to the Somali community there.

Trump also reiterated his exaggerated claim that he has helped end eight foreign wars. He has repeatedly said that he deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, which he did not win in December, and has cited that omission as one reason for his push to acquire the Danish territory of Greenland.

He added on Tuesday he did not believe the Norwegian government's statement that it does not control the Nobel Foundation, which awards the prize.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4AG5SJULMJJHZF7BGVC2ZTKL5M.jpg?auth=f3b12cdfe5a775ce4c6f325af497a41521f6810a6e11b2fe3eb72bd7c353514b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico sends 37 more cartel suspects to US amid rising tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/mexico-sends-37-more-cartel-suspects-us-amid-rising-tensions-2026-01-20/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Mexico has sent another 37 alleged members of criminal organizations to the United States, Mexico's security minister said on Tuesday.

The handover of alleged cartel members is the third major transfer in the past year and brings the total number of transferred inmates to 92.

The latest swap occurred amid growing tension with Washington over cartel activity and repeated threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to attack cartels with or without Mexican involvement.

The recent set of prisoners was sought by the U.S. for their links with criminal organizations and because they presented public safety risks, Mexico's military authorities said in a statement.

"With this transfer, 92 high-impact criminals have now been sent to the U.S. during this administration, preventing them from generating violence in our country," Mexican Security Minister Omar Garcia Harfuch said on social media.

The inmates were flown to Washington, Houston, New York, Pennsylvania, San Antonio, and San Diego aboard seven Mexican Armed Forces aircraft.

Among them was Pedro Inzunza Noriega, the father of the second-in-command of the powerful Beltran Leyva cartel, who was arrested in December 2025 after the U.S. named him in its first terrorism indictment against a Mexican drug trafficker.

Mexican lawmakers and legal experts have disputed the political and legal grounds for the prisoner transfers.

They are occurring as Trump has increased pressure on Mexico over the cartels and the violence they cause, including his demands to deploy U.S. military forces against cartels within Mexican territory.

Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has ruled out U.S. military intervention to combat drug cartels, following what she called a good conversation with Trump on January 12.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also spoke with Mexican Foreign Minister Juan Ramon de la Fuente in early January about the need for stronger cooperation to dismantle Mexico's violent narco-terrorist networks and stop fentanyl and weapons trafficking.</description><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2026 23:46:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chile’s Kast names future cabinet, taps Jorge Quiroz as finance minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/chiles-kast-names-future-cabinet-taps-jorge-quiroz-finance-minister-2026-01-21/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 20 (Reuters) - Chile's President-elect Jose Antonio Kast on Tuesday appointed Jorge Quiroz as Finance Minister and named other members of his cabinet ahead of taking office on March 11.

Kast also named Daniel Mas as head of the mining ministry. Chile is the world's largest copper producer and second-largest lithium producer.

The incoming president had previously informed business leaders of his plans to appoint Quiroz.

Quiroz, who holds a doctorate from Duke University in the United States, was the principal advisor for Kast's economic program. Quiroz has said Chile's economy is facing a "decline" from which it can recover by addressing issues such as security, deregulation, reducing the corporate tax rate, and implementing fiscal adjustments—the latter being a point of contention during the presidential campaign.

Mas, a businessman and current vice president of the country's Confederation of Production and Commerce, has had a long career in the private sector, working in construction, real estate, and the financial services industries. He will simultaneously serve as Chile's minister of economic development.

Kast also appointed two attorneys who had previously defended Augusto Pinochet, the dictator who ruled Chile with an iron fist from 1973 to 1990.

Human rights groups and family members of people killed during the dictatorship criticized the nomination of Fernando Rabat when rumors of his appointment leaked. Rabat, who defended Pinochet in an illicit funds case, will now lead the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, which is still overseeing cases linked to the dictatorship.

Defense minister Fernando Barros was also a vocal defender of Pinochet after he was detained in London in 1998, working to free the former dictator.

Kast also appointed Francisco Perez Mackenna as Minister of Foreign Affairs. For nearly three decades, Perez Mackenna led the business holdings of the billionaire Luksic family, one of Chile's richest families. Daniel Mas was named as head of the ministry responsible for economic development.

Trinidad Steinert, a chief prosecutor in the northern region of Tarapaca, will lead the Ministry of Public Security, a central role in fulfilling Kast's campaign promise to crack down on crime.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WU44OHJFCJKY7GAF34KN6LFH6Y.jpg?auth=9aa576d2a0ea9ebc5c68e22f917df9c032883032a78f38525907e57840f20435&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US troops could disobey questionable orders, Catholic archbishop says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-troops-could-disobey-questionable-orders-catholic-archbishop-says-2026-01-20/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - The Catholic archbishop overseeing the church's work with members of the U.S. military said it would be "morally acceptable" for troops to disobey orders that went against their consciences.

Archbishop Timothy Broglio said he was worried some members of the military could be put into situations where they are ordered to do something considered "morally questionable."

Broglio, who also heads the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, told BBC News on Sunday that "it would be morally acceptable to disobey that order but that's perhaps putting that individual in an untenable situation and that's my concern."

Broglio did not indicate what he considered a morally questionable order.

His comments come as President Donald Trump has sought to deploy troops onto the streets of U.S. cities and threatens possible military action to take control of Greenland.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Earlier this month, Trump told The New York Times he is constrained only by his "own morality."

The archbishop expressed concern over Trump's comments, suggesting that international law and one's own moral principles should go hand in hand.

He said it does not seem reasonable for the U.S. to attack and occupy Greenland, which is governed by Denmark, a NATO ally.

"It'd be one thing if the people of Greenland wanted to, wanted to be annexed, that would be one situation," Broglio said. "But taking it by force when we already have treaties there that allow for a military installation in Greenland? It doesn't seem necessary."

Broglio is the latest leader of the Catholic Church to raise concerns about Trump's demands. On Monday, three fellow archbishops decried the direction of U.S. foreign policy. Church leaders have also pushed back on the Trump administration's immigration agenda .

Six Democratic members of the U.S. Congress in a video last year reminded members of the military that it was their duty to reject unlawful orders, drawing reproach from the Trump administration, including a Pentagon decision to demote Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona from his rank of retired Navy captain.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4YYF2OEDLNLPFO3TRZRDHJUDRQ.jpg?auth=0a0059a15eb4f718e1f646eac530076279e56cb0efce2bfadef1fea4ecce2c61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand to hold general election on November 7</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/new-zealand-hold-general-election-november-7-2026-01-20/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - New Zealand’s prime minister Christopher Luxon said on Wednesday the country’s parliamentary elections will be held on Saturday November 7.

The conservative government, a coalition between the major centre-right National party and minority parties New Zealand First and ACT, has been in power since the 2023 election.

"Kiwis will have to weigh up who is best placed to provide stable and strong government in a very volatile and uncertain world, a strong economy with responsible spending, lower taxes and more opportunity for you and your family," Luxon told a press conference announcing the date.

Luxon, a former airline executive turned prime minister, has seen his popularity fall over the past year amid a weakening economy.

Current opinion polls indicate a tight contest with neither the ruling coalition nor the centre-left Labour Party led by former prime minister Chris Hipkins appearing to command majority support.

New Zealand has used a mixed-member proportional (MMP) system since 1996, and this has made coalitions the norm.

New Zealand's parliament has a three-year term and the last legal date that the next general election can be held is 19 December 2026.

For many voters, the economy remains their key concern with growth over the past two years soft, houses prices remaining well below their 2021 peak and unemployment sitting above 5%. The government will be banking on the economy continuing to improved this year following on from a 1.1% rise in the third quarter to reassure voters.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 01:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2JHCCI5NLJIEXI3QTOKX7RRFDY.jpg?auth=719cc6fb97b3dc2441f64f6ea4b0c449aff4c435ae843242fd91395b4254532a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's Lee plays down proposed US chip tariffs, warns of higher prices</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-lee-plays-down-proposed-us-chip-tariffs-warns-higher-prices-2026-01-21/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said on Wednesday if Washington introduced higher U.S. tariffs on semiconductor imports, it would likely boost U.S. prices, playing down concerns about the proposed 100% duty.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has said that South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers may face tariffs of up to 100% unless they commit to increased production on American soil.

Lee said that given South Korean and Taiwanese chipmakers' dominance of the market, a 100% U.S. import duty would likely sharply raise prices for chip products in the United States.

"They have a monopoly of 80 to 90% ... so most of it is likely to be passed on to U.S. prices," Lee told a news conference.

South Korea already has safeguards in place under a trade agreement with the U.S. to ensure its chipmakers would not be left at a disadvantage to Taiwanese or any other global competitors, Lee said.

South Korea’s exports hit a record high of $709.4 billion in 2025, up 3.8% from a year earlier, as semiconductor shipments jumped 22% on strong demand for artificial intelligence investments.

Chip exports to the U.S. accounted for 8% of the total $173.4 billion semiconductor exports, while China remained the biggest market, followed by Taiwan and Vietnam.

Lee also touched on the slumping won in his remarks, citing expectations by South Korean authorities that the currency would strengthen to around the 1,400 per dollar level in a month or two.

The president noted, however, that domestic policies alone would not be sufficient to stabilise foreign exchange markets, as it was somewhat correlated with weakness in the Japanese yen , adding that the won was faring comparably better.

Lee said he was pursuing diplomatic efforts to enable North Korea and the U.S. to resume dialogue and that a pragmatic approach was needed to deal with Pyongyang, which was continuing to stockpile nuclear arms.

"There is a benefit to making the North stop making nuclear materials and not export nukes and stop developing ICBMs," he said, referring to intercontinental ballistic missiles, adding it would be hard to imagine the North would actually give up its nuclear weapons programme.

North Korea has so far snubbed outreach by Lee and U.S. President Donald Trump to resume dialogue. The talks have stalled since Trump met the North's leader Kim Jong Un in 2019, amid disagreement over lifting sanctions against Pyongyang and nuclear dismantlement.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:44:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CP63YJFHCVMPVDD4JCWHVNOJWQ.jpg?auth=0870d2be13c0ad3e1d3acacfc5e72f98ba783f46920c4f0347ef7343f58ebdd7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he had a 'very good call' with Turkish President Erdogan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-had-very-good-call-with-turkish-president-erdogan-2026-01-21/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he had a "very good call" with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, without elaborating.

On the first anniversary of Trump's second term, protests sprang up across the country against his aggressive immigration crackdown that prompted outrage after federal agents dragged a US citizen from her car and shot dead 37-year-old mother Renee Good in Minneapolis in past weeks.

Hundreds of New Yorkers braved the numbing cold and gathered outside Trump Tower in Manhattan shouting slogans like “We won’t stand for fascism” and singing the Woody Guthrie ballad “This Land Is Your Land.”

There were also protests in Washington and smaller cities like Asheville, North Carolina, where demonstrators marched through the downtown shouting "No ICE, no KKK, no fascist USA," according to online videos.

The Trump administration says it has a mandate from voters to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally.

Recent polls show most Americans disapprove of the use of force by officers with Immigration and Customs Enforcement and other federal agencies.

University students demonstrated in Cleveland, Ohio, chanting "No hate, no fear, refugees are welcome here" while high schoolers in Santa Fe, New Mexico, left class to attend a "Stop ICE Terror" rally at the state capitol, according to protest organisers and school officials.

The actions were organized by left-leaning groups such as Indivisible and 50501, as well as labor unions and grassroots organisations opposed to immigrant detention camps, like one in El Paso, Texas, where three detainees have died in the last six weeks, according to federal authorities.

The demonstrations were set to roll west to cities such as San Francisco and Seattle, where afternoon and evening protests were planned.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 03:45:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f8e33916-f672-11f0-b67c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020831615203.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela to use US-brokered oil sale to boost battered currency</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260121-venezuela-us-oil-sale-currency</link><description>Venezuela said Tuesday it would start using revenues from a US-brokered oil sale to shore up its battered currency, as families waited in anguish for more prisoners to be released.

Interim president Delcy Rodriguez confirmed that her country had received $300 million from Washington's sale of Venezuelan crude and said she would use it to prop up the bolivar against the dollar.

The dollar is Venezuela's de facto currency, legalised by ousted leader Nicolas Maduro in 2019 to fight hyper inflation .

A six-year-old US embargo on Venezuelan oil has led to a shortage of greenbacks, however, causing the dollar's value to rocket.

On the black market, dollars have traded recently for up to 100 percent more than the official rate.

Rodriguez, who succeeded Maduro after his capture by US forces in a bombing raid on Caracas on January 3, said the new oil revenues would be used to "stabilise" the foreign exchange market.

She added that doing so would help "protect the income and purchasing power of our workers."

US President Donald Trump backed Maduro's former deputy Rodriguez to lead the country, provided she gives US oil majors access to Venezuela's rich oil reserves.

Rodriguez has been trying to appease him without alienating pro-Maduro hardliners in her administration.

On Monday, parliament, which is controlled by her brother Jorge Rodriguez, announced plans to reform 29 laws, including on foreign investment in the oil sector.

Currently, foreign companies are only allowed to operate in joint ventures with state-owned oil firm PDVSA, which insists on holding a majority.

"Foreign investment needs to be protected and profitable," Jorge Rodriguez argued.

In a signal of the government's intent to work with US oil companies, Delcy Rodriguez on Monday appointed a US-educated banker to head the country's main investment agency.

Calixto Ortega, a former head of the country's central bank, was previously posted as a diplomat to Houston, the city at the center of the US oil refining industry.

Ortega replaced Alex Saab , a Colombian-born Venezuelan seen as a frontman for Maduro, who was sacked as industry minister last week.

Trump claims that Washington effectively runs Venezuela since Maduro was snatched from his hideout on a Caracas military base and whisked to a New York jail.

He picked Rodriguez over popular opposition leader, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Maria Corina Machado, to lead the country's transition.

On Tuesday, the Republican leader said he was still in talks with Machado, who presented him with her Nobel medal -- which he openly coveted -- at the White House last week.

"Maybe we can get her involved in some way. I'd love to be able to do that," he told reporters in Washington.

Machado, who is still touring the US capital, insisted Tuesday there could be no real change in Venezuela until all political prisoners are released.

Rodriguez has begun to slowly release some of the estimated 800 political prisoners languishing in the country's penitentiaries.

Several key Maduro opponents still remain behind bars, however.

On Tuesday, the families of 200 prisoners demonstrated outside the prosecutor's office in Caracas to demand proof of life of their loved ones.

Abe, one of Japan’s most influential politicians, was serving as a regular lawmaker after leaving the prime minister's job when he was killed in 2022 while campaigning in the western city of Nara. It shocked a nation with strict gun control.

Tetsuya Yamagami, 45, pleaded guilty to murder in the trial that started in October, and Wednesday’s ruling will determine how long he'll spend in prison.

Yamagami said he killed Abe after seeing a video message the former leader sent to a group affiliated with the Unification Church. He added that his goal was to hurt the church, which he hated, and expose its ties with Abe.

Prosecutors have demanded life imprisonment for Yamagami, while his lawyers have sought a sentence of no more than 20 years, speaking of his troubles as the child of a church adherent.

The revelation of close ties between the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the church caused the party to pull back from the church. It also prompted investigations that ended with the church's Japanese branch being stripped of its tax-exempt religious status and ordered dissolved.

The killing has also led to officials working to increase police protection of dignitaries.

Abe was shot on July 8, 2022, while giving a speech outside a train station in Nara. In footage captured by television cameras, two gunshots ring out as the politician raises his fist. He collapses holding his chest, his shirt smeared with blood. Officials say Abe died almost instantly.

Yamagami was captured on the spot. He said he initially planned to kill the leader of the Unification Church, but switched targets to Abe because of the difficulty of getting close to the leader.

Yamagami’s case has also brought attention to the children of Unification Church adherents in Japan, and influenced a law meant to restrict malicious donation solicitations by religious and other groups.

Thousands of people have signed a petition requesting leniency for Yamagami, and others have sent care packages to his relatives and the detention center where he's being housed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 04:48:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b62f178c-9399-11ed-8787-005056a90321/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23013080896870.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How an Islamist party is gaining ground in Bangladesh, worrying moderates</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/how-an-islamist-party-is-gaining-ground-bangladesh-worrying-moderates-2026-01-21/</link><description>DHAKA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Long vilified for opposing independence and barred from electoral politics for over a decade, Bangladesh's biggest Islamist party is reinventing itself and attracting new support ahead of parliamentary polls next month, unsettling moderates and minority communities.

Jamaat-e-Islami began its overhaul soon after a youth-led uprising in the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million people toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024. With Hasina’s Awami League banned , Jamaat is betting on its anti-corruption image, welfare outreach, and what analysts describe as a more inclusive public stance to deliver the party's best-ever performance.

A December opinion poll by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute ranked Jamaat as the most "liked" party and projected a tight race with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party for the top spot in the February 12 election.

"We started welfare politics, not reactionary politics," Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman told Reuters, citing its medical camp initiatives, flood relief and aid for families of those killed in the uprising. The UN says as many as 1,400 people lost their lives in the protests.

"The constructive politics, which Jamaat and its associates ... are doing now, people will put their trust and belief in Jamaat-e-Islami," Rahman said.

The party has its origins in the pan-Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami movement, which emerged in India in the early 1940s and called for a society governed by Islamic principles. Jamaat opposed Bangladesh's independence, and during Hasina's rule many of its leaders were executed or jailed in a war crimes tribunal that was criticised by international human rights groups. In 2013, it was barred from elections after a court ruled its charter was in conflict with Bangladesh's secular constitution.

The electoral ban was lifted last year and Jamaat's student wing swept the Dhaka University polls, beating the Gen-Z National Citizen Party formed by leaders of the anti-Hasina movement.

Months later it formed an electoral alliance with the NCP, which some analysts say could help soften Jamaat’s image.

"We want something new and the new option is Jamaat," said Mohammad Jalal, 40, who sells coconut water from a mobile van in a crowded Dhaka market. "They have a clean image and work for the country."

Political analyst and theologian Shafi Md. Mostafa said the party’s shift from a “stigmatised force with limited space” to a “rehabilitated, pragmatic contender” had been helped by public anger over abuses during Hasina's rule.

"The authoritarian tendencies of the Awami League have created widespread frustration, allowing Jamaat to revive its rallying cry of ‘Islam as a solution’ and present itself as a moral alternative,” Mostafa said.

For the first time, Jamaat has nominated a Hindu candidate, and spoken out against recent attacks on minorities. On its website, the party says it wants Bangladesh to be a democracy guided by Islamic principles.

Party leaders have also publicly assured women of equal rights though Jamaat has not named any women as candidates for the 300 parliamentary seats. Rahman said women could gain representation through the 50 seats to be allocated by proportional representation after the election.

Shireen Huq of women's activist organisation Naripokkho said the promises were “an electoral ploy.”

“No matter what they say now, they will return to their dogma, which includes restrictions on women in every sphere,” she said.

Umama Fatema, a 26-year-old student activist who was at the forefront of the uprising, is also sceptical.

“One day they talk about women empowerment, but the next the party will talk about five-hour workdays for women,” she said, referring to the Jamaat chief's suggestion that women work only five hours a day so they can look after their families.

Since Hasina’s exit, Islamist groups have become increasingly emboldened. Hindu and Sufi shrines have been attacked , while events deemed un-Islamic have been targeted, from performances by spiritual folk musicians to women’s football matches.

The interim government has condemned the incidents, pledging “zero tolerance” from law enforcement and promising to protect minorities.

Hindus are the largest minority in Bangladesh, making up about 8% of the population, followed by much smaller numbers of Buddhists and Christians.

"Minorities have never had real protection under any government, but the fear and insecurity we now face is unprecedented," said a minority community leader, requesting anonymity for fear of reprisals.

"If a Jamaat-led coalition comes to power, there is a real risk that Bangladesh will move towards a full-fledged Islamic republic. Today, I fear for my life, and I fear that minorities in Bangladesh may not have a secure future," he added.

Jamaat spokesperson Ahsanul Mahboob Zubair said the party had "never been involved in, nor has it ever supported, any acts of violence or intolerance in the name of religion", and called for an investigation.

Jamaat, which was a junior coalition partner in the BNP-led government from 2001 to 2006, has formed electoral alliances with most of the country’s other Islamist parties, some more conservative.

It began shortlisting election candidates early last year, hiring an international agency to assess voter sentiment.

Last week, Jamaat said it would contest 179 seats, with 74 distributed among the NCP and other allies. A further 47 seats are still to be shared after one party pulled out of the alliance.

"Jamaat approached me in April,” said Mir Ahmad bin Quasem, the son of a Jamaat leader who was hanged for war crimes during Hasina's rule and who spent eight years in secret detention before his release in August 2024.

“They showed me data suggesting people across the country were fed up with the old parties and wanted change. They believed there was a real opportunity — and I joined."

Some say a Jamaat government might also move closer to Pakistan, marking a departure from Hasina’s era when India was the country’s most important bilateral partner. Rahman said that the party was not inclined towards any country.

“We maintain relations in a balanced way with all. We are never interested in leaning towards any one country. Rather, we respect all and want balanced relations among nations," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:54:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLTTBAPX5ZPW7JS6VPDG66OY4E.jpg?auth=1b7e31b43f5b3e0db356f5180c52cc4c96037a9da68b6afd2dd0e34a8aa509b2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Surging in polls, Thailand's reformist opposition tests new election playbook</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/surging-polls-thailands-reformist-opposition-tests-new-election-playbook-2026-01-21/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Three years ago, a party of reform-minded progressives swept Thailand's election in the wake of mass anti-establishment protests only to be blocked from taking power and forced to disband.

Now reborn as the People's Party, Thai voters are once again backing the progressives' promises of change, making the party the clear frontrunner for the February 8 polls , ahead of rivals that joined forces against its predecessor after the last election in 2023.

Two surveys released in mid-January showed the People's Party and its prime ministerial candidate as the overwhelming favourites, trouncing the ruling Bhumjaithai party and the populist Pheu Thai, which led a previous ruling coalition.

"We are at the best position we've ever been in," Deputy Leader Rangsiman Rome told Reuters, saying its detailed policy proposals were pulling in support alongside efforts to woo the undecided.

"For those that accused us of not being ready to run the country, we are showing them the opposite: that we have the team."

The People's Party will need to win at least 250 of the 500 seats in parliament in order to secure a clear majority.

It is currently at 30% to 34% in most opinion polls, so even if the momentum carries the party to victory, its ability to govern may still be stymied by its rivals.

A surge in nationalism following a fierce border conflict with Cambodia is providing ammunition to the campaigns of Thailand's conservatives, who are using the dispute to attack the People's Party agenda.

The party also faces potential legal action from an anti-graft agency that could suspend dozens of its members and ban them from politics for attempting to amend Thailand's royal insult law in 2021.

The groundwork for the People's Party popularity has been carefully engineered, particularly after the progressives' anti-establishment stance left its forerunner unable to form a government despite winning the last general election .

Move Forward picked up 151 seats in parliament in 2023 on a platform that included reforming the royalist military and breaking up business monopolies.

But a military-appointed Senate blocked its prime ministerial candidate in a parliamentary vote, opening the way for Pheu Thai to govern Southeast Asia's second-largest economy.

It was another round in the decades-long tussle between popular political movements and Thailand's conservative establishment, backed by the military, that has triggered bouts of instability, including violent protests and coups.

Around a year after the election, a Thai court ordered the dissolution of Move Forward, ruling that its campaign to amend a law that protects the monarchy from criticism risked undermining the democratic system.

Within hours of the ruling, its leaders announced they had formed the People's Party.

This time around the progressives appear to be moderating their position, including dropping their call to amend the royal insult law and softening their stance on the military.

Four People's Party members told Reuters that its campaign would double down on promoting detailed governance plans and a new team of experienced professionals.

"We think that it could help restore people's faith and trust in the People's Party," one of them said.

But the strategy of bringing in outside talent has caused upset within the grouping.

Kalyapat Rachitroj, a former lawmaker, resigned from the party earlier this month, arguing that the appointment of outsiders meant long-term members were overlooked.

"You can bring in hundreds more technocrats, professors, PhDs, and elites, but none of them are worth as much as a single idealist who has to leave," she wrote on social media.

The People's Party unveiled its team of experts on January 11, presenting them as potential cabinet ministers, alongside their slate of prime ministerial candidates including leader Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut and key economic strategist Sirikanya Tansakun.

Among the new inductees were former Thai envoy to the U.S. Pisan Manawapat, former law dean at Bangkok's Thammasat University Munin Pongsapan and Peangpanor Boonklum, a veteran corporate lawyer and former PTT (PTT.BK) , opens new tab executive.

"The move allows the party to present their own alternative to Bhumjaithai's team of technocrats, which could help the party pull wavering voters, especially middle-class urbanites," said independent analyst Mathis Lohatepanont.

Bhumjaithai, led by Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, has named career diplomat and current Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow as one of its prime ministerial candidates.

If it returns to power, the ruling party has said business executive Suphajee Suthumpun and former bureaucrat Ekniti Nitithanprapas will continue as commerce and finance ministers.

Although it is still too early to gauge the overall impact of the People's Party's new strategy, the softening of its position on contentious issues gives it more elbow room after the votes are counted, said Lohatepanont.

"This could be seen as both an election strategy to broaden the base and also as a way to ensure that their options are kept as open as possible in forming a government," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:54:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RCH3BDQD2FIHTHAA4HYJ2KMZGE.jpg?auth=30689fe55d212b51a387d635fc5c967af4418c15162c75c28a52b177843f0e75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court finds ex-PM Han Duck-soo guilty of key action of insurrection over martial law</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-court-finds-ex-pm-han-duck-soo-guilty-key-action-insurrection-over-2026-01-21/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 21 (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Wednesday found former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo guilty of engaging in a key action of insurrection concerning ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law in December 2024.

Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh's election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests . Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India in 2024, following deadly protests.

India's withdrawal move was part of "internal readjustments", the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi's decision.

It was not immediately clear when the families would return.

The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

In December, India summoned Bangladesh's high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its concern over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka.

The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly sought Hasina's extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi's concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community .</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 05:55:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7DJCAQO4BJTZLTI7PWC4RAFKE.jpg?auth=da6e3a3cfb88e4cba9df248517cd28f556f931c0ad67f672352ce4809aae84eb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand's election in numbers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailands-election-numbers-2026-01-21/</link><description>BANGKOK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Thailand will hold a general election on February 8 in a showdown between three big parties that could lead to its fourth prime minister in less than three years.

Trump, who marked the end of his turbulent first year in office on Tuesday, is expected to overshadow the annual gathering that global elites use to discuss economic trends in the snowy Alpine resort of Davos.

Trump told a news conference on Tuesday that he would have meetings about the Danish territory of Greenland in Davos and was optimistic that an agreement could eventually be made.

"I think we will work something out where NATO is going to be very happy and where we're going to be very happy. But we need it for security purposes. We need it for national security," he said.

Asked how far he is willing to go to acquire Greenland, Trump offered a cryptic response. "You'll find out," he said.

In the days leading up to his visit to Davos, Trump has been unrelenting in making his case that "we need Greenland" as an Arctic security guardpost against Russia and China, and he has threatened a trade war with Europeans who oppose him.

Emboldened by his ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and seizing control of that country's oil, Trump has talked of acting against Cuba and Colombia as well as Iran. He has not ruled out the use of the U.S. military to snatch Greenland, which has an American military base.

Sources familiar with the situation have previously told Reuters that Trump's push on Greenland is related to a legacy-building desire to expand the territory of the United States in the biggest way since 1959. That was when two U.S. territories - Alaska and Hawaii - became the 49th and 50th U.S. states under Republican President Dwight Eisenhower.

NATO leaders have warned that Trump's Greenland strategy could upend the alliance. Trump has linked Greenland to his anger at not receiving a Nobel Peace Prize.

In a breach of diplomatic protocol, Trump released the text of a private message he received from French President Emmanuel Macron in which Macron urged Trump to join him and other G7 leaders in Paris after Davos, an idea Trump dismissed. "I do not understand what you are doing on Greenland," wrote Macron.

Leaders of Denmark and Greenland have offered a wide array of ways for a greater U.S. presence on the strategic island but this has not placated Trump, who posted on social media on Tuesday a doctored image showing him planting an American flag on the territory of 57,000 people.

Trump's original purpose for going to Davos was to talk up the strength of the U.S. economy.

He is giving a keynote address on Wednesday that he said he would use to discuss economic successes at home, despite opinion polls showing Americans are broadly unhappy with his handling of the economy. The White House said he would address the rising cost of housing with a plan to let Americans use money in their 401(k) retirement savings plans for down payments on homes.

"President Trump will unveil initiatives to drive down housing costs, tout his economic agenda that has propelled the United States to lead the world in economic growth, and emphasize that the United States and Europe must leave behind economic stagnation and the policies that caused it," a White House official said.

During his stay, Trump plans to have separate meetings with the leaders of Switzerland, Poland and Egypt, the White House said.

On Thursday, Trump is due to preside over a ceremony celebrating the Board of Peace, a group he formed that is aimed at redeveloping Gaza amid a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.

Trump has drawn some worries by saying the Board of Peace may work on global crises beyond Gaza, a role traditionally performed by the United Nations.

Trump told a news conference on Tuesday he likes the United Nations but it has "never lived up to its potential."

He returns to Washington late on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:37:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3F6HLJ6NFNL7VN6FRO636N5X2I.jpg?auth=2e9ee1995f2d438ba84efe502dfc99fcfb9ba6700a8b5d24ea99b57abd26d1dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Azerbaijan says it agreed to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/azerbaijan-says-it-agreed-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-21/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Azerbaijan said on on Wednesday that it had accepted an invitation from U.S. President Donald Trump to join his "Board of Peace".

"Azerbaijan, as always, is ready to actively contribute to international cooperation, peace, and stability," Azerbaijan's foreign ministry said in a statement.

Azerbaijan and Armenia were at war for nearly four decades over the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, and reached a U.S.-brokered peace agreement last August after meeting Trump at the White House.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan joined Trump's "Board of Peace" on Tuesday, his spokesperson said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:38:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel's Netanyahu accepts invitation to join Trump's Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-netanyahu-accepts-invitation-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-21/</link><description>Jan 21 (Reuters) - Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday accepted U.S. President Donald Trump's invitation to join the so-called "Board of Peace", an initiative that aims initially to end the conflict in Gaza but which could then be expanded to tackle conflicts elsewhere, Netanyahu office posted on X.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:38:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J5SHGYAJPFN6ZOIQHQBZWLJBZI.jpg?auth=ad434a934c145283245d47d03f568d10f8d6cedaa061cce12d70b23ee9a03964&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France asks for a NATO exercise in Greenland, is ready to participate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-asks-nato-exercise-greenland-is-ready-participate-2026-01-21/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 21 (Reuters) - France has asked for a NATO exercise in Greenland and is ready to contribute to it, French President Emmanuel Macron's office said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 06:38:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4EPO2RX5PRONTC3RDIJCXBQ6CM.jpg?auth=8e9543263e090b354d7cb131edfbf0b54f18bd0a6627113bd8fd899c6a6f94dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rumen Radev, the ex-president vowing to end Bulgaria's political crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rumen-radev-ex-president-vowing-end-bulgarias-political-crisis-2026-01-21/</link><description>SOFIA, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Rumen Radev painted a bleak picture of Bulgarian politics when he resigned as president on Monday in an unprecedented move that capped four years of weak governments and snap elections. He also offered a solution: himself.

"Our democracy will not survive if we leave it to corrupt officials, conspirators and extremists," he said in a televised speech. "Your trust obliges me to protect the state, the institutions and our future."

Radev, a former air force commander, has waited years for this moment. Since a political crisis erupted in 2020, he has sat above the parliamentary mess, appointing caretaker governments when needed, and gradually amassing influence as the Balkan country's ceremonial head of state.

Now, with polls showing him to be Bulgaria's most popular politician, he is widely expected to form a new party and run in parliamentary elections this spring.

Radev has not announced his intention to run yet, but the timing appears to be in his favour.

Popular protests against corruption and a budget that proposed higher taxes ousted the last government in December, and voters are increasingly sick of a small elite of politicians who have dominated for years. These include former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, who runs the leading GERB party, and oligarch Delyan Peevski, who is under U.S. and UK sanctions for corruption.

Still, he faces a massive challenge to turn around the fortunes of one of the European Union's poorest and most corrupt members, where prosecutors allege that hundreds of millions of euros in European funds have been diverted into the pockets of businessmen and officials, public tenders have been fixed, and people have become so disillusioned that most don't bother to vote.

Turnout dropped from nearly 50% in April 2021 to below 35% in a snap election in June 2024.

The challenge extends to Radev's own personal image. He will face questions about his pro-Kremlin stance on the war in Ukraine , his scepticism on the euro, and even an allegedly damaging energy deal signed by a government he appointed.

"Radev offers the possibility of change to Bulgarian society, but also predictability – this is a perfect recipe," said Parvan Simeonov, the founder of Myara, a Bulgarian polling agency. "However, there are issues and questions that should be answered."

Radev was voted in as president in 2016 after a military career and training in the United States. In his first term, he became a critic of then Prime Minister Borissov, who was under pressure from corruption allegations.

When police raided Radev's offices in 2020, Bulgarians saw the move as a hit job and it triggered the largest demonstrations since Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007. Months-long protests called for an end to graft, more accountability, and for the government to step down. Radev, meanwhile, was reelected for a second term in 2021.

The protests saw an end to Borissov's tenure, but what followed was a political crisis in which weak coalitions struggled to last just a few months. The elections this spring will be the eighth in four years.

Graft continues: last year alone, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office said it opened 97 investigations in Bulgaria with damages totalling nearly 500 million euros.

Critics say Radev is partly to blame for questionable dealings done by interim governments that he appointed. This includes a 2023 gas deal between Turkish state gas company Botas and Bulgaria's Bulgargaz that led to losses and an investigation .

Radev is popular but not enough to win an outright majority, analysts said.

Many point to a possible marriage with the reformist PP-DB party which has also been outspoken against corruption. Still, the party does not agree with Radev's soft stance towards Russia, or on his reluctance to join the eurozone, which Bulgaria did on January 1.

Radev will also have to clarify his stance on Ukraine after a series of Kremlin-friendly statements in recent years. He clashed with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy during a meeting in 2023 when he said that military aid to Kyiv would only prolong the conflict.

"God forbid such a tragedy happens (here) and you are in my place," Zelenskiy said on live TV. "Are you going to say "Putin, take over Bulgarian territories?""</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:30:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RKH4X7OLEVLSBMYCA7473G5LRY.jpg?auth=9a08db481989bc5499214420cc06b3dbc3e746e84278e4f0e999a4f28d71031b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia says fire put out at Afipsky oil refinery after Ukrainian drone attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-says-fire-put-out-afipsky-oil-refinery-after-ukrainian-drone-attack-2026-01-21/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Ukrainian drone fragments ignited a fire at the Afipsky oil refinery in Russia's southern Krasnodar region, but nobody was hurt, there was no damage, and the fire is now out, a local emergencies centre said early on Wednesday.

The refinery, which has been frequently attacked by Ukrainian drones in recent months as part of Kyiv's campaign to degrade Russia's vast energy infrastructure, is mostly focused on exports. It processed 7.2 million metric tons of crude oil (144,000 barrels per day) in 2024.

Moscow has stepped up its own winter campaign against Ukraine's battered energy system while continuing to grind forward on the battlefield.

Separately, Ukrainian drones struck various towns in southern Russia, injuring 11 people and prompting the evacuation of several residents, local officials said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:30:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China says it has handled UK embassy planning in line with laws</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-says-it-has-handled-uk-embassy-planning-line-with-laws-2026-01-21/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 21 Jan 2026 07:55:11 +0000</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
