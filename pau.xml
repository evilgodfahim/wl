The DOJ has been accused of withholding information and was criticized by Democrats over the slow release and heavy redaction of records from the investigation into Epstein.

The new files include hundreds of videos or audio recordings, notably surveillance footage from August 2019, the month Epstein was found dead in his jail cell while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

The DOJ posted around 11,000 links to new documents online, but some of them appeared to lead nowhere.

Congress nearly unanimously passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act (EFTA), which mandated the complete release of the Epstein files by last Friday.

A group of victims earlier complained that only a "fraction" of the files were released and even those were "riddled with abnormal and extreme redactions with no explanation."

EFTA co-sponsors Ro Khanna, a Democrat, and Thomas Massie, a Republican, threatened to bring contempt charges against Attorney General Pam Bondi for failing to comply with the law.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a resolution on Monday calling for legal action against the administration for failing to release the complete Epstein files.

Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche blamed the delay on the need to redact the identities of Epstein's more than 1,000 victims, and on Sunday denied allegations of protecting Trump, who was formerly a close friend of Epstein's.

Trump had initially tried to block the disclosure of the files.

But the president, who cut ties with Epstein years before his arrest and faces no accusations of wrongdoing, finally bowed to mounting pressure from Congress and signed the law compelling publication of the files.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 10:51:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/03dee5c6-dfea-11f0-9329-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25354084546709.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's anti-corporate DEI campaign faces high legal hurdles</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/trumps-anti-corporate-dei-campaign-faces-high-legal-hurdles-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's anti-discrimination enforcement agency has a high bar to clear to prove companies' diversity, equity and inclusion policies run afoul of the law, according to interviews with more than a dozen corporate legal and compliance experts.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under new Chair Andrea Lucas is making a sharp pivot towards what she calls "a more conservative view of civil rights", like prioritizing cases of discrimination against white men.

That shift, coupled with the Trump administration’s aggressive campaign to dismantle DEI programs, is set to collide with the boundaries of U.S. discrimination law, long a cornerstone of workplace equality.

The move signals a broader campaign to redefine the meaning of workplace fairness, setting up a potential clash with corporate America, which has widely adopted DEI measures to hire and retain diverse talent.

Lucas plans to open inquiries into corporate DEI practices to find whether employers made race or sex-based decisions, she told Reuters in an exclusive interview last week. Specifically, she called for submissions of possible instances of discrimination against white men by corporate DEI practices.

But a program is not illegal just because the administration says so, said former EEOC Chair Jenny Yang. The agency still has to build a case and convince the courts that a company's programs violate discrimination law.

“In many situations, the work that might fall within the umbrella term of diversity, equity, inclusion is foundational work to prevent discrimination and ensure equal opportunity, which is the employer's obligation under the law,” Yang said.

Still, as chair, Lucas has a full suite of legal options to investigate companies that have DEI programs. She can subpoena for documents, depose executives and sue for any violation of workplace laws.

The EEOC’s looming transformation comes after nearly a year of mostly posturing against companies since Trump issued a pair of anti-DEI executive orders less than 48 hours after he was sworn into office in January, purging the government of DEI initiatives , offices and personnel and mandating every federal agency to discourage private entities from implementing DEI initiatives.

Conservatives like Robby Starbuck, a right-wing anti-DEI influencer, are capitalizing on the moment and trying to get the administration's policies into law.

"I've had a lot of conversations about that with lawmakers because that is a very, very important part of this," he said in an interview. "You have got to codify this into law; it's much harder to kill it than if it's an executive order."

Lucas said she is ready to prove - in court if necessary - that harm has been done to white men as a result of DEI programs.

She cited a widely circulated article in Compact Magazine, known for its array of bipartisan populist writers, alleging individuals were turned down for jobs because of diversity-hiring initiatives, a common conservative refrain that has been vocally criticized by experts and diversity advocates.

"If we have a charge of discrimination against you, we're going to use the full force of the federal government to remedy it," Lucas said. "This is a pro-enforcement, pro-American worker administration."

But there is still a high legal bar to clear, Rutgers law professor Stacy Hawkins said. People alleging discrimination have to demonstrate that a job, promotion, benefits or other compensation were denied because they were male and white, and because an employer preferred the race or sex of someone else.

Most of the time, it is not that white men have been discriminated against, but that the pool of applicants has grown and there is more, legitimate competition from people of color, Hawkins said.

The job market was marked by government-approved exclusion and discrimination for decades before reform, she added, and now white men have to compete against a wider diverse pool of qualified job applicants.

"The thing that has changed is that other people are not (being discriminated against)," Hawkins said.

Many companies and industries have also retooled their DEI programs to stay legally sound.

"The larger automakers are mostly on top of this with legal audits, rebranding and program modifications," said a former Detroit automotive executive, who spoke under anonymity.

The basic tenets of corporate DEI doctrine rest on three core principles: ensuring representation of people from diverse backgrounds across all levels of the workforce; equal compensation for every employee and fostering a sense of belonging, all to eliminate systemic bias in the workplace.

Employers recognize the need to hire and retain a workforce that reflects their customers as a strategic business decision that is crucial to long-term success for their employees and shareholders, said former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.

It explains why the vast majority of companies have kept their DEI programs and will continue to, despite the bluster from the White House, she said.

“DEI is essential for us to ensure that there are pathways to opportunity and that we continue to remove barriers,” said Abrams, who started a nonprofit DEI advocacy and consulting group American Pride Rises in 2023.

“Most people agree with DEI, most companies practice DEI, and most Americans want a democracy that defends DEI.”

WhatsApp's statement followed a repeat warning by Russia's communications regulator that it would completely block WhatsApp if it did not comply with its demands to bring its services into line with Russian law.

"WhatsApp continues to violate Russian law. The messenger is used to organise and carry out terrorist acts on the territory of the country, to recruit their perpetrators and to commit fraud and other crimes against our citizens," Roskomnadzor, the regulator, told Russian state media.

It confirmed it was taking measures to gradually restrict WhatsApp as a result. Thousands of Russians complained about outages and slowdowns on Tuesday, monitoring websites showed.

"In restricting access to WhatsApp, the Russian government aims to take away the right to private, end-to-end encrypted communication from over 100 million people, right before the holiday season in Russia," a WhatsApp spokesperson said.

"WhatsApp is deeply embedded in the fabric of every community in the country – from parent and workplace groups to friends, neighborhood, and extended family chats across Russian regions. We’re committed to fighting for our users because forcing people onto less secure and government-mandated apps can only lead to less safety for Russian people."

Russia in August began limiting some calls on WhatsApp , owned by Meta Platforms (META.O) , opens new tab , and on Telegram, accusing the foreign-owned platforms of refusing to share information with law enforcement in alleged fraud and terrorism cases.

Russian authorities, who also block or restrict social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, are heavily pushing a state-backed messenger app called MAX, which critics say could be used to track users.

The authorities have dismissed those accusations as false and say MAX, which integrates various government-related services into it, is designed to simplify and improve the everyday lives of citizens.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:21:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NMZVAZVVI5OOXEKMOLW4OYNPAI.jpg?auth=be66383f02800295f71caef9933da3f5a04f4548adc51982395aa960e955f8a6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sinkholes in Turkey's agricultural heartland fuel farmers' concerns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/sinkholes-turkeys-agricultural-heartland-fuel-farmers-concerns-2025-12-23/</link><description>KONYA, Turkey, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Hundreds of sinkholes have emerged in Turkey's central agricultural region due to dwindling rainfall and receding groundwaters, causing concern among farmers and environmental experts who see it as a worrying sign of climate change.

Gaping sinkholes pockmark farmland producing maize, wheat and sugar beet in Karapinar in Konya province, with more than 10 packed into a field in places. In mountainous areas, vast, ancient sinkholes previously filled with water have now mostly dried up.

The pace at which sinkholes are forming in the Konya basin has accelerated in recent years, with the total now nearing 700, according to Fetullah Arik, a geology professor studying sinkholes at Konya Technical University.

"The main reason for the increase in numbers is climate change and drought, which have affected the whole world since the 2000s," Arik said. "As a result of this drought, the groundwater level is dropping slightly every year."

He said the pace of receding groundwater levels has reached 4 to 5 metres per year, compared to half a metre per year in the 2000s, adding to concerns in Turkey's major agricultural sector.

Drought and receding groundwater lead local farmers to dig more wells, many unlicensed, further depleting the groundwater and exacerbating the problem.

"There is also an extremely high demand for water in this (Konya) basin," Arik said, adding that there are around 120,000 unlicensed wells, compared to some 40,000 licensed ones.

While the new sinkholes have not caused any casualties so far, their unpredictable nature risks the lives and belongings of locals, he said.

Two sinkholes opened up in the farmland belonging to Mustafa Sik, a farmer in Karapinar, in the past two years. His brother was only a short distance away, working on the farm in August 2024 when the second sinkhole formed with an "extremely loud, terrifying rumbling sound," Sik said.

A survey by geologists in Sik's land found two more areas where sinkholes could form – although it is not possible to predict when it will happen.

"Are we worried? Of course, we are very worried," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 11:42:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6Z3NKBGY7FPEJMZ57JBCYQ4H6Q.jpg?auth=7faffc317dda9591bb7034e4b2cb08ae1fdd62575326c6ed041e4b5d39f9359a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Justice Department releases new tranche of Epstein files</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-justice-department-releases-new-tranche-epstein-files-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department released a new trove of documents on Tuesday from its investigations into the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, including CCTV videos and legal records.

The latest release comprises around 29,000 pages, with many redactions, and dozens of video clips, including several purporting to be shot inside a prison. Epstein was found dead in 2019 after an apparent suicide in a New York jail.

The latest material comes a few days after the Trump administration published a large cache of Epstein files in an attempt to comply with a new law forcing disclosure on the politically fraught topic.

However the releases on Friday and Saturday contained extensive redactions, angering and doing little to defuse a scandal threatening the party ahead of 2026 midterm elections.

On Monday, Trump downplayed the importance of the Epstein files. Speaking to reporters, he said the material was "just used to deflect against tremendous success" by him and his fellow Republicans.

The new transparency law, overwhelmingly passed by Congress last month, mandated the disclosure of all Epstein files, despite Trump's months-long effort to keep them sealed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:44:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7FI6AAGRNOCZOEXSSA4IQSWMA.jpg?auth=c9b2712bab4fbdaf22ce3594ea0b87292c810d291a6e4b4c9ba876f4bc0b53fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greta Thunberg arrested at pro-Palestinian protest in London, campaign group says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greta-thunberg-arrested-pro-palestinian-protest-london-campaign-group-says-2025-12-23/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - British police arrested Swedish activist Greta Thunberg in London on Tuesday at a pro-Palestinian protest, UK-based campaign group Defend Our Juries said.

Thunberg was arrested under the Terrorism Act for holding a sign that said she supported prisoners linked to Palestine Action, an organisation which the British government has proscribed as a terrorist group, Defend Our Juries said.

A City of London spokesperson said two people had been arrested for throwing red paint on a building.

"A little while later, a 22-year-old woman also attended the scene," the police spokesperson said in statement. "She has been arrested for displaying an item (in this case a placard) in support of a proscribed organisation (in this case Palestine Action) contrary to Section 13 of the Terrorism Act 2000."

Defend Our Juries said it targeted the building because it was used by an insurance firm which they said provided services to the British arm of Israeli defence firm Elbit Systems.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:44:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FJHECSUIFNMVPCOZVCCD5CFBRM.jpg?auth=1eff6f4d12f71ae66fdd933f6f8f62d90a0c6f71e1c677c72b2fa515eb8a501d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Jared Kushner's withdrawal from Serbia will hurt investment, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/jared-kushners-withdrawal-serbia-will-hurt-investment-official-says-2025-12-23/</link><description>BELGRADE, Dec 23 (Reuters) - A decision by Jared Kushner, U.S. President Donald Trump's son-in-law, to pull out of a luxury development plan in Serbia will deprive the country of much-needed foreign investment and other Balkan states will benefit, the head of Serbia's ruling party said.

Kushner's U.S.-based Affinity Global Development told the Wall Street Journal last week it was withdrawing from the project to build a hotel, apartments, shops and offices on the site of the former Yugoslav army headquarters in Belgrade.

The firm signed a 99-year lease with the Serbian government last year but the project has faced opposition.

The plans, which were backed by Serb President Aleksandar Vucic, became embroiled in a corruption scandal and led to protests by Serbs who say the dilapidated site in the centre of Belgrade should be preserved as a tribute to people killed when it was damaged in a 1999 NATO bombing campaign.

The bombing campaign was intended to stop Serbian forces attacking parts of Kosovo, which was part of Serbia at the time.

Last week, Serbia's prosecutor filed an indictment against three officials including a minister over their role in removing the protected status of the buildings this year, a move that had allowed the project to advance but which prosecutors allege was done illegally.

"They (the protesters) drove investors away. This is the most negative message for investors," Milos Vucevic, head of Serbia's governing SNS party, told Prva TV on Monday.

"They have sent Americans to the Albanian coast," he said, referring to another project Kushner is developing in Albania .

Affinity Global Development did not immediately respond to requests for comment. There is no indication of any wrongdoing by Kushner or Affinity in the case.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:44:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XNDWOAPB3FOU7LSCH5TOEE4J5U.jpg?auth=4211373abeb24aba008b5a0b18399449f7d456e6ad364c42114760b73e2f7a4e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two CMA CGM vessels navigate the Suez Canal in sign of easing tension</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/two-cma-cgm-vessels-navigate-suez-canal-sign-easing-tension-2025-12-23/</link><description>CAIRO, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Two vessels from CMA CGM, the world's third-largest container shipping line, have travelled through the Suez Canal, the authority that runs the waterway said on Tuesday, in a sign the disruptions linked to the Gaza war could be easing.

While the Suez Canal provides the fastest link between Asia and Europe, since November 2023, shipping companies have had to take much longer routes because Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi militants attacked commercial vessels, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians during warfare in Gaza.

Before Tuesday's announcement from the Suez Canal Authority, CMA CGM had made limited passages through the Suez Canal when security conditions allowed.

CMA CGM did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Companies remain cautious, but since a fragile ceasefire in Gaza took effect on October 10, no Houthi attacks on ships have been reported, leading shipping companies to reconsider using the Suez Canal , which Egypt counts on as a major source of foreign currency.

The canal's authority said on Tuesday that the vessel CMA CGM Jacques Saade crossed the canal from the north on its journey from Morocco to Malaysia, while the CMA CGM Adonis passed from the south.

A schedule published on the CMA CGM website showed that the French company will use the passage for its India-U.S. INDAMEX service from January.

On Friday, Maersk said that one of its vessels had navigated the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait between Yemen and the Horn of Africa for the first time in nearly two years.

The Danish company said it had no firm plans to fully reopen the route, but would take a "stepwise approach towards gradually resuming navigation".</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:45:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BI7DNIZ7UVOQVIUDOKFXAE3AWY.jpg?auth=7068e771908064fc18dccb2f0e4a2b615b06193518e6402e99bc70ea4ae61bc8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria detains prominent American Islamist journalist, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/syria-detains-prominent-american-islamist-journalist-sources-say-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - A prominent American Islamist journalist who has been critical of Syria's new government and its nascent partnership with the United States has been detained by Syrian security forces, two people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

Bilal Abdul Kareem, a former stand-up comedian in the U.S. turned war journalist who has lived in Syria since 2012 and worked with many foreign media outlets, was detained in Al-Bab in northern Aleppo province on Monday, they said.

Syria's information ministry, an interior ministry spokesperson and a spokesperson for the U.S. special envoy to Syria did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Abdul Kareem has been a prominent voice among foreign Islamists in Syria, giving air to hardliners who view President Ahmed al-Sharaa - who once commanded Al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria - as compromising too much on Islamic values since taking power.

In August, Abdul Kareem petitioned the Syrian state to give citizenship to foreign jihadists among the rebels who swept to power with the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) group that ousted autocratic President Bashar al-Assad a year ago.

The fate of foreign fighters has loomed large since then, with few countries willing to take back people they often view as extremists and some Syrians wary of their presence.

Al-Sharaa's government has progressively limited their space for expression, detaining several, including some with a significant online presence.

In Abdul Kareem's latest video, he criticised Syria's decision to join the U.S.-led global coalition fighting Islamic State. The video was published a day after a gunman said by the U.S. and Syria to have been a member of Islamic State killed two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter in eastern Syria. IS has not directly claimed responsibility for the attack.

In the video posted on X, Abdul Kareem begins: "I'm not going to sugarcoat this, and it probably is going to get me in trouble, but here is the reality. The Americans have no legitimate reasons to be here."

He adds: "We simply cannot legitimise the presence of the enemy, and I said America is the enemy of the Syrian people."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:45:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Lavrov to meet Syrian counterpart for talks in Moscow, TASS cites foreign ministry</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/russias-lavrov-meet-syrian-counterpart-talks-moscow-tass-cites-foreign-ministry-2025-12-23/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov will hold talks with his Syrian counterpart Asaad Al-Shaibani in Moscow on Tuesday, the TASS state news agency reported, citing ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:45:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BU6HN5ZAA5JUBMGAJ7NDMOEXPU.jpg?auth=d344103e5e8e372d83a88fd0215888cb16929a93b6562d8d9b6fd4a98676cb74&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Companies collecting pennies on the dollar in market to recoup some tariff costs</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/companies-collecting-pennies-dollar-market-recoup-some-tariff-costs-2025-12-23/</link><description>NEW YORK, Dec  23 (Reuters) - Some U.S. companies are hedging their bets on the Supreme Court case against President Donald Trump's sweeping emergency tariffs by selling their rights to collect potential government refunds of the taxes to outside investors.

Atlanta-based Kids2, which makes 95% of its toys and infant products in China, is one.

Mark Mintman, the company's CFO, calls it a "cost recovery action." He first heard about selling potential refunds during a September meeting with bankers in New York, where one mentioned that a secretive market has emerged for selling the claims.

Under the deals, companies receive a fraction of the refund as an upfront payment. They keep that money if the tariffs are overturned and the government is directed to refund the taxes, but they give up the balance to the investors. They also keep the money if the tariffs are upheld, while investors get nothing.

This is just the latest twist on Wall Street’s keen ability to capitalize on cash flow. Similar markets exist for selling future payments from structured lawsuit settlements and lottery-winning annuities. David Bowie famously sold his royalty cash flow in what became known as "Bowie Bonds."

President Trump has said it would be an "economic disaster" if the tariffs are overturned. It’s not clear when the high court will issue its ruling, and whether companies will be entitled to refunds that could total more than $100 billion if Trump loses.

"We remain confident in the legal merits of the President's lawful use of tariffs," said a White House official in a text response to Reuters.

Mintman said he worked with a division of Jefferies LLC to find the buyer, a Boston-based hedge fund. He declined to identify the buyer because of a nondisclosure in their agreement. A spokesman for Jefferies declined to comment on their work brokering such deals.

There was pressure from the hedge fund to conclude the transaction quickly, said Mintman. The hedge fund required the deal to close before oral arguments at the high court, which took place in early November. The Supreme Court typically takes months to issue rulings after hearing oral arguments. The Trump administration has asked for a quick decision but the timing remains unclear.

Mintman said, among other things, he talked to his legal counsel to get an opinion on the trade and checked Polymarket, the prediction market, to see what the chances were that the tariffs would be ruled unconstitutional. The company, known for brands such as Baby Einstein, received a total of $2 million, a fraction of the $15 million they had paid to U.S. customs through September.

Kids2 received 23 cents on the dollar for tariffs they paid under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The use of this law to impose tariffs has drawn wide criticism, since it doesn’t directly reference tariffs. It does say the president has the authority to regulate imports during a national emergency.

The company got less—nine cents on the dollar—for separate emergency tariffs aimed at stopping fentanyl smuggling. The lower payment reflects the assumption that fentanyl tariffs are more likely to be upheld, said Mintman.

Known as "special situations" trades, these deals are attractive to investors because the assets are uncorrelated to broader markets and offer potential upside if the court strikes down the tariffs as unconstitutional, two legal sources who are working with buyers and sellers in the market told Reuters.

"There's a very well-established market...where there are buyers...who are willing to provide instant liquidity to parties that are uncertain as to when, if ever, they'll be able to monetize these claims," said Raniero D'Aversa, partner and chair of law firm Orrick's restructuring team.

Orrick started seeing demand for refund claims soon after tariffs were implemented in April. Many buyers are currently quoting 16-17% for fentanyl tariff claims and 26-28% for reciprocal tariff claims, said Amy Pasacreta, of counsel, on Orrick's restructuring team.

"Some [are] saying, 'you know what, I'd rather get my 10, 20, 30 cents because Supreme Court could very well say they're constitutional.' And if that's the case, at least I get a little something recouped," said Pasacreta.

That's a good description of Kids2’s motivation. Mintman said it took two years to get fully reimbursed for tax credits the company received under a program that rewarded firms for avoiding layoffs during the Covid pandemic.

"I'd anticipate customs would be inundated if this is overturned," he said, "so not expecting we'd get anything quickly." Given the value of money received now—rather than possibly years from now—the company "thought it was a good deal."

He also liked the odds. Going by the history of this administration’s success with cases before the Supreme Court, Mintman said he estimates a favorable outcome for Kids2 is still only 50-50. "In the back of my mind," he said, "I think I got 2 million bucks for free."

To be sure, many companies are passing up the opportunity to sell their claims. Mark Bissell, CEO of vacuum maker Bissell Inc., said he’s been approached about selling his refund rights but has no interest. He said it reminds him of late-night television ads that offer to buy the rights to payouts under life insurance policies. And he suspects the administration will find a way to keep collecting the taxes.

"My view is that if the Supreme Court finds tariffs illegal, that the administration has plan B or C or D up their sleeve to throw at it next," said Bissell.

Meanwhile, back at Kids2, they are considering another round of hedging—to recoup some of the tariffs paid since September.

According to a U.S.-backed peace plan signed by both Israel and Hamas in October, the Israeli military will gradually withdraw completely from the coastal enclave and Israel will not re-establish civilian settlements in the coastal territory.

"We are located deep inside Gaza and we will never leave all of Gaza. There will never be such a thing. We are there to protect, to prevent what happened," Katz said in a speech, referring to Hamas' October 7, 2023 raid on Israel.

The office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declined to comment.

Referring to units of the Israeli military, Katz said: "When the time comes, in northern Gaza ... we will build Nahal units instead of the (Israeli) communities that were displaced. We will do so in the right way at the right time."

"We don't trust anybody else to protect our citizens," he said, pointing to what he said was also a need to be also in Lebanon and Syria.

Katz's mention of displaced communities appeared to refer to Israel's withdrawal of all Jewish settlements from Gaza in 2005.

Netanyahu has repeatedly ruled out the possibility of re-establishing settlements in Gaza throughout the two-year Gaza war, although some ultra-nationalist members of his coalition seek to reoccupy Gaza.

Nahal units in Israel's armed forces are for civilians interested in enlisting in the military, which includes a year of pre-military preparatory and volunteer programmes. These units have had a historic role in creating Israeli communities.

Israel is heading into an election year in 2026 and the issue of settlements is expected to be a key issue.

Katz was speaking at a ceremony in the Israeli-occupied West Bank announcing the establishment of 1,200 housing units in the Israeli settlement of Beit El. The units are being built in place of an Israeli military base that is being shut.

Speaking about the West Bank, Katz said: "Netanyahu's government is a settlements government... it strives for action. If we can get sovereignty, we will bring about sovereignty... We are in the practical sovereignty era," Katz said. "There are opportunities here that haven't been here for a long time."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7OTBCSNLKBLKTGH5TIIYZZTW3Y.jpg?auth=a8024abfa1a7b81a83d89c5bbc72748a25937fd42b1143baea88b633315d90d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany deports criminal to Syria as pressure mounts on migration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/germany-deports-criminal-syria-pressure-mounts-migration-2025-12-23/</link><description>BERLIN, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Germany deported a convicted criminal to Syria on Tuesday for the first time since the start of a 14-year-long civil war there as the government in Berlin tries to show voters it is addressing their worries about migration.

Around a million Syrians live in Germany, a legacy of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's open-door policy, but migration now tops surveys of voters' concerns and support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has surged.

In response, conservative Chancellor Friedrich Merz has taken a tougher line on border security and migration, pledging to speed up deportations. Syria has become a focus since the end of the civil war last year.

The Syrian criminal was handed to authorities in Damascus on Tuesday morning, the interior ministry said, adding that another criminal was sent to Afghanistan, the second deportation there in a week.

"Deportations to Syria and Afghanistan must be possible," said Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt.

"Our society has a legitimate interest in ensuring that criminals leave our country,” he said.

Critics have argued that deporting migrants back to the two countries would put them at excessive risk.

The man sent to Syria had served a prison sentence in north-western Germany for aggravated robbery, bodily harm, and extortion. The Afghan offender had been in prison in southern Bavaria for, among other things, intentional bodily harm.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says several draft documents prepared after 'productive' U.S. talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-several-draft-documents-prepared-after-productive-us-talks-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:51 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>K-Pop concert to be held in Hong Kong and aired in mainland China, organisers say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/k-pop-concert-be-held-hong-kong-aired-mainland-china-organisers-say-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:52 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>'No other work': Syrian fuel smugglers risk their lives between front lines</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/the-observers/20251223-syria-front-lines-business-fuel-smuggling</link><description>Every morning, along the dusty roads of northeast Syria , convoys of motorcyclists speed by, jerricans of petrol and diesel strapped tightly to their bikes. These smugglers are the faces of a lucrative business that has thrived since the fall of Bashar al-Assad .

The smugglers buy fuel in the areas controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), where petrol and diesel are cheaper. They take it to zones controlled by the new Islamist government.

Most of the oilfields and oil wells in Syria are located in zones controlled by the SDF in the country's east. Meanwhile, the government has to purchase fuel at high prices from intermediaries in Kurdish-controlled regions.

Day Hafir, under SDF control, has become a key supply point for the smugglers, much like the neighbouring town of Maskana.

This is where the smugglers get their supplies. Both ordinary residents and organised traffickers then transport the fuel westward towards Manbij – some carrying just one or two jerrycans, others with small trucks piled high with tanks.

The smugglers unload when they reach their destination. They earn $10 for each jerrycan, a pittance considering the risks involved. The smugglers risk arrest at any moment by the government or the SDF. They also risk being shot at.

In November, a group of smugglers was shot at in Dayr Hafir. Several of them were injured. A pickup truck transporting barrels of fuel was also targeted in an attack that claimed the life of a 32-year-old man.

Our Observer Ali (pseudonym), who is based in the region, told our team:

“I have talked to several smugglers. They tell me that there's no other work. Smuggling is the only way they can make a living. They have no option but to risk their lives.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 12:46:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2174af00-df2f-11f0-95d8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/essence-syrie-2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian PM Albanese to invite Israeli President Herzog following anti-Semitic attack</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251223-australian-pm-albanese-to-invite-israeli-president-herzog-following-anti-semitic-attack</link><description>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Tuesday said his government would invite Israel 's president to visit, after a mass shooting in Sydney targeting the Jewish community.

Gunmen killed 15 people when they targeted a Hanukkah event on Bondi Beach , in what authorities have said was an anti-Semitic terrorist attack.

In the wake of the December 14 attack, Herzog called on Canberra to "fight against the enormous wave of anti-Semitism which is plaguing Australian society".

(Yes!) that followed a call to arms for the country, government sources said on Tuesday.

A source close to the matter said the Defence Staff issued official instructions about the tweak in recent weeks, in compliance with a presidential decree published on the official gazette in May that referred to the anthem's original version.

Before the latest change, the "Brothers of Italy" anthem concluded with: "We are ready to die, We are ready to die, Italy has called! Yes!"

News of the removal of the final word, which was not publicised by the government, was first reported by Il Fatto Quotidiano daily on Tuesday, and confirmed by sources in the defence ministry and the office of President Sergio Mattarella.

A presidential office source said the modification was not for any political reason but for the sake of purity, removing an addition to the original lyrics.

"Brothers of Italy", which is also the name of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's party, was penned by poet Goffredo Mameli in 1847, before Italy was unified.

While Mameli's lyrics did not include "Si", the word figures in the original musical score for the anthem, composed in the same year by Michele Novaro.

Reproductions of the original lyrics and score are posted on the government's website.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:23:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7PJGHIHDXJL2NN22XG6LP54QLY.jpg?auth=875f72c6dff34cd1c927b846b511750dbea6e4e023e4f6d3188d823b5b1441ab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Two men found guilty of UK plot to kill hundreds of Jews as IS fears grow</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/two-uk-men-found-guilty-over-terrorism-plot-against-jewish-community-2025-12-23/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Two men were found guilty on Tuesday of plotting to kill hundreds in an Islamic State-inspired gun rampage against the Jewish community in England, a planned attack investigators say demonstrates the resurgent risk posed by the militant group.

Police and prosecutors said Walid Saadaoui, 38, and Amar Hussein, 52, who went on trial a week after an unrelated deadly attack on a synagogue in the nearby northwest city of Manchester in October, were Islamic extremists who wanted to use automatic firearms to kill as many Jews as they could.

Had their plans come to fruition, it would have resulted in "one of, if not the, deadliest terrorist attack in UK history", said Assistant Chief Constable Robert Potts, in charge of Counter-Terrorism Policing in northwest England.

Their convictions come little more than a week after a mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach in which 15 people were killed .

Islamic State said the Australian attacks were a "source of pride". Although the jihadist group did not claim responsibility, its response has heightened fears of an increase in violent Islamist extremism.

While not posing the same threat of a decade ago when Islamic State controlled vast areas of Iraq and Syria, European security officials caution that IS and affiliated al Qaeda groups are once again looking to export violence abroad, radicalising would-be attackers online.

"You can see signs of some of those terrorism threats starting to grow again and starting to escalate," British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said last week.

British prosecutors told jurors that Saadaoui and Hussein had "embraced the views" of Islamic State and were prepared to risk their own lives in order to become "martyrs".

Saadaoui had arranged for two assault rifles, an automatic pistol and almost 200 rounds of ammunition to be smuggled into Britain through the port of Dover when he was arrested in May 2024, prosecutor Harpreet Sandhu said.

He added that Saadaoui planned to obtain two more rifles, another pistol and collect at least 900 rounds. Unbeknown to him, a man known as "Farouk" he was trying to get the weapons from was an undercover operative, which police said meant his plan never came close to being put into operation.

Sandhu said the assault rifles Saadaoui wanted were similar to those used in a 2015 Islamist militant attack on the Bataclan concert hall in Paris that killed 130 people. He added that Saadaoui "hero-worshipped" Abdelhamid Abaaoud, who coordinated that attack.

Saadaoui said in a message to "Farouk", whom he thought was a fellow militant, that the Paris attack was "the biggest operation after that of Osama (bin Laden)", an apparent reference to the September 11, 2001 attack on the United States.

"Based on Walid's communications and interactions with the undercover operative, and some of the things he said, that made it very clear that he regarded a less sophisticated attack with less lethal weaponry as not being good enough," Potts said.

"Because, in effect, it was his role and his duty to kill as many Jewish people as he could, and that wasn't going to be achieved via the use of a knife or, for example, potentially a vehicle as a weapon."

Both Saadaoui and Hussein had pleaded not guilty and Saadaoui said that he had played along with the plot out of fear for his life.

Hussein did not give evidence and barely attended his trial after he angrily shouted from the dock on the first day "how many babies?" in an apparent reference to Israel's war in Gaza.

They were convicted in Preston Crown Court on a single charge of preparing terrorist acts.

Walid Saadaoui's brother Bilel Saadaoui, 36, was found guilty of failing to disclose information about acts of terrorism but prosectors said he had been reluctant to join the attack.

The foiled plot is the latest in Britain and elsewhere inspired by Islamic State , which emerged in Iraq and Syria a decade ago and quickly created a "caliphate", declaring its rule over all Muslims and largely displacing al Qaeda.

At the height of its power from 2014-17, Islamic State held swathes of the two countries, ruling over millions of people and imposing a strict, brutal interpretation of Islamic sharia law.

Its fighters also carried out or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world, which were often claimed by Islamic State even without any actual connection.

The SITE Intelligence Group said in the wake of the Bondi Beach attack in Australia that IS had encouraged Muslims to take action elsewhere, particularly singling out Belgium.

A European intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said IS was flooding social media with propaganda and while this impacted only a handful of people, it meant there were more terrorism investigations than last year.

Ken McCallum, head of Britain's domestic spy agency MI5, said in October that his service and the police had thwarted 19 late-stage attack plots since the start of 2020, and intervened to counter many hundreds of other terrorism threats.

"Terrorism breeds in squalid corners of the internet where poisonous ideologies, of whatever sort, meet volatile, often chaotic individual lives," McCallum said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:23:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US 'not satisfied' with M23 withdrawal from Congo town, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-not-satisfied-with-m23-withdrawal-congo-town-official-says-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 14:24:31 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>US plans to impose tariffs on Chinese chips in mid-2027, USTR says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-impose-tariffs-chips-china-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Tuesday said it would slap tariffs on Chinese semiconductor imports starting in June, 2027 at a rate to be announced at least a month in advance.

Israel’s military said the men were involved in planning attacks against its forces and that two were members of Hezbollah’s air defence unit . It also alleged that one of those killed was serving concurrently in Lebanese army intelligence.

The Lebanese army later confirmed that Warrant Officer Ali Abdullah of the army's Support Brigade and Anti-Tank Regiment was killed when an Israeli air strike hit a vehicle near Sidon on Monday.

The Lebanese defence ministry said suggestions that army personnel were tied to political or armed groups were false, and Defence Minister Michel Menassa said such reports amounted to a “malicious attack” on the institution.

A Hezbollah official also denied to Reuters any link between the group and members of the Lebanese army.

Diplomatic efforts are continuing to try to shore up a fragile truce along the Israel–Lebanon border.

A U.S.-backed ceasefire agreed in November 2024 ended more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and required the disarmament of the Iran-aligned group, beginning in areas south of the river adjacent to Israel.

On Tuesday, the Lebanese army said it was nearing completion of the first phase of its plan and was carefully assessing and planning subsequent stages, taking into account all relevant conditions and developments.

Israel has repeatedly accused Hezbollah of attempting to rebuild military infrastructure in southern Lebanon, saying such activity violates understandings governing the Israel–Lebanon frontier.

A committee overseeing the Hezbollah–Israel truce said last week it was focusing on returning displaced civilians to their homes, amid concerns that tensions could flare if a year-end deadline to disarm Hezbollah is not met.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:22:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G6XXT7BLKVOIND6BNTS5ZUFXIA.jpg?auth=7a6bb98439b70ee73a48864f7f7a68ab07e142f3c563be8aa1d036227b59d5a9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he invited Kazakh, Uzbek leaders to G20 Summit next year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-says-he-invited-kazakh-uzbek-leaders-g20-summit-next-year-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he spoke with the presidents of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan and invited both leaders to the G20 summit next year in Miami, Florida.

"This is one of the emergency measures decided after the theft," the museum's deputy administrator Francis Steinbock told AFP.

Early in the morning, workers on the gallery balcony helped position a large grille hoisted by a crane to secure it to the gallery's tall French door windows.

"We had committed to doing it before the end of the year," Steinbock said, adding that discussions were ongoing regarding "securing the other windows".

Louvre director Laurence des Cars told lawmakers last week that a grille would be reinstalled "before Christmas", noting that one had been removed in 2003-2004 during restoration work on the Apollo Gallery.

The bars are the latest measure put in place in recent months as the security standards at the world's most visited museum in Paris are facing intense scrutiny following the October heist when thieves stole jewellery worth an estimated $102 million.

A police unit has been deployed at the museum, and a project for increased video surveillance is underway, Steinbock said.

Last week, the Louvre also announced the completion of anti-intrusion measures around the museum.

The October 19 robbery saw thieves park a truck with an extendable ladder below the Apollo Gallery housing the French crown jewels.

They clambered up, broke a window and used angle grinders to cut into glass display booths containing the treasures, which remain missing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 15:24:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b7790340-ade6-11f0-84e1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25292530722533.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lawsuit challenges Trump administration's ending of protections for South Sudanese migrants</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/lawsuit-challenges-trump-administrations-ending-protections-south-sudanese-2025-12-23/</link><description>BOSTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Immigrant rights advocates have filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's decision last month to end the temporary protections from deportation granted to more than 200 South Sudanese nationals.

Four migrants from South Sudan, along with the non-profit African Communities Together, alleged in a lawsuit , opens new tab filed in Boston federal court on Monday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was unlawfully putting them at risk of losing their temporary protected status after January 5.

That status, known as TPS, is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

The lawsuit argues the agency's action violated the statute governing the TPS program, ignored the dire humanitarian conditions that remain in South Sudan, and was motivated by discrimination against migrants who are not white in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment.

"This pattern reveals the administration’s true agenda: stripping protections from immigrant communities of color regardless of the dangers they face," Amaha Kassa, the executive director of African Communities Together, said in a statement.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

South Sudan has faced repeated bouts of violent conflict since 2011, with a civil war between 2013 and 2018 killing 400,000 people. The United States began designating South Sudan for TPS in 2011.

About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications for that same protection, according to the lawsuit.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on November 5, published a notice terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.

She did so after her department moved to similarly end temporary protections extended to foreign nationals from countries including Syria , Venezuela , Haiti , Cuba and Nicaragua, prompting several court challenges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V5LFT476Q5JZNOVS3BRLSKCPJI.jpg?auth=906441d727ca5b076d09678f31f26fc8b76d4ebee263c9ac6220173c19b7f55b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Five killed as Mexican plane carrying burned 2-year-old crashes off Texas coast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/five-killed-mexican-plane-carrying-burned-2-year-old-crashes-off-texas-coast-2025-12-23/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - At least five people, including a 2-year-old burn victim, died when a small Mexican Navy aircraft crashed on Monday off the Texas coast near Galveston during a humanitarian mission to transfer the child for treatment in the United States.

The Navy said that of the eight people on board the aircraft, two survived the crash and one was missing. The flight was carrying the child from the southern Mexican city of Merida.

President Claudia Sheinbaum said the child was among those killed, and that rescue workers were still searching for the missing person.

"My condolences to the relatives ... and those who were travelling in the aircraft," she said during her regular morning press conference. "There were medics, nurses, Navy personnel and relatives of the child."

The sheriff's office in Galveston did not immediately respond to a request for more information.

Local Mexican broadcaster N+ said the 2-year-old had suffered third-degree burns from a boiling water spill and that various hospitals around the family's home city of Escarcega had said they were not able to treat such a serious burn.

N+ reported that at a hospital in Merida, some 320 km (200 miles) away, the child's family was put in touch with the Michou y Mau Foundation, which assists Mexican children with severe burns.

In some cases, the charity takes severely burned children for treatment at a hospital in Galveston.

Sheinbaum said the crash would be investigated, adding her government was working closely with the U.S. to discover what happened during the 10 minutes in which the aircraft lost communication with ground personnel in Galveston.

"Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected," added U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Ronald Johnson.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Citing better cooperation, Montenegro lifts visas for Turkish citizens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/citing-better-cooperation-montenegro-lifts-visas-turkish-citizens-2025-12-23/</link><description>BELGRADE, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Montenegro on Tuesday revoked its decision to insist on visas for Turkish citizens and reintroduced a visa-free regime but for a shortened duration, citing improved cooperation with Turkish authorities.

Following violence triggered by the stabbing of a Montenegrin man in the capital Podgorica by a group of Turks, Montenegro in October suspended a regime that had allowed visa-free stays of up to 90 days for Turkish nationals.

"The material considered today states that cooperation with the Turkish authorities has been enhanced, alongside the implementation of strengthened security and migration checks," Montenegro's government said in a statement.

"The decision provides for a reduction of the permitted stay from 90 to 30 days, with a note that the visa regime may be reinstated in the event of an assessment of security risks."

The government said that by lifting visas for Turkish nationals it has aligned its policy with that of the European Union that it aims to join.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:30:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/INPHCA4KBFI4ZE6UK7253AP4FM.jpg?auth=9126561a2d21944e6a0a61c6d6a242d3c52e2702163827585853fd773c401dd6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>CSG will supply trucks to Slovak army under framework deal worth up to $1.2 billion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/csg-will-supply-trucks-slovak-army-under-framework-deal-worth-up-12-billion-2025-12-23/</link><description>PRAGUE, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Arms and ammunition maker Czechoslovak Group has signed a framework agreement with Slovakia's defence ministry to supply up to 1,289 military trucks in a deal worth potentially as much as 1.03 billion euros ($1.2 billion) over the coming years, CSG said on Tuesday.

The Czech-based company has been rapidly growing due mainly to increased demand for artillery shells and military equipment by Ukraine and European countries following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

It has also expanded its production of heavy military equipment and made acquisitions across Europe and the United States.

CSG, which said in September it was considering an initial public offering , said the contract with the Slovak defence ministry was for long-term supply of various types of trucks based on its Tatra Force platform.

In recent weeks, the company announced orders worth potentially billions of euros including making hulls for Leopard 2A8 tanks for their producer KNDS, a framework deal with the Slovak government for a large-calibre ammunition sales platform for European countries, and supplies of ammunition and 4,000 trucks to Asia.

The urgent public appeal charged that Tabari, a 67-year-old mother, was handed a death sentence in October following "a sham 10-minute trial , held remotely via videoconference without her chosen legal representation".

The letter, which was organised by a London-based association of families of victims called Justice for the Victims of the 1988 Massacre in Iran, said Tabari faced "execution solely for holding a banner bearing the words 'Woman, Resistance, Freedom'".

The banner was an apparent play on "Woman, Life, Freedom", a popular slogan during the 2022 nationwide protests sparked by the death in Iranian custody of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini .

There was no mention in Iranian official media about her case, nor confirmation that she had been sentenced to death.

Nonetheless, a group of eight independent United Nations rights experts also issued a statement Tuesday demanding Iran "immediately stop the execution" of Tabari, saying she had been found guilty of "baghi", or armed rebellion, based solely on the banner and an unpublished audio message.

"Ms. Tabari's case shows a pattern of serious violations of international human rights law regarding fair trial guarantees and the inappropriate use of capital punishment for broad and ill-defined national security offences," they said.

The experts, who are mandated by the UN Human Rights Council but do not speak on behalf of the world body, stressed that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified by Iran, restricts use of the death penalty to the "most serious crimes".

"This case involves no intentional killing and contains numerous procedural violations," they said, insisting that "to execute Tabari under these circumstances would constitute arbitrary execution".

Tuesday's joint appeal, signed by the former presidents of Switzerland and Ecuador, as well as the former prime ministers of Finland, Peru, Poland and Ukraine, charged that the case laid bare the "terror" faced by women for decades in Iran, which is "today the world's number one executioner of women per capita".

According to Norway-based Iran Human Rights (IHR), Iranian authorities have executed more than 40 women this year alone.

"In Iran, daring to hold a sign declaring women's resistance to oppression is now punishable by death," said Tuesday's letter, which was also signed by a slew of sitting judges, diplomats and current parliamentarians like US Republican Congresswoman Nancy Mace.

"We demand Zahra's immediate release, and we call on governments worldwide to stand with the women of Iran in their quest for democracy , equality, and freedom."

The appeal said Tabari stood accused of collaborating with the opposition organisation People's Mujahedin (PMOI, also known by the Persian acronym MEK), which is banned in Iran.

PMOI told AFP she was one of 18 activists who were currently on death row in Iran for their affiliation with the group.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:31:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4da927c-e016-11f0-a7f2-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/6fe1a747-fb66-4918-a9c2-13c4377c9545.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Louvre museum installs security bars on balcony used in October's heist</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/louvre-museum-installs-security-bars-balcony-used-octobers-heist-2025-12-23/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 23 (Reuters) - France's Louvre museum on Tuesday installed security bars on the balcony that burglars used to break in and steal some of the crown jewels.

Four people broke into the world's most visited museum on October 19 and escaped with jewels worth an estimated $102 million, exposing glaring security gaps and revealing its deteriorating state .

They parked a movers' lift outside the museum, jumped on the balcony of the Apollo gallery, smashed a window, cracked open display cases with angle grinders and fled on the back of scooters driven by accomplices in a heist lasting less than 7 minutes.

On Tuesday, a crane lifted the security grille into place to seal the glass door leading to the balcony.

"The Louvre is learning all the lessons from the theft of October 19 and is continuing its transformation and the strengthening of its security architecture," the museum said in a post on X.

It also said a mobile police squad was now present at the roundabout in front of the iconic glass pyramid, and 100 more cameras would be deployed around the museum next year.

Police have identified eight suspects in connection with the heist, though the jewels are still missing.

The break-in raised awkward questions about security at the Louvre, which is home to priceless artworks such as the Mona Lisa.

Louvre officials have admitted there was inadequate security camera coverage of the outside walls of the museum and no coverage of the balcony involved in the break-in.

The heist was one of several woes to hit the museum in recent weeks: another gallery, adjacent to the Apollo, was closed because of structural weakness , a water leak damaged books at the Egyptian antiquities department and the museum was partly closed for several days after its staff went on strike.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:54:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPXP5E4IMVNDTFATAPN7IRWDDI.jpg?auth=73244c65d1c1ff829be7c8e2c2b12b3d3a4600ff77724c6cb0d5400b2ed6976a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police drop probe into Bob Vylan comments about Israeli military</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-drop-probe-into-bob-vylan-comments-about-israeli-military-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:55:45 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Greta Thunberg released from custody after arrest at UK pro-Palestinian protest</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/greta-thunberg-released-custody-after-arrest-uk-pro-palestinian-protest-2025-12-23/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:55:47 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Palestinian farmers in West Bank face rising Israeli settler attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/the-observers/20251223-west-bank-palestinian-farmers-rising-israeli-settler-attacks</link><description>Palestinian villages in the West Bank are facing a surge in attacks by Israeli settlers. According to UN data, there were nearly 260 attacks against Palestinian homes, businesses and farms in October 2025 alone.

Agricultural lands – particularly olive groves – have become primary targets. These farms are the backbone of the local economy and a crucial source of income for many families. World Bank figures indicate that 74 percent of West Bank farmers have lost half of their income since 2023.

Israeli activists often join the farmers to provide what they call a “protective presence”. Yael Moav is one of them. She told the Observers team that these attacks aim to force Palestinians off their land. Moav says that Israeli authorities are supporting settlers and facilitating their presence in the West Bank.

We also spoke with a Palestinian olive farmer whose land is regularly targeted. He reports that settlers from a nearby outpost attack his farm on a weekly basis.

According to the Israeli human rights organisation Yesh Din, 94 percent of cases involving offences committed by Israelis against Palestinians are closed with no charges being filed.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 16:55:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/efd14ed2-dff0-11f0-9ea7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/vlcsnap-2025-12-22-17h58m24s736.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK police say comedian Russell Brand charged with two more sex offences</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-police-say-comedian-russell-brand-charged-with-two-more-sex-offences-2025-12-23/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - British police said on Tuesday that comedian Russell Brand had been charged with a new count of rape and another of sexual assault.

The U.S. Coast Guard this month intercepted the Skipper and Centuries tankers in the Caribbean Sea, both fully loaded with Venezuelan crude, and was this week pursuing a third empty vessel that was approaching the OPEC country's shore.

The actions targeting some vessels of a so-called "shadow fleet" of ships carrying sanctioned oil, coupled with President Donald Trump's announced blockade of all vessels subject to U.S. sanctions, has scared many ship owners away and left more than a dozen cargoes stuck in Venezuelan waters waiting to depart.

The emerging backlog, as PDVSA produces about 1.1 million barrels of crude per day, is quickly filling the company's onshore tanks, especially at the Jose terminal, which receives extra heavy oil from the country's main output region, the Orinoco Belt, according to the documents.

PDVSA began draining part of those inventories to oil tankers over the past weekend, shipping and company data showed, a strategy it has resorted to in past years to avoid cutting back oil production.

Since PDVSA's main joint-venture partner Chevron (CVX.N) , opens new tab has not suspended exports of the crude grades they jointly produce, most inventories at Venezuela's western region, where storage capacity is very limited, are close to normal levels, the documents showed.

Chevron, however, is responsible for only about a quarter of the crude grades produced at blending stations and upgraders in the Orinoco Belt, or about 130,000 bpd. PDVSA typically exports the three other quarters to China, which has been the destination of about 80% of Venezuela's crude exports this year.

As oil exports had stabilized and rose through November, PDVSA's onshore stocks at Jose, including crude and diluents, had reduced to some 9 million barrels last month from a peak of 17 million barrels earlier this year. But by mid-December they had again surpassed 10 million barrels, the documents showed.

PDVSA had been pushing customers to continue receiving oil cargoes bound for China at the Jose port through last week, but convincing them is now growing difficult after the U.S. targeted two more vessels over the weekend, company sources said.

Building floating storage has become necessary as the company negotiates price discounts and contract changes with some customers, while others begin to push to return their cargoes to the terminals, the sources added.

Last week, top officials at PDVSA discussed but then declined to declare force majeure over some crude exports, sources said, in an attempt to negotiate individually with its customers. Under force majeure, a seller frees itself from its delivery commitments for reasons out of its control set in contracts.

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday evening said oil cargo deliveries for Chevron to export would continue even amid the dispute with Washington, which is ratcheting up pressure on him to leave power.

"(Under) rain, thunder, or lightning, and regardless of any conflicts, the contract with Chevron will be fulfilled. We are serious, decent people," he said in a televised speech.

Chevron has repeatedly said that its operations in Venezuela "continue without disruption and in full compliance with laws and regulations applicable to its business."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:23:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OWS4RA5TSRNMHDVIFHCVRF56UQ.jpg?auth=526265c7c85d915f40dead2d211126bbbc7f9bad84e604dad8262968dee1705c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Justice Department releases card mentioning Trump, purportedly sent from Epstein to Nassar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/justice-department-releases-card-mentioning-trump-purportedly-sent-epstein-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department released an image on Tuesday of a card that makes a crude reference to President Donald Trump, purportedly written by convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to Larry Nassar, who is serving a life sentence for sexually abusing hundreds of girls.

Reuters could not determine whether the card is authentic.

The postmark on its envelope is Virginia, not New York where Epstein was jailed, and indicates the envelope was processed three days after his death in August 2019. The return address on the envelope misidentifies the jail where Epstein was being held and does not include his inmate number, which the Bureau of Prisons policy manual requires be included on outgoing mail.

The card features an image of a couple holding hands across a table and says in a handwritten note that "our president also shares our love of young, nubile girls." It was part of some 30,000 pages of documents released to the public on Tuesday.

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the card. There have been no allegations in the Justice Department disclosures of Epstein's files that Trump committed any crime.

Epstein's card also includes the message: "As you know by now, I have taken the 'short route' home," a possible allusion to suicide. Epstein was found dead in his cell on August 10, 2019. The Justice Department has said that he killed himself.

One of Nassar's former lawyers, Shannon Smith, declined to comment. Another former lawyer, Matthew Newburg, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The government obtained the handwritten card when it was returned to the federal detention center in New York as undeliverable after Epstein, an American financier with connections to prominent figures, had died in what authorities ruled a suicide. Another record the government released shows the FBI requested a handwriting analysis to determine whether it was written by Epstein; the results of that assessment, if one was conducted, were not immediately available.

The Justice Department said in a statement on X on Tuesday that "Some of these documents contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump that were submitted to the FBI right before the 2020 election. To be clear: the claims are unfounded and false." The statement did not detail which documents it was referring to.

The Associated Press reported in 2023 that a card had been returned to the New York jail addressed from Epstein to Nassar. It was found in the jail's mail room after Epstein died. It was unclear if the two men had any previous relationship.

Nassar, who served as Olympic gymnasts’ team doctor for 18 years, was sentenced in 2017 to 60 years in federal prison for possessing child sex abuse material, and in 2018 received two Michigan sentences totaling up to 300 years for molesting gymnasts under his care.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:23:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3BJFXCZULVNCRD3NTHAM4C4RAU.jpg?auth=4de3dc2fac4a26283796c1652d94ea1de73f6f0c991e8fedb8989a72a025de0f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Congo halts artisanal copper and cobalt processing amid corruption crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/congo-halts-artisanal-copper-cobalt-processing-amid-corruption-crackdown-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has suspended artisanal copper and cobalt mineral processing, according to a decree seen by Reuters, in an effort to improve transparency and prevent illegal exports, a pervasive problem in the mineral-rich nation.

Congo, the world's top cobalt supplier contributing around 70% of global output, has wrestled for decades with illegal, artisanal mining that diverts revenue away from the nation's coffers.

The decree, dated December 19 and signed by mines minister Louis Watum Kabamba, orders all entities that process and market artisanal copper and cobalt to suspend operations and certify the origin of minerals used.

A commission would be set up to carry out compliance and to verify the traceability and legality of supplies, the document said.

Reuters could not determine the likely impact on illegal exports and Congo's government had no figures.

“This suspension will be an opportunity to identify the flow and volume of minerals processed by the processing units," a source at the president's office said.

LICOCO, a Congolese nongovernmental group that aims to fight corruption in the sector said many entities operating illegally paid bribes to obtain their permits to circumvent the requirements laid out in the mining code.

Congo launched its first batch of traceable artisanal cobalt in November to clean up the supply chain and align production with international environmental, social and governance standards.

Artisanal mining is a lifeline for many in Congo, employing an estimated 1.5 million to 2 million people and supporting more than 10 million people indirectly.

But unregulated output is difficult to track, risks being confiscated by the government and pushes up the price of ethically produced, traceable cobalt.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:23:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6XYNH4KZLJL57ELMBC57XQ5LNE.jpg?auth=e34016f452dba593f529aaf118b4c1b14c61c1b567057baa44b73b55394029dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian troops withdraw from eastern town of Siversk</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-troops-withdraw-eastern-town-siversk-2025-12-23/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Ukrainian forces have pulled out of the embattled eastern town of Siversk, Kyiv's military said on Tuesday, as Russian troops wage a battlefield offensive aimed at threatening key cities critical to Ukraine's defences in the east .

The fall of Siversk comes with Ukraine under U.S. pressure to quickly negotiate peace in the nearly four-year-old war triggered by Russia's invasion, and puts Russian forces closer to the hub of Sloviansk, some 30 km (20 miles) to the west.

Sloviansk is a northern anchor of the so-called "fortress belt" of cities in Ukraine's heavily industrialised Donbas region, which Russia has demanded Kyiv cede before it ends its war.

"The invaders were able to advance due to a significant numerical advantage and constant pressure from small assault groups in difficult weather conditions," Ukraine's General Staff said in a statement.

It said it had withdrawn soldiers to preserve lives and resources, adding that they had, however, inflicted heavy losses on the enemy.

Russia said earlier this month it had captured Siversk, whose pre-war population was around 10,000, a claim Kyiv had denied.

On Tuesday, Ukraine's military said its forces were keeping up pressure on the town and would continue trying to sever logistics for Russian troops inside.

Ukrainian open-source group Deep State showed Russia had made gradual gains around Siversk this month, part of its grinding advances along the sprawling front line.

Fighting is still raging around the former eastern logistics hub of Pokrovsk, where Ukrainian forces said this month they had fended off an unusually large Russian mechanised attack.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 17:44:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela passes law against piracy, blockades amid US oil ship seizures</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/venezuela-passes-law-against-piracy-blockades-amid-us-oil-ship-seizures-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Venezuela's ruling-party controlled National Assembly unanimously approved a law on Tuesday that allows prison sentences of up to 20 years for anyone who promotes or finances what it describes as piracy or blockades.

The law, which includes "other international crimes", comes after recent U.S. actions against Venezuelan oil shipments.

The U.S. Coast Guard seized a sanctioned supertanker carrying Venezuelan crude earlier this month and attempted to intercept two other vessels linked to Venezuela over the weekend, U.S. officials said.

The interceptions mark Washington's toughest blow to state oil company PDVSA since its Treasury Department sanctioned the oil company's former trading partners, two subsidiaries of Russia's Rosneft, in 2020, forcing it to cut production and exports. PDVSA was already under sanctions since 2019.

The draft "Law to Guarantee Freedom of Navigation and Commerce Against Piracy, Blockades, and Other International Illicit Acts" was introduced on Monday by pro-government lawmaker Giuseppe Alessandrello.

National Assembly President Jorge Rodriguez said at the end of the session the bill will be sent to the executive for approval and will take effect once published in the Official Gazette.

Washington has increased pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro in recent months, including stepping up a military build-up in the Caribbean and killing dozens of people in strikes on boats it says, without providing evidence, are trafficking drugs off its coasts.

U.S. authorities say the operations are part of efforts to combat sanctions evasion and drug trafficking.

Maduro says the United States is seeking to undermine Venezuela's economy and remove him from power.

Rodriguez also blasted Venezuela's political opposition, whose leader has been in hiding for months but traveled to Oslo earlier December to collect her Nobel Peace Prize.

He accused the opposition of promoting sanctions and said they "stole, plundered, bowed down to U.S. imperialism," adding that "they are happy with the aggressive actions currently taking place in the Caribbean Sea."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 18:33:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W33SN53HZFOKPGMUOROEBZABWA.jpg?auth=a89a07855e3ad9289669e3ff8bf1b104d16aad4fc5fcf6e92cc05022e701418e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What makes a hit song?

Worse, most listeners can't tell the difference from the real thing. With computers borrowing from real musicians for their inspiration, we weigh the implications. If humans are going to continue to rule artistic creation, then our panel needs to answer one simple question: what makes a hit song?

Sometimes it's a gorgeous melody and a brilliant arrangement; sometimes it's an annoyingly easy-to-remember "brain worm" that will stay in your head long after you wish it had departed.

Either way, what makes a song special?

The two countries held five rounds of nuclear talks prior to a 12-day war between Iran and Israel in June, which Washington joined by striking Iranian nuclear sites.

The talks faced major stumbling blocks, notably over uranium enrichment on Iranian soil — a practice Western powers want eliminated to minimize the risk of weaponization, but which Tehran has firmly rejected.

"The United States remains available for formal talks with Iran, but only if Tehran is prepared for direct and meaningful dialogue," Trump's deputy Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus told the Security Council on Tuesday.

"We have been clear, however, about certain expectations for any arrangement. Foremost, there can be no enrichment inside of Iran, and that remains our principle," Ortagus said.

Iran's U.N. Ambassador Amir Saeid Iravani told the meeting the U.S. was not pursuing fair negotiation by insisting on a zero enrichment policy.

"We appreciate any fair and meaningful negotiation, but insisting on zero enrichment policy, it is contrary to our rights as a member of the NPT, and it means that they are not pursuing the fair negotiation," he said, referring to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

"They want to dictate their predetermined intention on Iran. Iran will not bow down to any pressure and intimidation."

The United Nations reinstated an arms embargo and other sanctions on Iran over its nuclear program in late September, following a process - known as snapback - triggered by European powers. Russia and China disputed the move.

Britain, France and Germany initiated the snapback process at the Security Council over accusations Iran had violated a 2015 deal aimed at stopping it from developing a nuclear bomb.

Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons and says its motives are peaceful.

The 2015 nuclear deal is enshrined in a Security Council resolution adopted the same year. The 15-member council has met twice a year since then to discuss implementation of the resolution.

Britain, France, the United States, Denmark, Greece, Slovenia and South Korea requested Tuesday’s briefing. But Russia and China argue that all the provisions in the resolution expired on October 18 and on Tuesday objected to the meeting being held, though it proceeded as planned.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:24:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AZKZMOI3LZAL7PRIWOY5JR3HXA.JPG?auth=6f381da2374514ac7637dfe9d51b01623e67b24070c4cf548e471731ad9fdf8e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo expresses 'much sadness' about Russia refusing Christmas ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/pope-leo-expresses-much-sadness-about-russia-refusing-christmas-ceasefire-2025-12-23/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Pope Leo said on Tuesday that he feels "much sadness" that Russia did not agree to a Christmas ceasefire in its nearly four-year old war with Ukraine.

Bolsonaro is currently serving a 27-year sentence after being convicted of plotting a coup to remain in power following his 2022 re-election loss.

His request was for transfer to a hospital on Wednesday, then surgery on Christmas Day, Thursday.

The approval by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw Bolsonaro's trial , comes after an expert review last week stated that the operation was medically necessary.

The far-right leader has faced repeated health issues since being stabbed in the stomach during the 2018 presidential campaign.

His latest problem is an inguinal hernia, a protrusion in the groin area due to a tear in the abdominal muscles.

The operation is scheduled to be completed at the DF Star, a private clinic in Brazil's capital where Bolsonaro underwent another surgery in April.

The ex-president has been detained since November at federal police headquarters in Brasilia.

In office from 2019 to 2022, he was sentenced by the Supreme Court in September to prison after being found guilty of having led a scheme to prevent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva from taking office.

He has maintained his innocence, declaring he was a victim of political persecution.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 20:26:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d80e0e1c-e030-11f0-816a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T152216Z-613812178-RC2V1HAEN3OD-RTRMADP-3-BRAZIL-BOLSONARO.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Libyan army chief of staff found dead in plain wreckage, PM says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251223-libyan-army-chief-of-staff-found-dead-in-plain-wreckage-pm-says</link><description>Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah has confirmed the death of Libyan military chief Muhammad Ali Ahmad al-Haddad and four others in a plane crash in Turkey on Tuesday evening.

Officials in Libya said contact with the plane was completely lost about half an hour into the flight because of a technical malfunction.

Al-Hadad was the top military commander in western Libya.

The justices denied the Justice Department's request to lift a judge's order that has blocked the deployment of hundreds of National Guard personnel in a legal challenge brought by Illinois state officials and local leaders. The department had asked to allow the deployment while the litigation plays out.

The National Guard serves as state-based militia forces that answer to state governors except when called into federal service by the president.

Trump ordered troops to Chicago, the third-largest U.S. city, and to Portland, Oregon, following his earlier deployments to Los Angeles, Memphis and Washington, D.C.

The case has been characterized by starkly different portrayals of the protests against Trump's aggressive immigration enforcement in and around Chicago.

Trump and his allies have described Democratic-led cities as lawless, crime-ravaged and plagued with vast, violent protests. His administration has said troops are needed to protect federal property and personnel.

Democratic mayors and governors, along with other Trump critics, have said these claims are a false account of the situation and a pretext for sending troops, accusing Trump of abusing his power.

Federal judges have expressed skepticism over the administration's dire view of protests that local law enforcement officials have called limited in size, largely peaceful and manageable by their own forces - far from the "war zone" conditions described by Trump.

Trump has relied on a law that lets a president deploy state National Guard troops to suppress a rebellion, repel an invasion or if he is "unable with the regular forces to execute the laws of the United States."

Illinois and Chicago sued after the administration federalized 300 Illinois National Guard troops and also ordered Texas National Guard troops into the state, calling the actions unlawful. Officials have since announced the administration was sending home hundreds of National Guard troops who were dispatched to Portland from California, and to Chicago from Texas.

Chicago-based U.S. District Judge April Perry temporarily blocked the move on October 9, finding that the claims of violence during protests at an immigration facility in the Chicago suburb of Broadview, Illinois, where a small group of demonstrators had gathered daily for weeks, were unreliable.

Perry, an appointee of Democratic former President Joe Biden, found that there was no evidence of rebellion or that the law was not being enforced, faulting officials for "equating protests with riots and a lack of appreciation for the wide spectrum that exists between citizens who are observing, questioning and criticizing their government, and those who are obstructing, assaulting or doing violence."

A National Guard deployment would "only add fuel to the fire," Perry said.

A three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals declined to lift Perry's order blocking the deployment, concluding that "the facts do not justify the president's actions in Illinois." Two of the three judges were appointed by Republican presidents, including one by Trump.

The Justice Department told the Supreme Court that the assessment by local officials of the protests was "implausibly rosy," and that federal agents "have been forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence."

Lawyers for Illinois and Chicago told the justices that the local protests have "never hindered the continued operation" of the Broadview facility, and that state and local authorities have responded to every request for assistance and contained any sporadic disruption.

Officials from Portland and Oregon are pursuing a separate legal challenge to Trump's planned deployment to that city. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, permanently blocked that deployment in a November 7 ruling. The administration has appealed that ruling.

The Supreme Court in October asked the administration as well as Illinois and Chicago to provide written arguments over how to interpret the words "regular forces" in the law at issue in the case.

In an October 10 written ruling, Perry said that historical sources indicate that "regular forces" means only members regularly enlisted in the military, including the Army and Navy, as opposed to the National Guard.

Trump's administration "made no attempt to rely on the regular forces before resorting to federalization of the National Guard," Perry said, adding that there are other limits on the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes.

The administration repeatedly has sought the Supreme Court's intervention to allow implementation of Trump policies impeded by lower courts. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has sided with the administration in almost every case that it has been called upon to review since Trump returned to the presidency in January.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:20:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/34IAUOV6CZJQ5AKIEHSAXEWU5A.jpg?auth=c8d46cd0d2aabb164bd5dd85e092e1761aca240d542692fbf6da90d4b7dfc9d9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Libya says its army chief dies in plane crash in Turkey</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/signal-lost-with-jet-believed-be-carrying-libyan-army-chief-over-ankara-media-2025-12-23/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The Libyan army's chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, died in a plane crash on Tuesday after leaving Turkey's capital Ankara, the prime minister of Libya's internationally recognised government said, adding that four others were on the jet as well.

"This followed a tragic and painful incident while they were returning from an official trip from the Turkish city of Ankara. This grave loss is a great loss for the nation, for the military institution, and for all the people," Libyan Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah said in a statement.

He said the commander of Libya's ground forces, the director of its military manufacturing authority, an adviser to the chief of staff, and a photographer from the chief of staff's office were also on the aircraft.

Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on social media platform X that the plane had taken off from Ankara's Esenboga Airport at 1710 GMT en route to Tripoli, and that radio contact was lost at 1752 GMT. He said authorities found the plane's wreckage near the Kesikkavak village in Ankara's Haymana district.

He added that the Dassault Falcon 50-type jet had made a request for an emergency landing while over Haymana, but that no contact was established.

The cause of the crash was not immediately clear.

Turkey's defence ministry had announced Haddad's visit earlier, saying he had met with Turkish Defence Minister Yasar Guler and Turkish counterpart Selcuk Bayraktaroglu, along with other Turkish military commanders.

The crash occurred a day after Turkey's parliament passed a decision to extend the mandate of Turkish soldiers' deployment in Libya by two more years.

NATO member Turkey has militarily and politically supported Libya's Tripoli-based, internationally recognised government. In 2020, it sent military personnel there to train and support its government and later reached a maritime demarcation accord, which has been disputed by Egypt and Greece.

In 2022, Ankara and Tripoli also signed a preliminary accord on energy exploration, which Egypt and Greece also oppose.

However, Turkey has recently switched course under its "One Libya" policy, ramping up contacts with Libya's eastern faction as well.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:20:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KUALE6CVFJL5PNKLWOSVYFNIFQ.jpg?auth=5b939b23ec88c7154b1ed38959af4d1c5910f1740e8d96bd664b4850a8537164&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo 'disappointed' in Illinois governor over assisted dying law</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-disappointed-illinois-governor-over-assisted-dying-law-2025-12-23/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Pope Leo on Tuesday criticized the governor of the U.S. state of Illinois for signing a bill to allow some adults with a terminal illness to end their own lives with medical help, in an unusual political intervention by the church leader.

Leo, the first U.S. pope, told journalists outside his residence in Castel Gandolfo, Italy, that he was "very disappointed" in Governor JB Pritzker for signing the measure.

"Unfortunately ... he decided to sign that bill," said the pope, responding to a question about the measure. "I'm very disappointed about that."

Leo, originally from Chicago, met at the Vatican with Pritzker last month and said he "very explicitly" spoke with the governor about the bill.

The pope, leader of the world's 1.4 billion Catholics, usually refrains from commenting on local political issues.

The Illinois bill, which takes effect next September, gives terminally ill adults with a prognosis of six months or less the option to request a medical prescription to end their lives.

The Catholic Church teaches that life is sacred from conception until natural death. It opposes abortion, capital punishment and assisted dying measures.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:20:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UXG66ZKBBRIPHC6UE7VL4VYWYI.jpg?auth=8a59c552ab07b89882d18afe2b6b4948da3ceb332444fb4581743b348e1f89f1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Florida Catholic bishops urge Trump to halt immigration enforcement until after holidays</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/florida-catholic-bishops-urge-trump-halt-immigration-enforcement-until-after-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Florida's Catholic bishops are calling on U.S. President Donald Trump to halt immigration enforcement activities until after the Christmas holidays.

"Such a pause would show a decent regard for the humanity of these families. Now is not the time to be callous toward the suffering caused by immigration enforcement," the bishops wrote on Monday to Trump and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis.

In response, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said on Tuesday, "President Trump was elected based on his promise to the American people to deport criminal illegal aliens. And he’s keeping that promise."

A spokesperson for DeSantis did not immediately comment.

Trump has carried out an aggressive immigration campaign over the last year, apprehending and deporting migrants who he says are dangerous criminals.

His administration has also rescinded policy that limited immigration arrests near sensitive locations, including churches, hospitals and schools, and deployed federal agents across the U.S. to ramp up such arrests.

While the administration insists it is targeting criminals, government data shows that it has been arresting more people who have not been charged with any crimes beyond their alleged immigration violations than previous administrations.

Despite signs the public is questioning the crackdown, the administration is planning to expand it in the new year.

The appeal by the Florida bishops comes more than a month after the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a rare condemnation of the Trump administration immigration crackdown and advocated for "meaningful immigration reform." And in October Pope Leo decried mistreatment of immigrants.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 21:20:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U4XDV6RH5BK2DCJ2SZ7AZA7WGI.jpg?auth=cb51c3f70ee1fa81f26d5e7600ed59ec71514a63d9799203e5edc915f7e33d75&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US tells UN it will deprive Venezuela's Maduro, drug cartel of resources</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-tells-un-it-will-deprive-venezuelas-maduro-drug-cartel-of-resources-2025-12-23/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The United States told the United Nations on Tuesday it will impose and enforce sanctions "to the maximum extent" to deprive Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro of resources as Russia warned other Latin American countries could be next.

U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has for months waged a campaign of against suspected drug trafficking boats off the Venezuelan coast and the Pacific coast of Latin America. He has threatened strikes on Venezuelan land.

"The single most serious threat to this hemisphere, our very own neighborhood and the United States, is from transnational terrorist and criminal groups," U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz told the U.N. Security Council.

The U.S. has ramped up its military presence in the region and Trump announced a blockade of all vessels subject to U.S. sanctions. So far this month, the U.S. Coast Guard has intercepted two tankers in the Caribbean Sea, both fully loaded with Venezuelan crude. The Coast Guard is also pursuing a third empty vessel that was approaching the OPEC country's shore.

"The reality of the situation is that sanctioned oil tankers operate as the primary economic lifeline for Maduro and his illegitimate regime. The sanctioned tankers also fund the narco-terrorist group Cartel de Los Soles," Waltz said.

Washington designated Cartel de los Soles, or Cartel of the Suns, as a foreign terrorist organization late last month for the group's alleged role in importing illegal drugs into the U.S. It accuses Maduro of leading Cartel de los Soles. Venezuela's government rejected what it called a "ridiculous" move to designate the "non-existent" group.

"This intervention which is unfolding can become a template for future acts of force against Latin American states," Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the Security Council, citing a recent strategy document from Trump that said the U.S. will reassert its dominance in the Western Hemisphere.

Waltz spoke after Nebenzia and did not directly respond to his remark.

China urged the United States to “immediately halt relevant actions and avoid further escalation of tensions,” China’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Sun Lei told the council.

Venezuela, backed by Russia and China, requested Tuesday's meeting, the second held on the escalating tensions. The Security Council first met in October, when the United States justified its actions as consistent with Article 51 of the founding U.N. Charter, which requires the Security Council to be immediately informed of any action states take in self-defense against armed attack.

"Let it be clear once and for all that there is no war in the Caribbean, there is no international armed conflict, nor is there a non-international one, which is why it is absurd for the U.S. government to seek to justify its actions by applying the rules of war," Venezuela's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Moncada told the council.

"The threat is not Venezuela The threat is the U.S. government," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:20:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AERLROFCTRMB3CJETBGZSCMW5U.jpg?auth=296e73d757da7e942b0018ee2d271d62b87a6ca2687fa7070dd7429615aec129&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion rips through Pennsylvania nursing home</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/explosion-rips-through-pennsylvania-nursing-home-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - An apparent gas explosion caused major damage to a nursing home outside Philadelphia on Tuesday, sending emergency crews to conduct search-and-rescue operations, according to officials and local media reports.

No official information on possible casualties was immediately available.

The Bucks County emergency dispatch center received a report of an explosion with injuries at the Silver Lake Nursing home in Bristol Township, about 21 miles northeast of Philadelphia, shortly after 2 p.m. EST, a county spokesperson said.

"A portion of the building is reported to have collapsed," the spokesperson, Jim O'Malley, said in an email message, adding that emergency personnel from numerous agencies were dispatched.

Video footage posted by a nearby police department showed numerous emergency and law enforcement vehicles converging in the area with lights flashing.

Channel2 Now reported that first-response personnel arriving on the scene found significant structural damage to the facility, prompting immediate search-and-rescue operations for residents and staff.

The news outlet cited authorities as saying that about 15 nursing home patients were initially accounted for outside the building, while "multiple others remained unaccounted for."

It said rescue teams reported "numerous individuals trapped beneath debris on the second floor, as well as additional victims trapped in the basement area."

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro posted a message on his social media account saying he had been briefed on the incident and that "the scene is still active."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:20:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France probes cyberattack on postal service claimed by pro-Russian hackers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251223-france-probes-cyberattack-on-postal-service-claimed-by-pro-russian-hackers</link><description>France 's DGSI counter-espionage agency on Tuesday took over a probe into a cyberattack on the national postal service after a pro-Russian group of hackers claimed responsibility, prosecutors said.

The attack, which began on Monday, disrupted several of La Poste's online services – including consumer banking and tracking registered mail – during the busy Christmas week.

La Poste said it was still delivering parcels and letters, but that, while things had improved slightly on Tuesday, "the situation remains unstable".

The cyberattack was claimed by Noname057(16), a pro-Russian group of hackers that has previously targeted Ukrainian media websites and government and corporate websites in countries including Poland, Sweden and Germany.

The Paris prosecutors' office told AFP that La Poste had made a criminal complaint, and the DGSI – the General Directorate for Internal Security – was called in to lead the investigation after the hacker group's claim.

The probe, "at this stage", is looking into the crime of a data service's functioning being deliberately disrupted, the office said.

Early Tuesday, when questioned about the cyberattack, French Economy Minister Roland Lescure told the BFMTV/RMC news outlet that "the priority of all priorities" was to make sure that parcels were delivered in time for Christmas .

Noname 57(16) emerged in 2022, the year that Russia launched its all-out invasion of Ukraine.

Experts say that its activities appear to be designed to support pro-Russian information warfare. They say the group appears to be a loose organisation of hacktivists.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:20:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/db208bb8-df4d-11f0-8e1e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25356472268811.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudan's prime minister takes his peace plan to the UN</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/eye-on-africa/20251223-sudan-s-prime-minister-takes-his-peace-plan-to-the-un</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:21:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b1bc3a82-e043-11f0-9024-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/ANGL251223-2144-Live-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge tosses Trump challenge to New York immigration-related law</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-judge-tosses-trump-challenge-new-york-immigration-related-law-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit the U.S. Department of Justice filed challenging a New York law that President Donald Trump's administration said was impeding immigration enforcement.

U.S. District Judge Anne Nardacci in Albany rejected , opens new tab the Justice Department's arguments a New York law that bars the Democratic-led state from sharing vehicle and address information with federal immigration authorities violated the U.S. Constitution.

The Justice Department declined to comment.

U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi announced the lawsuit at a press conference in February as part of a legal campaign the Republican president's administration has waged over laws adopted by so-called "sanctuary jurisdictions" run by Democrats.

The lawsuit took aim at a state law known as the Driver’s License Access and Privacy Act, or the "Green Light Law," which the state enacted in 2019.

That law directed the state's Department of Motor Vehicles to accept various foreign documents as proof of identification and age for standard licenses and barred the state agency from inquiring about the immigration status of applicants.

The Justice Department under Trump alleged the law was impeding its ability to address a "crisis of illegal immigration" and argued the law interfered with the enforcement of federal immigration laws in New York.

It argued the federal immigration law preempted the state law and that New York's law impermissibly regulates the federal government in violation of the U.S. Constitution. The Justice Department asked the judge to block its enforcement.

But Nardacci, who was appointed by Democratic former President Joe Biden, said the administration had failed to plausibly allege the law ran afoul of the Constitution.

She said the administration could point to no federal statute requiring New York to provide DMV information for standard license applicants to federal immigration authorities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:44:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RRUJCGGUFVLYVN5G5VVFZBOWLY.jpg?auth=74920569f7f2a8c82ae492a51b7d9e5b9c6488fc830da8b04b8c71b8524be1d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Loaded supertanker returns to Venezuelan waters amid US interceptions, TankerTrackers.com says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/loaded-supertanker-returns-venezuelan-waters-amid-us-interceptions-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 23 (Reuters) - Panama-flagged very large crude carrier Kelly, which had departed from Venezuela carrying oil last week, has returned to Venezuelan waters following the U.S. interception of more tankers, monitoring service TankerTrackers.com said on Tuesday.

The U.S. Coast Guard on Saturday intercepted the Panama-flagged tanker Centuries, which was carrying some 1.9 million barrels of Venezuelan Merey heavy crude, and is pursuing a separate empty vessel that was on its way to the OPEC country.

Centuries and Kelly departed almost together escorted by Venezuelan navy ships last week, sources said. Kelly is now back fully loaded in Venezuelan waters near state-run oil company PDVSA's Amuay port, TankerTrackers.com said.

More than a dozen loaded vessels are in Venezuela waiting for new directions from their owners after the U.S. seized the supertanker Skipper earlier this month and targeted two additional vessels on the weekend.

U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced a "blockade" of all vessels under sanctions entering or departing from Venezuela in a move to ramp up pressure over Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

Guyana's maritime authority said this month that at least one of the ships was flying a false Guyanese flag . Panama's foreign affairs minister said this week that some U.S.-targeted tankers did not follow the country's maritime rules.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:44:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope calls for Christmas Day truce, laments Russia’s rejection</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251223-pope-calls-for-christmas-day-truce-laments-russia-rejection</link><description>Pope Leo XIV on Tuesday called for a global truce on Christmas Day, expressing “great sadness” that “apparently Russia rejected a request” for one.

“I am renewing my request to all people of good will to respect a day of peace — at least on the feast of the birth of our Saviour,” Leo told reporters at his residence in Castel Gandolfo near Rome .

Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 and has repeatedly rejected calls for a ceasefire, saying it would only give a military advantage to Ukraine.

“Among the things that cause me great sadness is the fact that Russia has apparently rejected a request for a truce ,” the pope said.

Referring to conflicts in general, Leo added: “I hope they will listen and there will be 24 hours of peace in the whole world.”

Ukraine on Tuesday pulled troops out of a town in the east of the country after fierce battles with Russian forces, as relentless strikes by Moscow killed three civilians and cut power to thousands in freezing winter temperatures.

There was no sign of an imminent breakthrough after top negotiators from both Russia and Ukraine were in Miami last weekend for separate meetings with US officials seeking a deal to end almost four years of fighting.

Pope Leo met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky earlier this month.

Asked whether he would accept Zelensky’s invitation to visit Ukraine, Leo later said, “I hope so,” but cautioned that it was not possible to say when such a trip might take place.

He also said that seeking peace in Ukraine without European diplomatic involvement was “unrealistic” and warned that US President Donald Trump ’s proposed peace plan risked a “huge change” in the transatlantic alliance.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 22:45:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/dec68016-d4e8-11f0-842b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-09T101535Z-778331222-RC2VCIAROZZS-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-POPE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian state passes tougher gun, anti-terror laws after Bondi Beach shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australian-state-passes-tougher-gun-anti-terror-laws-after-bondi-beach-shooting-2025-12-23/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state on Wednesday passed sweeping new gun and anti-terror laws following the recent mass shooting on Bondi Beach, tightening firearm ownership, banning public display of terrorist symbols and strengthening police power to curb protests.

The New South Wales state parliament passed the terrorism and other legislation amendment bill early morning after the upper house approved the bill by 18 votes to eight.

The bill passed the lower house on Tuesday with support from the governing centre-left Labor and the opposition Liberal party. The rural-focused National Party, the Liberal's junior coalition partner, opposed the gun reforms arguing the ownership caps would unfairly disadvantage farmers.

The legislation follows the December 14 shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach, where 15 people were killed and dozens wounded. The gun attack, Australia's deadliest in almost three decades, prompted calls for stricter gun laws and tougher action against antisemitism.

Under the new laws, most individual gun licences will be capped at four firearms, while farmers will be permitted to own up to 10 guns.

Police will be granted more powers to impose restrictions on public protests for up to three months following a declared terror attack, while public display of symbols of prohibited terror organisations will be banned.

"Globalise the intifada", a chant usually heard during pro-Palestine protests, will also be banned after the government argued it encourages violence in the community.

Police believe the two alleged gunmen were inspired by the militant Sunni Muslim group Islamic State. Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead by police, while his 24-year-old son Naveed has been charged with 59 offences, including murder and terrorism.

Activist groups have condemned the law and signalled plans for a constitutional challenge.

In a statement, the Palestine Action Group, Jews Against the Occupation and the First Nations-led Blak Caucus said it would file a legal challenge against what they described as "draconian anti-protest laws" rushed through the state parliament.

"It is clear that the (state) government is exploiting the horrific Bondi attack to advance a political agenda that suppresses political dissent and criticism of Israel, and curtails democratic freedoms," the groups said.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has also vowed a crackdown on hate speech, with his centre-left federal government planning to introduce legislation to make it easier to prosecute those promoting hatred and violence, and to cancel or deny visas to people involved in hate speech.

Facing criticism that his government has not done enough to curb antisemitism, Albanese said he spoke with Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Tuesday and invited him to make an official visit to Australia as soon as possible.</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 23:20:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7NKYJ53VY5MOFGVQYHK3BFT24I.jpg?auth=d30b9be2abfb9df0bc2a9961cd89a6bf127281ce76a2a67fc88c4dc7bca3f498&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US targets former EU commissioner, activists with visa bans over alleged censorship</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-targets-former-eu-commissioner-activists-with-visa-bans-over-alleged-2025-12-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 - The Trump administration on Tuesday imposed visa bans on a former European Union commissioner and anti-disinformation campaigners it says were involved in censoring U.S. social media platforms, in the latest move in a campaign aimed at European rules that U.S. officials say go beyond legitimate regulation.

Trump officials have ordered U.S. diplomats to build opposition to the European Union's landmark Digital Services Act (DSA), which is intended to combat hateful speech, misinformation and disinformation, but which Washington says stifles free speech and imposes costs on U.S. tech companies.

The visa bans come after the administration's National Security Strategy this month said European leaders were censoring free speech and suppressing opposition to immigration policies that it said risk "civilisational erasure" for the continent.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the five people targeted with visa bans "have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to censor, demonetize, and suppress American viewpoints they oppose."

"These radical activists and weaponized NGOs have advanced censorship crackdowns by foreign states -- in each case targeting American speakers and American companies," Rubio said in an announcement.

Rubio did not name those targeted, but Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers identified them on X, accusing the individuals of "fomenting censorship of American speech."

The most high-profile target was French former business executive Thierry Breton, who served as the European commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024. Rogers called Breton "a mastermind" of the DSA and said he once threatened Trump ally and X owner Elon Musk ahead of an interview Musk conducted with Trump. Reuters was unable to immediately reach Breton for comment.

Reuters reported in August that U.S. officials were considering sanctions on officials responsible for the DSA.

The visa bans also hit Imran Ahmed, the British CEO of the U.S.-based Center for Countering Digital Hate; and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of the German nonprofit HateAid; and Clare Melford, co-founder of the Global Disinformation Index, Rogers said. The organizations did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

Melford, a former management consultant and TV executive, said in a video posted online in 2024 that she co-founded the Global Disinformation Index “to try to break the business model of harmful online content” by reviewing online news websites to allow advertisers to "choose whether or not they want to fund content that is polarizing and divisive and harmful, or whether they want to steer their advertising back towards more quality journalism.”

Rogers said Melford falsely labeled online comments as hate speech or disinformation and used U.S. taxpayers' money to "exhort censorship and blacklisting of American speech and press."</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 23:21:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3TYKGHJ5N5PSVEN2OXHN4IPSHU.jpg?auth=ff0ce3dbb8ae1650712d4249b0228b36bed8967d76c347d85d5daa541a692fff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine withdraws troops from eastern town amid deadly Russian strikes</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251223-ukraine-withdraws-troops-deadly-russian-strikes</link><description>Ukraine pulled out troops from a town in the east after fierce battles, it said on Tuesday, as relentless Russian strikes killed three civilians and cut power to thousands in freezing winter temperatures.

Kyiv said it had withdrawn forces from Siversk, a town in the heavily embattled Donetsk region on the route to two of Ukraine’s last remaining strongholds in the area. Russia announced the capture of Siversk almost two weeks ago.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the pre-Christmas strikes showed that the Kremlin had no intention of ending the invasion it launched in February 2022.

The attacks came two days after US-mediated settlement talks in Miami, which lasted several days as the warring sides worked through details of a Washington-proposed plan to end the war. There has been no sign of an imminent diplomatic breakthrough.

The Ukrainian army said that “to preserve the lives of our soldiers and the combat capability of our units, Ukrainian defenders have withdrawn from the settlement” of Siversk, adding that fighting was continuing on the outskirts.

Moscow on Monday reported “slow progress” in talks over the US plan to end the war, as Kyiv and its European allies seek to adjust an initial proposal that adhered to many of Russia’s hardline demands .

A Russian strike could collapse the internal radiation shelter at the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine, the plant’s director has told AFP.

In an interview, director Sergiy Tarakanov said fully restoring the shelter could take three to four years and warned that another Russian strike could cause the inner shell to collapse.

“If a missile or drone hits it directly, or even falls somewhere nearby, for example an Iskander, God forbid, it will cause a mini-earthquake in the area,” Tarakanov said.

The Iskander is Russia’s short-range ballistic missile system, capable of carrying a variety of conventional warheads, including bunker-busting munitions.

“No one can guarantee that the shelter facility will remain standing after that. That is the main threat,” he added.

On the battlefield in the east, Russia’s army claimed to have captured settlements in the Kharkiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, in a grinding advance that has accelerated in recent weeks.

Zelensky said a four-year-old child was killed in the central Zhytomyr region after a Russian drone struck a residential building.

Workers were scrambling to repair damaged energy infrastructure, he said, forcing emergency power cuts across several regions during frigid winter weather.

“An attack ahead of Christmas , when people simply want to be with their families, at home, and safe. An attack carried out essentially in the midst of negotiations aimed at ending this war,” Zelensky said.

There were also deaths in the Kyiv and Khmelnytskyi regions.

In Russia , one person was killed and three wounded, including a teenage boy, after Ukrainian drone attacks on the border region of Belgorod, its governor said.

Ukraine’s Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said energy facilities in the west of the country were the most affected by the strikes.

Russia’s army said it had launched a massive strike using long-range drones and hypersonic missiles at military and energy sites.

The southern Black Sea region of Odesa was again targeted as Russia stepped up attacks on the key port city.

Olena Dolhachova, a 40-year-old maths teacher in Odesa, told AFP she had to rely on candles to continue her work.

“There are attacks every week. Just when power is restored, all our schedules are disrupted again. We are left without electricity , without stability, sitting in the dark for two or three days,” she said.

“It is very difficult.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 23 Dec 2025 23:22:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7a12e9b4-d5da-11f0-a648-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/101225-donetsk-war-m.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's air defence units destroy drone flying towards Moscow, mayor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-air-defence-units-destroy-drone-flying-towards-moscow-mayor-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Russia's air defence units destroyed a drone flying towards Moscow, Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:42:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosions heard in southern Moscow at site of general's killing, Russia's Telegram channels say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/explosions-heard-southern-moscow-site-generals-killing-russias-telegram-channels-2025-12-23/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Several explosions were heard in southern Moscow on Wednesday at the site where Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov was killed by a car bomb on Monday, Baza and SHOT Telegram channels reported.

According to witnesses, a car detonated, Baza and SHOT, which have sources in Russia's law enforcement agencies, reported.

At least two people were seriously injured in the explosions which took place near a police station, SHOT, Baza and other unofficial Russian Telegram news channels reported.

Reuters was not able to independently verify the reports. There was no official confirmation from Russian authorities about the incident.

Sarvarov was killed on Monday when a bomb exploded under his Kia Sorento as he left a parking space in southern Moscow, Russian investigators said, adding they were looking at possible involvement by Ukrainian special services.

A string of Russian military figures and prominent backers of the war in Ukraine have been killed since the conflict began, some in car bombings, and Ukrainian military intelligence has said it was behind a number of attacks.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US bars five Europeans over alleged pressure on tech firms to censor speech</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20251224-us-bars-five-europeans-over-alleged-pressure-on-tech-firms-to-censor-speech</link><description>The State Department announced Tuesday it was barring five Europeans it accused of leading efforts to pressure US tech firms to censor or suppress American viewpoints.

The Europeans, described by Secretary of State Marco Rubio as “radical” activists and “weaponized” nongovernmental organizations, fell afoul of a new visa policy announced in May that restricts the entry of foreigners deemed responsible for the censorship of protected speech in the United States.

“For far too long, ideologues in Europe have led organized efforts to coerce American platforms to punish American viewpoints they oppose,” Rubio posted on X. “The Trump administration will no longer tolerate these egregious acts of extraterritorial censorship.”

The five Europeans were identified by Sarah Rogers, the undersecretary of state for public diplomacy, in a series of social media posts. They include leaders of organizations that address digital hate and a former European Union commissioner who clashed with tech billionaire Elon Musk over broadcasting an online interview with US President Donald Trump .

Rubio’s statement said they advanced foreign government censorship campaigns against Americans and US companies, which he said created “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences” for the United States .

The action to bar them from the US is part of a Trump administration campaign against foreign influence over online speech, using immigration law rather than platform regulations or sanctions.

The five Europeans named by Rogers are Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate; Josephine Ballon and Anna-Lena von Hodenberg, leaders of HateAid, a German organization; Clare Melford, who runs the Global Disinformation Index; and former EU commissioner Thierry Breton, who was responsible for digital affairs.

In her post on X, Rogers called Breton, a French business executive and former finance minister, the “mastermind” behind the EU’s Digital Services Act , which imposes strict requirements designed to keep internet users safe online, including the flagging of harmful or illegal content such as hate speech.

She referred to Breton warning Musk of a possible “amplification of harmful content” by broadcasting his livestream interview with Trump in August 2024, when Trump was running for president.

Breton responded Tuesday on X by noting that all 27 EU member states voted for the Digital Services Act in 2022. “To our American friends: ‘Censorship isn’t where you think it is,’” he wrote.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said France condemns the visa restrictions on Breton and the four others. Posting on X, he said the Digital Services Act was adopted to ensure that “what is illegal offline is also illegal online,” adding that it “has absolutely no extraterritorial reach and in no way concerns the United States.”

Most Europeans are covered by the Visa Waiver Program, meaning they do not necessarily need visas to enter the country. They do, however, need to complete an online application prior to arrival under a system run by the Department of Homeland Security. As a result, it is possible that at least some of the five individuals have been flagged to DHS, a US official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss details not publicly released.

Other visa restriction policies were announced this year, alongside bans targeting foreign visitors from certain African and Middle Eastern countries and the Palestinian Authority . Visitors from some countries could also be required to post a financial bond when applying for a visa.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:45:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/951bbd7e-7408-11ef-b79c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_36GE46E.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supreme Court blocks Trump’s National Guard deployment in Chicago</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251223-supreme-court-blocks-trump-national-guard-deployment-chicago</link><description>The US Supreme Court dealt a blow to President Donald Trump ’s immigration crackdown on Tuesday by blocking his deployment of National Guard troops in Chicago.

The conservative-dominated court kept in place, for now, a lower court order barring the deployment of troops on the streets of the city in the midwestern state of Illinois.

“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the court said in an unsigned order.

Three conservative justices — Samuel Alito, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch — dissented.

The Republican president has sent National Guard troops to three Democratic-led cities this year — Los Angeles, Washington and Memphis — but his efforts to deploy soldiers in Portland and Chicago have been tied up in the courts.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson, reacting to the ruling, said the president “activated the National Guard to protect federal law enforcement officers, and to ensure rioters did not destroy federal buildings and property.”

“Nothing in today’s ruling detracts from that core agenda,” Jackson said.

JB Pritzker, the Democratic governor of Illinois, who strongly opposed the deployment along with the Democratic mayor of Chicago, welcomed the ruling, calling it a “big win for Illinois and American democracy.”

“This is an important step in curbing the Trump administration’s consistent abuse of power and slowing Trump’s march toward authoritarianism,” Pritzker said.

After two lower courts blocked Trump from sending troops into Chicago, his administration made an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court .

In his filing with the top court, Solicitor General John Sauer claimed federal agents in Chicago were being “forced to operate under the constant threat of mob violence.”

The court order blocking deployment of the National Guard “improperly impinges on the president’s authority and needlessly endangers federal personnel and property,” Sauer added.

The Supreme Court rebuff of the emergency appeal was a rare defeat for Trump at the top court, where conservatives hold a 6–3 majority.

It was not immediately clear how Tuesday’s decision would affect other cases in which Democratic-led states have challenged Trump’s National Guard deployments.

California and Oregon have both filed legal challenges against the Trump administration’s extraordinary domestic use of the National Guard.

Trump sent troops to Los Angeles earlier this year to quell demonstrations sparked by a federal crackdown on undocumented migrants .

A district court judge ruled the deployment unlawful, but an appeals court panel allowed the Los Angeles operation to proceed.

Some 300 National Guard troops remain activated in the Chicago area but are not engaged in operations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 01:45:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d8717a32-d16d-11f0-a365-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25328704047319.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: U.S. eyes additional Coast Guard assets to seize fleeing tanker, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-eyes-additional-coast-guard-assets-seize-fleeing-tanker-sources-say-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON/LONDON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Coast Guard is waiting for additional forces to arrive before potentially attempting to board and seize a Venezuela-linked oil tanker it has been pursuing since Sunday, a U.S. official and a source familiar with the matter told Reuters.

The ship, which maritime groups have identified as the Bella 1, has refused to be boarded by the Coast Guard. That means that the task will likely fall to one of just two teams of specialists - known as Maritime Security Response Teams - who can board vessels under these circumstances, including by rappelling from helicopters.

The days-long pursuit highlights the mismatch between the Trump administration's desire to seize sanctioned oil tankers near Venezuela and the limited resources of the agency that is mainly carrying out operations, the Coast Guard.

Unlike the U.S. Navy, the Coast Guard can carry out law enforcement actions, including boarding and seizing vessels that are under U.S. sanctions.

Trump earlier this month ordered a "blockade" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela, in Washington's latest move to increase pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The Coast Guard has in recent weeks seized two oil tankers near Venezuela. After the first seizure , on Dec. 10, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi posted a 45-second video showing two helicopters approaching a vessel and armed individuals in camouflage rappelling onto it.

A Saturday social media post by the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Coast Guard, showed what appeared to be Coast Guard officers aboard the Gerald Ford aircraft carrier getting ready to depart and seize the Centuries tanker, the second of the ships boarded by the U.S.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Coast Guard officials on the Ford were from a Maritime Security Response Team and at the time too far from Bella 1 to carry out a boarding operation.

"There are limited teams who are trained for these types of boardings," said Corey Ranslem, chief executive of maritime security group Dryad Global and previously with the U.S. Coast Guard.

The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Reuters could not determine what, if any other reasons, have led to the Coast Guard not seizing the vessel yet.

The administration could ultimately choose to not board and seize the vessel.

The White House said that the United States was still in "active pursuit of a sanctioned dark fleet vessel that is part of Venezuela’s illegal sanctions evasion."

The U.S. Coast Guard is a branch of the armed forces but a part of the Department of Homeland Security.

The United States has assembled a massive military force in the Caribbean, including an aircraft carrier, fighter jets and other warships. Ospreys and additional MC-130J Commando II aircraft arrived in Aguadilla, Puerto Rico in recent days, according to a separate source.

The Coast Guard has far fewer resources in place.

The service has long said that it lacks the resources to effectively carry out a growing list of missions, including search and rescue operations and drug seizures.

In November, the Coast Guard announced that it had seized about 49,000 pounds of drugs worth more than $362 million in the eastern Pacific.

"The Coast Guard is in a severe readiness crisis that is decades in the making," Admiral Kevin Lunday, who leads the Coast Guard, told lawmakers in June.

For the fiscal year ending September 2026, the Coast Guard requested $14.6 billion in funding. It will receive an additional $25 billion through a sweeping spending and tax legislation, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act."

"Our Coast Guard is less ready than in any other time in the past 80 years since the end of World War Two. The downward readiness spiral we are on is not sustainable," Lunday said earlier this year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 03:24:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P2RGNPIEUJN2NJVAEANDIH634I.jpg?auth=4fbfd8dc902772819840f75c51e3a6b0eeb432abb2d197da58a978f56f9db0fc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US holds call with Palau on transfer of third-country nationals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-holds-call-with-palau-transfer-third-country-nationals-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. on Tuesday said Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau spoke to Palau President Surangel Whipps about transferring third-country nationals to the Pacific Island nation, even after its lawmakers rejected a previous request from Washington on the matter.

President Donald Trump's immigration policies , including his administration's deportation drive, have been broadly condemned by human rights advocates on concerns about due process. The Trump administration has also sent hundreds of people to third countries to which they have no ties, a tactic that was rarely used in the past.

Trump has said the measures are aimed at improving domestic security.

"The leaders discussed a new U.S.-Palau Memorandum of Understanding regarding the transfer of third-country nationals with no known criminal histories," the State Department said in a statement after Tuesday's call.

In late July, Palau's Congress said it "cannot accept" a U.S. proposal for it to accept asylum seekers from other countries.

Palau, with a population of 17,000, has a compact of free association with the U.S., which provides economic assistance in return for allowing American military access to its territory.

Palau is not a signatory to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention.

U.S. Catholic bishops have condemned Washington's immigration enforcement activities and in October, Pope Leo XIV lamented the mistreatment of immigrants.

Last week, a federal judge signaled a willingness to again rule that the Trump administration cannot swiftly deport migrants to countries other than their own without providing meaningful notice and an opportunity for them to raise fears of persecution or torture if they are sent there.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 03:26:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S5UMFJJICNONHEB7B42HMMW5XM.jpg?auth=c6e3d87a45403522d0ef038ce71001a0ed5757da7e3aff2c37dd934a5d17a8a4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia cancels British man's visa after charges of displaying Nazi symbol</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/australia-cancels-british-mans-visa-after-charges-displaying-nazi-symbol-2025-12-24/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Australia cancelled the visa of a British national after he was charged with displaying a banned Nazi symbol, the immigration minister said on Wednesday, as the country cracks down on antisemitism in the wake of a mass shooting at Bondi Beach.

The government revoked the visa of a 43-year-old man who was charged on December 8 with displaying a Nazi symbol and advocating for violence against the Jewish community on social media platform X, according to Australian Federal Police.

"If you come to Australia on a visa, you are here as a guest," Home Affairs Minister Bourke told the Australian Broadcasting Corp, referring to the British citizen.

"If someone comes here for the purposes of hate, they can leave," he said.

Burke and the federal police did not name the British man but the federal police said he displayed the Nazi Hakenkreuz - a type of swastika - and espoused "pro-Nazi ideology with a specific hatred of the Jewish community" from two X accounts from October to November.

After having his visa revoked, the man who was living in the state of Queensland was taken into immigration detention and would be deported unless he voluntarily left first, media reports said.

On December 14, a father and son allegedly opened fire on a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach, killing 15 people and sparking calls for the Australian government to do more to stop antisemitism.

Sajid Akram, 50, was shot dead in the attack but his son Naveed Akram is charged with murder and terrorism, with police saying he was recorded saying he was motivated by Islamic text the Koran.

As part of the government's response to the Bondi Beach shooting and calls for heightened action against antisemitism , Burke said he plans to lower the legal thresholds for a person's antisemitic actions to be illegal. He has previously said that antisemitic groups intentionally curb their language to avoid criminal charges while violating Australian community standards.

He also said that for a visa cancellation the authorities needed to prove a person's actions had a harmful impact on the community, but "incitement of hate should be enough".

"We should be able to cancel visas on that basis alone," Bourke told the ABC. "There will...be legislation to increase my powers to make cancellations of exactly this nature."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 03:26:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PTAOA7RIOBOSRD6SRCB46W2AEQ.jpg?auth=81dc23c9ce0fb09516b57fcc9e17a3ae9698f14f4f4ebd5c01e795d850428b5c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US accused of “greatest extortion known in our history” over Venezuela at UN</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251224-us-accused-of-greatest-extortion-known-in-our-history-over-venezuela-at-un</link><description>Russia and China on Tuesday criticized the United States for its military and economic pressure on Venezuela, telling the UN Security Council it amounted to “cowboy behavior” and “intimidation.”

Venezuela , which requested the emergency council meeting with the backing of Moscow and Beijing, accused Washington of “the greatest extortion known in our history.”

The United States has deployed a major military force in the Caribbean and has recently intercepted oil tankers as part of a naval blockade against Venezuelan vessels it considers to be under sanctions.

At Tuesday’s meeting, US Ambassador Mike Waltz responded to the criticism by saying, “The United States will do everything in its power to protect our hemisphere, our borders, and the American people.”

US President Donald Trump accuses Venezuela of using oil , the South American country’s main resource, to finance “narcoterrorism, human trafficking, murders, and kidnappings.”

Caracas denies any involvement in drug trafficking and maintains that Washington is seeking to overthrow its president, Nicolas Maduro , in order to seize Venezuelan oil reserves, the largest in the world.

“The acts by the US side run counter to all key norms of international law,” said Vassily Nebenzia, Russia’s ambassador to the United Nations , calling the US blockade an “act of aggression.”

“The responsibility of Washington is also evident for the constant catastrophic consequences of such cowboy-like conduct,” he told the council.

“China opposes all acts of unilateralism and bullying and supports all countries in defending their sovereignty and national dignity,” said the Chinese representative, Sun Lei.

Venezuelan ambassador Samuel Moncada told the council: “We are in the presence of a power that acts outside of international law, demanding that Venezuelans vacate our country and hand it over.”

“This is the greatest extortion known in our history,” he added.

Waltz reiterated Trump’s accusations against the Venezuelan leader, saying, “Nicolas Maduro is a fugitive wanted by American justice and the head of the foreign terrorist organization the ‘Cartel de los Soles.’”

Experts say there is no evidence of the existence of an organized group with a defined hierarchy that goes by that name.

The US government has offered a $50 million reward for any information leading to the arrest of Maduro, a staunch ally of Russian leader Vladimir Putin.

Since September, US forces have launched dozens of air strikes on boats that Washington alleges, without showing evidence, were transporting drugs. More than 100 people have been killed.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 04:12:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d2f2a06a-e07a-11f0-8c32-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T215017Z-750816989-RC2LMIAYP1KS-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-VENEZUELA-UN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China probe finds Taiwanese smugglers controlled vessel that damaged subsea cables</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-probe-finds-taiwanese-smugglers-controlled-vessel-that-damaged-subsea-2025-12-24/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Chinese authorities on Wednesday said two Taiwanese citizens led a smuggling operation involving a Chinese-crewed vessel that damaged subsea cables earlier this year.

In June, a Taiwanese court sentenced the Chinese captain of a Togo-registered ship, the Hong Tai 58, to three years in jail after finding him guilty of intentionally damaging undersea cables off Taiwan in February, in a case that alarmed officials in Taipei.

On Wednesday, the public security bureau in Weihai, in China's eastern Shandong province, said its investigations into the incident showed that two Taiwanese men were behind a multi-vessel operation that was illegally transporting frozen goods into China. The authorities' findings came after interviewing seven Chinese crew members on the Hong Tai 58.

China previously accused Taiwan of " manipulating " possible Chinese involvement in the case, saying it was making claims before the facts were clear.

The Weihai public security bureau issued a bounty of up to 250,000 yuan ($35,569) for information or assistance regarding the Taiwanese suspects with the surnames Chien and Chen, adding that they have been on a Chinese customs office wanted list since 2014.

China's Taiwan Affairs Office accused Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party of provoking confrontation, saying Taipei had "ignored the facts of the case" and "maliciously hyped up" the situation.

Taipei is "sheltering and condoning smuggling crimes, using the opportunity to carry out political manipulation and undermine cross-strait relations," a spokesperson for the office, Peng Qingen, said at a weekly news briefing.

Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Beijing views Taiwan as its own territory. Taipei rejects that, saying only the island's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 04:57:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine drone attacks target Moscow at night, spark industrial fire in Tula, Russia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-drone-attacks-target-moscow-night-spark-industrial-fire-tula-russia-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainian overnight drone attacks targeted Moscow and sparked an industrial fire in the Tula region, which lies directly south of the Russian capital, regional authorities said on Wednesday.

At least three drones targeting Moscow were downed, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on the Telegram messaging app.

He said emergency services were dispatched to the sites where the drone debris fell, but he did not immediately report any damage.

Two of the four major airports servicing the capital limited operations, Russia's civil aviation authority said on Telegram.

The Russian defence ministry said its air defence units destroyed 172 Ukrainian drones overnight, nearly half of them over regions bordering Ukraine.

Debris from a downed Ukrainian drone sparked a fire at an industrial site in Russia's Tula region, Tula Governor Dmitry Milyaev said on Telegram.

Milyaev did not give details about the industrial facility.

He said that Russian air defence units destroyed 12 Ukrainian drones over the region.

Ukraine has stepped up drone strikes deep inside Russia, saying it is targeting military, energy and logistics sites to disrupt Moscow’s war effort, in response to Russia’s continued strikes on Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 05:25:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's recall of ambassadors compounds staffing problems at posts in Africa</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/trumps-recall-ambassadors-compounds-staffing-problems-posts-africa-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's mass recall of ambassadors will leave Washington without top-level presence in more than half of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, complicating America's efforts to push its agenda in a region that has faced military coups and devastating conflicts in recent years.

Since taking office, the administration has worked to implement its business-focused diplomacy in Africa, shifting the U.S. priority from aid to trade. Trump has sought to broker peace accords and rare-earth deals and has struck bilateral agreements instead of providing direct foreign assistance.

Trump has touted the U.S. as a better partner to African countries than China, saying he was committed to strengthening friendships in the region in the latest effort by successive U.S. administrations to counter perceptions of U.S. neglect of a continent where China has increasingly made economic inroads.

U.S. embassies across Africa and the State Department's Africa Bureau in Washington have chronically been understaffed across several administrations. But now, Trump's ouster of 13 chiefs of mission as reported by the Associated Press will bring the total top-level vacancies in the region to roughly 30. Former diplomats and experts said this number will inevitably have an impact on America's diplomacy.

It was unclear whether the State Department planned to replace those who are being recalled. The department did not provide answers on when they intended to replace them.

The recall of top envoys reflected Trump's "personal style", said Cameron Hudson, a former U.S. official who worked on Africa, given the Republican president has taken an active role in the peace accord between Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda as well as in actions against Nigeria over the killing of Christians.

That approach, Hudson said, misses the point of diplomacy and engagement and undermines efforts by diplomats to shape attitudes and interests.

Trump feels "He doesn't need ambassadors, because he's managing these relationships, even with 54 African countries, himself. So if he's not personally engaged, then that country doesn't merit his engagement. If he is personally engaged, then why does he need an ambassador?," Hudson said.

Aside from Trump himself, Massad Boulos, father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany and senior adviser for Arab and African Affairs, has played a major role in negotiations between Congo and Rwanda. He has also tried to help end the war in Sudan.

Despite former President Joe Biden's repeated pledges to focus more on Africa, U.S. influence in the continent declined during his term. Washington lost a military base in the Sahel region and made little progress breaking China's commercial domination in minerals seen as critical to national security.

Much of Trump's focus in the region has been on mediating a peace deal to end the conflict in eastern Congo, as the Republican president sought diplomatic acclaim for international peacemaking. However, just days after Trump and leaders of Congo and Rwanda reaffirmed a peace deal, Rwanda-backed M23 rebels made their biggest advance in months.

Trump also has feuded with South Africa and added Nigeria to a list of countries of concern, threatening military action if the West African nation fails to crack down on the killing of Christians.

Among U.S. envoys recalled were those serving in Rwanda and Nigeria, according to the AP, as well as Niger, where this year a U.S. pilot working for a missionary agency was kidnapped.

"The Trump Administration is delivering unprecedented success in advancing America’s national interests in Africa," Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the State Department, said.

"Those successes — from commercial and trade deals to historic health and peace agreements — are a direct result of President Trump’s tremendous leadership and the professionalism of American diplomats. That’s the real story."

The State Department did not confirm AP's reporting on the number of ambassadors recalled.

Even after high-level engagement by Boulos, it still falls to the embassy to do the follow-up work, said Tibor Nagy, who was the top Africa official at the State Department during Trump's first term. He said the vacancies were "an extremely high number," though added that assessment was based on his impression rather than data.

In addition to the overseas missions, leadership of the Africa Bureau at the State Department will also be going through personnel changes with Senior Bureau Official for African Affairs Jonathan Pratt retiring.

In an email seen by Reuters, Pratt told staff that when he took on the position, he had agreed to serve in the role through the end of the year. "While historically understaffed, the AF bureau constantly rises to every challenge and takes advantage of every opportunity," he said.

The bureau's Deputy Assistant Secretary Nick Checker will step into the role after Pratt's departure, a State Department spokesperson said. Checker will be the third official to take on the role under Trump's second term, after the retirement of Pratt and Troy Fitrell .

Trump has yet to nominate a candidate for Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, a Senate-confirmed position. The State Department did not address a question on when the administration would make that nomination.

Nagy, who was a key department official in the first months of the current Trump administration, said the lack of a nominee "definitely can hurt the operations of the bureau."

Nagy, who also served as U.S. ambassador to Ethiopia and Guinea, said that while Checker is "qualified, competent ... at some point you really do need to have a Senate-confirmed assistant secretary."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 06:34:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JL6SPVOPARMEDMLJHHIX54HDRM.jpg?auth=4d2af2b73c2f72d344f811a4c7bc9d8a2048b66cc4f825bd174406a7819e1931&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey says electrical failure reported before Libyan military jet crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/turkey-says-electrical-failure-reported-before-libyan-military-jet-crash-2025-12-24/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - A private jet carrying the chief of staff of Libya’s army reported an electrical failure and requested an emergency landing shortly before crashing near Ankara , Turkey’s head of communications said on Wednesday.

The Dassault Falcon 50 jet took off from Ankara’s Esenboga Airport at 1717 GMT on Tuesday en route to Tripoli and at 1733 GMT it informed air traffic control of an emergency caused by an electrical malfunction, Burhanettin Duran said in a statement.

Eight people, including three crew members, were killed in the crash, according to Libyan and Turkish officials.

Air traffic control redirected the aircraft back toward Esenboga Airport and emergency measures were initiated, but the jet disappeared from radar at 1736 GMT while descending for landing and contact was lost, he said.

Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya earlier said the aircraft requested an emergency landing while flying over Ankara’s Haymana district, adding that the wreckage was later found near Kesikkavak village in the area.

Search and rescue teams reached the crash site after operations were launched by Turkey's Interior Ministry and investigations into the cause of the crash were continuing with the involvement of all relevant authorities, Duran said.

Libya's internationally recognised government has said the dead included the country's army chief of staff, Mohammed Ali Ahmed Al-Haddad, and four members of his entourage.

Libyan officials have said the jet was leased and registered in Malta, adding that its ownership and technical history would be examined as part of the investigation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 06:34:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EC7FOZJT2JKIREM72PPBJJ2XRM.jpg?auth=30b4ee40a6a7a1c0880e3992e7eb8bef0ec0a472d96d0d1fe60c063b0a3ae30e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea special prosecutor indicts ex-president Yoon over opinion polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-special-prosecutor-indicts-ex-president-yoon-over-opinion-polls-2025-12-24/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 24 (Reuters) - South Korea's special prosecutor has indicted ex-president Yoon Suk Yeol on allegations of violating the political fundraising act by illegally receiving public opinion polls, according to a statement from the special prosecution team on Wednesday.

Less than 100 days after he was elected premier, Anutin dissolved parliament earlier this month when his minority government faced the threat of a no-confidence vote.

Speaking to party members and supporters on Wednesday, Anutin said he and his Bhumjaithai party were ready to return to power, describing the February 8 election as "the most consequential poll" for the conservative political outfit since its formation in 2008.

"Today we are sure and ready to enter the election race to serve Thailand and its people," Anutin said.

"This is the first time the Thai people has high expectations from the Bhumjaithai Party."

If re-elected, Anutin said that key executives of his government will keep their roles, including Finance Minister Ekniti Nitithanprapas, Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow and Commerce Minister Suphajee Suthumpun.

Anutin stands to gain from growing nationalist sentiment generated by the conflict with Cambodia, which reignited on his watch. However, analysts say the election could be close and grant no clear majority for any of the parties involved.

Yodchanan Wongsawat , a leading prime ministerial candidate with the Pheu Thai Party, told Reuters in an interview that he is open to join a coalition government.

In a nationwide survey conducted by the National Institute of Development Administration, Bhumjaithai is currently polling at 9.92%, fourth among the major parties competing in the vote.

But the survey also indicated that some 32.36% of voters had yet to decide which party they will back, leaving space for Bhumjaithai to gain ground in the coming weeks.

Bhumjaithai came third in the 2023 election, joining a Pheu Thai-led ruling coalition, with which it stayed until June this year.

The party withdrew its support following a leaked phone call between then Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and former Cambodian leader Hun Sen.

Paetongtarn was later dismissed by the Constitutional Court in August, opening the door for Anutin.

A savvy political operator, Anutin manoeuvred his way to the top job through a parliamentary vote in September after striking a deal with the opposition People's Party, the largest force in parliament.

That agreement, however, fell through earlier this month, setting the stage for February's earlier-than-expected snap election.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:25:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NDMMPYQCLBKQHMMRH7SLRJEO2Q.jpg?auth=fea9f8968d6f5320a7f580f200209a691f454232912b6fceb6b375f25a5248a0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Coup leader expected to stay in power in Guinea presidential vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/coup-leader-expected-stay-power-guinea-presidential-vote-2025-12-24/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 07:26:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>France condemns U.S. visa ban imposed on ex-EU commissioner Breton</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-condemns-us-visa-ban-imposed-ex-eu-commissioner-breton-2025-12-24/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The French government condemned on Wednesday a visa ban imposed by the Trump administration on Thierry Breton, a former European Union commissioner who helped drive the EU's Digital Services Act, which has recently targeted top U.S. tech companies.

"France strongly condemns the visa restriction imposed by the United States on Thierry Breton, former minister and European Commissioner, and four other European figures," wrote French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot on X on Wednesday.

The Trump administration on Tuesday imposed visa bans on Breton and other anti-disinformation campaigners which it says were involved in censoring U.S. social media platforms, in the latest move in a campaign aimed at European rules that U.S. officials say go beyond legitimate regulation.

Breton, a former French finance minister and the European commissioner for the internal market from 2019-2024, was the most high-profile individual targeted by these bans.

The United States' Under Secretary for Public Diplomacy Sarah Rogers described - when outlining the bans on Tuesday - Breton as a 'mastermind' of the EU's Digital Services Act, which was again defended by Barrot on Wednesday.

"The Digital Services Act (DSA) was democratically adopted in Europe to ensure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online. It has absolutely no extraterritorial reach and in no way affects the United States," wrote Barrot on X.

Breton himself also condemned the visa ban against him.

"He suggested that during the upcoming election period, voters should choose candidates who can cooperate with the Tatmadaw," state-run media reported, referring to Myanmar's powerful armed forces.

The comments underline the junta's attempts to hold on to power as it uses ballots to do what it couldn't on the battlefield - cement its control over the country in the face of fierce armed resistance that has emerged since the coup, while gaining some international legitimacy for its rule.

But analysts and diplomats say the aim of establishing a stable administration in the Southeast Asian nation is far-fetched since the civil war is still raging, and a military-controlled government with a civilian veneer is unlikely to win many backers overseas.

"A new iteration of indirect military rule will do nothing to resolve the armed conflict or civil resistance, and Myanmar will remain mired in crisis," said Richard Horsey, Senior Myanmar Adviser at Crisis Group.

Voting will be held in two phases , on Sunday and Jan. 11, in only 202 of Myanmar's 330 townships where the military has varying degrees of control.

Dates for a potential third phase, counting or results have not been announced.

The battle-hardened Tatmadaw has long dominated politics in Myanmar, which won independence from Britain in 1948, with a string of military chiefs running the country with an iron grip.

Min Aung Hlaing joined their ranks in February 2021, when he ousted a civilian government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi on the unproven allegation of electoral fraud by her party, which had won the preceding years' polls by a landslide.

"The military is incapable of anything but cosmetic change that will not threaten their core interests of central control," said David Mathieson, an independent Myanmar analyst.

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, which won the last two general elections in 2020 and 2015 , remains dissolved by the election commission, and many other anti-junta political outfits are not in the running.

Six parties are competing nationwide, including the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party that has the largest slate of candidates and is tipped to win the polls, creating conditions for the junta chief to take a civilian role.

"The USDP already has established political leaders within its ranks," said political analyst Sai Kyi Zin Soe, suggesting that Min Aung Hlaing's route to presidency may not be straightforward, although the general is expected to remain tremendously powerful.

"While it is likely that a national leader will emerge from the military-aligned USDP, we have to wait and see if that leader will be Min Aung Hlaing," he said.

In a military-managed election in 2010, the Tatmadaw installed a former general as a civilian president, a move intended to oversee a tightly controlled political opening.

President Thein Sein later launched reforms that surprised critics and supporters alike. These included freeing political prisoners, easing long-standing media censorship and overseeing the 2015 election that resulted in a transfer of power to Suu Kyi after his party lost the vote.

But comparisons between the current situation and past processes can be flawed, partly because of the unprecedented violence that has ravaged Myanmar since the coup, as a popular armed resistance has combined with long-standing ethnic armies in the country's borderlands to challenge the Tatmadaw.

"Rather than stabilising the country, military-orchestrated elections are likely to intensify violence while failing to generate durable political or economic stability," said Ye Myo Hein, a senior fellow at the Southeast Asia Peace Institute non-profit.

The elections are also a move by Min Aung Hlaing and his brass to seek foreign legitimacy after being shunned by the international community in the wake of the coup, the analysts said.

Although planned with the backing of key ally China , the junta is seeking to gather broader support for the elections, including from neighbours such as India and Thailand as well as the 11-member ASEAN bloc that has barred the ruling generals from its summits.

Thailand's foreign minister said last month that ASEAN would find it difficult to re-engage with Myanmar because the election was being held without the necessary "inclusive dialogue," and also called for Suu Kyi's release.

The United Nations, human rights groups and many Western nations have been vocal in their criticism of the elections that the junta is carrying out with the help of a law that punishes dissent and under which it has charged hundreds of people.

"Any meaningful election requires an end to violence and dialogue amongst all parties concerned," Britain said at the UN Security Council this week. "And there are no indications that the planned elections will be perceived as free or fair."

The junta insists that the polls have popular support, denying that they are being conducted with coercion, force or suppression.

"The election is being conducted for the people of Myanmar, not for the international community," junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun told reporters this month, according to state-run media.

A handful of prefabricated white shelters, it sits at the end of a short dirt track on a hill leading up from Road 60, a major route that dissects the Israeli-occupied West Bank.

Over time, similar modest dwellings have turned into sprawling Israeli housing developments, part of a plan that members of Israel's cabinet acknowledge they have implemented to prevent the birth of a Palestinian state.

The process can be violent. A Bedouin family told Reuters attackers who descended from Or Meir hurling Molotov cocktails drove them off Palestinian-owned land nearby last year. They fear they won't ever be able to return.

Messages posted on Or Meir's channel on the Telegram social media platform celebrate chasing out Bedouin herders and show the new settlers’ determination to secure lasting control over what they call “strategic” territory.

This year ​was one of the most violent on record for Israeli civilian attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to United Nations data that shows more than 750 injuries and the rapid spread of outposts throughout land Palestinians hope will form the heart of a future state.

Israeli NGO Peace Now has recorded 80 outposts built in 2025, the most since the organization started its records in 1991. On December 21, Israel's cabinet approved 19 more settlements, including former outposts. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said the goal was to block Palestinian statehood.

For decades, groups of settlers have built outposts on West Bank land without official authorisation from the Israeli state. Israeli authorities in the West Bank sometimes demolish such camps but they often reappear, and in many cases end up being accepted by Israel as formal settlements. Smotrich has pushed efforts to formalise more outposts.

Most of the world considers all Israel's settlement activity in the West Bank illegal under international law relating to military occupations. Israel disputes this view.

"Since establishing our presence on the land, we have driven away nine illegal Bedouin outposts, and returned 6,000 dunams to Jewish hands," the account representing Or Meir's settlers said in a post in September, using the dunam measurement equal to about 1,000 square meters, or a quarter of an acre.

Reuters could not independently confirm all the attacks on the Bedouins or determine who posted on behalf of Or Meir, which was established about two years ago. The settlers there declined to speak to the news agency.

In response to Reuters questions about intensifying settler violence in the West Bank, an Israeli official blamed a "fringe minority" and said Palestinian attacks against Israelis were underreported by the media. The Palestinian Authority did not respond to requests for comment.

Messages on the Or Meir Telegram channel, which is public, suggest a well-organized plan to take land, a finding supported by Reuters examination of a dozen other Telegram and WhatsApp groups representing similar groups, three interviews with settlers and pro-settler groups and on-the-ground reporting around Or Meir and a new settlement.

"The evidence shows that this is a systematic pattern of violence,” said Milena Ansari, a researcher based in Jerusalem for Human Rights Watch whose work includes research on settlements in the West Bank.

The Bedouin Musabah family said they were attacked at night in June from the direction of Or Meir. Charred remains of their home and a barn were still visible to a Reuters team in December.

"We were living here, sitting in God's safety," said Bedouin shepherd Shahada Musabah, 39, now sheltering in the nearby Palestinian village of Deir Dibwan. "They started to set fire and they destroyed everything. They didn't leave us anything at all."

In response to questions about the incident, Israel's military told Reuters dozens of Israeli civilians set fire to property in Deir Dibwan on the night in question. It said all suspects had left by the time security forces arrived. An official in the Deir Dibwan council told Reuters up to 60 settlers were involved, throwing stones and burning the Musabah house and other property, along with cars. Several villagers were injured by stones.

In a telephone call, Or Meir settler Elkanah Nachmani told Reuters reporters not to advance up the track to the outpost from Road 60 and not to make contact again.

Nachmani responded to a Reuters request for comment but did not address the issues raised by the questions. In the Telegram channel, Or Meir settlers accused Palestinians of poisoning their sheep in November 2024, an accusation the Musabah family denies.

Israeli monitoring group Yesh Din said of the hundreds of cases of settler violence it documented since October 7, 2023, only 2% resulted in indictments.

Reuters could not confirm the group's findings. Israel's police and military did not respond to requests for comment.

More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 7, 2023 and October 17, 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, according to the U.N. In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.

The Or Meir group has been open about its goals.

In November 2024, the Or Meir account posted that it aimed to settle "a strategic ridge near the settlement of Ofra" seeking to create "a continuous Jewish settlement presence."

Dror Etkes, an Israeli peace activist, said other outposts served the same purpose, fracturing the West Bank and "limiting the possibility of Palestinians to be in these places."

Despite the government's actions to recognise dozens of previously irregular outposts, Israel’s military told Reuters in a statement Or Meir "is illegal and has been evacuated several times by the security forces." It did not provide specifics about why it considered the outpost illegal or why it was "evacuated" - the military's word to describe closure or demolition of outposts in the West Bank.

After the most recent evacuation in March, Or Meir re-emerged with the help of over 100,000 shekels ($30,000) raised by donations, according to the settlement's website. Reuters couldn't independently confirm the donations.

The former outposts Israel has formalised as settlements over the years include ones previously evacuated by the army. Ofra, also on Road 60 just north of Or Meir, started as an outpost and is now a major housing development.

"Why do we continue?" asked a post by the Or Meir Telegram account in March after the evacuation. The post then answered its own question. "All breakthroughs in settlements were accomplished this way. At first, the state refused to accommodate any activity on the ground and fought it fiercely, but due to the persistence of the citizens, it eventually had to accept it."

In December, Smotrich said 51,370 housing units had been approved for West Bank settlements since he became minister in late 2022, part of what the U.N. describes as the fastest expansion of settlements since its monitoring began in 2017. Smotrich's office did not respond to a request for comment.

On September 30, the Oir Meir Telegram account published a map showing the location of the outpost. The map highlighted a large area with a blue boundary stretching to the edge of Deir Dibwan. The group said the marked area was under control of their outpost.

At least four attacks on Palestinians have been reported within the blue boundary, according to the Deir Dibwan council, which said Palestinians could no longer access the area, including about 250 dunams belonging to the council itself.

The map also shows eight black markers, mostly within the blue boundary, listed as “abandoned Arab invasion outpost,” indicating places from which Bedouins had allegedly been ejected.

Road 60 is flanked by settlements. It is intersected by Road 505, running west-east toward the Jordan Valley and also lined with settlements, including Evyatar near the Palestinian town of Beita.

Evyatar began as a tented outpost in 2019. It was evacuated in 2021 but secured Israeli government recognition in 2024. Malkiel Barhai, Evyatar’s mayor, credited Smotrich for the approval.

Speaking in Evyatar with a pistol tucked into his trousers that he said was for protection, Barhai said the settlement was vital to keep Road 505 open “because we have Arab villages, hostile Arab villages, around.”

A member of the Beita municipality told Reuters settlers from surrounding outposts or settlements, including Evyatar, killed 14 people in the area around Beita between 2021 and 2024. Reuters could not verify the deaths or who was responsible.

On November 8, Reuters witnessed an attack by settlers wielding sticks and clubs and hurling large rocks as Palestinians harvested olives close to Beita. Two Reuters employees - a journalist and a security adviser - were among those injured.

Barhai denied settlers were behind attacks, and blamed Palestinians for violence.

Samer Younes Ali Bani Shamsah, a farmer who lives near Evyatar and whose leg was broken in a settler attack, said he would not leave the land no matter the cost.

"This is my place, my home. Where would I go?," he said. A hill over, another outpost stood, above a hill of olive trees.

The military ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in a February 2021 coup, just as it was preparing for its second term in office following a landslide election win months earlier.

The generals accused Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy (NLD) party of electoral fraud , which she rejected. International election monitors reported no irregularities. Suu Kyi and much of the NLD were detained along with thousands of junta opponents.

The junta pledged to hold an election by August 2023 and restore a democratic system but that was pushed back as the military lost control of swathes of the country in its battles with ethnic minority rebels and anti-junta militias.

The NLD was among dozens of parties dissolved for failing to register.

Most analysts see the election as a way for the military, which has governed Myanmar for much of the past six decades, to entrench its rule via proxies in the absence of a viable political opposition, and earn legitimacy at home and abroad.

Voting will be held in phases, on December 28 in 102 townships, and on January 11 in 100 townships. Authorities have said a third phase could be held later in January.

Myanmar has 330 townships altogether and junta chief Min Aung Hlaing has acknowledged polls will not be nationwide.

Dates for counting and results have not been publicised. The military-backed election commission has said its more than 50,000 electronic voting machines will speed up counting.

Seats will be determined by a combination of first-past-the-post, proportional representation and mixed-member proportional systems, the commission has said. Previous elections used a plurality system where candidates with the most votes won seats.

In line with an army-drafted 2008 constitution, 25% of upper and lower house seats are reserved for serving military personnel selected by the armed forces chief.

Only six parties are competing on a national level, with 51 contesting within a single region or state. Many parties that ran in the past two elections have been disbanded and anti-junta rebels have refused to take part.

That has left in the fray only junta-approved parties, including the military's proxy Union Solidarity and Development Party, which won the last election held by a junta in 2010 . The USDP is fielding 1,018 candidates, a fifth of the total registered.

The USDP, led by former generals, was routed by the NLD in landslides in 2015 and 2020 elections, the latter annulled after the coup.

As in 2010, with the armed forces controlling 25% of the legislature and its USDP allies expected to win a large number of seats, the military will have power to influence who becomes president, the formation of a government, plus judicial and civil service appointments.

According to the constitution, parliament must convene within 90 days of the start of the election. Speakers will be elected and at a later date, a president.

To choose a president, three electoral colleges are formed comprising members of the upper and lower houses, which each nominate one candidate for president. Two of the colleges are elected lawmakers while the third is exclusively comprised of military-appointed lawmakers.

A plenary vote of the bicameral legislature will be held and the candidate with most votes becomes president, with the runners up as vice presidents. A cabinet will then be appointed by the president.

The United Nations, many Western countries and human rights groups say the election is a sham exercise aimed at perpetrating military rule.

The Association of Southeast Asian Nations bloc, of which Myanmar is a member, has called for a fair and inclusive election and may find it difficult to re-engage even after the polls.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing, however, has made a major diplomatic push this year to win support for the polls, including two trips each to key allies China and Russia, which are backing the election, as is India , according to state media.

The military has rejected international criticism, saying the election was not being conducted through coercion or force and has public support.

"The election is being conducted for the people of Myanmar, not for the international community," junta spokesperson Zaw Min Tun said on December 14.

"Whether the international community is satisfied or not, is irrelevant."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:25:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5RG5TMEB5NPJVJOC2NIHXPTZTM.jpg?auth=de3e5b1ce3bb38b516464eb0d89abbadfc571417d193bca4ad625f0fe696029f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar's decade of turmoil: elections, coup and conflict</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmars-decade-turmoil-elections-coup-conflict-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Nearly five years after it seized power, Myanmar's military is moving ahead with a multi-phase general election starting on Sunday, despite conflict across the country.

Here is a timeline of key moments in Myanmar's recent history:

NOVEMBER 2015: Myanmar holds its second general election since the end of five decades of military rule in 2011. Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party win by a landslide, routing the military-backed ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party.

NOVEMBER 8, 2020: Myanmar holds a nationwide election in which the NLD claims a landslide victory.

NOVEMBER 11, 2020: The main opposition, the army-backed USDP, calls for a re-run of the election, alleging irregularities.

FEBRUARY 1, 2021: As the NLD prepares to start its second term in office, Myanmar's military stages a coup , arresting Suu Kyi, President Win Myint and other senior figures from the ruling party. The military-backed Vice President Myint Swe becomes president but immediately transfers power to the military, which forms a junta to administer the country.

FEBRUARY 7, 2021: Protests sweep across Myanmar as tens of thousands of people take to the streets in Yangon and other parts of the country in the biggest demonstrations in years.

MARCH–APRIL 2021: The military violently suppresses demonstrators, prompting many protesters to take up arms against the junta, marking a shift toward a nationwide rebellion.

APRIL 2021: Remnants of Suu Kyi's party and pro-democracy activists establish a parallel civilian administration, the National Unity Government. Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing goes to Jakarta for an emergency meeting of Association of Southeast Asian Nations leaders, who agree a "five-point consensus" roadmap aimed at securing peace in Myanmar.

OCTOBER 2021: ASEAN decides to exclude Myanmar's military leadership from its summits over its failure to take steps to implement the peace plan.

DECEMBER 30, 2022: Suu Kyi is sentenced to 33 years in jail on charges ranging from electoral violations and breaching of coronavirus restrictions to corruption - allegations she denies. The sentence is later reduced to 27 years.

MARCH 2023: The military-appointed election commission dissolves the NLD and dozens of other political parties for failing to re-register under new rules.

OCTOBER 27, 2023: A collection of ethnic minority armed groups launch a coordinated offensive against the military near the Chinese border, taking over swathes of territory and posing the most significant threat to the junta since the coup.

JULY 2025: The military government enacts a controversial law aimed at protecting an upcoming election from obstruction, disruption and destruction, with penalties including the death sentence.

AUGUST 1, 2025: Myanmar forms an interim government after ending a state of emergency lasting more than four years, with Min Aung Hlaing assuming the presidency while also remaining military chief.

AUGUST 18, 2025: Myanmar announces it will hold the first phase of a multi-stage election on December 28, outlining a roadmap for the first national polls since the coup.

OCTOBER 29: Myanmar's junta announces that the second phase of the election will be on January 11, covering 100 more townships across the country.

DECEMBER 14: Junta spokeperson Zaw Min Tun fires back at international criticism of the election, saying the move has public support and is not being conducted with coercion, force or suppression.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:25:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BKGLEL2EPNO2FGQRLHXACEHKZY.jpg?auth=0c8244c53547ae6f19808e70e661a093b2da9235213f88dddff3f80ad90b00fa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh leader seen as likely next prime minister set to return from exile ahead of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-leader-seen-likely-next-prime-minister-set-return-exile-ahead-polls-2025-12-24/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The Bangladesh Nationalist Party aims to gather five million supporters to welcome its leader Tarique Rahman home from nearly 17 years in exile on Thursday, a show of strength as he emerges as a leading contender for prime minister in February elections.

Rahman, 60, is the son of ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and acting chairman of the party that is widely expected to come out on top in the parliamentary vote set for February 12.

His return from London comes as his BNP is on the ascendant following the ouster of its arch foe, long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , in a student-led uprising last year. Apart from brief transition administrations, Khaleda Zia and Sheikh Hasina have alternated in power since 1991.

A December survey by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute suggests the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race. Hasina's Awami League party, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could jeopardize the vote.

Rahman’s decision to return is driven by both political developments and personal circumstances. His mother has been seriously ill for months, prompting what party insiders describe as an urgent trip home.

BNP leaders said they are preparing for what they call an “unprecedented” gathering in the capital, aiming to draw more than five million supporters along the route from the airport to the reception venue.

“This will be a defining political moment,” senior BNP leader Ruhul Kabir Rizvi said, adding that security arrangements are being closely coordinated with authorities to ensure order.

Rahman has lived in London since 2008 as he faced multiple criminal convictions at home including for money laundering and in a case related to a plot to assassinate Hasina. He was, however, acquitted of all charges after Hasina’s removal, clearing the legal barriers that had delayed his return.

BNP officials said he will travel directly from the airport to the reception venue before visiting his mother.

Rahman's return comes as the Muslim-majority South Asian nation of nearly 175 million people enters a sensitive election period under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. The vote is widely viewed as crucial to restoring political stability after nearly two years of turmoil.

Bangladesh is at a crossroads, with Rahman’s return testing the BNP’s ability to mobilise peacefully and the interim administration’s promise to deliver a credible transfer of power. While the government has pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns about law enforcement.

The National Citizen Party (NCP), which emerged from the youth protest movement that toppled Hasina, said it views Rahman's return positively.

"Tarique Rahman was forced into exile under severe pressure and threats, so his homecoming carries symbolic weight," said Khan Muhammad Mursalin, an NCP spokesperson. "His arrival will undoubtedly energize party leaders and supporters ... On the path to democracy, we will stand with him."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:26:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V3GIWIZVNBOMREEDXWTIPK3VFY.jpg?auth=174a69f1603e56b4c83656a59847e2152042f8ebebb52acafe8d6727881af2af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar's election in numbers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmars-election-numbers-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Myanmar will hold the first round of voting in a general election on Sunday in what its military government says will usher in a return to civilian rule following a 2021 coup.

Following are facts and figures on elections in Myanmar:

- 4 national elections have been held in Myanmar in the past 35 years, but only two - in 2010 and 2015 - resulted in the formation of elected governments. The 2020 election was annulled by a military junta, as was a 1990 ballot - 20 years after it took place and was ignored.

- 4,963 candidates have registered for this election.

- 6 parties will take part nationwide and 51 will vie for seats in a single region or state.

- 40 parties were dissolved in 2023 for failing to register for the election, including the former ruling National League for Democracy, whose government was ousted in 2021.

- 1,018, or one-fifth the candidates running, are from the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party

- 2 rounds of voting are scheduled - December 28 and January 11 - with the possibility of another a few weeks later.

- 202 of Myanmar's 330 townships will hold voting in the first two rounds. It is unclear when the rest will be contested, with a civil war raging in many areas. No dates have been set for counting of votes or announcement of results.

- 664 seats are available in the bicameral parliament, with 440 in the lower house and 224 in the upper house.

The plant, located around 300 kilometers (186 miles) northeast of Tokyo on the coast of the Sea of Japan, was shut down after a powerful tsunami destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi reactor in 2011. Both are operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co (9501.T) , opens new tab .

The peaceful coastal area encompassing Kashiwazaki city and Kariwa village, home to around 80,000 people, is gaining attention as the restart of the plant's Unit No. 6 would be the first for TEPCO since the Fukushima disaster.

"The use of nuclear energy is essential in Japan, which has few resources," said TEPCO President Tomoaki Kobayakawa on Monday as he gave top delegates from the Japan Business Federation a tour of the plant.

After the Fukushima disaster, Japan shuttered all 54 nuclear reactors in operation at the time, which left it heavily reliant on fossil fuel imports. Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has said she supports more nuclear relaunches to strengthen energy security and address the cost of imported energy, which accounts for 60% to 70% of Japan's electricity generation.

TEPCO has been improving safety at its nuclear power business, Kobayakawa said, as around 20 staffers - clad in thick blue hazmat suits - performed safety drills at the plant.

But Yukihiko Hoshino, a member of the Kashiwazaki city assembly, said local residents were concerned about the chances of another nuclear accident.

"The biggest worry is whether they will be able to evacuate," he said.

He said there are still people who cannot return home to the Fukushima plant area.

The Niigata assembly's final session of 2025 runs from Tuesday until December 22. TEPCO plans to restart the 1,356-megawatt Unit No. 6 in January, pending the assembly's vote.

It is not clear when the assembly might vote on the plant's restart. TEPCO was looking to restart Unit No. 7 later and possibly decommission the other five.

Of the 54 reactors that were in operation before the Fukushima incident, Japan has restarted 14 of the 33 that remained operable. On its own, Unit No. 6 could improve the supply situation for the energy-hungry Tokyo area by 2%, according to Japan's industry ministry.

After years of decline, Japan's power demand is set to grow thanks to data center expansions and AI-driven businesses.

TEPCO continues to pay compensation for the Fukushima Daiichi disaster.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 09:26:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZOTSHTEFLFI7RIQVHJKCJGGJGE.jpg?auth=c591f4dc6cdb37c29dce3b5731d87941a17e2f16880d9717c69d02882d2c8b4d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy seeks meeting with Trump to hammer out issue of territory</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-seeks-meeting-with-trump-hammer-out-issue-territory-2025-12-24/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called for a meeting with Donald Trump to hammer out the most sensitive issues in a future peace deal with Russia, such as control of territory, following the latest round of U.S.-Ukrainian talks.

In remarks to reporters released by his office on Wednesday, Zelenskiy said Ukrainian and U.S. delegations had inched closer to finalising a 20-point plan at the talks over the weekend in Miami.

"This is a document referred to as a framework – a foundational document on ending the war, a political document between us, America, Europe, and the Russians," Zelenskiy said.

"We are ready for a meeting with the United States at the leaders’ level to address sensitive issues. Matters such as territorial questions must be discussed at the leaders’ level."

U.S. President Trump has long said he wants to end Europe's deadliest war since World War Two, but has so far failed to win substantial concessions from the warring sides.

Kyiv has been pressing Washington to modify a peace plan that, in a draft unveiled last month, echoed Moscow's main demands that Ukraine cede more territory, renounce future military alliances and accept curbs on its forces. Kyiv says that would leave it defenceless against future attacks by Russia, which invaded in 2014 and again at full scale in 2022.

Zelenskiy said that the latest 20-point framework draft was a considerable evolution compared with the 28-point plan discussed earlier by the United States and Russia.

Ukraine would keep its army at its current strength of 800,000, and additional documents agreed with the United States and European allies would provide robust guarantees of its security.

"...We will be able to see a strong Ukraine – supported by the Coalition of the Willing, with a mechanism to monitor compliance with peace and with specifics on how to respond to any potential renewal of aggression by Russia," Zelenskiy said.

Ukrainian and U.S. officials also worked on several documents related to post-war reconstruction and investment, Zelenskiy said.

However, despite the progress, Ukraine and the United States still have not found common ground on territorial issues.

Zelenskiy said that Kyiv's proposal was "to remain where we are”, halting fighting at current battle lines. Moscow, whose forces have been slowly advancing, wants Kyiv to withdraw troops from all of the eastern Donetsk region, around a quarter of which is still under Ukrainian control.

Zelenskiy said Washington was trying to find a compromise and looking to establish a demilitarized zone or a free economic zone in the area.

There was also no agreement on the fate of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Zelenskiy said. Europe's largest nuclear power plant is located in territory under Russian military control near the front line. Zelenskiy said Kyiv was proposing a small economic zone there.

The new 20-point proposal would be studied by Moscow, Zelenskiy said, and then the next steps would be determined.

"We are saying: if all regions are included and if we remain where we are, then we will reach an agreement," Zelenskiy said.

"But if we do not agree to remain where we are, there are two options: either the war continues, or something will have to be decided regarding all potential economic zones."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 10:23:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CQOPC53XD5MSNKKJ33BE3GSOUI.jpg?auth=c2bfe439ef3aeba00c3ddb8ef870361cfef0cf63f6a6ae731b63f2e3836fcdd8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>How a real photo of Donald Trump linked to Jeffrey Epstein was doctored using AI</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251224-real-photo-donald-trump-jeffrey-epstein-doctored-artificial-intelligence</link><description>On December 12, Democratic representatives released 19 photos from the files of New York financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein , who died in prison. The images show a number of well-known people, including Steve Bannon , Woody Allen and Bill Gates . US President Donald Trump appears in three of the photos. None of the images appear to show these public figures engaging in criminal behaviour.

Still, one of the photos featuring Donald Trump sparked a lot of online discussion. The photo, which was likely taken in the 1990s, shows the future president surrounded by six women wearing Hawaiian leis. Black squares cover the women’s faces in order to protect their identities.

Pro-Trump social media users claim that Democrats blacked out the women’s faces purely to make it impossible to determine their ages, so that viewers would be more likely to interpret the image as further indication that the president may have abused underage girls who were victims of Epstein’s sexual trafficking ring.

On December 14, some of these social media users claimed to reveal an uncensored version of the photo, which would clear up questions about the women’s ages.

One pro-Trump social media user, who shared the photo in a post that garnered more than 4,000 likes on Instagram, said:

“Democrats and their lackeys in the media are circulating a picture of Donald Trump with a bunch of young beautiful women wearing Hawaiian leis with faces blacked out to give the implication that Trump was hanging around with underage women supplied by Epstein.

The truth is that the women in the photo were models representing Hawaiian Tropic, the American suntan lotion brand, at an event at Mar-a-Lago.”

Pro-Trump social media users were right to say that the anonymised photo is not proof that Trump abused underage girls. So far, there has been no evidence for such an accusation.

That said, the photo said to show the faces of the women posing with Donald Trump has been digitally altered. If you run the image through a reverse image search (check out one of our handy guides to find out how), then you can find the original, undoctored image.

There are a few details in the image that are clear indications that it was generated by artificial intelligence (AI). First of all, Donald Trump’s right hand is visibly deformed. This is a clue that artificial intelligence has been used to generate the image, as AI struggles to accurately depict details of human anatomy.

Another clue: the undoctored image has a logo at the bottom right. This diamond-shaped logo represents Google’s AI image generator, Nano Banana, which is integrated in Gemini, the company’s AI chatbot. Google Lens also indicates that the image was “created by Google’s AI”. Images generated by Nano Banana have an invisible watermark, which can be detected by SynthID, a detection tool used by Google Lens.

Finally, the image is supposed to show a group of six women standing with Trump. However, there are only five in the AI-generated image.

US tabloid the New York Post published a photo on December 12 that they said showed the uncensored original image, showing the faces of the six women.

The photo published in the New York Post reveals the face of the sixth woman, who disappeared in the AI-generated image. The brown haired woman is standing to the left of the president.

In the photo created by AI, the woman was replaced by Trump’s deformed-looking hand. The faces of the women in the photo published by the New York Post are completely different to those that appear in the AI-generated image.

So what happened? Well, someone probably asked Google’s AI to uncensor the photo of Donald Trump.

This is a dangerous use of this tool, warns open source analyst Tal Hagin on X :

"This is why using AI to enhance blurred or redacted images is dangerous.

AI does not recover hidden details. It hallucinates them. It fills in gaps based on patterns, not reality. That means it can easily manufacture a completely different person’s face.”

This type of content is even more misleading because it is a fake generated from a real photo connected to an event that really took place.

Just as pro-Trump social media users claimed, the women who appear in the photo were models working for Hawaiian Tropic sun lotion, which was revealed by the British newspaper The Telegraph . The paper interviewed one of the women who appears in the photo. She said that she was 22 when the photo was taken, likely in 1998. She added that Trump behaved like a “gentleman”.

The quake shook buildings in the capital, Taipei. The quake had a depth of 11.9 km (7.39 miles), the administration said.

There was not immediate report of damage across Taiwan, the National Fire Agency said.

Taiwan chipmaker TSMC said the quake did not reach the required level for evacuation of factories across the island, which lies near the junction of two tectonic plates and is prone to earthquakes.

Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly complained that ending the Ukraine war - the deadliest in Europe since World War Two - has been the most elusive foreign policy aim of his presidency.

Ukraine and its European allies are worried that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated Ukraine after Russian forces took 12-17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukraine per day in 2025.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that envoy Kirill Dmitriev had briefed Putin on the trip to Miami for contacts with Trump's envoys.

But Peskov refused to be drawn on Russia's reaction to the proposals, or the exact format of the documents, saying that the Kremlin was not going to communicate via the media.

"All the main parameters of the Russian side's position are well known to our colleagues from the United States," Peskov told reporters.

"Now we mean to formulate our position on the basis of the information that was received by the head of state and continue our contacts in the very near future through the existing channels that are currently working."

Putin has said in recent weeks that his conditions for peace are that Ukraine should cede the around 5,000 square km of Donbas that it still controls and that Kyiv should officially renounce its intention to join the NATO military alliance.

Asked about the format of the documents brought back to Moscow by Dmitriev from Miami, Peskov said it was not appropriate to speak to the media about it.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in remarks to reporters released by his office on Wednesday, said Ukrainian and U.S. delegations had inched closer to finalising a 20-point plan at the talks over the weekend in Miami.

But Zelenskiy said Ukraine and the United States had not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas that it still controls - or on the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is controlled by Russian forces.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:19:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XL7LQP2Y4ZKL3MC5EZVHP2SR2Q.jpg?auth=738ef2a259b044ee18a431aa9fae2e30a79ec283865c6accfd215e4f22135b22&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU says it strongly condemns U.S. visa ban on European individuals</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-says-it-strongly-condemns-us-visa-ban-european-individuals-2025-12-24/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The European Commission strongly condemns the U.S. decision to impose a visa ban on five European individuals, including former EU commissioner Thierry Breton , a Commission spokesperson said on Wednesday, adding that the EU had requested clarifications from the U.S. authorities.

The talks come two days after a special meeting in Kuala Lumpur of Southeast Asian foreign ministers convened to try to salvage a truce first brokered by ASEAN chair Malaysia and U.S. President Donald Trump after a previous round of clashes in July

Thai Defence Ministry spokesman Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri said Wednesday's meeting of the General Border Committee would last three days and could pave the way for an agreement.

The talks were held at a border checkpoint towards the southern end of their 817-km (508 mile) frontier.

"If the secretariat meeting goes smoothly and leads to an agreement, then there will be a meeting between the defense ministers of the two countries on December 27," Surasant told reporters.

Cambodian defence ministry spokeswoman Maly Socheata said the talks began at 4.30 pm local time (0930 GMT), led by generals from both sides.

The meeting is the most significant step since fighting re-erupted and follows separate, unsuccessful efforts by Malaysia, China and the United States to bring the two countries to the table.

Cambodia and Thailand have each accused the other of aggression and violations of an enhanced ceasefire reached in October in Malaysia in Trump's presence, during which they committed to demining and withdrawing troops and heavy weapons from areas over which sovereignty has been contested bitterly for decades .

In the run-up to Wednesday's talks, Thailand and Cambodia have continued clashing, with both sides fighting at multiple points since early December, stretching from forested regions near Laos to the coastal provinces of the Gulf of Thailand.

At least 21 civilians have been in killed in Cambodia since the fighting, and more than half a million people displaced, according to national authorities. In Thailand, at least 65 people have lost their lives, with over 150,000 evacuated from their homes.

Cambodia's defence ministry on Wednesday accused Thailand of using fighter jets to drop bombs in its border province of Banteay Meanchey, describing the actions as "brutal" and indiscriminate.

Thailand, on the other hand, said its neighbour continued to fire heavy weapons into civilian areas in Sa Kaeo province on Wednesday, prompting Thai troops to retaliate.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:19:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XOOIJDPVVRL75MRLXXKDF2F7H4.jpg?auth=3ad57bd835d11e2a0844a9f6bc6939329f86ec0e6bfb97091b0361bc88fc4cb7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine unveils 20-point peace proposal under discussion with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-unveils-20-point-peace-proposal-under-discussion-with-us-2025-12-24/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 24 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy outlined for the first time the main points of a draft 20-point framework peace proposal discussed by Ukraine and the United States, which he said could become the basis of future agreements to end war with Russia.

After weeks of talks to modify an earlier 28-point draft seen as supporting many of Russia's main demands, Zelenskiy said that most positions had been brought significantly closer . Ukraine and the United States still had not reached consensus on two main points: control of territory and the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Zelenskiy said, calling for talks with U.S. President Donald Trump to resolve them.

Below are the points of the draft proposal as unveiled by Zelenskiy and shared by his office on Wednesday.

1. Ukraine’s sovereignty will be reaffirmed.

2. This point will envisage a full and unquestionable non-aggression agreement between Russia and Ukraine. It specifies that to sustain long-term peace, a monitoring mechanism will be established to oversee the line of contact through space-based unmanned monitoring, to ensure early notification of violations, and to resolve conflicts.

3. Ukraine will receive robust security guarantees.

4. Ukraine will maintain its armed forces at their present strength of 800,000 personnel. The earlier U.S. draft had called for Ukraine to reduce the size of its forces.

5. The United States, NATO, and European countries will provide Ukraine with security guarantees that mirror Article 5, the mutual-defence clause of NATO's founding treaty.

6. Russia will formalise a policy of non-aggression towards Europe and Ukraine in all necessary laws and all required documents on ratification, including ratification by an overwhelming majority vote in the State Duma.

7. Ukraine will become an EU member at a specifically defined date. Ukraine will also receive short-term preferential access to the European market.

8. Ukraine will receive a strong global development package, which will be defined in a separate agreement on investment and future prosperity.

9. Several funds will be established to address economic recovery, the reconstruction of damaged areas and regions, and humanitarian issues. The objective will be to mobilize $800 billion to help Ukraine fully realize its potential.

10. Ukraine will accelerate the process of concluding a free-trade agreement with the United States. Zelenskiy said the U.S. position was that if Washington were to grant free trade access to Ukraine, it aimed to offer similar terms to Russia.

11. Ukraine will confirm that it will remain a non-nuclear state, in accordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons.

12. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Zelenskiy said no agreement had yet been reached with the United States on the issue of Europe's biggest nuclear power plant, which is located near the front line in territory now controlled by Russian forces. Zelenskiy said the U.S. proposal was for the plant to be operated jointly by Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, each holding equal stakes in a joint enterprise, with the Americans acting as the chief managers. Kyiv's proposal was for the plant to be operated by a 50-50 joint enterprise involving only the United States and Ukraine, with Ukraine receiving half of the energy produced and the United States independently allocating the other half.

13. Ukraine and Russia commit to implementing educational programmes in schools and across society that promote understanding and tolerance toward different cultures and eliminate racism and prejudice. Ukraine will implement European Union rules on religious tolerance and the protection of minority languages.

14. Territory: Zelenskiy said that this was the most complex point, and as yet unresolved. Russia wants Ukraine to withdraw troops from territory Ukraine still controls in the eastern Donetsk region. Kyiv wants fighting to be halted at current battle lines. Washington has proposed demilitarised zones and a free economic zone in the part of the Donetsk region that Kyiv controls.

15. After reaching an agreement on future territorial arrangements, both Russia and Ukraine undertake not to alter these agreements by force.

16. Russia will not obstruct Ukraine from using the Dnipro River and the Black Sea for commercial purposes. A separate maritime agreement and an access agreement will be concluded, covering freedom of navigation and transport. The Kinburn Spit, along the Dnipro's outlet to the sea, will be demilitarized.

17. A humanitarian committee will be established to resolve outstanding issues:

a. All remaining prisoners of war will be exchanged on the principle of All for All.

b. All civilian detainees and hostages will be returned, including children.

c. Provisions will be made to address the suffering of victims from the conflict.

18. Ukraine must hold elections as soon as possible after the signing of the agreement.

19. This agreement will be legally binding. Its implementation will be monitored and guaranteed by a Peace Council, chaired by President Trump. Ukraine, Europe, NATO, Russia, and the United States will be part of this mechanism. Sanctions will apply in case of violations.

20. Once all parties agree to this agreement, a full ceasefire will take effect immediately.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 11:19:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VASJ5SDZMBID7PAKTMEHP7QYFA.jpg?auth=0fd2fce4ad7b422504504338e1d9a6802b426d41afed5f9fa4450b7401f01d3b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey, Hamas discuss Gaza ceasefire deal's second phase, Turkish source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-hamas-discuss-gaza-ceasefire-deals-second-phase-turkish-source-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan on Wednesday met with Hamas political bureau officials in Ankara to discuss the ceasefire in Gaza and advancing the agreement to its second phase, a Turkish Foreign Ministry source said.

As early as November the avenues are garlanded with lights and the streets are packed with holiday shoppers.

Many traiteurs (delicatessens) and butchers have been busy for weeks taking orders for delicacies that will soon be set out on dinner tables, with people splurging on expensive treats for the end-of-year holidays.

Historically, Christmas Eve dinner was the big, traditional meal served after a nighttime church service that worshippers sat through on a nearly empty stomach. Since the Middle Ages, midnight Mass has been preceded by a meagre meal; it was customary to eat only a little bread, fish or vegetable broth and drink a glass of water.

Though fewer people now attend midnight Mass, the tradition of a big Christmas Eve and New Year’s meal has survived.

Throughout the holiday season, supermarket shelves are stacked to the ceiling with cans and jars of foie gras , a French specialty of fattened duck or goose liver, with pâté often served as a starter on warm toast alongside some jam – or chutney – often made from onion or fig.

Though many have stopped eating foie gras because of the way the birds’ livers are artificially fattened through force-feeding (known as gavage), it remains one of the most popular food items for a Christmas meal and France remains its largest producer by far.

Literally translated as “fat liver”, foie gras originated in ancient Egypt some 4,500 years ago before it spread throughout the Mediterranean and was adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans. In the Middle Ages, the tradition of gavage was continued by the Jewish population, since goose meat was viewed as a good source of nutrition and its cooking fat conformed to religious dietary restrictions.

The popularity of foie gras grew during the Renaissance, when it became associated with the kings of France. The term “ foyes gras ” was coined during the reign of Louis XIV and it was served at royal banquets under Louis XV, but it was Louis XVI who declared it the “dish of kings".

Foie gras is also often served pan roasted, sliced over a cut of meat or as a sauce. It is produced in winter, and its high price makes it a luxurious holiday product for year-end festivities.

For those who do not eat foie gras , other common starters at a French Christmas or New Year’s dinner are smoked salmon, scallops ( coquilles Saint-Jacques ), shrimp or oysters.

The French are among the largest consumers of oysters in the world, eating around 85,000 tonnes each year, a large portion of which are consumed at the Christmas dinner table.

Oysters are easy to find in France, with its long coastline, and are relatively inexpensive for a holiday dish. They are most often served fresh on shaved ice with a red wine and shallot vinaigrette (sometimes known as a mignonette ) or simply a wedge of lemon.

It is a French custom to eat oysters only during months that have an "r" in their names – September through April. This is not only because they taste best during this period but due to habit – long before refrigerated transportation methods were invented, oysters could only be shipped inland from the sea during the cold winter months if they were to stay fresh and not spoil before being served.

Salmon, lobster, crayfish and other seafood are also traditionally eaten in winter for the same reason. But unlike oysters, these are relatively expensive.

Much like in the United States or Great Britain, a traditional staple of a French Christmas dinner is stuffed poultry.

Before the turkey arrived in Europe from the Americas in the 17th century, the French ate stuffed goose. But the turkey has mostly replaced the goose as the holiday bird of choice because it is less expensive, yet larger and meatier than a plain old chicken.

The turkey’s main advantage is its size (one can weigh up to 18 kilogrammes) for big family feasts.

A smaller but succulent fowl that is very popular in France during the holidays is the capon ( chapon in French), a cockerel that was neutered to render its meat fattier and usually weighing 3-4 kilogrammes, or else the even smaller guinea fowl ( pintade ).

Whatever bird is chosen, it is generally roasted and served with a special Christmas stuffing that traditionally includes chestnuts and mushrooms.

Other holiday main dishes in France include roasted meats, such as lamb or beef, and also game such as doe, wild boar, venison or pheasant, which are not usually eaten year-round by French people who are not hunters.

No Christmas meal in France is complete without a bûche de Noël , otherwise known as the Yule log cake.

The bûche is an elaborate creation made of a rolled sponge cake filled with cream – or ice cream – and frosted to look like tree bark on a log.

It is a reminder of an earlier tradition, dating back to the Iron Age, when people in Europe would gather to welcome the winter solstice on December 21, the longest night of the year. Families would burn large logs, usually from fruit trees, anointed with wine and salt and decorated with pine cones, holly or ivy. The log kept the house warm, and its ashes were said to have medicinal benefits and to guard against evil.

Other Christmas desserts in France include gingerbread, served in the form of a spiced loaf cake or soft biscuit called pain d’épices, as well as chocolate. Traditionally, well-behaved children were given chocolate and other sweets on December 6, the day of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children.

Gradually, the tradition of Saint Nicholas disappeared in most French regions except for the east, and the ritual giving of chocolate and pain d’épices was incorporated into Christmas.

While the traditional festive feasts are normally enjoyed at home, there are other treats to enjoy outside at Christmas markets. Chief among them is mulled wine, simply known as vin chaud or "hot wine".

Vin chaud is popular across Europe and was historically the only alcoholic drink served at the Christmas markets in France's eastern Alsace region. It is made with red or white wine gently heated with sugar and spices including cinnamon, cloves and star anise. A non-alcoholic version made with apple juice is also popular.

As the best way to see Christmas decorations that light up French towns and cities is after dark when temperatures drop, a piping hot mug of vin chaud is a great way to stay warm while enjoying the festive atmosphere.

His office said in a statement that Hamas must fully uphold the October agreement , noting that it envisaged the militant group being removed from power in Gaza as well as demilitarisation and deradicalisation of the territory.

"Israel will respond accordingly," the statement added.

The Israeli military earlier said that an explosive device had detonated against a military vehicle in the southern Rafah area of Gaza and that one officer had been lightly injured.

Violence has subsided but not stopped since the Gaza truce took effect on October 10, and the sides have regularly accused each other of violating the ceasefire. Gaza's health ministry says Israel has killed more than 400 people in the territory since the ceasefire went into effect.

A 20-point plan issued by U.S. President Donald Trump in September calls for an initial truce followed by steps towards a wider peace. It ultimately calls for Hamas to disarm and have no governing role in Gaza and for Israel to pull out of the territory, which remains in ruins after two years of war.

The sides have not fully agreed to everything in it. Hamas has said it will only hand over its arms if a Palestinian state is established.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HCKBAHWSPFJDRCBI6FMO4U2JTE.jpg?auth=919ab1fb25fcadb82580462e38cb69cc04f8259dae05f12e73e169699964a00f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US actions will not stop EU from moderating online hate and disinformation, commissioner says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251224-us-actions-will-not-stop-eu-moderating-online-hate-disinformation-commissioner-says</link><description>The European Union 's commissioner in charge of the bloc's single market said Wednesday that US sanctions won't stop him from doing his work after the Trump administration placed a visa ban on his predecessor for trying to regulate big tech companies.

"My predecessor @ThierryBreton acted in the interest of the European general good, faithful to the mandate given by the voters in 2019," Stéphane Séjourné , European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, said on X.

"No sanction will silence the sovereignty of the European peoples. Total solidarity with him and all affected Europeans," he said.

Macron also voiced his support for Breton in a post on X.

"I have just spoken with @ThierryBreton and thanked him for his significant contributions in the service of Europe. We will stand firm against pressure and will protect Europeans.

"We will not give up, and ‌we will protect Europe's independence ‍and the freedom of Europeans," he wrote on the social media platform.

The US State Department said Tuesday it would deny visas to Breton and four activists, accusing them of seeking to "coerce" American social media platforms into censoring viewpoints they oppose.

The President of the European Commission , Ursula von der Leyen , said the EU will keep ⁠protecting freedom of speech following the strong reaction from the French government.

"Freedom of speech ​is the foundation of our strong and vibrant ‌European democracy. We are ‍proud of it. We will protect it," she said on X.

Breton, a Frenchman, was described by the US State Department as the "mastermind" of the European Union's Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes content moderation and other standards on major social media platforms operating in Europe.

Breton, who left the European Commission in 2024, on X slammed the ban as a "witch hunt," comparing the situation to the US McCarthy era when officials were chased out of government for alleged ties to communism.

The DSA has become a rallying point for US conservatives who see it as a weapon of censorship against right-wing thought in Europe and beyond, an accusation the EU furiously denies.

"The Digital Services Act was democratically adopted in Europe. It has absolutely no extraterritorial reach and in no way affects the United States," French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot said on X.

The visa ban also targeted Imran Ahmed of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit that fights online misinformation, as well as Anna-Lena von Hodenberg and Josephine Ballon of HateAid, a German organization that the State Department said functions as a trusted flagger for enforcing the DSA. Clare Melford, who leads the UK-based Global Disinformation Index (GDI), was also on the list.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 14:47:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0d164d12-e0cd-11f0-83d4-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24085394195061.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Democrats urge Trump to reverse mass ambassador recalls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-urge-trump-reverse-mass-ambassador-recalls-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Democratic senators urged President Donald Trump on Wednesday to reverse a recall of nearly 30 career ambassadors, warning the move leaves a dangerous leadership vacuum that allows adversaries like Russia and China to expand their reach.

The Trump administration in recent days has ordered more than two dozen career diplomats serving across Europe, Asia, Africa and Latin America back to Washington to ensure U.S. missions abroad reflect its "America First" priorities.

Calling the abrupt mass recalls an "unprecedented move" that no other administration has done since Congress established the modern Foreign Service a century ago, 10 Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said there was no plan to replace them with qualified candidates.

The removals bring the number of empty U.S. ambassadorial posts to well over 100, about half of all such posts worldwide, the senators said in their letter addressed to Trump and seen by Reuters. The senators said 80 posts had been vacant before the decision.

State Department and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the letter. A senior department official on Monday described the mass recall as "a standard process in any administration."

"As the over 100 U.S. embassies lacking senior leadership await a new U.S. ambassador, China, Russia and others will maintain regular communications with the foreign leaders that we will have effectively abandoned, allowing our adversaries to expand their reach and influence to limit, and even harm, U.S. interests," Democrats said in their letter.

The senators, who included Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Jeanne Shaheen, Chris Murphy and others, provided examples of how Washington would lack top-level U.S. presence in crucial locations as Beijing and Moscow make inroads.

In regions from the Indo-Pacific to Africa and the Balkans as well as Latin America, Washington would be on the back foot countering China's expanding economic reach, the senators said.

"These ambassadors have demonstrated their commitment to faithfully execute the policies of administrations of both parties for decades," the senators said. "We urge you to reverse this decision immediately before more damage is done to America’s standing in the world."

Political appointees leave their posts when a new administration takes office but career diplomats, while serving at the pleasure of the president, are often considered bipartisan and typically serve three to four years in their overseas posts regardless of a change in government.

But Trump has long been suspicious of the bureaucracy and has repeatedly pledged to "clean out the deep state" by firing bureaucrats whom he deems disloyal and placing loyalists in senior roles.

In February, Trump ordered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to revamp the U.S. foreign service to ensure that the Republican president's foreign policy is "faithfully" implemented.

In July, the Trump administration fired more than 1,300 State Department diplomats and civil servants as Washington grappled with multiple crises on the world stage: Russia's war in Ukraine, the almost two-year-long Gaza conflict, and the Middle East on edge due to high tension between Israel and Iran.

The Department's total workforce reduction in the U.S. totaled roughly 3,000 after deferred resignations and early retirements, accounting for more than 11% of its total foreign and civil service officers.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:22:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q7DQQFQRUNKTPA2BBT3PNXX6LQ.jpg?auth=ca9c7c733eceab8a2bbf0cbc96aede3089de28d4424bc2b5be36a4676df5ca3a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK government says it backs free speech after US visa bans</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-government-says-it-backs-free-speech-after-us-visa-bans-2025-12-24/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Britain is committed to upholding the right to free speech, a government spokesperson said on Wednesday in response to a decision by the United States to impose visa bans on anti-disinformation campaigners.

The Falcon 50 aircraft requested an emergency landing because of electrical failure minutes after it took off from the Turkish capital Ankara on Tuesday, but contact was lost, Turkish officials said. The plane was returning to Tripoli .

The wreckage was located by Turkish security personnel in the Haymana district near Ankara.

Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the crash site that the plane's voice recorder and the flight data recorder (black box) had been recovered.

"The examination and evaluation processes of these devices have been initiated," he said.

Turkey's Transport Minister Abdulkadir Uraloglu said later on X: "The analysis of the voice recorder and flight data recorder to determine the cause of the aircraft's crash will be carried out in a neutral country."

The findings would be shared "with our nation and the entire world with full transparency", he added.

Lieutenant General Mohammed al-Haddad and four other aides were returning to Tripoli after holding talks in Ankara with Turkish military officials. There were eight people aboard the plane including three crew members.

Libya's Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah expressed "deep sadness and great sorrow" over the death of the army chief.

Yerlikaya said the bodies were still at the crash site that covers approximately three square kilometres (one square mile), adding that a 22-member Libyan delegation including five relatives of the deceased had arrived in Ankara.

"We pray for God's mercy upon those who lost their lives in this tragic accident and extend our condolences to their families," he added.

A total of 408 personnel from the government's disaster agency AFAD, police and health services are at the scene, the minister said, while the real-time imagery from the area is being relayed by drones.

Turkish officials said the Ankara prosecutor's office has launched an investigation into the incident.

Tolga Tuzun Inan of Istanbul-based Bahcesehir University said a single electrical failure would not leave an aircraft completely dark.

"When multiple triggering factors combine with meteorological conditions, such a situation may occur," he told the private NTV broadcaster.

He said data from the black box would reveal what happened, but cautioned that the analysis process could take several months.

Haddad had been the army's chief of general staff since August 2020 and was appointed by then-prime minister Fayez al-Sarraj.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan offered condolences over the loss of lives during a phone call with Prime Minister Dbeibah, his office said.

Libya is split between a UN-recognised government in Tripoli, led by Dbeibah, and commander Khalifa Haftar 's administration in the east.

The North African country has been divided since a NATO-backed revolt toppled and killed longtime leader Moamer Kadhafi in 2011.

Turkey has close ties with the UN-backed government in Tripoli, to which it provides economic and military support.

But Ankara has recently also reached out to the rival administration in the east, with the head of Turkey's intelligence agency, Ibrahim Kalin, meeting with Haftar in Benghazi in August.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 15:25:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/885f13c4-e0d6-11f0-8e55-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25358296781818.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's Macron says he discussed Ukraine with NATO head Rutte</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/frances-macron-says-he-discussed-ukraine-with-nato-head-rutte-2025-12-24/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 24 (Reuters) - France's President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday he had spoken with NATO chief Mark Rutte to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the work undertaken by the Coalition of the Willing.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted calls to establish a state commission to investigate Israel's failures in the run-up to its deadliest day and has taken no responsibility for the attack that sparked the two-year Gaza war .

His ruling coalition voted on Wednesday to advance a bill which grants parliament members the authority to pick panel members for an inquiry and gives Netanyahu's cabinet the power to set its mandate.

Critics say the move circumvents Israel's 1968 Commissions of Inquiry Law, under which the president of the Supreme Court appoints an independent panel to investigate major state failures such as those which preceded the 1973 Yom Kippur war .

Survivors and relatives of those hurt in the Hamas attack have launched a campaign against the proposed probe, saying only a state commission can bring those accountable to justice.

"This is a day of disaster for us all," said Eyal Eshel, who lost his daughter when Hamas militants overran the army base where she served. "Justice must be done and justice will be done," he said at the Knesset, before the vote.

Surveys have shown wide public support for the establishment of a state commission into the country's biggest security lapse in decades.

Netanyahu said on Monday that a panel appointed in line with the new bill, by elected officials from both the opposition and the coalition, would be independent and win broad public trust.

But Israel's opposition has already said it will not cooperate with what it describes as an attempt by Netanyahu's coalition to cover up the truth rather than reveal it, arguing that the investigation would ultimately be controlled by Netanyahu and his coalition.

The new bill says that if the politicians fail to agree on the panel, its make-up will be decided by the head of parliament, who is allied with Netanyahu and is a member of his Likud party.

Jon Polin, whose son Hersh Goldberg-Polin was taken hostage and found slain by his captors with five other hostages in a Hamas tunnel in August 2024, said only a trusted commission could restore security and unite a nation still traumatized.

"I support a state commission, not to see anyone punished and not because it will bring back my only son, no. I support a state commission so that nothing like what happened to my son, can ever happen to your son, or your daughter, or your parents," Polin said on Sunday at a news conference with other families.

Hersh Goldberg-Polin was among dozens of hostages taken in the 2023 attack from the site of the Nova music festival.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:26:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QRJUDNE3CFJYTEYUFBMK7YTZKY.jpg?auth=208567b24f702d3a500b1ad6847eee898fe9e72daa61b19976acf4dae90f3307&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Majority of Russians expect Ukraine war to end in 2026, state pollster says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/majority-russians-expect-ukraine-war-end-2026-state-pollster-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 24 (Reuters) - A majority of Russians expect the war in Ukraine to end in 2026, state pollster VTsIOM said on Wednesday, in a sign that the Kremlin could be testing public reaction to a possible peace settlement as diplomatic efforts to end the conflict intensify.

During the pollster's year-end presentation, VTsIOM Deputy Head Mikhail Mamonov said 70% of the 1,600 respondents saw 2026 as a more "successful" year for Russia than this year, while for 55% that hope was linked to a possible end to what Russia calls its "special military operation" in Ukraine.

"The main reason for optimism is the possible completion of the special military operation and the achievement of the stated objectives, in line with the national interests outlined by the president," Mamonov said at the presentation.

In its previous year-end polls, VTsIOM emphasised the consolidation of Russian society around President Vladimir Putin and his military goals in Ukraine but gave no figures for the share of the population expecting the war to end.

The Ukraine war, which started in February 2022, is nearing its fifth year, but the real level of Russian public fatigue with the conflict is difficult to measure due to strict state controls on dissent.

Mamonov cited the Russian army's ongoing offensive in Ukraine, U.S. reluctance to finance Ukraine and the European Union's inability to fully replace the United States financially and militarily as the main factors behind the prospects for an eventual peace agreement.

After the end of military hostilities, he added, the reintegration of veterans of the "special military operation" into society and the reconstruction of Russian-controlled regions of Ukraine, as well as Russian border regions, are seen as the main priorities.

Some two thirds of Russians support peace talks, the highest share since the start of the war, according to independent pollster Levada, which has been branded a "foreign agent" under Russian law during the conflict.

The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Putin has been briefed about his officials' contacts with President Donald Trump's envoys on U.S. proposals for a possible Ukrainian peace deal and that Moscow would now formulate its position.

Putin has said in recent weeks that his conditions for peace are that Ukraine should cede the roughly 5,000 square km of Donbas that it still controls and that Kyiv should officially renounce its intention to join the NATO military alliance.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on December 22 that negotiations conducted with the United States and European nations aimed at ending the war with Russia were " very close to a real result".

On Wednesday, Zelenskiy called for a meeting with Trump to hammer out the most sensitive issues in a future peace deal , including control of territory.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:27:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z6NCRVZ3MBNUZFOOX4LKC37PUI.jpg?auth=2d15cc2e61e9c2fcf982cbf52a1a2a5fa5a0b1b99d409ba3aafac5e2705f86f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In Peru, record 34 candidates are presidential hopefuls amid political distrust</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-record-34-candidates-are-presidential-hopefuls-amid-political-distrust-2025-12-24/</link><description>LIMA, Dec 24 (Reuters) - At least 34 candidates have registered to compete in Peru's 2026 presidential election, the electoral office said on Wednesday, a record number for a country that has been defined by political volatility in recent years, with many former leaders imprisoned or ousted.

The candidates for the April 12 election include a comedian, a former soccer player, and Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of late former president Alberto Fujimori, who is planning to run for the fourth time.

In the last presidential election in 2021, 18 candidates participated.

The electoral office will publish the final list of candidates on March 14, said its head Roberto Burneo at a press conference. Any Peruvian can file an objection against a candidate and claim they do not meet legal requirements.

Presidential terms in Peru have often been cut short amid impeachments, resignations or accusations of corruption. Dina Boluarte's midnight removal last October made her the sixth consecutive president in Peru to fail to complete a full term.

The last president to finish a term was Ollanta Humala, who served from 2011 to 2016, but received a 15-year prison sentence for money laundering earlier this year.

The list of registered candidates includes the former right-wing mayor of Lima, Rafael López Aliaga, known as "Porky" for his resemblance to a famous cartoon character.

Conservative Fujimori will try again after attempts in 2011, 2016 and 2021, when she was defeated by leftist Pedro Castillo, who was impeached and arrested in late 2022.

Other candidates include Vladimir Cerrón, a fugitive from justice and leader of the Marxist party Peru Libre that brought Castillo to the presidency, Carlos Álvarez, a popular comedian and impersonator of former presidents, George Forsyth, a former soccer goalkeeper, and Mario Vizcarra, brother of jailed former president Martín Vizcarra.

With distrust high in traditional parties and politicians, an Ipsos Peru poll released last Sunday indicated that almost half of Peruvians (48%) do not know who to vote for, will cancel their ballot or do not have a favorite candidate.

As such, it is likely there will be no outright winner in the election's first round and that it will go to a run-off on June 7, according to analysts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 16:50:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FRWEP3OSZRLETLOIQZKYEPPO7Y.jpg?auth=b08521fc3e04c3c8017b5e919b34a943b10e3244893e05c89ffa7d6206ca2b45&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Algerian parliament brands French colonisation a crime, demands apology and reparations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251224-algerian-parliament-brands-french-colonisation-state-crime-demands-apology-reparations</link><description>Algeria 's parliament unanimously approved on Wednesday a law declaring France 's colonisation of the country a "state crime" and demanding an apology and reparations.

Standing in the chamber, lawmakers wearing scarves in the colours of the national flag chanted, "Long live Algeria" as they applauded the passage of the bill, which states that France holds "legal responsibility for its colonial past in Algeria and the tragedies it caused".

The vote comes as the two countries are embroiled in a major diplomatic crisis , and while analysts say the move is largely symbolic it is still politically significant.

Parliament speaker Brahim Boughali told the APS state news agency before the vote that it would send "a clear message, both internally and externally, that Algeria's national memory is neither erasable nor negotiable".

The legislation lists the "crimes of French colonisation", including nuclear tests, extrajudicial killings, "physical and psychological torture" and the "systematic plundering of resources".

It states that "full and fair compensation for all material and moral damages caused by French colonisation is an inalienable right of the Algerian state and people".

France's rule over Algeria from 1830 until 1962 remains a sore spot in relations between the two countries. The period was marked by mass killings and large-scale deportations , all the way up to the bloody war of independence from 1954-1962.

Algeria says the war killed 1.5 million people while French historians put the death toll lower, at 500,000 in total, some 400,000 of them Algerian.

French President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged the colonisation of Algeria as a " crime against humanity " but has stopped short of offering an apology.

Asked last week about the vote, French foreign ministry spokesman Pascal Confavreux said he would not comment on "political debates taking place in foreign countries".

Hosni Kitouni, a researcher in colonial history at the University of Exeter in the UK, said that "legally, this law has no international scope and therefore is not binding for France".

But "its political and symbolic significance is important: It marks a rupture in the relationship with France in terms of memory," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 17:19:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ab50486-e097-11f0-9917-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23333627271030.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss prosecutors drop probe into banking blog</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/swiss-prosecutors-drop-probe-into-banking-blog-2025-12-24/</link><description>ZURICH, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Zurich have ended an investigation into a leading Swiss banking blog whose offices were raided this summer on suspicion it had breached banking secrecy laws.

Police had searched the offices and home of the founder of Zurich-based blog Inside Paradeplatz, confiscating a laptop, a mobile phone and documents in a probe over reporting published in 2016 about a former boss of bank Raiffeisen Switzerland.

Based on later findings by a Zurich court that reasonable suspicion against the founder was not met, and that protection of journalistic sources prohibited use of the evidence gathered, prosecutors for the canton of Zurich decided to drop the probe.

In a statement, prosecutors said the proceedings were discontinued on December 8 after a further review, but noted that the order was not yet legally binding.

The raid on the blog stirred concern among advocates of press freedom in Switzerland.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 17:44:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Blast hits mosque during evening prayers in Nigeria’s Maiduguri, witness says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/blast-hits-mosque-during-evening-prayers-nigerias-maiduguri-witness-2025-12-24/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Dec 24 (Reuters) - An explosion tore through a mosque during evening prayers on Wednesday in Maiduguri, the capital of Nigeria’s Borno state, a Reuters witness said. There was no immediate word on casualties or official comment.

The blast occurred in a city that has been at the heart of an Islamist insurgency waged by Boko Haram and its offshoot Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) for nearly two decades which has killed tens of thousands and displaced millions across the northeast.

No group has claimed responsibility, but militants have previously targeted mosques and crowded places in Maiduguri in suicide bombings and improvised explosive device attacks.

Boko Haram launched its uprising in Borno state in 2009, seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate. Despite military offensives and regional cooperation, sporadic attacks continue to threaten civilians in the northeast.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 18:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why all the running?

Why the trend? Is it a mere post-pandemic fad, or the sign of something deeper?

We think of running as a solitary pursuit, but it's increasingly a social activity. Running clubs are particularly in vogue among the young, who seek a release from a life that's increasingly happening in front of a screen.

Technology is also seeping into the experience, be it with equipment, monitors or apps , to the point that some bemoan the gamification of running.

So what's running about: a pursuit or an escape? Goals to achieve or the experience of the journey?

"We, States of Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and the United Kingdom condemn the approval by the Israeli security cabinet of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank," said a joint statement released by the French foreign ministry.

"We recall our clear opposition to any form of annexation and to the expansion of settlement policies," it added.

On Sunday, Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced the authorities had greenlit the settlements, saying the move was aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state.

In their statement, the countries stressed such unilateral actions "violate international law" and risk undermining a fragile ceasefire in Gaza as mediators push for the implementation of the second phase of the truce.

The countries urged Israel "to reverse this decision, as well as the expansion of settlements".

They also reaffirmed their "unwavering commitment to a comprehensive, just and lasting peace based on the two-state solution... where two democratic states, Israel and Palestine, live side-by-side in peace and security".

Israel has occupied the West Bank following a war in 1967.

Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents.

Earlier this month, the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the West Bank – all of which are illegal under international law – had reached its highest level since at least 2017.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 19:19:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1cb306c8-e0f7-11f0-9867-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25339610597954.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>White House orders U.S. forces focus on 'quarantine' of Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/white-house-orders-us-forces-focus-quarantine-venezuela-2025-12-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - The White House has ordered U.S. military forces to focus almost exclusively on enforcing the "quarantine" of Venezuela, a U.S. official told Reuters on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump's administration began releasing files related to criminal investigations of Epstein, the late American financier who was friends with Trump in the 1990s, to comply with a law passed by Congress last month.

Republicans and Democrats in Congress passed the law over Trump's objections, requiring that all documents be released by December 19 while allowing partial redactions to protect victims.

Releases so far have contained extensive redactions, angering some Republicans and doing little to defuse a scandal threatening the party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

In a message shared on social media on Wednesday, the Justice Department said more than a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein had been uncovered by the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, without elaborating on when or how the documents were found.

"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible," the department said. "Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 20:23:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ILFJKU4RBI2JEN73NHPR7JWBE.jpg?auth=9870531b243b02eb90743d6cbd5cb89d9c1eb3be566a5196ab8c69edad16adf1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed in blast at mosque in northeast Nigeria</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251224-several-killed-in-blast-at-mosque-in-northeast-nigeria</link><description>An explosion ripped through a mosque in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri and killed at least seven worshippers Wednesday, witnesses and security sources told AFP.

No armed groups immediately claimed responsibility for what anti-jihadist militia leader Babakura Kolo said was a suspected bombing.

Maiduguri is the capital of Borno state, home to a years-long insurgency by jihadist groups Boko Haram and an offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province, though the city itself has not seen a major attack in years.

The bomb went off inside a crowded mosque in the city's Gamboru market, as Muslim faithful gathered for evening prayers around 6:00 pm (1700 GMT), according to witnesses.

One of the leaders of the mosque, Malam Abuna Yusuf, put the toll at eight dead, though officials have not yet released a casualty count.

"We can confirm there has been an explosion," police spokesman Nahum Daso told AFP, adding that an explosive ordnance disposal team was already on-site.

Kolo said that seven were killed.

He said it was suspected that the bomb was placed inside the mosque and exploded midway through prayers, while some witnesses described a suicide bombing .

It was not immediately clear how many people were injured, though witness Isa Musa Yusha'u told AFP: "I saw many victims being taken away for medical treatment."

Videos taken in the aftermath and seen by AFP showed a person covered in blood writhing on the ground, and what appeared to be bodies covered by a sheet.

A security alert sent by an international NGO to its staff in Maiduguri, seen by AFP, advised its workers to stay away from the Gamboru market area.

Nigeria has been battling a jihadist insurgency since 2009 in a conflict that has killed at least 40,000 and displaced around two million from their homes in the northeast, according to the UN .

Though the violence has waned since its peak a decade ago, it has spilt into neighbouring Niger, Chad and Cameroon .

And concerns are growing about a resurgence of violence in parts of the northeast, where insurgent groups remain capable of mounting deadly attacks despite years of sustained military operations.

Maiduguri itself – once the scene of nightly gun battles and bombings -- has been calm in recent years, with the last major attack recorded in 2021.

But reminders of the conflict are never far off in the state capital, where major military operations are headquartered.

Military pick-ups lumber through town daily, their beds filled with soldiers whose helmets shield them from the hot afternoon sun.

Evening checkpoints are still in effect, even as markets that once closed in the early afternoon throng into the night.

Meanwhile, in the countryside, the insurgency continues to rage, with analysts warning of an uptick in jihadist violence this year.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 20:25:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/edad9848-e0fb-11f0-aa07-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25077805366921.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump-backed Asfura wins Honduras presidency after weeks of delays in disputed election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-backed-asfura-wins-honduras-presidency-after-weeks-delays-disputed-2025-12-24/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Dec 24 - Nasry Asfura, the conservative National Party candidate backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, has won Honduras' presidential election, the electoral body said on Wednesday as it finally declared a victor of the November 30 presidential election after weeks of delays, technical problems, and allegations of fraud.

The electoral authority, known as the CNE, said Asfura had won 40.3% of the vote, edging out center-right Liberal Party candidate Salvador Nasralla who garnered 39.5%.

The DOJ began releasing records last week from the investigation into Epstein, a wealthy financier who died in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial for sex trafficking underage girls.

The Epstein Files Transparency Act passed nearly unanimously by Congress last month and signed into law by President Donald Trump mandated the release of all of the Epstein files by December 19.

The Justice Department failed to meet that deadline, however, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche blaming the delay on the need to painstakingly redact the identities of Epstein's victims from the files.

The DOJ said Wednesday it would need a "few more weeks" to sort and redact the new material.

It said the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York and the FBI had "uncovered over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case."

"We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible," the DOJ said on X.

Electoral authorities declared Asfura the victor of the November 30 presidential election after weeks of delays, technical problems and allegations of fraud.

Trump threw his support behind Asfura, a 67-year-old politician and businessman who is the former mayor of the capital Tegucigalpa, writing in a Truth Social post before the election that he was the "only real friend of Freedom in Honduras" and urging people to vote for him.

Trump also threatened to cut off U.S. financial support to Honduras if Asfura did not win. Despite casting himself as a foe of illegal drugs, Trump also pardoned former President Juan Orlando Hernandez, who was from Asfura's National Party and had been serving a 45-year sentence in the U.S. after his conviction on drug trafficking and firearms charges.

"The United States urges all parties to respect the confirmed results so that Honduran authorities may swiftly ensure a peaceful transition of authority to President-Elect Nasry Asfura," U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said in a statement.

"We look forward to working with his incoming administration to advance our bilateral and regional security cooperation, end illegal immigration to the United States, and strengthen the economic ties between our two countries."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:20:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2W4BRUNMIRN7JMP2T2CVU6MYQ4.jpg?auth=39bd47d32fae6ef33d1494402e83eb82d191538e4c6c3c4b0ef4d1778e89c777&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, Canada, Germany and others condemn Israel's West Bank settlement plan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/uk-canada-germany-others-condemn-israels-west-bank-settlement-plan-2025-12-24/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Countries including Britain, Canada, Germany and others on Wednesday condemned the Israeli security cabinet's approval of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank , saying they violated international law and risked fuelling instability.

"We call on Israel to reverse this decision, as well as the expansion of settlements," said a joint statement released by Britain, Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway and Spain.

"We recall that such unilateral actions, as part of a wider intensification of the settlement policies in the West Bank, not only violate international law but also risk fuelling instability," the statement said.

Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar rejected the statement by foreign countries in an X post on Wednesday, saying the decision aimed to help address security threats faced by Israel.

"Foreign governments will not restrict the right of Jews to live in the Land of Israel, and any such call is morally wrong and discriminatory against Jews," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KXUYSUG7LVJZVMMI5RYKPSUWSE.jpg?auth=608166132b0197fc8804149d94583381dfe955645c18ac912fdff54acd778bf9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE agents involved in Maryland shooting, injuring two</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/ice-agents-involved-maryland-shooting-injuring-two-2025-12-24/</link><description>Dec 24 (Reuters) - Federal immigration agents were involved in a shooting on Wednesday that left one person shot and wounded and another with injuries, authorities said.

The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees federal immigration officers, said in a statement that ICE agents were carrying out an operation to target two men in the U.S. illegally in Glen Burnie, Maryland, just south of Baltimore.

When the agents approached a van carrying the two men, the driver drove the van into agents' vehicles, and then drove the van directly at ICE officers in an attempt to run them over, DHS said.

The agents then "defensively fired their service weapons, striking the driver," DHS wrote. The van then wrecked between two buildings and injured the passenger. Both men were taken to a hospital.

ABC News, citing the Anne Arundel County Police Department, reported the man who was shot was in stable condition, and the other man did not suffer serious injury.

The Anne Arundel County Police Department, which is investigating the shooting, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Maryland Governor Wes Moore, a Democrat, wrote on social media he was "aware of the ICE-involved shooting that occurred earlier today" and his office was working with local officials to learn more and provide support.

Federal immigration officers have been involved in several confrontations with both the subjects of their raids and people witnessing and objecting to their tactics as they work to carry out President Donald Trump's mass deportation plan.

ICE agents in September shot and killed a man who they said had tried to run them over with a car, though security and body camera footage raised doubts about the situation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo, on Christmas Eve, says denying help to poor is rejecting God</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-christmas-eve-says-denying-help-poor-is-rejecting-god-2025-12-24/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Pope Leo said in a Christmas Eve sermon on Wednesday that the story of Jesus being born in a stable because there was no room at an inn should remind Christians that refusing to help the poor and strangers today is tantamount to rejecting God himself.

Leo, who has made care for immigrants and the poor key themes of his early papacy, said Jesus' birth showed God's presence in every person as the pontiff led the world's 1.4 billion Catholics into Christmas at a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica.

"On earth, there is no room for God if there is no room for the human person. To refuse one is to refuse the other," said the pope during the solemn service, attended by about 6,000 inside the basilica.

Leo, the first U.S.-born pope, is celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world's cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis .

The pope, who has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump 's divisive immigrant crackdown, quoted a line from the late Pope Benedict XVI lamenting that the world does not care for children, the poor or foreigners.

"While a distorted economy leads us to treat human beings as mere merchandise, God becomes like us, revealing the infinite dignity of every person," said Leo.

"Where there is room for the human person, there is room for God," he said. "Even a stable can become more sacred than a temple."

Outside the basilica, about 5,000 people watched the service on screens from St. Peter's Square, holding umbrellas and wearing ponchos under a hard rain in Rome.

Leo, 70, came outside to greet them before the start of the Mass. "I admire and respect and thank you for your courage and your wanting to be here this evening," he said, "even in this weather."

On Thursday, the pope will celebrate a Christmas Day Mass and deliver a twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message and blessing.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:21:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OUEQZTNAUFIN3OPKG7BRQ7CWYQ.jpg?auth=d809ba2fc8531377c6bc4712266a2245b8919b26ee9c13102c5cb106bea5076e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Atmospheric river drenches Los Angeles, triggers widespread flooding</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/atmospheric-river-drenches-los-angeles-triggers-widespread-flooding-2025-12-24/</link><description>LOS ANGELES, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Torrential rains drenched Southern California on Wednesday, unleashing widespread flash flooding as authorities urged motorists to stay off roads and residents living downslope of wildfire-scarred foothills and canyons to evacuate.

Downpours measuring an inch (2.54 cm) or more of rain an hour in some areas were spawned by the region's latest atmospheric river storm, a vast airborne current of dense moisture siphoned from the Pacific and swept inland over the greater Los Angeles area.

The Christmas Eve storm was expected to persist into Friday, posing unsafe driving conditions during what would normally be a busy holiday travel period, according to the U.S. National Weather Service.

"Life-threatening" storm conditions were expected to persist through Christmas Day over Southern California, "where widespread flash flooding is underway," the weather service said.

A flash-flood warning was posted across much of Los Angeles County until 6 p.m. PST, urging motorists: "Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area, subject to flooding or under an evacuation order."

Los Angeles city officials urged residents to heed evacuation orders issued for about 130 homes considered especially vulnerable to mudslides and debris flows in areas where last year's wildfires ravaged the community of Pacific Palisades.

Wednesday's heavy rainfall was accompanied by gusty winds that forecasters said were likely to topple trees and power lines. In upper elevations of the Sierra mountains, the storm was expected to dump heavy snow.

NWS meteorologist Ariel Cohen said 4 to 8 inches of rain had fallen in some foothill areas by 9 a.m. PST, and the Los Angeles City News Service reported numerous rockslides in the mountains. Forecasts called for more than a foot (30.48 cm) of rain falling over some lower-terrain mountain areas by week's end.

Forecasters even issued a rare tornado warning for a small portion of east-central Los Angeles County due to heavy thunderstorm activity over the community of Alhambra.</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YYZQMU5PURIE5I6CH2HGH4MIBA.jpg?auth=2044f01af404750e8d34b7ad8632b3acf956a42a53ea14fbd804062c8912db94&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four bodies found believed to be from one Liechtenstein family</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/four-bodies-found-believed-be-one-liechtenstein-family-2025-12-24/</link><description>ZURICH, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Police on Wednesday discovered the bodies of two men and two women believed to belong to a single family from Liechtenstein, authorities in the tiny Alpine principality said.

Local police said at around 10:30 a.m. (0930 GMT), the body of a 41-year-old man from Liechtenstein was found on the Swiss side of the bank of the Rhine next to Liechtenstein's capital Vaduz. The cause of death was unclear, Swiss police said.

Subsequent investigations led police to an apartment in Vaduz where they discovered the bodies of a 73-year-old man and two women, aged 68 and 45.

According to initial findings, the three were the parents and sister of the 41-year-old man, Liechtenstein police said in a statement. What caused their deaths is still being determined, a spokesperson for Liechtenstein police said.

The state police's criminal investigation department is investigating the deaths with a large deployment of officers.

"The investigation is proceeding in all directions," the police statement said. "There is no danger to the public."</description><pubDate>Wed, 24 Dec 2025 22:44:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin sent a message to North Korea's Kim to celebrate New Year's Day, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/russias-putin-sent-message-north-koreas-kim-celebrate-new-years-day-kcna-says-2025-12-24/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a message on December 18 to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to celebrate New Year's Day, North Korean state media KCNA reported on Thursday.

With the exception of votes in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland and the breakaway region of Somaliland, Somalia last held direct elections in 1969, months before military general, Mohamed Siad Barre, took power in a coup.

After years of civil war that followed Barre's fall in 1991, indirect elections were introduced in 2004. The idea was to promote consensus among rival clans in the face of an Islamist insurgency , although some Somalis say politicians prefer indirect elections because they create opportunities for corruption.

Under the system, clan representatives elect lawmakers, who then choose the president. The president, in turn, has been responsible for appointing Mogadishu's mayor.

The vote in Mogadishu, a city of some 3 million people where security conditions have improved in recent years despite continuing attacks by al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab militants, is seen as a test run for direct elections at the national level.

Around 1,605 candidates are running on Thursday for 390 posts in Mogadishu's district councils, said Abdishakur Abib Hayir, a member of the National Electoral Commission. Council members will then choose a mayor.

"It shows Somalia is standing on its feet and moving forward," Hayir told Reuters. "After the local election, elections can and will take place in the entire country."

A 2024 law restored universal suffrage ahead of federal elections expected next year. However, President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud reached a deal in August with some opposition leaders stipulating that while lawmakers would be directly elected in 2026, the president would still be chosen by parliament.

Opposition parties have argued the rapid introduction of a new electoral system would benefit Mohamud's re-election prospects.

They also question whether the country is safe enough for mass voting given al Shabaab's control over vast areas of the countryside and regular strikes on major population centres.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 04:56:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZIGO6H4I2FKOVOP5SJ7IQRDYXM.jpg?auth=892c16cbe0bf0e6db6dbe34252f29c65532c2fd213748eb21a38b6f82843d0d8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Christmas celebrations muted at Bondi as Australians grieve after deadly shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/christmas-celebrations-muted-bondi-australians-grieve-after-deadly-shooting-2025-12-25/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Christmas celebrations were muted at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach on Thursday in the aftermath of a terror attack that killed 15 people there more than a week ago, as the community continued to grapple with the country's deadliest mass shooting in nearly three decades.

Police patrolled across the beachfront in Bondi, a traditional Christmas destination, as hundreds of people, many wearing Santa hats, gathered on the sands.

"I think it's tragic, and I think everybody respects and is very sad for what happened, and I think people here are out on the beach, because it's like a celebration but everybody has got it in their memories and everybody is respectful of what happened," British tourist Mark Conroy told Reuters.

"Everyone is feeling for the family and friends who are going through the worst possible thing you could imagine."

The gun attack on December 14 at a Jewish Hannukah celebration has prompted calls for stricter gun laws and tougher action against antisemitism, while public gathering rules in Sydney have been tightened under new laws passed on Wednesday.

Beachgoers were seen taking photos next to a Christmas tree while some posed with lifeguards, although windy weather conditions appear to thin crowds.

"It's not the best conditions for Christmas Day today, it's a bit choppy. ... so not ideal, but people are still here," Surf Life Saving Patrol Captain Thomas Hough said.

Flags flew at half mast outside the heritage-listed Bondi Pavilion building near the site of the attack , which police say was allegedly carried out by a father and son, inspired by the militant group Islamic State.

In Melbourne, a car with a "Happy Chanukah!" sign was set alight on Christmas Day in the city's southeast, with no injuries reported, Australian media reported.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, facing mounting criticism from opponents who argue his government has not done enough to curb a rise in antisemitism, called the firebombing of the car "just beyond comprehension."

"What sort of evil ideology and thoughts at a time like this would motivate someone?," Albanese told reporters on Thursday.

Since the start of Israel's war in Gaza in October 2023, there have been attacks against synagogues, Jewish buildings and cars in Australia.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 05:48:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SRBRP4J7IBLIFCRFPEOZJWI5BM.jpg?auth=c7da7cbb03d844398c5f5eef42c310ab03349aa935fa9975cd487d6257007332&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China social media thrashes one-child policy after population control czar dies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-social-media-thrashes-one-child-policy-after-population-control-czar-dies-2025-12-25/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 25 (Reuters) - The death of a former head of China's one-child policy has been met not by tributes but by castigation of the abandoned policy on social media this week.

State media praised Peng Peiyun, head of China's Family Planning Commission from 1988 to 1998, as "an outstanding leader" in her work related to women and children.

The reaction on China's social media to Peng's death in Beijing on Sunday, just shy of her 96th birthday, was less positive.

"Those children who were lost, naked, are waiting for you over there" in the afterlife, one person posted on China's popular micro-blog Weibo.

China's near-universal mandate of just one child per couple from 1980 through 2015 prompted local officials to compel women to undergo abortions and sterilisations.

Beijing launched the one-child policy as leaders worried about population growth potentially spiralling out of control. But China's population, long the world's highest, later slowed and last year tumbled for the third year in a row.

"If the one-child policy had been implemented for 10 years less, China's population would not have plummeted like this!" a Weibo post said.

After falling behind India's in 2023, China's population declined last year to 1.39 billion. Experts warn the downtrend will accelerate in coming years. Data for 2025 will be released next month.

As population czar, Peng focused her commission's work on the countryside.

In rural China, large families were once seen as a goal for couples looking to ensure that they would be taken care of in their old age. Sons who could carry on the family name were also favoured, leading to unwanted infant girls and even aborted female foetuses.

"Those children, if they were born, would be almost 40 years old, in the prime of their lives," one person posted on Weibo.

By the 2010s, Peng had publicly shifted her views, saying the one-child policy should be eased. Now Beijing is trying to boost the flagging birth rate with childcare subsidies, longer maternity leave and tax benefits.

The shrinking and greying of the population has spurred worries that the world's second-biggest economy will struggle as the number of workers declines. Rising costs from elderly care and retirement benefits will also likely create additional budgetary strains for already indebted local governments.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 06:34:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BKRUX7F4BBLZ3DUIXLGHDK5SZQ.jpg?auth=ac6305ac03d49d2f283fe1ed263574565fd6d6bfb5de4d3323b8491ec9eb9c11&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia says Yemen group should withdraw its forces from seized provinces</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-says-yemen-group-should-withdraw-its-forces-seized-provinces-2025-12-25/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it remains hopeful that Yemen's main southern separatist group will end an escalation that has given it broad control across the south , deepening uncertainties in a country already divided between two administrations since civil war erupted over a decade ago.

In a foreign ministry statement, the kingdom described the military operations by Yemen's Southern Transitional Council (STC) - through which the group seized the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra earlier this month - as an "unjustified escalation."

"The kingdom remains hopeful that the public interest will prevail through ending the escalation by the Southern Transitional Council and the withdrawal of its forces from the two governorates in an urgent and orderly manner," the statement said.

The UAE-backed STC forces were initially part of the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis. But the STC turned on the government and sought self-rule in the south, including the major port city of Aden where the Saudi-backed administration is headquartered.

A joint Saudi-Emirati military delegation arrived in Aden on December 12 to discuss measures aimed at defusing tensions. Saudi Arabia said the teams were sent to put "the necessary arrangements" to ensure the return of STC forces to their previous positions outside the two provinces.

The kingdom added, however, that these efforts remain in progress to restore the situation to its previous state.

Yemen has been marred by civil war since 2014, through which the Houthis took control of the northern part of the country including the capital, Sanaa, pushing the Saudi-backed government to flee south and headquarter in the port city of Aden.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 06:34:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh leader considered top PM candidate returns from exile ahead of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladesh-leader-considered-top-pm-candidate-returns-exile-ahead-polls-2025-12-25/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting Chairman Tarique Rahman returned from nearly 17 years in exile on Thursday, a homecoming the party hopes will energise supporters with Rahman poised to be the top contender for prime minister in February.

Hundreds of thousands of supporters lined the route from Dhaka’s airport to the reception venue, waving party flags and carrying placards, banners and flowers, while chanting slogans welcoming Rahman, as senior BNP leaders received him at the airport under tight security.

Rahman, 60, the son of ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, has lived in London since 2008 and led the BNP as acting chairman since 2018.

Dressed in a light grey, finely checkered blazer over a crisp white shirt, Rahman exited the airport, removed his shoes to step barefoot onto Bangladeshi soil, and picked up a handful of earth in a symbolic gesture marking his return to the South Asian nation.

He was seen standing beside the driver’s seat in a bus taking him to the reception venue, smiling and waving as crowds surged to catch a glimpse of their returning leader.

He had been unable to return while facing multiple criminal cases at home. Rahman was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The rulings were overturned after Hasina was ousted last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to his return.

His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception venue before visiting his mother.

The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasina’s removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda largely alternated in office. A December survey by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race.

Hasina's Awami League party, which has been barred from the February 12 election, has threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote.

Bangladesh is heading into the polls under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. While authorities have pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman’s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:23:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZVVK7HB2BVNZZNTEQBLB2NW2XQ.jpg?auth=c2c6d1a76057ec0a9de023b4e0639c5f163b8e15e86c81dcb729becb1e4bfd84&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia-ally Touadera seeks third term in Central African Republic</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/russia-ally-touadera-seeks-third-term-central-african-republic-2025-12-25/</link><description>BANGUI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera is seeking a third term in an election on Sunday, campaigning on security gains after signing deals with rebel groups and enlisting support from Russian mercenaries and Rwandan forces.

He faces six opposition candidates including Anicet-Georges Dologuele, a former prime minister and runner-up in the 2020 election, but is likely to win in part due to his control over state institutions, analysts say.

Such a result would likely further the interests of Russia, which has traded security assistance for access to resources including gold and diamonds. Touadera is also offering access to the country's lithium and uranium reserves to anyone interested.

The 68-year-old mathematician took power in 2016 after the worst crisis in the chronically unstable country's history, when three years of intercommunal strife forced a fifth of the population to flee their homes, either internally or abroad.

Touadera has signed peace deals this year with several rebel groups, while others have been weakened in the face of Russian mercenaries and troops from Rwanda deployed to shore up Touadera's government as well as U.N. peacekeepers.

"During the 10 years that we have been working together, you yourselves have seen that peace is beginning to return, starting from all our borders and reaching the capital," Touadera told a rally at a stadium in the capital Bangui this month.

His opponents , meanwhile, have denounced a constitutional referendum in 2023 that scrapped the presidential term limit, saying it was proof Touadera wants to be president for life.

They have also accused him of failing to make significant progress towards lifting the 5.5 million population out of poverty.

"The administrative infrastructure has been destroyed and, as you know, the roads are in a very poor state of repair," Dologuele told a recent press conference.

"In short, the Central African economy is in ruins."

The presidential contest is taking place alongside legislative, regional and municipal elections, with provisional results expected to be announced by January 5.

If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, a presidential runoff will take place on February 15, while legislative runoffs will take place on April 5.

A smooth voting process could reinforce Touadera's claim that stability is returning, which was buttressed last year with the U.N. Security Council's lifting of an arms embargo and the lifting of a separate embargo on diamond exports.

"The fact that these measures were lifted, it shows that we're gradually getting back to normal. Or at least that's the narrative," said Romain Esmenjaud, associate researcher at the Institut Francais de Geopolitique.

The peace deals are credited with a decline in violence in some areas and an expected boost in economic growth projections to 3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has said the U.N. should hand security back to the government soon.

But serious security threats remain. Rebels have not fully disarmed, reintegration is incomplete, and incursions by combatants from neighbouring Sudan fuel insecurity in the east.

Pangea-Risk, a consultancy, wrote in a note to clients that the risk of unrest after the election was high as opponents were likely to challenge Touadera's expected victory.

"The election will take place in an atmosphere marked by heightened grievances over political marginalization, increasing repression, and allegations of electoral fraud," said chief executive Robert Besseling.

Dologuele alleged fraud after he was recorded as winning 21.6% of the vote in 2020, when rebel groups still threatened the capital and prevented voting at 800 polling stations across the country, or 14% of the total. A court upheld Touadera's win.

Paul-Crescent Beninga, a political analyst, said voters will be closely scrutinising the voting and counting processes.

"If they do not go well, it gives those who promote violence an excuse to mobilise violence and sow panic among the population of the Central African Republic. So that is why we must ensure that the elections take place in relatively acceptable conditions," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:23:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CEQT5QLT2BLFFEUTM2AXC2BILU.jpg?auth=3677d7c713068f5455e0b677e2e1c92523c7ef56e7c9ee5810c65783fb6b78cf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Helicopter crash on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro kills five, aviation authority says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/helicopter-crash-tanzanias-mount-kilimanjaro-kills-five-aviation-authority-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>DAR ES SALAAM, Dec 25 (Reuters) - A helicopter crashed on Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro, killing five people, the civil aviation authority said on Thursday, while local media reported that the aircraft was on a medical rescue mission.

The helicopter crashed near the mountain's Barafu Camp on Wednesday, Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority said in a statement.

Mwananchi newspaper and East Africa TV, citing Kilimanjaro region's head of police, Simon Maigwa, reported that the helicopter was on a medical rescue mission.

Among the dead were a guide, a doctor, the pilot and two foreign tourists, Mwananchi cited Maigwa as saying, without giving the tourists' nationalities.

Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak, is nearly 6,000 meters (20,000 ft) above sea level.

The crash happened between 4670 and 4700 metres, Mwananchi reported.

Around 50,000 tourists climb Kilimanjaro annually.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:24:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey detains 115 suspected Islamic State members believed planning attacks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-detains-115-suspected-islamic-state-members-believed-planning-attacks-2025-12-25/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Turkish authorities have detained 115 suspected Islamic State members they said were planning to carry out attacks on Christmas and New Year celebrations in the country, the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office said on Thursday.

No group has claimed responsibility for Wednesday's attack, which comes amid heightened security concerns in Nigeria’s northeast, where Islamist insurgents Boko Haram and its ISWAP faction have waged a 15-year campaign of violence targeting civilians, mosques, and markets.

The blast at the Al-Adum mosque occurred around 6 p.m. local time as congregants gathered for evening worship. Eyewitnesses described scenes of panic as victims were rushed to the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital and the State Specialist Hospital.

“Nobody knows what happened. It was during prayers that the bomb exploded. Allah has destined that this will happen but nobody can give details of how it happened,” said Masta Dalori, a market leader.

Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum condemned the attack, calling it “utterly condemnable, barbaric and inhumane”. In a statement, he urged heightened vigilance in places of worship and public spaces during the festive season.

“Attacking a place of worship is a desecration of its sanctity at a time when Muslim faithful are performing acts of worship,” he said, offering condolences to families of the dead and prayers for the injured.

Police confirmed the casualty figures and said bomb disposal teams had cordoned off the area. “Ongoing sweeping operations by police EOD are in progress,” said Kenneth Daso, spokesperson for Borno State Command.

He added that investigations were underway and advised residents to remain calm and vigilant.

Last August, gunmen attacked a mosque and nearby homes in northwest Katsina State killing at least 50, according to local officials and residents.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:24:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XSXZUZAFJVNCROHLDI7GPM2VMY.jpg?auth=f85aa88ca83d523f53960a2b877efdc9f77ee3f10484fe65cfbf74fc95db148a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo to renew call for peace during first Christmas blessing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-pope-leo-to-renew-call-for-peace-during-first-urbi-et-orbi-christmas-blessing</link><description>Pope Leo XIV is expected to renew his calls for peace Thursday when he delivers his first Christmas blessing from St Peter's Basilica at the end of a year overshadowed by conflict, but also marked by hopes for peace in Gaza.

In Bethlehem, the Christian community celebrated its first festive Christmas in more than two years as the occupied West Bank city emerged from the shadow of the war in Gaza .

However, the Pope's call this week for a one-day global truce went unheeded in Ukraine , where fighting continued, as the pontiff prepared to deliver his "Urbi et Orbi" blessing at 12:00 – during which popes usually speak about conflicts around the world and urge peace .

Before the address, the Pope celebrated his first Christmas Mass Wednesday evening where he described the celebration as a feast of "faith, charity and hope".

He also spoke in front of St Peter's Basilica to offer Christmas wishes and thank those who had come to follow the mass on outdoor screens despite rainy weather.

"St Peter's is very large but unfortunately it is not large enough to receive all of you," he told the crowd of around 5,000 people.

Leo will also hold another mass on Christmas Day, renewing a tradition from the times of late pope John Paul II (1978-2005).

Hundreds of worshippers also gathered for mass at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem Wednesday night as the Palestinian city ushered in its first festive Christmas during the Gaza war.

Throughout the conflict that began with Hamas 's attack on Israel in October 2023, a sombre tone had marked Christmases in the biblical birthplace of Jesus Christ.

But celebrations returned Wednesday with parades and music in the West Bank city, as a fragile truce held in Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people face winter in makeshift tents.

With pews of the Church of the Nativity filled long before midnight, many stood or sat on the floor for the traditional mass to usher in Christmas Day.

At 11:15 pm organ music rang out as a procession of dozens of clergymen entered, followed by Jerusalem 's Latin Patriarch, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, who blessed the crowd with signs of the cross.

In his homily, Pizzaballa urged peace, hope and rebirth, saying the Nativity story still held relevance in the turbulence of modern times.

He also spoke of his visit to Gaza over the weekend, where he said "suffering is still present" despite the ceasefire .

"The wounds are deep, yet I have to say, here too, there too, their proclamation of Christmas resounds," he said. "When I met them, I was struck by their strength and desire to start over."

Hundreds took part in the parade down Bethlehem's narrow Star Street on Wednesday, while a dense crowd massed in the square.

"Today is full of joy because we haven't been able to celebrate because of the war," said Milagros Anstas, 17.

Men dressed as Santa Claus sold toffee apples and toys as families took photographs in front of a nativity scene framed by a giant star.

As darkness fell, multi-coloured lights shone over Manger Square and a towering Christmas tree glittered next to the Church of the Nativity.

The basilica dates back to the fourth century and was built on top of a grotto where Christians believe Jesus was born more than 2,000 years ago.

Bethlehem residents hoped the return of Christmas festivities would breathe life back into the city.

"We need to get the message to the whole world and this is the only way," said George Hanna, from the neighbouring town of Beit Jala.

In Syria , Christmas lights illuminated Damascus's Old City despite the Christian community's fears of violence after a deadly attack in June.

Around the district, home to several important churches, red baubles hung from trees, shopkeepers put up Christmas decorations and street vendors peddled warm chestnuts.

"Syria deserves joy and for us to be happy, and to hope for a new future," said student Loris Aasaf, 20.

In stark contrast to the messages of religious leaders, US President Donald Trump wished a Merry Christmas "to everyone, including the radical left-wing scum", referring to Democrats.

Severe weather disrupted the holiday season in California where authorities, fearing dangerous flooding, have declared a state of emergency in Los Angeles and ordered evacuations.

In Australia , Prime Minister Anthony Albanese had a sombre message after the deadly attack during a Hanukkah celebration at Bondi Beach on December 14.

"After the terror inflicted on Jewish Australia celebrating Hanukkah and Bondi Beach, we feel the weight of sorrow in our hearts."</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 07:24:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ddd5d39a-e15a-11f0-becb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25358797799822.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Oil tanks on fire after alleged Ukrainian drone attack on Russia’s Temryuk port</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-live-oil-tanks-on-fire-after-alleged-ukrainian-drone-attack-on-russia-s-temryuk-port</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited a nuclear submarine factory and received a message from Russia's Vladimir Putin hailing the countries' "invincible friendship", Pyongyang's state media said.

North Korea and Russia have drawn closer since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago, and Pyongyang has sent troops to fight for Russia.

In return, Russia is sending North Korea financial aid, military technology and food and energy supplies, analysts say.

The "heroic" efforts of North Korean soldiers in Russia's Kursk region "clearly proved the invincible friendship" between Moscow and Pyongyang, Putin said in a message to Kim, according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).

Two ‍oil ​product tanks ⁠caught fire at the ​southern ‍Russian port ​of Temryuk after what regional ​authorities in the Krasnodar region said was a Ukrainian drone ‍attack.

Flames covered ​an area of about 2,000 square ‌metres, authorities at the ‍Krasnodar operational headquarters said on the Telegram messaging app.

Russian nuclear-capable bombers conducted a "scheduled" flight over the Norwegian and Barents Seas, prompting "fighter jets of foreign countries" to escort them, Russia's Defence Ministry said, according to Russian news agencies.

Neither the date of the Tu-95 flights nor the countries that deployed monitoring aircraft were specified.

"Russian Tu-95MS strategic bombers and missile carriers carried out a scheduled flight over the neutral waters of the Barents and Norwegian Seas," the ministry said, referring to bodies of water north of Scandinavia and northwest of Russia.

"At certain stages of the route, long-range bombers were escorted by fighter jets of foreign countries," it added.

Foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian was responding to a question at a press briefing on whether China might exploit a recent easing of tensions with India over disputed border areas to keep ties between the United States and India from deepening.

China views its ties with India from a strategic and long-term perspective, Lin said, adding that the border issue was a matter between China and India and "we object to any country passing judgment about this issue".

The Pentagon said in a report on Tuesday that China "probably seeks to capitalize on decreased tension ... to stabilize bilateral relations and prevent the deepening of U.S.-India ties".</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 08:29:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3I42MQ6O2FLM5F5J2GHX2K3JL4.jpg?auth=d6feaa07beb68428049845e3afd1d8af8a61bccc987504ca79202323ad2e4ef7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In first Christmas sermon, Pope Leo decries conditions for Palestinians in Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/first-christmas-sermon-pope-leo-decries-conditions-palestinians-gaza-2025-12-25/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Pope Leo decried conditions for Palestinians in Gaza in his Christmas sermon on Thursday, in an unusually direct appeal during what is normally a solemn, spiritual service on the day Christians across the globe celebrate the birth of Jesus.

Leo, the first U.S. pope , said the story of Jesus being born in a stable showed that God had "pitched his fragile tent" among the people of the world.

"How, then, can we not think of the tents in Gaza, exposed for weeks to rain, wind and cold?" he asked.

Leo, celebrating his first Christmas after being elected in May by the world's cardinals to succeed the late Pope Francis , has a more quiet, diplomatic style than his predecessor and usually refrains from making political references in his sermons.

But the new pope has also lamented the conditions for Palestinians in Gaza several times recently and told journalists last month that the only solution in the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people must include a Palestinian state.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of intense bombardment and military operations , but humanitarian agencies say there is still too little aid getting into Gaza, where nearly the entire population is homeless .

In Thursday's service with thousands in St. Peter's Basilica, Leo also lamented conditions for the homeless across the globe and the destruction caused by the wars roiling the world.

"Fragile is the flesh of defenseless populations, tried by so many wars, ongoing or concluded, leaving behind rubble and open wounds," said the pope.

"Fragile are the minds and lives of young people forced to take up arms, who on the front lines feel the senselessness of what is asked of them and the falsehoods that fill the pompous speeches of those who send them to their deaths," he said.

Later on Thursday the pope will deliver a twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message and blessing, which usually addresses global conflicts.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:23:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MK3CJZ73W5ISDMQX3B42WM33XI.jpg?auth=77baa33446795703f800f4db5a078b0c67fc6d5a88230a7cf2a63f39e6610723&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian drones hit oil and gas facilities in Russia, SBU official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-drones-hit-oil-gas-facilities-russia-sbu-official-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>Ukrainian long-range drones hit oil product tanks in the Russian port of Temryuk and a gas processing plant in Russia's Orenburg, an official at the SBU security service told Reuters on Thursday.

A tradition dating back to the ​Cold War era of 1955, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) tracks Santa's overnight journey around the world, starting from his home base at the North Pole.

NORAD, a joint US-Canadian military command at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs, has provided images and updates on Santa's worldwide journey for seven decades, along with its main task of monitoring air defenses and issuing aerospace and maritime warnings.

But the details of Santa's mission are known only to him.

"NORAD tracks Santa, but only Santa knows his route, which means we cannot predict where or when he will arrive at your house," a senior NORAD official said in a press statement.

The Santa tracker tradition originated from a ‍1955 misprint in a Colorado Springs newspaper, which attempted to print the telephone number of a department store that children could call to speak with Santa. But the printed number went ​instead to what was then known as Continental Air Defense Command.

An understanding officer took the children's calls and assured them that Santa was airborne and on schedule to deliver presents to good girls and boys, flying aboard his reindeer-powered sleigh.

According to its website , NORAD detects Santa's liftoff with its polar radar network, then follows his journey with the same satellites used to warn of ‍any possible missile launches aimed at North America. As soon as Santa's lead reindeer, Rudolph, switches on his shiny red nose, military personnel can zero in on his location using the satellites' infrared sensors.

US President Donald Trump appeared to be following NORAD's Santa tracker on Wednesday as he sat by a Christmas tree at his Mar-a-Lago residence in Florida , fielding telephone calls from children around the country. As he spoke to one youngster from Pennsylvania, Trump said, "So Santa right now is in Copenhagen , Denmark , but he's heading toward our country. ‍What would you like from Santa?"

Speaking to another caller, Trump jokingly explained the rationale for tracking Santa in terms of national security, saying, "We want ‌to make sure he's ​not infiltrated, that we're not infiltrating into our country a bad Santa."</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 10:25:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/514c6c84-e175-11f0-bf80-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/NORAD2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia made a proposal to France on jailed French researcher Vinatier, the Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-made-proposal-france-jailed-french-researcher-vinatier-kremlin-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russia had made a proposal to France regarding Laurent Vinatier, a French researcher jailed for violating Russia's foreign agent laws, and the ball is now in Paris's court, the Kremlin said on Thursday.

Vinatier was sentenced in 2024 to three years in jail for failing to comply with laws requiring individuals deemed "foreign agents" to register and meet a number of stipulations. He is now facing additional espionage charges.

France has said Vinatier was arbitrarily detained and has called for his release. President Emmanuel Macron has denied that Vinatier worked for the French state and has described his arrest as part of a misinformation campaign by Moscow.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that there had been contacts with France on the issue.

"There were indeed relevant contacts between us and the French," Peskov told reporters. "Indeed, an offer was made to the French about this. The ball is in France's court right now."

Countries on NATO's eastern flank have been on high alert for potential airspace incursions since September when three Russian military jets violated Estonia's airspace for 12 minutes just days after more than 20 Russian drones had entered Polish airspace.

"This morning, over the international waters of the Baltic Sea, Polish fighter jets intercepted, visually identified, and escorted from their area of ​​responsibility a Russian reconnaissance aircraft flying near the borders of Polish airspace," the army said.

It also said that at night, objects were observed entering Polish airspace from the direction of Belarus.

"After detailed analysis, it was determined that these were most likely smuggling balloons, moving in accordance with the wind direction and speed," the army said. It added that part of the airspace over northeast Poland's Podlaskie region, which borders Belarus, was temporarily closed to civilian traffic to ensure security.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:20:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Christmas traditions: festivities that continue well into the New Year</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-french-christmas-traditions-festivities-continue-well-into-new-year</link><description>The Christmas season is a time when the French set aside their treasured notions of being a staunchly secular country to revel in holiday traditions, many of them rooted in the religious practices of ancient Rome and continuing into the early part of the year.

Although France shares many Christmas traditions with its European neighbours, others are quintessentially French – like oysters on ice, the bûche de Noël (Christmas log cake) and a decided emphasis on Champagne.

As in countries across Europe, Christmas markets often spring up in France starting in November, with many continuing through the first week of January. Kiosks resembling wooden Swiss chalets sell mulled wine, gingerbread ( pain d’épice ) and various gifts and crafts, continuing a tradition dating from the Middle Ages.

Paris hosts an array of Christmas markets in a typical year with additional "pop-up" markets appearing for just a day or a weekend. Among the most well known of the annual markets are the Villages de Noël near the Eiffel Tower and the largest one at the Tuileries Garden , as well as those at Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) in the Marais, Notre-Dame in the city centre and in Saint-Germain-des-Prés.

In the Alsace region bordering Germany , Strasbourg proclaims itself the " Capital of Christmas ". The city is known for its Christmas market, which is the oldest in France (dating from 1570) and one of the oldest in Europe.

Every year, a 30-metre-tall Christmas tree is brought to Place Kléber and decorated with ornaments and lights while merchants and craftsmen offer their wares at the some 300 wooden chalets dotted all over the city centre. For most of December, Strasbourg becomes one of the most illuminated cities in France.

The first day of Advent on December 1 marks the official countdown to Christmas in many Christian traditions. French supermarkets and other stores invariably carry advent calendars ( calendriers de l'avent ) – box calendars with a folding door for each day leading up to Christmas that reveals a chocolate or small trinket when opened.

Advent wreaths (c ouronnes de l’Avent ) may also make an appearance around this time, often adorned with pine cones, bows and four candles. Traditionally, one candle will be lit on each Sunday leading up to Christmas.

In parts of northeastern France and beyond, Père Fouettard is a frightening figure designed to scare children into being well-behaved – traditionally his role is to punish the naughty while Santa Claus rewards the nice. With his black beard, shaggy hair and soot-smeared face, Père Fouettard whips misbehaved children on December 6, the day of Saint Nicholas, the patron saint of children.

Those who have not been good over the past year may also find their long-awaited Christmas gifts consist of coal, beets or onions, all thanks to Père Fouettard.

Meanwhile, well-behaved children are given chocolate and other sweets on the day of Saint Nicholas.

Gradually, the December 6 tradition has disappeared in most French regions and the ritual giving of chocolate and gingerbread has been incorporated into Christmas.

Papillotes are small gifts of chocolate, wrapped with a little note inside decorative paper with fringed ends. They are thought to have been invented around 1790 by a young apprentice chocolatier in Lyon who fell in love with a girl from the neighbourhood and sent her chocolates wrapped in love notes. When the master chocolatier, Monsieur Papillot, discovered these unique gifts he decided to manufacture and market them, and the papillote en chocolat was born.

Today, the candies often come wrapped in gold foil along with little holiday messages or proverbs and are popular in France around Christmas as well as New Year 's.

Adorning many a Christmas crèche in the southern Provence region are handmade and painted ceramic figurines known as santons , from the Provençal term " santoun " (for little saint).

While Joseph, Mary and Jesus are represented in many a manger scene, the santons often depict a whole village, including craftsmen, farmers and the local baker. An iconic figure among the santons is the Ravi, a man depicted with outstretched arms who is openly marvelling at the miracle of the nativity.

Another Provençale tradition is that of the 13 desserts, which are said to symbolise Christ and the 12 apostles. An array of 13 offerings – including dried fruits, nuts, nougat, marzipan candies and an olive oil cake called Pompe à l’huile – are laid out in the week before Christmas so that holiday visitors will have something to nibble on. Tradition holds that partaking of each of the 13 treats will bring good luck in the coming year.

Christmas would not be complete without a sumptuous feast, and in France that meal is known as the Réveillon de Noël (from réveiller , to rouse or awaken) and often takes place on December 24. The table may be decorated with an Advent wreath and candles, and some advise knotting the ends of the tablecloth so the Devil can't get under the table.

In the Middle Ages, midnight Mass was preceded by a meagre meal; it was customary to eat only a little bread, fish or vegetable broth and drink a glass of water. Christmas dinner was the big traditional meal served to worshippers on December 25 after a long nighttime church service. Though fewer people these days attend midnight Mass, the tradition of a big Christmas Eve or Christmas Day meal has survived.

Throughout December, supermarket shelves are laden with cans and jars of foie gras , a French specialty of fattened duck or goose liver, often served as a starter on warm toast with some jam, often onion or fig.

Though many have stopped eating foie gras because of the way the birds’ livers are artificially fattened through gavage , or force-feeding, it remains one of the most popular food items for a French Christmas meal, and France today remains its largest producer by far.

Literally translated as “fat liver”, foie gras originated in ancient Egypt before it spread throughout the Mediterranean and was adopted by the Greeks and then the Romans. Later, in the Middle Ages, the tradition of gavage was continued by the Jewish population, since goose meat was viewed as a good source of nutrition and its cooking fat conformed to Jewish dietary laws.

The popularity of foie gras grew during the Renaissance, when it became associated with the kings of France. The term “ foyes gras ” was coined during the reign of Louis XIV and it was served at royal banquets under Louis XV, but it was Louis XVI who declared it the “ dish of kings ".

Foie gras is also often served pan-roasted, or sliced over a cut of meat, or as a sauce. It is produced in winter, and its high price makes it a luxurious holiday product that is perfect for year-end festivities.

For those who do not eat foie gras , other common starters at a French Christmas or New Year’s dinner are smoked salmon, scallops ( coquilles Saint-Jacques ), shrimp or oysters.

The French are among the largest consumers of oysters in the world, with more than 85,000 tonnes of oysters served each year, a large portion of which is enjoyed at the Christmas dinner table.

Oysters are easy to find in France, with its long coastline, and are relatively healthy for a holiday dish. They are most often served fresh on shaved ice alongside a red wine and shallot vinaigrette (sometimes known as a mignonette ) or simply a wedge of lemon.

It is customary to eat oysters only during months that have an "r" in their names – September through April. This is not only because they taste best during this period but due to habit – long before refrigerated transportation methods were invented, oysters could only be shipped inland from the sea during the cold winter months if they were to stay fresh and not spoil before being served. Salmon, lobster, crayfish and other seafood are also traditionally eaten in winter for the same reason.

Much like in the United States or Great Britain, a staple of French Christmas dinner is the stuffed turkey, or the dinde de Noël .

Before the turkey arrived in Europe from the Americas in the 17th century, the French ate stuffed goose. But the turkey has mostly replaced the goose as the holiday bird of choice because it is less expensive, yet larger and meatier than chicken and thus fit for a feast.

A smaller, succulent fowl that is very popular in France during the winter holidays is the capon ( chapon ), a cockerel that was neutered to render its meat fattier and usually weighing 3-4 kilos, or the even smaller guinea fowl ( pintade ).

Whatever bird is chosen, it is generally roasted and served with a special Christmas stuffing that traditionally includes chestnuts and often mushrooms.

Other holiday main dishes in France include roasted meats such as lamb or beef and also game, such as wild boar, venison or pheasant, which are not often eaten year-round by French people who are not hunters.

No Christmas in France is complete without a bûche de Noël , otherwise known as the Yule log cake. The bûche is an elaborate creation made of a rolled sponge cake filled with cream and frosted to look like tree bark or a log.

It is a reminder of an earlier tradition, dating back to the Iron Age, when people in Europe would gather to welcome the winter solstice on December 21, the longest night of the year. Families would burn large logs, usually from fruit trees, anointed with wine and salt and decorated with pine cones, holly or ivy. The log kept the house warm, and its ashes were said to have medicinal benefits and to guard against evil.

After a meal of stuffed goose, capon or other roasted meat – not to mention Champagne , good wine and a wide variety of rich desserts and chocolates – it’s not surprising that the French speak of a crise de foie (“liver crisis,” also known as indigestion) at the end of the holiday season.

But a little crise de foie is a small price to pay for a festive meal with family and friends to ward off the winter chill.

While the main event may be over as the year draws to a close, the festivities do not yet stop in France, which carries the holiday season into February.

Les Étrennes is a New Year’s Eve tradition of gift-giving dating back to Roman times, when offerings typically included honey, dates or money as well as laurel leaves or branches. Today in France the day is marked by offering an envelope of money and sometimes a card to those who do work for you all year round, notably garbage collectors, firefighters, mailmen and your building's concierge or gardien(ne) .

Much of France marks Épiphanie on January 6 with a galette des rois (king cake) – a flaky, puffed cake layered with frangipane, a sweet almond paste. The cake has a ceramic bauble (the fève , or bean) baked inside. Whoever receives the slice with the fève becomes king or queen for the day and is given a gold paper crown, sold with the cake.

When the cake is served, the youngest person present traditionally crawls under the table to blindly select who will receive the next slice.

Christian legend holds that Epiphany, or Three Kings' Day, is when the three wise men arrived in Bethlehem. But the tradition of the fève dates from Roman celebrations of Saturnalia in late December and early January, when slaves would dine with the rest of the household. If a slave received the fève they could have anything they wanted for the day.

The Chandeleur is celebrated on February 2 to mark 40 days after Christmas. Known by the Christians as Candlemas, it is another tradition that can be traced back to Celtic and Roman pagans, who celebrated that the days were getting longer around this time.

Today in France it is when Christmas nativity scenes are often taken down and a day for eating crêpes that are round and golden like the sun, to herald the return to longer days. Holding a coin in your left hand while successfully flipping a crêpe with your right is thought to bring prosperity.

Forecasters said Southern California could see its wettest Christmas in years and warned of flash flooding and mudslides. Areas scorched by wildfires in January saw evacuation warnings as heavy rains and gusty winds brought mudslides and debris flows.

Many flood areas were in burn scar zones, which were stripped of vegetation by fire and are less able to absorb water.

San Bernardino County firefighters said they rescued people trapped in cars Wednesday when mud and debris rushed down a road leading into Wrightwood, a resort town in the San Gabriel Mountains about 80 miles (130 kilometres) northeast of Los Angeles. It was not immediately clear how many were rescued.

Firefighters also went door to door to check homes, and the area was under a shelter-in-place order, officials said. An evacuation order was issued for Lytle Creek, also in the San Gabriel Mountains.

Travis Guenther and his family were trapped in Lytle Creek after roaring waters washed out the only bridge in or out of their neighbourhood. More than a dozen neighbours took shelter at a community centre or found hotel rooms.

“Everybody that left to go to work this morning is stuck,” he said. “Half the families are here, and half the families are on the other side of the creek.”

Guenther said he had plenty of supplies and was coordinating with other in the community of about 280 people. Two nurses who live on his street offered to help anyone who may need medical attention.

Janice Quick, president of the Wrightwood Chamber of Commerce and a resident of the mountain town for 45 years, said a wildfire in 2024 left much of the terrain without tree coverage.

The storm also stranded Dillan Brown, his wife and 14-month-old daughter at a rented cabin in Wrightwood with almost no food and only enough diapers for about another day. Roads leading off the mountain and to a grocery store became blocked by rocks and debris, Brown said.

A resident learned of his situation and posted a call for help in a Facebook group. In less than an hour, neighbours showed up with more than enough supplies to ride out the storm, including bread, vegetables, milk, diapers and wipes.

“I think we’re a little sad and upset that we’re not going to be home with our families,” Brown said, but the “kindness shown is definitely an overwhelming feeling.”

Residents around burn scar zones from the Airport Fire in Orange County were also ordered to evacuate.

Areas along the coast including Malibu were under flood warnings until Wednesday evening, and wind and flood advisories were issued for much of the Sacramento Valley and the San Francisco Bay Area.

Several roads including a part of Interstate 5 near the Burbank Airport closed due to flooding.

The storms were the result of multiple atmospheric rivers carrying massive plumes of moisture from the tropics during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year.

Southern California typically gets half an inch to 1 inch (1.3 to 2.5 centimetres) of rain this time of year, but this week many areas could see between 4 and 8 inches (10 to 20 centimetres) with even more in the mountains, National Weather Service meteorologist Mike Wofford said.

Heavy snow and gusts created “near white-out conditions” in parts of the Sierra Nevada and made mountain pass trave treacherous. Officials said there was a “considerable” avalanche risk around Lake Tahoe, and a winter storm warning was in effect until Friday morning.

Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency in six counties to allow state assistance in storm response.

The state deployed emergency resources and first responders to several coastal and Southern California counties, and the California National Guard was on standby.

The California Highway Patrol reported a seemingly weather-related crash south of Sacramento in which a Sacramento sheriff's deputy died. James Caravallo, who was with the agency for 19 years, was apparently traveling at an unsafe speed, lost control on a wet road and crashed into a power pole, CHP Officer Michael Harper said via email.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:21:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5836f150-e179-11f0-8958-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25359158594505.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia is analysing US documents on Ukraine peace deal, Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-is-analysing-us-documents-ukraine-peace-deal-kremlin-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Kremlin is analysing the documents on ending the war in Ukraine which were brought to Moscow by special envoy Kirill Dmitriev from the United States, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 11:41:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z6NCRVZ3MBNUZFOOX4LKC37PUI.jpg?auth=2d15cc2e61e9c2fcf982cbf52a1a2a5fa5a0b1b99d409ba3aafac5e2705f86f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Christmas festivities from across the world</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251225-in-pictures-christmas-festivities-from-across-world</link><description>To display this content from YouTube, you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.

"There were appropriate contacts between our side and the French. Indeed, a proposal was made to the French regarding Vinatier," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters without providing details.

"The ball is now in France 's court," he added.

Vinatier, who works for a Swiss conflict mediation NGO and was jailed in June 2024, is serving a three-year sentence for failing to register as a "foreign agent" but faces fresh allegations of spying.

Vinatier's family have rejected the accusations against him, saying he is a victim of tensions between Moscow and Paris over the war in Ukraine .

President Vladimir Putin said last week he would look into the case after a French journalist asked him about it during an end-of-year televised press conference.

"I don't know anything about this case. This is the first I've heard of it," Putin said.

"But I promise you I'll definitely find out what it is. And if there's even the slightest chance of resolving this matter favourably, if Russian law allows it, we'll make every effort," Putin said.

Vinatier is one of several Westerners to have been arrested after Putin launched an all-out offensive on Ukraine in February 2022.

Several US citizens have been arrested and then released in prisoner exchanges brokered by both US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden .

In court hearings on his original case, Vinatier, a veteran Russia expert, said he had not known he was required to register with the authorities under Moscow's "foreign agents" law, which is widely used to target and sideline critics of the Kremlin.

He apologised and said through his work he had always tried to represent Russia's interests in international relations.

Moscow has used alleged breaches of the "foreign agents" law to arrest people before hitting them with more serious charges – as happened to Vinatier.

His family remains “cautiously hopeful” but hopes he will be "released during the holidays” between now and Orthodox Christmas on January 7, his lawyer Frédéric Belot said.

“We have every confidence in French diplomacy, which is doing its utmost,” Belot continued, hoping that Vinatier's fate will be discussed during talks between Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 12:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e28dd1b0-e17f-11f0-8a4b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24288449590640.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Daughters of King Charles' brother Andrew join royals for Christmas service</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/daughters-king-charles-brother-andrew-join-royals-christmas-service-2025-12-25/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Britain's Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie attended the royal family's traditional Christmas Day church service on Thursday, while their father Andrew, recently stripped of his titles over ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, was absent.

King Charles and Queen Camilla led senior royals to a church in Sandringham in eastern England, about 110 miles (175 km) northeast of London, greeting well-wishers in crisp winter weather.

Charles and Camilla walked ahead while the Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Kate, and their three children, followed.

Other family members included Princess Anne and her husband Tim Laurence, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh with their children, as well as the king's niece Zara and her husband Mike Tindall.

Now known only as Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, the king's younger brother has faced mounting pressure over his links to Epstein.

In October, Charles stripped him of all titles, including Duke of York and prince, and ordered him to vacate his Windsor home and move to private accommodation on the Sandringham estate, which has been the royal family's traditional venue for their Christmas Day service since 1988.

Buckingham Palace had said the steps taken against Andrew were necessary to protect the monarchy's reputation, adding that the king's thoughts and sympathies were with victims of abuse.

Andrew has denied allegations that he sexually abused Virginia Giuffre, an American woman who said she was trafficked by the late financier Epstein and forced to have sex with Andrew as a teenager - a claim Andrew settled in a U.S. civil lawsuit in 2022 without admitting liability.

The attendance of his daughters Beatrice, 37, and Eugenie, 35, underscores their continuing presence at family events despite the controversy surrounding their father.

The royals are expected to return to Sandringham House for lunch before the king's televised Christmas message later in the day.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:32:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MTUVMLU445PTTFGPZ7HPGU4ZO4.jpg?auth=81158f61344cf189c14a9c173274a10264e448f2ab7943443b8ce9a2a03988ce&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia compares US blockade of Venezuela to piracy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-compares-us-blockade-venezuela-piracy-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that the United States was reviving piracy and banditry in the Caribbean Sea by blockading Venezuela and said it hoped that U.S. President Donald Trump's pragmatism would help avoid a disaster.

"Today we are witnessing complete lawlessness in the Caribbean Sea, where long-forgotten theft of other people's property, namely piracy, and banditry, are being revived," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said of the situation.

"We consistently advocate for a de-escalation," Zakharova said. "We hope that the pragmatism and rationality of US President Trump will allow solutions to be found that are mutually acceptable to the parties within the framework of international legal norms."

"We confirm our support for the efforts of the government of Nicolas Maduro aimed at protecting sovereignty and national interests, and maintaining the stable and secure development of his country," she said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 13:34:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VD7NSDSMUBK7FCTGBVMSJH567U.jpg?auth=ea3e69418456b5bfe04fe70272d28e27d620150b9920a19a0287a6c390ed05c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro endorses son for presidency before more surgery</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-endorses-son-presidency-before-more-surgery-2025-12-25/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Brazil's former President Jair Bolsonaro endorsed his son's 2026 presidential campaign on Thursday while out of jail for more surgery that has dogged him since a stabbing seven years ago.

Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, 44, has said he wants to consolidate his father's conservative legacy at the October 4 vote where he will try to unseat leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

"With the commitment of not allowing the popular will to be silenced, I make the decision to nominate Flavio Bolsonaro as a pre-candidate for the presidency in 2026," Jair Bolsonaro said in a letter read out by Flavio in front of a hospital in the city of Brasilia where his father was being treated.

He was undergoing scheduled treatment for a hernia, his wife Michelle Bolsonaro said on social media.

Jair Bolsonaro, 70, has a history of hospitalizations and surgeries related to a stabbing he suffered while campaigning in 2018, including a 12-hour procedure for recurring intestinal issues in April this year.

Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes authorized Bolsonaro to leave prison , where he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup, for the surgery.

But police were ordered to stay outside his room where computers and mobile phones were prohibited.

Deemed a flight risk following his conviction, the ex-president was detained in late November and began serving his 27-year sentence three days later.

News of the younger Bolsonaro's presidential candidacy this month rattled financial markets. Investors had bet the ex-president would back a more seasoned candidate such as Sao Paulo Governor Tarcisio de Freitas, his former infrastructure minister.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 14:21:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TINNE5BYCRI3JEXZ64WSAULC6U.jpg?auth=2aec62cb301630369fe93c9d57fae53ab63a44a3e745fd98ceaec9a18b73d5a1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia sees slow but steady progress in Ukraine peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-sees-slow-steady-progress-ukraine-peace-talks-2025-12-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Russia sees slow but steady progress in peace talks with the United States on Ukraine, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday.

Zakharova added that Western European powers were trying to torpedo the progress and suggested that the United States counter such moves.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 14:22:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OLTCOHPXTRKT7LQWJU7LYN7LXQ.jpg?auth=ed3f1d137289b74efabd422972db0b70711dd6f841e35f001a902cddb626402d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli military says it killed a member of Iran’s Quds Force in Lebanon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-military-says-it-killed-member-irans-quds-force-lebanon-2025-12-25/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Dec 25 (Reuters) - The Israeli military said on Thursday that it killed a member of The Quds Force, the overseas arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, in Lebanon.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 14:45:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's King Charles lauds unity in diversity in his Christmas message</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-king-charles-lauds-unity-diversity-his-christmas-message-2025-12-25/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Britain's King Charles highlighted the importance of unity in diversity in his annual Christmas Day message on Thursday, as wars and tensions put communities around the world under strain.

"With the great diversity of our communities, we can find the strength to ensure that right triumphs over wrong," Charles, 77, said in his fourth annual broadcast since becoming monarch.

"As I meet people of different faiths, I find it enormously encouraging to hear how much we have in common, a shared longing for peace and a deep respect for all life."

Charles spoke of "journeying" and the importance of showing kindness to people on the move - themes that resonate at a time of intense public concern over migration around the world.

His message, delivered from Westminster Abbey where monarchs have been crowned since William the Conqueror in 1066, came at the end of a year marked by tensions in the royal family.

The king's words were followed by a performance by a Ukrainian choir, wearing traditional Ukrainian "vyshyvanka" embroidered shirts, and the London-based Royal Opera Chorus.

Charles has frequently expressed his support for Ukraine and has hosted President Volodymyr Zelenskiy at Windsor Castle three times in 2025 alone, most recently in October .

Although constitutionally required to remain above politics, the king has repeatedly spoken out on global crises, voicing concern over the Israel–Gaza conflict and expressing sorrow after violence against Jewish communities including an attack at a synagogue in northern England in October and Sydney's Bondi Beach shooting this month.

In his Christmas Day broadcast - a tradition dating back to 1932 - Charles praised military veterans and aid workers for their courage in adversity, saying they gave him hope.

In an address rich in references to the Biblical Christmas story, he also recalled his state visit to the Vatican in October, where he and Pope Leo prayed together in the first joint worship by a British monarch and a Catholic pontiff since England broke away from Rome in 1534. The British monarch is supreme governor of the Church of England.

Nearly two years after revealing an unspecified cancer diagnosis, Charles said this month that his treatment could be scaled back in the new year.

His daughter-in-law, Kate, Princess of Wales, announced in January that she was in remission after completing chemotherapy the previous September - rare disclosures for a family that traditionally guards its privacy.

Health was not the only challenge for the monarchy.

Charles stripped his younger brother Andrew of his titles as Duke of York and prince after renewed scrutiny of his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

But the year also brought a rare moment of reconciliation when Charles' younger son, Prince Harry, met his father for tea in September, their first meeting in just under two years.

Harry, who is based in the U.S., later said he hoped for healing, calling life "precious" and acknowledging limited time to mend ties.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:21:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WAF5VRVQSJPHRL7A4AXSWGSJIE.jpg?auth=1fbc08ba3aded865abe77eeefa4c948518b9d3ed979b2f00b99180159d705f78&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Forest great Robertson, 'Picasso of our game', dies at 72</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/soccer/forest-great-robertson-picasso-our-game-dies-72-2025-12-25/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 25 (Reuters) - John Robertson, the Nottingham Forest winger described by his manager Brian Clough as "a Picasso of our game", has died at the age of 72, the Premier League club said on Thursday.

He was a key member of Clough's all-conquering Forest team, assisting Trevor Francis's winner in their 1979 European Cup final victory over Malmo before scoring himself to sink Hamburg in the 1980 final.

"We are heartbroken to announce the passing of Nottingham Forest legend and dear friend, John Robertson," Forest said in a statement.

"A true great of our club and a double European Cup winner, John’s unrivalled talent, humility and unwavering devotion to Nottingham Forest will never ever be forgotten."

Robertson spent most of his career at the City Ground, making over 500 appearances across two stints at the club.

Clough once described him as a "scruffy, unfit, uninterested waste of time" who became "one of the finest deliverers of a football I have ever seen", usually with his cultured left foot.

Robertson was a stalwart of Forest's meteoric rise from the second division to winning the English first division title the following season in 1978 before the two European Cup triumphs.

He earned 28 caps for Scotland, scoring the winning goal against England in 1981, and served as assistant manager to former Forest teammate Martin O'Neill at several clubs, including Aston Villa.

"Rest in peace, Robbo… Our greatest," Forest said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 15:21:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swedish police investigating serious incident in Boden, north Sweden</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/swedish-police-investigating-serious-incident-boden-north-sweden-2025-12-25/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Swedish police are investigating a serious incident in the northern town of Boden, they said on Thursday, with daily Aftonbladet reporting that a number of injured people had been taken to hospital.

"We are taking a number of investigative measures," a police spokesperson said, declining to give further details.

Local police said the body of a 41-year-old man was found on Wednesday on the Swiss side of the bank of the Rhine next to Vaduz, Liechtenstein's capital.

He turned out to be a senior employee of the municipality of Triesen, south of Vaduz, who had been suspended a few days earlier due to irregularities in the accounts, police said.

Police later found the bodies of a 73-year-old man and two women, aged 68 and 45, in a Vaduz apartment. These were the municipality worker's parents and sister, police said. Autopsies are underway to establish what caused the four deaths.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 17:20:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JETN4SUJA5N4PGLAOBIZDTA7XQ.jpg?auth=28fd2d5ccdab2a4c8805de0213b09c8252115a51503fd2b7aa31de89275838dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, US negotiators discussed how to bring peace closer, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-us-negotiators-discussed-how-bring-peace-closer-zelenskiy-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Thursday that he spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner for about an hour on how to end the war with Russia .

"It was a really good conversation: many details, good ideas, that we discussed. There are some new ideas on how to bring the real peace closer, and it concerns formats, meetings, and, certainly, the timeline," Zelenskiy said on the Telegram app.

Trump has been pushing for a deal to end the almost four-year-long war, and in recent weeks peace efforts led by Witkoff and Kushner have been slowly inching forward.

Earlier this week, Zelenskiy presented a 20-point draft peace plan that he described as the main framework for ending the war.

The draft represented a slimmed-down version of an original 28-point plan the U.S. previously discussed with the Russian side that was widely seen as mainly benefiting Moscow as it demanded Kyiv cede territory and put curbs on its army.

However, key territorial questions remain unresolved in the new 20-point draft, Zelenskiy said, adding that a meeting with Trump would be required to solve the most sensitive issues.

Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that Moscow was analysing the documents on ending the war which were brought to Moscow by Russia's special envoy Kirill Dmitriev from the United States.

The White House did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

Zelenskiy said that Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov planned to have one more conversation with the U.S. negotiators later in the day.

"We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine and to ensure that all documents and steps are realistic, effective, and reliable," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 18:32:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BRFMIOVEMJLG5C7LGRZ346YKZ4.jpg?auth=db07454891d26ead8ac48691d7398c4998f2a3e60cf75f0fe48a12c0fd8f785c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelensky holds talks with US envoys as Russia sees 'slow but steady' peace progress</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251225-zelensky-holds-talks-us-envoys-russia-sees-slow-steady-peace-progress</link><description>Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Thursday he had had "very good" talks with US President Donald Trump 's envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner , focused on ending the "brutal Russian war".

"We discussed certain substantive details of the ongoing work," he said in a post on social media.

"There are good ideas that can work toward a shared outcome and the lasting peace," he added.

Zelensky thanked the two envoys for their "constructive approach, the intensive work, and the kind words".

"We are truly working 24/7 to bring closer the end of this brutal Russian war against Ukraine and to ensure that all documents and steps are realistic, effective, and reliable," he added.

They had also agreed during the conversation that Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov would speak with the two envoys again Thursday.

Zelensky's post came a day after having said that Ukraine had won some limited concessions in the latest version of a US-led draft plan to end the Russian invasion.

The 20-point plan, agreed on by US and Ukrainian negotiators, is being reviewed by Moscow . But the Kremlin has previously not shown a willingness to abandon its territorial demands for full Ukrainian withdrawal from the east.

Zelensky conceded on Wednesday that there were some points in the document that he did not like.

But he said Kyiv had succeeded in removing immediate requirements for Ukraine to withdraw from the Donetsk region or that land seized by Moscow's army would be recognised as Russian.

Russia, meanwhile, said talks with the United States were making gradual headway.

"In ​the negotiation process on a settlement of the Ukraine conflict, I mean in the negotiation ‍process with the United States, ​there is slow but steady progress," she said.

Zakharova ‌added that Western European ‍powers were trying to torpedo the progress and suggested that the United States counter such ‍moves.

Washington imposed visa bans on Tuesday on Ahmed and four Europeans, including French former EU commissioner Thierry Breton. It accuses them of working to censor freedom of speech or unfairly target U.S. tech giants with burdensome regulation. Ahmed lives in New York and is believed to be the only of the five currently in the country.

The move sparked an outcry from European governments who argue regulations and the work of monitoring groups made the internet safer by highlighting false information and compelling tech giants to do more to tackle illegal content, including hate speech and child sexual abuse material.

For Ahmed, the 47-year-old CEO of the U.S.-based Center for Countering Digital Hate, it also sparked fears of imminent deportation that would separate him from his wife and child, both U.S. citizens, according to a lawsuit he filed on Wednesday in the Southern District of New York.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio, when announcing the visa restrictions, said he had determined the presence of the five in the United States had potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States and they could therefore be deported.

Ahmed named Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and other Trump officials in his lawsuit, arguing officials were violating his rights to free speech and due process with the threat of deportation.

U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick issued a temporary restraining order on Thursday, which enjoined officials from arresting, detaining or transferring Ahmed before he has an opportunity for his case to be heard, and scheduled a conference between the parties for December 29.

Ahmed, in a statement provided by a representative, praised the U.S. legal system's checks and balances and said he was proud to call the country his home. "I will not be bullied away from my life’s work of fighting to keep children safe from social media’s harm and stopping antisemitism online," he said.

In response to questions about the case, a State Department spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court and Congress have repeatedly made clear: the United States is under no obligation to allow foreign aliens to come to our country or reside here."

The Department of Homeland Security did not respond to a request for comment.

Legal permanent residents, known as green card holders, do not need a visa to remain in the U.S., but the Trump administration has attempted to deport at least one already this year.

Mahmoud Khalil, detained in March after his prominent involvement in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University, was released by a judge who argued punishing someone over a civil immigration matter was unconstitutional.

A U.S. immigration judge in September ordered Khalil to be deported over claims he omitted information from his green card application, but he appealed that ruling and separate orders blocking his deportation remain in place.</description><pubDate>Thu, 25 Dec 2025 23:19:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IIVEYADSFFPBTPSINDLSK3DXEU.jpg?auth=4624682c77119d5b92492184ef8774bacd7d92318f0c58d3c8b1a92b26d9d7a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US launches strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-launches-strikes-against-islamic-state-militants-northwest-nigeria-trump-says-2025-12-25/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 25 (Reuters) - The United States carried out a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government, U.S. President Donald Trump and the U.S. military said on Thursday, claiming the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

"Tonight, at my direction as Commander in Chief, the United States launched a powerful and deadly strike against ISIS Terrorist Scum in Northwest Nigeria, who have been targeting and viciously killing, primarily, innocent Christians, at levels not seen for many years, and even Centuries!," Trump said in a post on Truth Social.

The U.S. military’s Africa Command said the strike was carried out in Sokoto state at the request of the Nigerian authorities and killed multiple ISIS militants.

The strike comes after Trump in late October began warning that Christianity faces an "existential threat" in Nigeria and threatened to militarily intervene in the West African country over what he says is its failure to stop violence targeting Christian communities.

Reuters reported on Monday the U.S. had been conducting intelligence-gathering flights over large parts of Nigeria since late November.

Nigeria’s foreign ministry said the strikes were carried out as part of ongoing security cooperation with the United States, involving intelligence sharing and strategic coordination to target militant groups.

"This has led to precision hits on terrorist targets in Nigeria by air strikes in the North West," the ministry said in a post on X.

A video posted by the Pentagon showed at least one projectile launched from a warship. A U.S. defense official said the strike targeted multiple militants at known ISIS camps.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on X thanked the Nigerian government for its support and cooperation and added: “More to come...”

Nigeria's government has said armed groups target both Muslims and Christians, and U.S. claims that Christians face persecution do not represent the complex security situation and ignore efforts to safeguard religious freedom. But it has agreed to work with the U.S. to bolster its forces against militant groups.

The country's population is split between Muslims living primarily in the north and Christians in the south.

Police said earlier on Thursday a suspected suicide bomber killed at least five people and injured 35 others in Nigeria's northeast, another region troubled by Islamist insurgents.

In a Christmas message posted on X earlier, Nigerian President Bola Ahmed Tinubu called for peace in his country, "especially between individuals of differing religious beliefs."

He also said: "I stand committed to doing everything within my power to enshrine religious freedom in Nigeria and to protect Christians, Muslims, and all Nigerians from violence."

Trump issued his statement on the strike on Christmas Day while he was at his Palm Beach, Florida, Mar-a-Lago Club, where he has been spending the holiday. He had no public events during the day and was last seen by the reporters traveling with him on Wednesday night.

The U.S. military last week launched separate large-scale strikes against dozens of Islamic State targets in Syria , after Trump vowed to hit back in the wake of a suspected ISIS attack on U.S. personnel in the country.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:43:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/42VSMAOQ2JNULDBJDEFT27LIMY.jpg?auth=03c0a9c333315216ea77d2436b99f8054a3d03aa47d337026b2907e46458b42a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Political stability at stake as Malaysia's Najib awaits verdict in biggest 1MDB trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/political-stability-stake-malaysias-najib-awaits-verdict-biggest-1mdb-trial-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak will hear a verdict on Friday in the biggest trial he faces over the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal , a ruling that could risk deepening tensions within the administration of current premier Anwar Ibrahim.

Investigators have said about $4.5 billion was allegedly stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund co-founded by Najib in 2009, and that more than $1 billion allegedly made its way into his personal bank accounts.

Najib, 72, last year apologised for mishandling the scandal while in office but he has consistently denied wrongdoing, saying he was misled by 1MDB officials and a fugitive financier, Jho Low, on the source of the funds.

In 2020, Najib was convicted of graft and money laundering for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit and began a 12-year prison sentence two years later after losing all his appeals. That sentence was later halved by a pardons board chaired by Malaysia's king, with Najib due for release in 2028.

A Malaysian high court will decide on Friday whether to convict Najib of four more charges of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering involving the illegal transfer of about 2.2 billion ringgit ($539 million) from 1MDB.

If found guilty, he could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.

The implementation of the penalties, however, could be stayed pending further appeals.

The decision will be closely watched after another court this week dismissed a bid by Najib to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest.

That ruling reignited tensions in Anwar's ruling administration, which includes Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation.

UMNO campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll ended in a hung parliament.

Several UMNO leaders expressed disappointment with the decision to deny Najib house arrest, saying it risked diluting the powers of Malaysia's rulers, while others were angered by social media posts by some members of Anwar's coalition celebrating the ruling.

Anwar this week called for all parties to handle news of the verdict with patience and wisdom, adding that it was "inappropriate to muddy the atmosphere or add tension" even if there were those who chose not to sympathize with Najib and his family.

A guilty verdict for Najib on Friday could strain ties further, with some UMNO leaders already calling for the party to review its pact with Anwar or withdraw from the government altogether. An acquittal, however, may weaken Anwar, who has been under pressure to uphold his credentials as an anti-graft campaigner.

Anwar has been accused by critics of betraying progressive voters and allies after prosecutors dropped some corruption charges against Najib and other UMNO figures . The premier has repeatedly said he does not interfere in court cases.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 01:44:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5AKU6KBTAFI7RJOEFMTHLNA7R4.jpg?auth=5f6000b76bf2d89b4c69e0e03c632c92c80d8f4a38bd329209fd13a86b2f1303&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar to hold third phase of election voting on January 25, state media reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-hold-third-phase-election-voting-january-25-state-media-reports-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Myanmar will hold a third phase of voting in its general election on January 25, according to an announcement in state media on Friday.

Faced with rising government bond yields and a weak yen, the Takaichi administration has stepped up efforts to reassure investors that the government will not resort to irresponsible debt issuance or tax cuts.

The budget for the year starting from April, to be submitted to parliament early next year, will total a record 122.3 trillion yen ($784.63 billion), exceeding this year's initial budget of 115.2 trillion yen.

Still, new government bond issuance will increase only slightly from this year's 28.6 trillion yen to 29.6 trillion yen, with the debt dependence ratio falling to 24.2%, the lowest since 1998.

Higher tax revenues, projected to rise 7.6% to a record 83.7 trillion yen, will help fund increased spending, though they will not fully offset surging debt-servicing costs, along with higher social welfare and defence outlays.

Debt-servicing costs for interest payments and debt redemption will jump 10.8% to 31.3 trillion yen, with the assumed interest rate set at 3.0%, the highest level in 29 years, as the Bank of Japan exits ultra-loose monetary policy.

Japan already has the highest debt burden in the developed world at more than twice the size of its economy, making it highly sensitive to rising borrowing costs and complicating Takaichi's plans to pursue aggressive fiscal stimulus measures.

Takaichi intends to drop the idea of using the annual primary budget balance as Japan's fiscal consolidation goal and set a new goal that extends through several years to allow more flexible spending.

The country's accident investigation board will not be in a position to release the interim update by the first anniversary on Monday of the worst aircraft accident on South Korean soil, the two board officials said. They declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter.

On December 29, 2024, the Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 made an emergency belly landing at Muan airport, overshot the runway then slammed into a concrete embankment and erupted into a fireball, killing all but two of the 181 people on board.

The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes .

The pilots shut off the less-damaged engine after the bird strike, investigators said in a July update that was not released publicly due to objections from victims' families.

Some of the family members said investigators appeared to blame the pilots without exploring other factors, such as the concrete structure beyond the end of the runway that likely made the disaster far more deadly.

"It feels like all kinds of doubts are just growing bigger and bigger. In the meantime, a year has gone by, and it feels like the frustration is only continuing to build," said Ryu Kum-Ji, a 42-year-old woman who lost both of her parents in the crash.

She joined other family members who shaved their heads and staged a protest in front of a presidential office, calling for an independent and transparent probe.

Missteps by the transport ministry, which oversees the investigation board, could also be a factor in the accident, Ryu said.

A transport ministry official told bereaved family members this month that it would examine their concerns.

"We take seriously your concerns saying that government's efforts were not sufficient in the process of (finding the truth)," the second vice minister of the transport ministry said. "The government will stand by the bereaved families and take a closer look."

South Korea's parliament will launch an independent probe into the crash on Tuesday.

Under the U.N. aviation body's rules, a final report is expected within a year of an accident, and if that is not possible, an interim statement should be made public on every anniversary detailing the investigation's progress and any safety issues raised.

But the investigation board is not planning to release an update yet because of pending legislation designed to ensure its independence, said the two officials.

Lawmakers have proposed replacing board members and transferring oversight from the transport ministry to the prime minister's office.

"We will respect the decision of the newly formed committee regarding the timing of the interim statement's publication," said one of the board officials.

South Korea's anti-corruption body found in a report this week that the concrete embankment at Muan airport violated local and global standards that call for such structures to be "frangible" so they give way in case of impact. That meant it could "cause fatal damage to aircraft and occupants."

The board had planned public hearings in early December, but delayed them at the request of the victims' families and lawmakers. Police are also investigating the accident.

"All we want is for authorities to admit they were wrong if they did wrong, and apologise. Apology and a proper disclosure of the truth...that is what we want," Ryu said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 04:54:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UBPNCKVRIBNEJNR6C4HVY4DXVM.jpg?auth=65135a25b2e585b14ef141571e0e4e1aa5c4b89a00c082da29f749f0aaefd08f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Kyiv awaits Moscow’s response to the latest US-led plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251226-live-kyiv-awaits-moscow-s-response-to-the-latest-us-led-plan</link><description>Welcome to the France 24 liveblog covering the war in Ukraine and diplomatic efforts to end the conflict.

Yemen's main southern separatist group, the Southern Transitional Council (STC), which is supported by Abu Dhabi, has pushed the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from its headquarters in Aden while claiming broad control across the south earlier this month.

"The UAE reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to supporting all endeavours aimed at strengthening stability and development in Yemen," the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it remains hopeful that STC will end an escalation and withdraw its forces from the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra.

The STC was initially part of the Sunni Muslim Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Iran-aligned Houthis. But the group has turned on the government and sought self-rule in the south.

Yemen has already been marred by a civil war since 2014, with the Houthis controlling the northern part of the country, including the capital Sanaa after forcing the Saudi-backed government to flee south.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 07:22:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia court finds ex-PM Najib Razak guilty of abuse of power in biggest 1MDB trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-court-finds-ex-pm-najib-razak-guilty-abuse-power-biggest-1mdb-trial-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak was found guilty of abuse of power on Friday in the biggest trial yet in the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal , a ruling that could have significant political repercussions.

The judge had yet to deliver the full verdict and sentencing.

Malaysia and U.S. investigators say at least $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad, a state fund Najib co-founded in 2009 while in office. More than $1 billion allegedly made its way into accounts linked to Najib, who has consistently denied wrongdoing.

Najib has been charged with four counts of corruption and 21 counts of money laundering for receiving illegal transfers of more than 2.3 billion ringgit ($569.45 million) from 1MDB. He had consistently denied wrongdoing.

"The contention by the accused that the charges against him were a witch hunt and politically motivated were debunked by the cold, hard and incontrovertible evidence against him that pointed towards the accused having abused his own powerful position in 1MDB, coupled with the extensive powers conferred upon him," Judge Collin Lawrence Sequerah said in an ongoing reading of the verdict.

Najib could face maximum jail terms of between 15 and 20 years on each charge, as well as a fine of up to five times the value of the alleged misappropriations.

Najib, 72, has been in prison since August 2022, when Malaysia's top court upheld a verdict convicting him of corruption for illegally receiving funds from a 1MDB unit. His 12-year jail sentence in that case was halved last year by a pardons board.

Najib last year apologised for mishandling the scandal while in office but had consistently denied wrongdoing, saying repeatedly that he was misled by 1MDB officials and the fugitive financier, Jho Low, about the source of the funds.

Judge Sequerah in reading the verdict had earlier said evidence had revealed Najib had an "unmistakable bond and connection" with Low, who acted as the then prime minister's "proxy and intermediary" in 1MDB affairs.

Low, who has been charged in the United States for his central role in the case, denies all wrongdoing and his whereabouts are unknown.

Najib has maintained he was misled by Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that funds deposited into his account were donations from the Saudi royal family.

But Sequerah said Najib's argument was "implausible" and dismissed letters on the donations produced by Najib that allegedly originated from the Saudi royal family, saying they were not corroborated by evidence and were probably forgeries.

"The irresistible conclusion is that the Arab donation narrative is not meritorious ... the evidence pointed unmistakably to the fact that the monies were, in fact derived from 1MDB funds," Sequerah said.

The verdict came just days after another court denied a bid by Najib to serve his jail sentence under house arrest - a decision that reignited tensions within current Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's administration.

Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation, campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll ended in a hung parliament.

Some UMNO leaders expressed disappointment with the decision to deny Najib house arrest and others were angered by social media posts by some members of Anwar's coalition celebrating the earlier ruling.

Anwar on Tuesday called for calm, urging all parties to accept the court verdict with "full patience and wisdom".

Andrei Kolesnikov, the Kremlin correspondent for the Kommersant, one of Russia's top newspapers, said that Putin briefed top businessmen on the details of the plan at a late-night Kremlin meeting on December 24.

"Vladimir Putin asserted that the Russian side is still ready to make the concessions that he made in Anchorage. In other words, that 'Donbas is ours,'" Kommersant reported.

In essence, Putin wants the whole of Donbas but outside that area "a partial exchange of territories from the Russian side is not ruled out," Kolesnikov wrote in the newspaper.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in remarks to reporters released by his office on Wednesday, said Ukrainian and U.S. delegations had inched closer to finalising a 20-point plan at the talks over the weekend in Miami.

But Zelenskiy said Ukraine and the United States had not found common ground on demands that Ukraine cede the parts of Donbas that it still controls - or on the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant which is controlled by Russian forces.

U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to end the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two and his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been negotiating with Russia, Ukraine and European powers.

The full detail of the U.S. proposals has not been disclosed, though Russian officials have repeatedly referred to unspecified "understandings" reached between Putin and Trump at a summit in Anchorage, Alaska, in August.

Russia controls all of Crimea which it annexed in 2014, about 90% of Donbas, 75% of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on the principles of the conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO.

According to Kommersant, Putin also raised the issue of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest nuclear facility in Europe, at his meeting with businessmen.

Putin, according to Kommersant, said that joint Russian-U.S. management of the nuclear power station was being discussed.

Putin also said that the United States had expressed an interest in crypto mining near the plant and that the plant should be used to partially supply Ukraine, Kommersant said.

Zelenskiy has said that sensitive issues, including any compromises on territory, should be discussed at the level of heads of state, and Kyiv has been seeking a face-to-face meeting with Trump.

"We have agreed on a meeting at the highest level – with President Trump in the near future. A lot can be decided before the New Year," he said on X following the latest round of talks between Ukrainian and U.S. negotiators.

Zelenskiy held talks on Thursday with Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff and the president's son-in-law Jared Kushner.

He said that some documents, part of a wider framework aimed at ending the conflict and ensuring Ukraine's reconstruction, were "nearly ready" while others were "fully prepared".

Earlier this week, Zelenskiy unveiled a 20-point draft peace plan that he described as the main framework for ending the war.

While the plan outlined Ukraine receiving security guarantees to prevent further Russian aggression, there was no compromise between Ukraine and the U.S. on the issues of territory, which Moscow is demanding Kyiv cede.

Control over the occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant also remained the matter of further discussion.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H3YTXAF2KJLLJE6WDUBPND2AOE.jpg?auth=b848ea5fd9bdba0f29bb9c2a4686e72ac82f270c272a99a2c6d23c8c67c37cf6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones damage foreign-flagged vessels in southern ports, Ukraine says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/russian-drones-damage-foreign-flagged-vessels-southern-ports-ukraine-says-2025-12-26/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Russian overnight drone attacks damaged Slovakia-, Palau- and Liberia-flagged vessels in ports in Ukraine's Odesa and Mykolaiv regions, Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Friday.

In recent weeks, Russia has escalated attacks on the southern Odesa region, and Ukrainian officials said Moscow aimed to cut Ukraine off from the Black Sea and sow chaos among civilians.

There were no casualties in Friday's strikes, Oleksiy Kuleba said in a statement on the Telegram messaging app, but the attacks caused power cuts and damaged elevators and civilian warehouses in the Odesa region.

Separately, Kuleba added, drones damaged a locomotive and a freight car at the northwestern Kovel railway station, around 60 kilometres (37.28 miles) from Poland.

"Despite Russia's deliberate terror, Ukraine's logistics system continues to function," Kuleba said.

Russia did not comment on the matter.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seoul court acquits ex-officials of tampering in case of man slain by North Korean troops</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/seoul-court-acquits-ex-officials-tampering-case-man-slain-by-north-korean-troops-2025-12-26/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A South Korean court on Friday acquitted five former government officials accused of manipulating facts in a case from 2020 where a fisheries official was killed at sea by North Korean troops.

The Seoul Central District Court cited a "lack of evidence" against the officials, who served in former President Moon Jae-in's administration and included ex-national security advisor Suh Hoon, and returned a verdict of not guilty.

The officials claimed before the trial that fisheries official Lee Dae-jun, who was shot dead by North Korean troops, had sought to defect to the North due to gambling debts, mental health issues and an unhappy life.

Lee's family refuted the allegations.

"The evidence submitted by the prosecutor alone is insufficient to admit that (the defendants) were trying to steer the matter to make it look like a defection to North Korea" beyond a reasonable doubt, the lower court said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear if prosecutors would appeal. The five officials had been on trial since 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says foreign tanker carrying smuggled fuel seized in Gulf</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-foreign-tanker-carrying-smuggled-fuel-seized-gulf-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Iran has seized a foreign oil tanker near the Iranian island of Qeshm in the Gulf, saying it was carrying 4 million litres of smuggled fuel, state media reported on Friday.

Authorities did not name the vessel or disclose its nationality. They said 16 foreign crew members had been detained on criminal charges. State TV said the tanker was seized on Wednesday.

Iranian news websites published video footage and photographs of what they said was the seized tanker.

Iran said last week it had seized another foreign tanker carrying 6 million litres of what it described as smuggled diesel in the Gulf of Oman without identifying the vessel or its nationality.

Iran, which has some of the world's lowest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and a sharp fall in the value of its national currency, has been seeking to curb widespread fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf states.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seoul court acquits ex-officials of tampering in case of man slain by North Korean troops</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/seoul-court-acquits-ex-officials-tampering-case-man-slain-by-north-korean-troops-2025-12-26/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:41 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Iran says foreign tanker carrying smuggled fuel seized in Gulf</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-foreign-tanker-carrying-smuggled-fuel-seized-gulf-2025-12-26/</link><description /><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:29:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>South Korean prosecutors seek ten years in prison for ousted president Yoon</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251226-south-korea-prosecutors-request-10-year-term-for-ex-president-yoon-suk-yeol</link><description>An independent counsel on Friday demanded a 10-year prison term for South Korea’s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol in the first of seven criminal cases related to his ill-fated attempt to impose martial law in 2024 and other allegations that flared when he was in office.

The first of Yoon's trials to wrap up covers charges including his defiance of authorities’ attempts to investigate and detain him. Yoon denies all charges and his lawyers have argued that the detainment warrant was invalid and illegal.

The court is expected to render a verdict as early as next month.

Yoon faces other trials on accusations ranging from corruption and favor trading to rebellion, a grave charge that is punishable by life imprisonment or execution. The rebellion trial is also nearing an end.

Yoon’s martial law enactment brought armed troops into Seoul streets and triggered South Korea 's most serious political crisis in decades.

Martial law lasted only a few hours, as lawmakers managed to enter the National Assembly and voted to lift his decree. Yoon was impeached by the opposition-controlled parliament later in December 2024 before he was formally dismissed as president upon an Constitutional Court ruling in April.

On Friday, independent counsel Cho Eun-suk’s team requested the Seoul Central District Court to sentence Yoon to 10 years in prison on charges of obstruction of official duties, abuse of power, falsification of official documents and destruction of evidence.

Yoon holed up at his residence and hindered authorities' attempts to execute a warrant for his detention for weeks after his impeachment . The standoff caused worries about physical clashes between Yoon's presidential security service and those attempting to detain him and further deepened a national divide.

Park Eok-su, a senior investigator on Cho’s team, called Yoon's actions “an unprecedented obstruction of official duties” during Friday's court session.

Yoon also faces charges that he sidestepped a legally mandated full Cabinet meeting before declaring martial law, and that he fabricated documents including the martial law proclamation and ordered data deleted from phones used by those involved in his martial law imposition.

Yoon has denied those charges and maintained  that his decree was meant to draw public support of his struggle against the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which impeached some of his top officials and obstructed his agenda.

Wrapping up a six-month probe last week, Cho’s team said Yoon plotted for over a year to impose martial law to eliminate his political rivals and monopolize power.

Yoon's other trials deal with charges like the ex-leader ordering drone flights over North Korea to deliberately stoke tensions and justify his plans to declare martial law and committing perjury in the trial of his prime minster. Yoon also faces charges that he tried to manipulate the investigation into a marine’s drowning in 2023 and received free opinion surveys from an election broker in return for a political favor.

Yoon has said he wasn't informed of such drone flights and denied wrongdoing in the influence-peddling scandal.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 08:56:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bfd8e26c-e234-11f0-b5e4-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360240895524.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explosion at mosque in Syria's Homs kills three, says local official</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-mosque-syrias-homs-kills-three-says-local-official-2025-12-26/</link><description>DAMASCUS, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Three people were killed and five injured when an explosion struck a mosque in an Alawite neighbourhood in the Syrian province of Homs on Friday, a local official said.

President Donald Trump, in a post on Truth Social, claimed the group had been targeting primarily Christians in Nigeria "at levels not seen for many years".

The Sunni Muslim group emerged in Iraq and Syria and quickly created a "caliphate", declaring its rule over all Muslims and largely displacing al Qaeda.

At the height of its power from 2014-2017 it held swathes of the two countries, ruling over millions of people. It had a base only a 30-minute drive from Baghdad, and also held the city of Sirte on Libya's Mediterranean coast.

On its territory, IS sought to rule like a centralised government, imposing its interpretation of Islamic Sharia law strictly and deploying shocking brutality including public executions and torture.

Its fighters also carried out or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world.

The caliphate eventually collapsed in Iraq and in Syria after a sustained military campaign by a U.S.-led coalition.

After being ousted from its bases in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul, the group took refuge in the hinterlands of the two fractured countries.

It retains a significant presence in Syria and Iraq , parts of Africa including the Sahel region, and in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Fighters are scattered in autonomous cells, IS leadership is clandestine and its overall size is hard to quantify. The U.N. estimates a membership of 10,000 in IS heartlands.

Many foreign fighters have joined Islamic State's Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), named after an old term for the region that included parts of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.

In the Philippines, Islamic State affiliates remain active in southern areas, especially Mindanao, where pro-Islamic State militants controlled the city of Marawi in 2017.

IS has always wanted to spread its extreme form of Islam, but has adopted new tactics since the collapse of its forces and a string of other setbacks in the Middle East.

It is now a disparate group often operating through affiliates and sympathisers.

But it has retained the ability to carry out high-profile attacks, which it claims on its Telegram channels, often posting images as part of its plan to spread terror.

While IS militants operating across several regions share an ideology, there are no signs that they exchange weapons or financing.

The U.S. military believes the group's current leader is Abdulqadir Mumin, who heads the Somalia branch.

The shooting attack at a Jewish Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach has raised questions over whether the group is inspiring lone wolf attacks once again. The police said IS appeared to inspire the gunmen, who killed 15 people.

The men accused of carrying out Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly 30 years had spent time in the Philippines, where IS-linked networks are known to operate.

IS continues to strike and plot in Syria, where the government has signed a cooperation agreement with the U.S.-led coalition combatting the group .

This month, two U.S. soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in Syria , opens new tab by a member of the Syrian security forces suspected of sympathising with IS.

The U.S. military launched large-scale strikes against dozens of IS targets in Syria, after Trump vowed to hit back in the wake of a suspected IS attack on U.S. personnel in the country.

IS has expressed hatred for Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa, calling him "Trump's boy" and accusing him of "establishing the worst and darkest chapter of treason in Islamic modern history", two days before the U.S. soldiers and interpreter were killed in Syria.

IS has also carried out attacks in Africa, showing it still has a global reach.

In October, it claimed responsibility for an attack that a U.N. mission said had killed at least 43 worshippers during a night mass at a church in eastern Congo.

In February, a military official said IS had attacked military bases in Somalia's northeastern Puntland state with suicide car and motorbike bombs, triggering airstrikes that killed 70 militants.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:46:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MNEAVZS3KRLWTK23R63WPROJUU.jpg?auth=01b39b01c1bd80819c5e0d2b4f3aa421c443a5ea5e8cb32b60c63fd80fbecacb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to meet Ukraine's Zelenskiy at Mar-a-Lago on Sunday, Axios reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-meet-ukraines-zelenskiy-mar-a-lago-sunday-axios-reports-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday at Mar-a-Lago, Axios reporter Barak Ravid said on social media platform X, citing a Ukrainian official.

His conviction is likely to heap years onto the six-year term he is already serving for a separate case related to the 1MDB fund.

The nation’s High Court found Najib, 72, guilty on four counts of abuse of power and 21 charges of money laundering related to more than $700 million channelled into his personal bank accounts from the 1MDB fund.

While Najib, the son of one of the country's founding fathers, was groomed for leadership from a young age, he experienced a spectacular fall from power as public anger mounted over the corruption scandal .

Since Najib's 2018 election loss, investigations under successive governments have ensnared him and wife Rosmah Mansor in graft allegations .

Prosecutors say Najib abused his positions as prime minister, finance minister and 1MDB advisory board chairman to move large amounts of money from the fund into his personal accounts more than a decade ago.

According to investigators, proceeds from the state fund were used to bankroll high-end real estate, a luxury yacht and precious artworks.

Friday's hearing opened around 9:00am (0100 GMT) before the Kuala Lumpur High Court in the country's administrative capital of Putrajaya.

Presiding Judge Sequerah started reading a lengthy verdict, before breaking for Friday afternoon prayers, with the hearing resuming at 3:00pm.

During the morning reading, Judge Sequerah dismissed several of the defence lawyers' arguments, including that Najib was duped by his close associate, the shadowy businessman Low Taek Jho , better known as Jho Low.

"The evidence clearly points to the fact that this was no coincidence but was evident of a relationship in which Jho Low operated as a proxy or agent of the accused with regard to the running of the affairs of 1MDB," Sequerah said.

The defence's argument that Najib was "misled and duped by management and by Jho Low is unmeritorious", the judge said.

Low, who is currently on the run, is seen as the mastermind behind the scheme to plunder the country's investment vehicle.

Sequerah also dismissed arguments that the money flowing into Najib's accounts was "donations" from Middle East funders, calling it a "tale that surpassed even those from the Arabian Nights".

The prosecution presented bank records, testimony from over 50 witnesses and documentary evidence.

Najib "paints himself as a victim of rogue subordinates, when in truth, he was the single most powerful decision-maker", deputy public prosecutor Ahmad Akram Gharib told the court during closing arguments.

"The accused wielded absolute financial, executive and political control," he said.

Najib's lawyers have previously said the politician was unaware that 1MDB's management was working hand in glove with Low to siphon large amounts of money from the fund, ostensibly established to foster economic growth in Malaysia .

Najib's lawyer, Muhammad Shafee Abdullah, last week told journalists his client "never got a fair trial".

He again blamed Low for the scandal, which dented Malaysia's image abroad.

Najib has apologised for allowing the 1MDB scandal to happen during his tenure, but he maintains he knew nothing about illegal transfers from the fund.

His legal battle was dealt a blow on Monday after he lost a bid to serve the remainder of his current jail term at home rather than the Kajang Prison outside Kuala Lumpur.

Each count of abuse of power is punishable by up to 20 years in jail and a fine of up to five times the amount of the bribe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 10:48:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f1502624-22d5-11ed-b6bd-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2022-08-23T095503Z_1851378304_RC272W93MP8B_RTRMADP_3_MALAYSIA-POLITICS-NAJIB.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thai defence minister to attend truce talks with Cambodia, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-defence-minister-attend-truce-talks-with-cambodia-pm-says-2025-12-26/</link><description>BANGKOK, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Thailand's defence minister will join ongoing talks with Cambodia on Saturday that could lead to a truce, the Thai premier said on Friday, as border clashes between the two Southeast Asian neighbours continued for a third week.

If the defence minister is able to come to an agreement with his Cambodian counterpart, the two countries will make a deal in line with a previous pact brokered with the help of U.S. President Donald Trump following a previous round of clashes in July, he said.

"What is important is that both of us have to keep the promises that both will not threaten, offend, and instigate, and to reduce hostility between the two countries," Anutin Charnvirakul told reporters in Bangkok, referring to a potential deal.

A Cambodian defence ministry spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Thai and Cambodian officials have been holding parleys at a border crossing since Wednesday as hostilities between the two countries continued. The ceasefire broke down in early December, with at least 98 people killed on both sides and more than half a million on displaced.

Since the conflict restarted, neither Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim - chair of the ASEAN bloc that facilitated the previous ceasefire - nor Trump have been successful in halting hostilities.

The warring sides have also been pressed by Beijing to put an end to the fighting, with China's special envoy for Asian affairs Deng Xijun holding talks in Bangkok and Phnom Penh in recent days.

"I hope that this time will be the last time to sign such an agreement, so that there will be peace in the area and people can return to their homes," Anutin said.

Thailand and Cambodia have accused each other of moves that led to the breakdown of the July truce, which was expanded into a wider agreement in October to help settle the conflict.

The neighbours have long disputed sections of their 817-km (508-mile) land border, and the latest fighting has stretched from forested inland areas near Laos to coastal provinces.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 11:20:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XHWH46WONJLC3MULZK7F3ULCJE.jpg?auth=613076f7f3125a1687bf9e74e03ecbcb0689d4c41836b8afe2deb43e62746d5a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli reservist rams vehicle into Palestinian man praying in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-reservist-rams-vehicle-into-palestinian-man-praying-west-bank-2025-12-26/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Dec 26 (Reuters) - An Israeli reservist soldier rammed his vehicle into a Palestinian man as he prayed on a roadside in the occupied West Bank on Thursday, after earlier firing shots in the area, the Israeli military said.

"Footage was received of an armed individual running over a Palestinian individual," it said in a statement, adding the individual was a reservist and his military service had been terminated.

The reservist acted "in severe violation of his authority" and his weapon had been confiscated, the military said.

Israeli media reported that he was being held under house arrest.

The Israeli police did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

The Palestinian man went to hospital for checks after the attack, but was unhurt and is now at home.

Video which aired on Palestinian TV shows a man in civilian clothing with a gun slung over his shoulder driving an off-road vehicle into a man praying on the side of the road.

This year ​was one of the most violent on record for Israeli civilian attacks against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to United Nations data that shows more than 750 injuries.

More than a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 7, 2023 and October 17, 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, according to the U.N. In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 11:40:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deadly blast hits Alawite mosque in Syria's Homs province</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251226-blast-alawite-mosque-in-syria-homs-province-kills-least-five</link><description>At least five people were killed in an explosion ⁠at a mosque of the Alawite minority sect in the Syrian city of Homs on Friday, Syrian state news agency ​SANA said.

Homs city's press ​office said an explosive device had detonated inside the Imam Ali bin Abi Talib mosque and that security forces had cordoned off the area.

Local official Issam Naameh told Reuters the blast took place during Friday noon prayers, typically the busiest time for mosques.

Syrian state ‍media SANA published footage of rescuers and security forces examining debris splayed across ​the mosque's green carpet. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.

Kremlin foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, spoke by telephone to several members of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. He did not say when the call took place.

Putin envoy Kirill Dmitriev brought paper copies of U.S. proposals for peace back to Moscow after a meeting in Miami at the weekend - and the details were being analysed by the Kremlin, Peskov said.

"The information was analysed, and on behalf of President Putin, contact took place between representatives of the administrations of Russia and the United States," Peskov said. "It was agreed to continue the dialogue."

When asked how the Kremlin viewed the documents, Peskov said that he did not want to comment as Russia felt making remarks in public could undermine the negotiations.

Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported that Putin told some of Russia's top businessmen that he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces in Ukraine but that he wanted the whole of Donbas.

Asked about the report, Peskov said that the Ukrainian peace discussions were touched upon "in general" and mentioned at the meeting. He gave no further details on the details of what was discussed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 12:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WGFEGIY5PVLWZPRBABY42JPBGU.jpg?auth=25ca3e5ec5e3afc0542aeb91a244bfc00328e0808a553d636926d79a7bbe9831&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON 2025: Morocco eye early qualification against Mali</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/sports/20251226-afcon-2025-morocco-eye-early-qualification-against-mali</link><description>Elsewhere in the sports news, the focus remains firmly on the Africa Cup of Nations .

But security experts say it is unclear whether such strikes can do much to hinder Islamist militants who have long menaced communities in the area.

Trump announced on Truth Social on Thursday that U.S. forces had launched a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government.

Local media reported loud explosions in the village of Jabo in the evening of Christmas Day. Reuters has not been able to confirm whether there were casualties.

Abuja confirmed it had approved the operation. Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar said on Friday Nigeria had acted jointly with the U.S., but not targeting any specific religion.

“Nigeria is a multi-religious country, and we’re working with partners like the U.S. to fight terrorism and protect lives and property,” Tuggar told Nigeria's Channels Television.

Nigeria's population of over 230 million people is roughly evenly divided among Christians, who predominate in the south, and Muslims who predominate in the north.

Last month, Trump threatened to order his forces to take military action in Nigeria unless the authorities there acted to stop what he described as the persecution of Christians.

While Nigeria has had persistent security challenges, including violence and kidnappings by Islamist insurgents in the north, it strongly denies that Christians are subjected to systematic persecution.

Its government responded to Trump's threat by saying it intended to work with Washington against militants, while rejecting U.S. language that suggested Christians were in particular peril.

“After Trump threatened to come guns-blazing in Nigeria, we saw a Nigerian delegation visit the U.S.,” Kabir Adamu, managing director of Abuja-based Beacon Security and Intelligence Limited, told Reuters.

“The Attorney General was involved, and agreements were signed. Then we learned of U.S. surveillance missions mapping terrorist locations.”

Participating in the strikes could raise a risk that the government could be perceived as endorsing Trump's language on wider sectarian strife, a sensitive issue throughout Nigeria's history.

"Trump is pandering to domestic evangelical Christian objectives with his ‘Christian genocide’ narrative,” Adamu said.

The northwestern area where Thursday's airstrikes took place has been plagued since 2024 by increasing violence from members of the Lakurawa sect, a strict Sunni Islamist movement that claims affiliation with the Islamic State group.

Formed as a vigilante outfit, the group evolved into a jihadist movement enforcing strict Islamist rule across hundreds of villages in the area. Nigeria declared the group a terrorist organisation early this year.

"It’s very likely this is the group Trump referred to when mentioning U.S. military strikes in Nigeria,” said Confidence MacHarry, senior analyst at Lagos-based SBM Intelligence. “They’ve also been linked to widespread cattle theft, with most of the stolen animals ending up in markets along the Nigeria-Niger border."

But Adamu questioned whether the strikes would do much to counter the insurgents, noting that the particular village hit was not previously known for harbouring militants.

"We were told the Nigerian government okayed the attack, but why Jabo when there is no record of any group there?" he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 13:35:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WTIZZR45R5K4DFWVYXFDTRPUBI.jpg?auth=dbab212b106daa523fcdd101e0b38d3f2dc9cadd2283e756e21c1623f73c418e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia's ex-PM Najib ordered to serve 15 years in jail in 1MDB case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysias-ex-pm-najib-ordered-serve-15-years-jail-1mdb-case-2025-12-26/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A Malaysian court on Friday sentenced former premier Najib Razak to serve 15 years in prison after convicting him on multiple counts of abuse of power and money laundering over his role in the multibillion-dollar fraud scandal at state fund 1MDB.

"Later, a young woman was stabbed near Road 71, and the suspect was ultimately engaged with gunfire near Maonot Junction in Afula following intervention by a civilian bystander," it said, adding that the attacker was hospitalised with injuries.

The U.S. has amassed a huge military presence in the Caribbean, killed dozens in strikes on boats near the Venezuelan coast it alleges were carrying drugs, and seized two fully-loaded Venezuelan crude tankers. President Donald Trump has said it would be smart for Maduro to leave power.

Hundreds of people in Venezuela's capital Caracas and other parts of the South American nation took to the streets after the July 2024 presidential election, banging pots and pans and blocking roads, demanding the opposition be declared victors.

At least 2,000 people were arrested in post-election violence, according to the government, whose top prosecutor in the following moments announced the release of several groups of detainees, including dozens aged under 18.

Venezuela's electoral authority and Supreme Court said Maduro had won the election and that the protests sought to undermine his victory for a third six-year term.

Late on Christmas Day, the penitentiary services ministry said on social media that authorities had "decided to evaluate each case individually and grant precautionary measures in accordance with the law, which has led to the release of 99 citizens."

It said the group had been detained "for their participation in acts of violence and incitement to hatred following the 2024 election day."

The Committee for the Freedom of Social Activists, a local NGO, said on X that this "number does not correspond to reality."

Penal Forum, another NGO, said they had only been able to confirm the release of 45 people - 27 men, 15 women and three teenagers, who had been "arbitrarily detained for political reasons."

"We continue to verify other possible cases," it said.

Maduro's government says it does not have political prisoners but rather "imprisoned politicians" who seek to destabilize the country.

Earlier in December, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk told the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva that repression of civic space in the South American nation had intensified, stifling people's freedoms as journalists, activists, opposition figures and humanitarian workers face threats, harassment and arbitrary detention.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 14:45:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel recognises Somaliland, Somalia's breakaway region, as independent state</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-recognises-somaliland-somalias-breakway-region-independent-state-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Israel has recognised Somaliland, a breakaway region of Somalia, as an "independent and sovereign state," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, making Israel the first country to do so.

The Southern Transitional Council, backed by the United Arab Emirates , said the strikes happened in Yemen’s Hadramout governorate. It wasn’t immediately clear if there were any casualties from the strikes that further raise tensions in the war-torn nation and put at risk a fragile Saudi-led coalition that has been battling the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in the country’s north for a decade.

The separatists said they would not be deterred by the strikes, but added that they remained open to working with Riyadh.

“The Council affirms that such actions will not serve any path of understanding and will not deter the people of the South from continuing to move forward toward restoring their full rights,” the STC said in a statement.

Still, the group said it was open to “any coordination or arrangements” that guarantee security and unity in the South, prevent the return of security threats and meet both the aspirations of the southern population and shared interests with Saudi Arabia.

Amr Al Bidh, a foreign affairs special representative for the Council, said in a statement that its fighters had been operating in eastern Hadramout on Friday after facing “multiple ambushes” from gunmen. Those attacks killed two fighters with the STC and wounded 12 others, Al Bidh said.

The Saudi strikes happened after that, he added.

The STC later described their operations in the area as seeking a wanted man and trying to cut off smuggling through the area.

Faez bin Omar, a leading member in a coalition of tribes in Hadramout, said he believed the strikes served as a warning to the STC to withdraw its fighters from the area. An eyewitness to the strikes, Ahmed al-Khed, said he saw destroyed military vehicles afterward, believed to belong to forces allied to the STC.

The STC’s satellite channel AIC aired what appeared to be mobile phone footage it described as showing the strikes. In one video, a man speaking could be heard blaming the strike on Saudi aircraft.

Officials in Saudi Arabia did not respond to a request for comment. On Thursday, the kingdom called on the Emirati-backed separatists in southern Yemen to withdraw.

The Council moved earlier this month into Yemen’s governorates of Hadramout and Mahra . That had pushed out forces affiliated with the Saudi-backed National Shield Forces, another group in the coalition fighting the Houthis.

Those aligned with the Council have increasingly flown the flag of South Yemen, which was a separate country from 1967-1990. Demonstrators rallied on Thursday in the southern port city of Aden to support political forces calling for South Yemen to secede again from Yemen.

Following the capture of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, and much of the country’s north by the Houthis in 2014, Aden has been the seat of power for the internationally recognised government and forces aligned against the rebels.

The actions by the separatists have put pressure on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which maintain close relations and are members of the OPEC+ oil cartel, but also have competed for influence and international business in recent years.

The UAE said in a statement Friday that it “welcomed the efforts undertaken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to support security and stability" in Yemen.

“The UAE reaffirmed its steadfast commitment to supporting all endeavours aimed at strengthening stability and development in Yemen, contributing positively to regional security and prosperity,” it added.

There has also been an escalation of violence in Sudan, another nation on the Red Sea, where the kingdom and the Emirates support opposing forces in that country’s ongoing war.

The Iranian-backed Houthis seized Sanaa in September 2014 and forced the internationally recognised government into exile. Iran denies arming the rebels, although Iranian-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen despite a UN arms embargo.

A Saudi-led coalition armed with US weaponry and intelligence entered the war on the side of Yemen’s exiled government in March 2015. Years of inconclusive fighting have pushed the Arab world’s poorest nation to the brink of famine.

The war has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the globe’s worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more.

The Houthis, meanwhile, have launched attacks on hundreds of ships in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war, greatly disrupting regional shipping.

Further chaos in Yemen could again draw in the United States.

Washington launched an intense bombing campaign targeting the rebels earlier this year that US President Donald Trump halted just before his trip to the Middle East in October. The Biden administration also conducted strikes against the Houthis, including using B-2 bombers to target what it described as underground bunkers used by the Houthis.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:23:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1b4b4586-e262-11f0-a9da-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25359617616473.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone attack kills two soldiers in Chad near Sudan border, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/drone-attack-kills-two-soldiers-chad-near-sudan-border-sources-say-2025-12-26/</link><description>N'DJAMENA, Dec 26 (Reuters) - A drone attack killed two Chadian soldiers at a military camp near the Sudan border before dawn on Friday, local authorities and a security source said, adding it was not immediately clear who was behind the strike.

Two people were killed and one seriously injured in the attack on the border town of Tine, said Hamit Hassan, prefect of the department that includes Tine. He said he had no information on who was responsible.

A Chadian military intelligence officer told Reuters the drone came from Sudan but it was unclear whether it was launched by the country’s army or paramilitary Rapid Support Force.

"We are still in the process of confirming the origin of this drone. If it is a Sudanese military drone, we will exercise our right to retaliate," the officer, who asked not to be named because he wasn't authorized to speak on the record, told Reuters.

"The air force base in (the eastern city) Abeche is already on high alert and ground reinforcements are already in Tine."

Sudan's army and the RSF did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tine serves as a transit camp for Sudanese refugees who later move on to safer camps away from the border, though humanitarian sources say a lack of funds to provide water, sanitation and shelter at inland camps has slowed relocation efforts.

More than 12 million people have already been displaced by the ongoing war in Sudan, according to the International Rescue Committee (IRC) .</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 15:43:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea to end overseas adoptions amid UN concern over human rights abuses</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251226-south-korea-end-overseas-adoptions-amid-un-concern-human-rights-abuses</link><description>South Korea ’s government said it plans to end its waning foreign adoptions of Korean children , while United Nations investigators voiced “serious concern” over what they described as Seoul’s failure to ensure truth-finding and reparations for widespread human rights violations tied to decades of mass overseas adoptions.

The announcement Friday came hours after the United Nations human rights office released South Korea’s response to investigators urging Seoul to spell out concrete plans to address the grievances of adoptees sent abroad with falsified records or abused by foreign parents.

The issue had rarely been discussed at the UN level, even as South Korea faces growing pressure to confront widespread fraud and abuse that plagued its adoption programme, particularly during a boom in the 1970s and 1980s when it annually sent thousands of children to the West.

The country will phase out foreign adoptions over a five-year period, aiming to reach zero by 2029 at the latest as it tightens welfare policies for children in need of care, Vice Minister of Health and Welfare Lee Seuran said during a briefing.

South Korea approved foreign adoptions of 24 children in 2025, down from around 2,000 in 2005 and an annual average of more than 6,000 during the 1980s.

In the health ministry’s briefing and response to the UN, officials focused on future improvements rather than past problems.

“Adoptions were mainly handled by private adoption agencies before, and while they presumably prioritised the best interests of the child, there may have also been other competing interests,” Lee said.

“Now, with the adoption system being restructured into a public framework, and with the Health Ministry and the government having a larger role in the process for approving adoptions, we have an opportunity to reassess whether international adoption is truly a necessary option,” she added, citing efforts to promote domestic adoptions.

UN investigators, including special rapporteurs on trafficking, enforced or involuntary disappearances and child abuse, raised the adoption issue with Seoul after months of communication with Yooree Kim. The 52-year-old was sent to a French family in 1984 without her biological parents’ consent, based on documents falsely describing her as an abandoned orphan.

Kim said she endured severe physical and sexual abuse by her adopters and petitioned the UN as part of a broader effort to seek accountability from governments and adoption agencies in South Korea and France .

Citing broader systemic issues and Kim’s case, UN investigators criticised South Korea for failing to give adoptees effective access to remedies for serious abuses and for the “possible denial of their rights to truth, reparations, and memorialisation”.

They also voiced concern over the suspension of a government fact-finding investigation into past adoption abuses and fraud, despite reports of grave violations including cases that may amount to enforced disappearances.

In its response, South Korea highlighted past reforms focused on abuse prevention including a 2011 law that reinstated judicial oversight of foreign adoptions, which ended decades of control by private agencies and resulted in a significant drop in international placements.

South Korea also cited recent steps to centralise adoption authority.

However, the government said further adoption investigations and stronger reparations for victims would hinge on future legislation. It offered no new measures to address the vast backlog of inaccurate or falsified records that have blocked many adoptees from reconnecting with birth families or learning the truth about their origins.

Choi Jung Kyu, a human rights lawyer representing Kim, called South Korea’s response “perfunctory”. He noted that promises of stronger reparations, which were meant to reduce the need for victims to litigate, are not clearly spelled out in draft bills proposing a relaunch of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses.

The government also vetoed a bill in April that would have removed the statute of limitations for state-related human rights violations, although that was before President Lee Jae-myung took office in June. Lee issued an apology in October over past adoption problems, as recommended by the truth commission.

Choi, who represents multiple plaintiffs suing the government over human rights abuses under past dictatorships, said they often face prolonged legal battles when authorities dismiss truth commission findings as inconclusive or cite expired statutes of limitations.

Kim, who could not immediately be reached for comment, filed a rare petition for compensation against the South Korean government in August, noting that authorities at the time of her adoption falsely documented her as an orphan despite having a family.

Following a nearly three-year investigation into complaints from 367 adoptees in Europe, the US and Australia, the truth commission in March recognised Kim and 55 other adoptees as victims of human rights violations including falsified child origins, lost records and child protection failures.

That was weeks before the commission halted its adoption investigation following internal disputes among commissioners over which cases warranted recognition as problematic. The fate of the remaining 311 cases, either deferred or incompletely reviewed, hinges on whether lawmakers establish a new truth commission through legislation.

The commission’s findings acknowledged state responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption programme rife with fraud and abuse. The programme was driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children’s backgrounds and origins. The findings largely aligned with previous reporting by The Associated Press.

The AP investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), detailed how South Korea’s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to send some 200,000 Korean children overseas despite evidence that many were procured through questionable or unscrupulous means.

Seoul’s past military governments passed special laws promoting foreign adoptions, removing judicial oversight and giving vast powers to private agencies, which bypassed proper child relinquishment procedures while shipping thousands of children overseas each year.

Western nations largely ignored the abuses and sometimes pressured South Korea to maintain the supply to meet their high demand for babies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:27:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b58e7d0c-e271-11f0-bc30-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360246423921.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New York plans patriotic NYE ball drop to mark USA's 250th birthday</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251226-new-york-plans-patriotic-nye-ball-drop-mark-usa-250th-year</link><description>When the ball drops on New Year’s Eve in New York City, it will sparkle in red, white and blue, ushering in 2026 and kicking off months of celebrations for the nation’s upcoming 250th birthday.

The patriotic touches at this year’s Times Square gathering, including a second confetti drop, will offer an early glimpse of what’s ahead: hundreds of events and programmes, big and small, planned nationwide to mark the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

“I’m telling you right now, whatever you’re imagining, it’s going to be much more than that,” said America250 Chair Rosie Rios, who oversees the bipartisan commission created by Congress in 2016 to organise the semiquincentennial anniversary. “It’s going to be one for the ages, the most inspirational celebration this country and maybe the world has ever seen.”

Rios and her group worked with the Times Square Alliance business district and One Times Square, the building from which the ball drops, to make the changes to this year’s ceremonies. They're also planning a second ball drop on July 3, the eve of the nation’s birthday, “in the same beautiful style that Times Square knows how to do it", Rios said.

It will mark the first time in 120 years that there will be a ball drop in Times Square that doesn't occur on New Year’s Eve, she said.

A New Year’s Eve ball was first dropped in Times Square in 1907. Built by a young immigrant metalworker named Jacob Starr, the 700-pound (318-kilogramme), 5-foot- (1.5-metre-) diameter ball was made of iron and wood and featured 100 25-watt light bulbs.

Last year, the Constellation Ball, the ninth and largest version, was unveiled. It measured about 12 feet (3.7 metres) in diameter and weighs nearly 12,000 pounds (5,400 kilogrammes).

The only years no ball drop occurred were 1942 and 1943, when the city instituted a nightly “dimout” during World War II to protect itself from attacks. Crowds instead celebrated the new year with a moment of silence followed by chimes rung from the base of One Times Square.

This year, the stroke of midnight will also mark the official launch of America Gives, a national service initiative created by America250. Organisers hope to make 2026 the largest year of volunteer hours ever aggregated in the country.

On the following day, America250 will participate in the New Year’s Day Rose Parade in Pasadena, California , with a float themed “Soaring Onward Together for 250 Years". It will feature three larger-than-life bald eagles representing the country’s past, present and future.

“We want to ring in this new year from sea to shining sea. What better way to think about it than going from New York to California,” Rios said. "This has to be community-driven, this has be grassroots. We’re going from Guam to Alaska, from Fairbanks to Philadelphia, and everything in between.”

President Donald Trump has also announced the “Freedom 250” initiative to coordinate additional events for the 250th anniversary.

Rios said she sees the wide range of celebrations and programmes planned for the coming months, from large fireworks displays and statewide potluck suppers to student contests and citizen oral histories, as an opportunity to unite a politically divided nation.

“If we can find something for everyone ... having those menus of options that people can pick and choose how they want to participate," she said. “That’s how we’re going to get to engaging 350 million Americans.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 16:50:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8b3db77c-e274-11f0-aa0c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25358639593329.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More rain expected in drenched California before drier weekend</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/more-rain-expected-drenched-california-before-drier-weekend-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - Storm-hit Southern California was at risk on Friday of more floods hampering millions of motorists traveling after Christmas, but the National Weather Service predicts a drier weekend.

The holiday deluge that started in earnest on Christmas Eve was spawned by the region's latest atmospheric storm, a vast airborne current of dense moisture siphoned from the Pacific, that swept inland over the greater Los Angeles area.

It dumped 6 inches of rain in the Los Angeles area with up to 18 inches of rain in the mountains, washing out some roads, and spurred evacuations and some shelter-in-place orders.

An additional 1-to-3 inches of rain is expected on Friday, said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, a commercial forecasting company.

"Our overall picture is that there's just one more day of this mess, mostly across Southern California, specifically in the LA area," Kines said on Friday. "We still have some issues today with bouts of heavy rain, but this weekend is mainly dry, thankfully."

More than 14.5 million Californians were expected to travel by car over the Christmas holiday, according to AAA. The coming drier weather should make traveling easier, after days of slick or flooded roads, forecasters said.

The atmospheric river that brought the trouble will wind down through Friday across California with lingering heavy rainfall, heavy mountain snow, and gusty winds.

Many of the evacuation warnings issued in Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties were lifted on Christmas Day. But the orders remain on Friday in the hard-hit town of Wrightwood, a rural community with a population of about 5,000 in the San Gabriel Mountains on the border between Los Angeles and San Bernardino counties.

Aerial video footage posted online on Christmas Eve by the fire department showed rivers of mud coursing through inundated cabin neighborhoods, and mud-covered cars and homes.

Videos posted online on Thursday showed some residents scrambling over washed-out roads, picking through rubble on Christmas Day as streams of water still flowed over mounds of mud and into gullies that were once streets.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 17:19:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JOKXC5YHOVKINJKC2APJTAS2P4.jpg?auth=eaa7c3f54390f5b93e08cc21058549809215af1ebb84c18604e800d986724aac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio spoke with Honduras President-elect Asfura after election victory</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rubio-spoke-with-honduras-president-elect-asfura-after-election-victory-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Honduran President-elect Nasry Asfura to congratulate him on his victory, the State Department said on Friday.

Throughout his long political career, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had repeatedly singled out the Iranian Republic as Israel’s number one enemy, saying its nuclear program had one goal: the destruction of the Jewish state.

Meanwhile Iran had long called for Israel’s destruction and provided arms for its opponents in Gaza and Lebanon .

What was unclear was how a conflict between the two adversaries – both of which have considerable military might – could play out.

The question was answered in the early hours of June 13, 2025, as explosions were heard in the Iranian capital Tehran and Netanyahu announced that operation “Rising Lion” had begun.

The armed conflict between the two arch enemies drew in neighbouring countries Jordan and Qatar as well as the US , whose President Donald Trump dubbed it the “12-day war”.

Throughout 2024, Iran and Israel had been launching small-scale attacks on each other, with Tehran firing missiles and drones at Israel while Tel Aviv’s fighter jets targeted Iran’s missile launchers and aerial defences.

But the tit-for-tat skirmishes paled in comparison to Israel’s surprise operation launched on June 13. Overnight, 200 planes targeted military sites throughout Iran and the regime’s major nuclear sites at Natanz, Fordo and Isfahan.

Within a few hours, Israel had seized control of Iranian airspace, and in the 12 days that followed, its air force carried out operations across Iran’s territory.

Israel launched 360 attacks in 27 Iranian provinces throughout the 12-day war, with a third striking Tehran, according to US-based monitor ACLED .

Part of the success of operation “Rising Lion” came down to Israel’s use of of First Person View (FPV) drones , which can be operated remotely using an onboard camera. They were flown by Mossad agents working undercover inside Iran to target sensitive infrastructure and high-profile members of the regime from the conflict's first hours.

By the evening of June 13, Israel had overwhelmed Iran’s air defence system, carried out strikes on several Iranian cities and eliminated at least twenty of the regime’s senior officers.

These included Iran’s highest-ranking military officer, Mohammad Bagher, and Revolutionary Guards commander-in-chief Hossein Salami.

Nine of Iran’s top scientists were killed by targeted strikes in what French newspaper Le Monde described as a “decisive blow” to Tehran’s nuclear program.

Over the next 12 days, a total of 16 scientists would be killed by Israel.

Days after first launching the attack, Netanyahu confirmed that Israel was trying to eliminate Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei .

Trump said on June 17 that the US forces knew “exactly” where Khamenei was hiding but would not try to eliminate him – “at least not for now”.

Ultimately, Israel did not topple Iran’s longtime leader, but its 12-day assault on Iran did considerably weaken the regime’s military might.

“We have set Iran's nuclear project back by years, and the same goes for its missile program,” said Israeli army chief of staff Eyal Zamir on June 25.

Iran's stockpile of 2,500 ballistic missiles was reduced to a maximum of 1,500, and two-thirds of its missile launchers were destroyed, according to figures from the Israeli army.

In the Iranian capital, strikes targeted government buildings, state media outlets, universities and the infamous Evin prison .

They also hit civilians. Iran’s health ministry said that 610 civilians were killed and 4,700 wounded during the 12-day conflict. It did not say how many members of the military had been killed or wounded.

As Israel launched its attack on Iran, Tehran was quick to respond.

Khamenei issued a statement on June 13 assuring Iranians that Israel would “not remain unscathed from the consequences” of its attack and that the Iranian response would “not be half-measured”.

By the evening of June 13, Iran launched Operation Honest Promise 3, firing Shahed drones and hypersonic missiles towards Israel.

Air raid sirens sounded across the country as missiles flew across the sky above Jerusalem and strikes caused fires in buildings in Tel Aviv.

Iran fired least 150 missiles overnight, according to estimates from the Israeli army, most of which were intercepted with help from the United States and Jordan.

Major targets included Israel's “Pentagon”, the Kirya, and the country’s nuclear facilities. At least two people were killed and around 60 wounded, according to emergency services.

Over the coming days, the Israeli army banned the sharing of videos or photos on social media showing the damage caused by Iranian bombing,

But missile salvos caused significant damage in Israeli towns and cities, an oil refinery in Haifa, power plants, water treatment plants, Soroka Hospital in Beer-Sheva and the research centre at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot.

Iran fired some 550 missiles and 1,000 drones, 90 percent of which were intercepted by Israel and its allies, according to the Israeli army.

Some 36 direct hits on populated areas killed at least 28 civilians and injured 3,000, according to ACLED.

Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz mapped the damage caused by Iranian missiles in urban centres, finding that 480 buildings were damaged in Tel Aviv across five separate sites, “obliterating” some neighbourhoods.

In the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, 237 buildings were damaged across three sites, with around ten being severely damaged.

In Bat Yam, another Tel Aviv suburb, 78 buildings were damaged by a single strike, with 22 of them subsequently condemned for demolition.

Israelis submitted 40,000 compensation claims to the authorities for damage caused by Iran’s attacks, but the population as a whole were overwhelmingly supportive of their prime minister's decision to attack Iran.

As Israel and Iran traded strikes, the US delayed joining the war alongside Tel Aviv. “I may do it, I may not do it,”Trump said on June 18 – day five of the conflict. “Nobody knows what I'm going to do.”

In previous months Trump had urged Netanyahu not to attack Iran as he sought to reach a nuclear deal with Tehran, but was quick to praise Israel’s strikes on the first day of the war as “excellent” and “very successful”.

Meanwhile, Israel was pressing Trump to provide it with “bunker buster” bombs to deliver a fatal blow to Iran's nuclear programme.

The US finally deployed its GBU-57 bombs – 13-ton laser-guided munitions designed to destroy underground bunkers – overnight on June 21 as part of operation "Midnight Hammer".

Seven B2 stealth bombers carrying the munitions took off from the US state of Missouri and entered Iranian airspace, where they targeted the two main sites for the production and storage of enriched uranium buried dozens of metres underground at the Fordo and Natanz sites.

Hidden in desert areas in central Iran, defences at the two sites had already been weakened by Israel's air strikes.

At Fordo, 12 bunker-buster bombs were dropped successively on two ventilation shafts, according to the US military . Two other bombs were dropped on the Natanz site, while US Navy submarines fired two dozen Tomahawk cruise missiles at the Nuclear Technology Center in Isfahan.

Trump announced that Iran's main nuclear sites had been “completely and totally destroyed” by the strikes, although US intelligence later contradicted this claim .

Two days later, Iran retaliated by bombing the largest US base in the Middle East , Al-Udeid in Qatar .

But Tehran had warned Washington in advance of the strikes, and the dozen missiles caused no American casualties.

Claiming the US had achieved its objectives by preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, Trump took to his social media network on June 24 to declare an end to the war.

“It has been fully agreed by and between Israel and Iran that there will be a Complete and Total CEASEFIRE… an Official END to THE 12 DAY WAR will be saluted by the World,” he wrote on Truth Social.

Israel and Iran continued to launch attacks on each other for a few hours, with final strikes targeting the Iranian capital and Beer-Sheva in southern Israel, before fighting stopped – and both sides claimed victory.

Netanyahu claimed a "historic" triumph for his country and warned that Israel would “thwart” any future attempts by Iran to revive its nuclear program.

Iran's top security body, meanwhile, said the Islamic Republic's forces had "compelled" Israel to "unilaterally" stand down.

Denmark was also traditionally thought of as a "frugal" member of the EU when it came to common expenditure. But all this has changed with the war in Ukraine and the long shadow that Russia casts over the Baltic and Nordic regions.

Denmark's stated priority for its presidency of the EU in 2025 is "A Competitive and Green Europe". Combining those two objectives has arguably become a strength for the kingdom, as it has long been a pioneer in green energy . Wind power, especially offshore, produces over 50 percent of the country's electricity needs. Danish Green MEP Rasmus Nordqvist joins us as we visit an iconic wind farm just off the coast of the capital Copenhagen .

Despite its small size, Denmark is also a major player when it comes to agriculture – especially on intensive farming. Here again it's a pioneer, becoming the first country in the world to tax livestock methane emissions, also known as a flatulence tax. Our team visit a dairy farm in Jutland to see the impact there.

Economically, Denmark has historically been export-oriented: its modest population and its maritime history mean it has long been outward facing when it comes to trade. Our team heads to the country's second-biggest container port at Fredericia, to discuss the effects of US President Donald Trump 's and China 's international tariffs . We meet MEP Niels Flemming Hansen, from the conservative European People's Party.

Finally, we tackle another key issue: Greenland . It's an autonomous territory in Denmark with a significant independence movement, and its strategic location and its natural resources make it a tempting target for the US president. Greenland was thrust into the international spotlight earlier this year because of Trump's sudden interest in the territory. Our team interview Jens Heinrich, the head of Greenland's representation in Denmark.

From Danish design and from pharma to farmers, our reporter Luke Brown visits some of the most emblematic sectors of the Danish economy, to gauge the impact of the global economic headwinds.

Denmark was also traditionally thought of as a "frugal" member of the EU when it came to common expenditure. But all this has changed with the war in Ukraine and the long shadow that Russia casts over the Baltic and Nordic regions.

We take a closer look at one of the key priorities of Denmark's EU presidency: Europe 's defence policy, in an era marked by the US retreat from Europe and Russia's increasingly aggressive posture. Indeed, Denmark has been dealing with a series of drone incursions over its territory. To discuss these issues, our team meets with one of the vice-presidents of the European Parliament , Danish MEP Christel Schaldemose from the Socialists and Democrats, as well as with the head of the Danish Defence Intelligence Service, Thomas Ahrenkiel.

We also illuminate a specifically Danish phenomenon: a left-leaning, Social Democratic-led government that pursues a very hard line on migration and asylum. It's a strategy that seems to be gaining ground in the EU. This December, EU member states gave the green light to tightening immigration policy, including the setting up of controversial "return hubs" outside the bloc.

At home, Denmark's move to crack down on what the government calls "parallel societies" has faced accusations that it discriminates against people of migrant heritage. To discuss these questions, we meet with former Renew MEP Karen Melchior from the European think tank CEPS (Centre for European Policy Studies), and we visit Nørrebro, a multicultural district of Copenhagen , where we watch local football team Nørrebro United.

Our reporter Charlotte Prudhomme investigates the impact of fake news in Denmark, and the efforts being made to counter them.

And our reporter Luke Brown meets the people most affected by Denmark’s hard line on immigration: two young women who fled Syria a decade ago. We discuss how they cope with the uncertainty of not knowing if they'll be able to stay in Denmark.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, has become Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending much of his adult life in and out of detention due to his activism, and a rare symbol of opposition to a far-reaching crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

The lengthy imprisonment of Abd el-Fattah, who obtained British citizenship through his mother, Laila Soueif, in 2021, and his repeated hunger strikes alongside her prompted widespread international pleas for his release.

She confirmed his return on Facebook: "Praise be to Allah, Alaa reached London safely".

In a longer statement, his family said he flew to Britain on Friday from Cairo after his travel ban was lifted by Egyptian authorities on December 20. The statement said he would shortly be reunited with his 14-year-old son Khaled, who lives in Brighton in southern England with his mother.

"I'm delighted that Alaa Abd el-Fattah is back in the UK and has been reunited with his loved ones, who must be feeling profound relief," Starmer said on social media platform X.

"I want to pay tribute to Alaa’s family, and to all those that have worked and campaigned for this moment."

Despite campaigns calling for Abd el-Fattah's release, notably during the COP27 climate summit that Egypt hosted in 2022 , Sisi pardoned him in September this year, having ordered authorities to study his possible pardon . Abd el-Fattah's name had been removed from Egypt's "terrorism" list months earlier.

On Friday, Starmer also thanked the president for his decision to grant the pardon.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:16:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man arrested after three women stabbed on Paris metro</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251226-man-arrested-after-three-women-stabbed-on-paris-metro</link><description>French police on Friday arrested a man suspected of stabbing three women in the Paris metro as the capital's end-of-year festivities were in full swing, prosecutors told AFP.

The researchers' assessment broadly aligns with U.S. intelligence findings, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share information not authorized for public release.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has made clear his intention to place intermediate-range Oreshnik missiles, with an estimated range of up to 3,400 miles (5,500 km), in Belarus, but the exact location has not been previously reported.

Deployment of the Oreshnik would underscore the Kremlin’s growing reliance on the threat of nuclear weapons as it seeks to deter NATO members from supplying Kyiv with weapons that can strike deep inside Russia, some experts said.

The Russian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Belarus Embassy declined to comment. The state-run Belta news agency quoted Defense Minister Viktor Khrenin on Wednesday as saying that the Oreshnik’s deployment would not alter the balance of power in Europe and was “our response” to the West’s “aggressive actions.”

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment and the CIA declined to comment.

Researchers Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies, in California, and Decker Eveleth of the CNA research and analysis organization in Virginia, said they based their finding regarding the deployment of Oreshniks on imagery from Planet Labs, a commercial satellite firm, that showed features consistent with a Russian strategic missile base.

Lewis and Eveleth said they were 90 percent certain that mobile Oreshnik launchers would be stationed at the former airbase near Krichev, some 190 miles (307 km) east of the Belarus capital of Minsk, and 300 miles (478 km) southwest of Moscow.

Moscow tested a conventionally armed Oreshnik – Russian for Hazel tree - against a target in Ukraine in November 2024. Putin boasts that it's impossible to intercept because of velocities reportedly exceeding Mach 10.

Putin plans to deploy the weapon “in Belarus to extend its range further into Europe,” said John Foreman, an expert with the Chatham House who served as a British defense attache in Moscow and Kyiv.

Foreman said he also sees such a move as a reaction to the planned stationing in Germany next year by the U.S. of conventional missiles that include the intermediate-range hypersonic Dark Eagle.

The Oreshnik’s deployment would come with only weeks left before the expiration of 2010 New START pact, the last U.S.-Russia treaty limiting deployments of strategic nuclear weapons by the world’s biggest nuclear powers.

Putin said after a December 2024 meeting with his Belarusian counterpart, Alexander Lukashenko, that the Oreshnik could be stationed in Belarus in the second half of this year - part of a revised strategy in which Moscow is basing nuclear weapons outside its territory for the first time since the Cold War.

Lukashenko last week said that the first missiles had been deployed without mentioning a location.

Lukashenko said up to 10 Oreshniks would be based in Belarus. The American researchers assessed that the site is large enough to accommodate only three launchers and that others may be based at another location.

U.S. President Donald Trump works to reach a deal with Moscow to end its war in Ukraine, which has been urging its Western allies to send weapons that can reach deep inside Russia.

Trump for now has rejected Kyiv’s request for Tomahawk cruise missiles, capable of striking Moscow. Britain and France have supplied cruise missiles to Ukraine. Germany in May announced it will co-produce long-range missiles with Ukraine with no limits on their range or targeting.

The American researchers said reviews of the Planet Labs imagery revealed a hurried construction project that began between August 4-12 and showed features consistent with those of a Russian strategic missile base.

One “dead giveaway” in a November 19 photo is a “military-grade rail transfer point” enclosed by a security fence to which missiles, their mobile launchers and other components could be delivered by train, said Eveleth.

Another feature, said Lewis, is the pouring at the end of the runway of a concrete pad that then was covered with earth that he called “consistent with a camouflaged launch point.

Pavel Podvig, a Geneva-based expert on Russia’s nuclear forces, said he was skeptical deploying the Oreshnik would provide Moscow with any additional military or political advantages other than reassuring Belarus of its protection.

“I don’t see how this would be seen in the West...as kind of different from these being deployed in Russia,” he said.

But Lewis said deploying the Oreshnik in Belarus underscored how Russia’s stationing of nuclear weapons outside its territory sent a “political message” of its increased reliance on them.

“Can you imagine if we put a nuclear-armed Tomahawk (cruise missile) in Germany instead of just the conventional ones?” Lewis said. “There is no military reason to put the system in Belarus, only political ones.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 19:38:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WNWMR54JURLYPCLBDGCLPKPVYE.jpg?auth=5eb5dfaab54de26e837db37339f078f74d3ae5a14bbabae893da9718e1aaf367&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's top court orders detention of ex- head of highway police after escape attempt</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-top-court-orders-detention-ex-head-highway-police-after-escape-attempt-2025-12-26/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Brazil Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Friday ordered the preventive detention of the former head of the country's federal highway police, who was captured in Paraguay, according to a court document seen by Reuters and information from two people familiar with the matter.

Silvinei Vasques, who served under former President Jair Bolsonaro, was caught while trying to board a plane at Asuncion airport in neighboring Paraguay, in an attempt to reach El Salvador, after breaking a court-ordered ankle monitor.

Vasques was recently sentenced to 24 years and six months in prison for his role in a 2023 attempted coup , the same incident for which Bolsonaro is now serving a 27-year sentence for orchestrating the plot.

The former cop, who was not yet in jail, apparently broke his electronic ankle monitor while in Brazil's southern state of Santa Catarina, prompting security alerts at border checkpoints, according to the Supreme Court document.

Vasques, caught with a fake Paraguayan passport, planned the escape using a rented car and even took his dog with him, the document said, adding that the attempt to flee warranted converting precautionary measures like the electronic tag into preventive detention.

Reached by Reuters, Vasques' attorney did not comment on his client´s attempt to flee.

Vasques is not the first official convicted over the 2023 coup attempt who has tried to flee Brazil. In November, the Supreme Court ordered the arrest of the former intelligence agency director Alexandre Ramagem, who left the country in September and has since been living in the United States.

That same month, Moraes ordered Bolsonaro be detained after the former president tried to remove his court-ordered ankle monitor using a soldering iron. Bolsonaro was then under house arrest.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 20:23:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZN6ET5HN5JLR3MXEAP4TLRLU2M.jpg?auth=ca43379f7fb6c688b10b8fb5d0ba8f9726d411caca7631e803788db97aaf2335&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says Russia using Belarus territory to circumvent Ukrainian defences</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/zelenskiy-says-russia-using-belarus-territory-circumvent-ukrainian-defences-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that Russia was using ordinary apartment blocks on the territory of its ally Belarus to attack Ukrainian targets and circumvent Kyiv's defences.

The Kremlin used Belarusian territory to launch its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and Belarus remains a steadfast ally, though longstanding President Alexander Lukashenko has vowed to commit no troops to the conflict.

"We note that the Russians are trying to bypass our defensive interceptor positions through the territory of neighbouring Belarus. This is risky for Belarus," Zelenskiy wrote on Telegram after a military staff meeting.

"It is unfortunate that Belarus is surrendering its sovereignty in favour of Russia's aggressive ambitions."

Zelenskiy said Ukrainian intelligence had observed that Belarus was deploying equipment to carry out its attacks "in Belarusian settlements near the border, including on residential buildings.

"Antennae and other equipment are located on the roofs of ordinary five-storey apartment buildings, which help guide 'Shaheds' (Russian drones) to targets in our western regions. This is an absolute disregard for human lives, and it is important that Minsk stops playing with this."

The Russian and Belarusian defence ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Zelenskiy said the staff meeting also discussed ways of financing interceptor drones, which officials in Kyiv see as the best economically viable means of tackling Russian drone attacks, which have grown in intensity in recent months.

The president said the Ukrainian military's general staff had been charged with working out changes to strategy in fending off air attacks "to defend infrastructure and frontline positions."

Lukashenko this month said Russia's Oreshnik ballistic missile system, described by Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin as impossible to intercept, had been deployed to Belarus and entered active combat duty.

An assessment by two U.S. researchers, reported by Reuters on Friday , said Moscow was likely stationing the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik at a former air base in eastern Belarus, a development that could bolster Russia’s ability to deliver missiles across Europe.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 21:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NFKAV6CM5BPNNHDXJYBYKTGNOI.jpg?auth=dc84c1ada42e2b578f14e8e7e4c5046669d74fb2544ee70faef4743c152a97d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuelans held in Salvadoran prison look to challenge deportation in US court</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/venezuelans-held-salvadoran-prison-look-challenge-deportation-us-court-2025-12-26/</link><description>Dec 26 (Reuters) - A group of Venezuelans who were sent to a maximum-security El Salvador prison from the U.S. and then returned to Venezuela called on Friday for the United States to comply with a ruling that would allow them to challenge their deportation in U.S. courts.

U.S. Judge James Boasberg ruled this week that President Donald Trump's administration must urgently arrange for the return of the hundreds of Venezuelans who were deported to El Salvador, saying their expulsion violated their due process rights and that they have the right to challenge their deportation in court.

Under the ruling, the Trump administration must present a plan to allow their return within two weeks.

"The court ruling now orders that we be granted the opportunity for a fair hearing in accordance with the law in the United States," Ysqueibel Peñaloza, a former detainee, said on behalf of some 252 former prisoners.

"We call on the governments of the United States and El Salvador to fully comply with the court order. We demand that the authorities of that country create the conditions that will allow us to participate in the hearing."

Peñaloza asked for national and international help in their defense, without specifying what help they needed.

The Venezuelans were sent to El Salvador from the U.S. in March after Trump invoked the 1798 Alien Enemy Act - a little-used wartime law - to deport people classified as members of the Tren de Aragua gang, without carrying out hearings or usual migration procedures.

Many lawyers and family members denied the men in question had any links to gangs and said they were often left in the dark about the location of the detainees.

The deportations drew strong criticism from human rights groups and spawned a legal battle with the Trump administration.</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Dec 2025 22:20:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q3TXQ7MC7FLMJIDK75YNF4ZIF4.jpg?auth=d2e96fc1946bc602efada3990e4ed15629f4ccffbde29119b44fd87cc1d5ad4f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainian capital Kyiv under massive Russian attack, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-capital-kyiv-under-massive-russian-attack-officials-say-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - The Ukrainian capital Kyiv came under a massive Russian attack early on Saturday, with explosions sounding in the city, air defences in operation and the Ukrainian military saying missiles were being deployed.

The Russian action took place two days before a meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy says he is due to hold in the United States with President Donald Trump to work out details of an accord for settling the nearly four-year-old war pitting Russia against Ukraine.

Reuters eyewitnesses said air defences were in action in the city and unofficial Telegram channels reported explosions.

Before the overnight attacks, Zelenskiy said his talks in Florida on Sunday would focus on the territory to be controlled by each side after a halt to the fighting that began in February 2022 with President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Russia's smaller neighbour, Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

Explosions sounded in Kyiv as Ukraine's air defence units went into action, and the military said on the Telegram messaging app that missiles were being deployed. The air force said Russian drones were targeting the capital and regions in the northeast and south.

An air raid alert remained in effect in the capital some four hours after being introduced. There were no immediate reports of damage or power cuts.

Russia made no immediate comment on the attacks.

On Thursday night, Russia struck Ukraine's energy infrastructure and stepped up attacks on the southern region of Odesa, the site of Ukraine's main seaports.

Amid the continued fierce fighting, territory remains the main diplomatic stumbling block. A 20-point draft in the U.S.-driven campaign to clinch a peace plan is 90% complete, Zelenskiy told journalists in Kyiv.

He said a security guarantee agreement between Ukraine and the U.S. was almost ready - a key element after guarantees in earlier post-Soviet years proved meaningless.

"A lot can be decided before the New Year," Zelenskiy told Politico.

Trump said the United States was the driving force behind the process.

"He doesn't have anything until I approve it," Trump told Politico. "So we'll see what he's got."

Zelenskiy told Axios the U.S. had offered a 15-year deal on security guarantees, subject to renewal, but Kyiv wanted a longer agreement with legally binding provisions to guard against further Russian aggression.

Trump said he believed Sunday's meeting would go well. He also said he expected to speak with Putin "soon, as much as I want."

In addition to territory, a critical point is control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station, Europe's largest, seized by Russia in the opening weeks of the war.

Moscow demands that Ukraine withdraw from the areas of the eastern region of Donetsk that Russian troops have failed to occupy in their drive to secure all of the Donbas, which also includes the Luhansk region.

Kyiv wants the fighting halted at the current lines.

Under a U.S. compromise, a free economic zone would be set up if Ukraine leaves parts of the Donetsk region, though details have yet to be worked out.

Axios quoted Zelenskiy as saying that if he is not able to push the U.S. to back Ukraine's "strong" position on the land issue, he was willing to put the 20-point plan to a referendum - as long as Russia agrees to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold the vote.

He said he wanted more pressure applied to Russia.

Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Kyiv's version of the 20-point plan differed from what Russia had been discussing with the U.S., according to Interfax-Russia news agency.

But he expressed optimism that matters had reached a "turning point" in the search for a settlement.

Putin's foreign policy aide, Yuri Ushakov, spoke with members of the Trump administration after Moscow received U.S. proposals about a possible peace deal, the Kremlin said on Friday. It did not disclose how Moscow had viewed the documents.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:07:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ERFF4HEXTNODTFIJFGN5DA4ZCM.jpg?auth=9722bc7db3b121ab7ecea3b5bcceda55c2c25ab22c5caa2b78ef76884fc20368&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar goes to the polls amid civil war and humanitarian crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-goes-polls-amid-civil-war-humanitarian-crisis-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Myanmar heads to the polls on Sunday as it battles a civil war that has ravaged parts of the country as well as one of Asia's worst humanitarian crises.

Already one of Southeast Asia's poorest countries, Myanmar has been hammered by a conflict triggered by a 2021 coup in which the military ousted an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.

Myanmar's humanitarian crisis is one of the most severe in Asia, driven by the intensifying civil war and repeated natural disasters, including a massive earthquake in March.

The ruling junta has previously suppressed information about a severe food crisis gripping the country by pressuring researchers not to collect data about hunger and aid workers not to publish it, Reuters has reported , besides cracking down on journalists since the coup.

Myanmar is one of the world's most under-funded aid operations, with only 12% of required funds received, the United Nations says.

U.S. cuts to humanitarian aid are having a crushing impact on people, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar has said.

The UN estimates that 20 million of Myanmar's 51 million people need aid as soaring inflation and a plunging currency push about half the population below the poverty line.

More than 3.6 million people have been displaced from their homes, with over 6,800 civilians killed in the conflict triggered by the coup, according to UN estimates.

With mounting violence forcing increasing numbers of people to flee, more than 12 million in Myanmar will face acute hunger next year, including 1 million who will need lifesaving support, according to the UN's World Food Programme.

More than 16 million people across Myanmar are acutely food insecure, meaning that their lack of food threatens lives and livelihoods, WFP estimates.

They are the fifth-largest group needing aid anywhere in the world, making Myanmar "a hunger hotspot of very high concern," the agency said.

More than 540,000 children across the country are expected to suffer this year from acute malnutrition - life-threatening wasting that can have severe and lifelong effects – a 26% increase from last year, WFP said.

One in three children under the age of five is already suffering from stunted growth, according to WFP.

Myanmar's economy - once deemed as one of the region's most promising - has struggled in recent years, reeling from the civil war, natural disasters and mismanagement.

But despite the challenges, Myanmar's economy is showing some signs of improvement and its GDP growth is estimated to rebound to 3% in the next fiscal year, the World Bank said this month.

The projected growth is driven by post-earthquake reconstruction and continued targeted assistance for the hardest-hit areas, although inflation is expected to remain above 20%.

With electricity supply deteriorating, exposing millions of people to chronic blackouts, households and businesses are increasingly embracing solar energy for reliable power.

Russia, which has been building ties with the junta, signed an investment agreement with Myanmar in June that it said could open up new opportunities for Russian energy companies in the south Asian country.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:07:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZJDZTPOPFVKG5KQX3IJQR6GURM.jpg?auth=4a0fa285dc22d15abe1793d11eeb79723df381f246ea6ce88a576b166368e753&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Conflict and fear sap campaign energy ahead of Myanmar election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/conflict-fear-sap-campaign-energy-ahead-myanmar-election-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Campaigning ahead of Myanmar's general election that begins on Sunday has been shorn of the energy of previous polls, residents said, as voting is scheduled amid a civil war and a humanitarian crisis as well as wide criticism that it is a sham to help the junta perpetuate power.

Myanmar has been in the throes of a nationwide conflict since the military deposed an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in a 2021 coup, alleging poll fraud in a general election held the preceding year.

Although the junta insists the election has popular backing, the vote has been widely criticised by the United Nations, Western governments and human rights groups as an attempt by the military to entrench its rule through political proxies.

Three residents of Myanmar's commercial capital Yangon, parts of which will vote on Sunday, said they remember past campaigns being rife with activity, including lively rallies, noisy road shows and large gatherings.

"This time, the candidates did not really come out on the streets. I only see sign boards on the streets about them," said a 31-year-old from Yangon, who asked not to be named because of security concerns.

"I am someone who goes out the whole day, but I don't see any candidates campaigning even for USDP and for smaller parties," he added, referring to the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party.

After the first phase on Sunday, the military-led administration will hold two more on January 11 and January 25 , covering areas across 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships.

Dates for counting votes and announcing the results have not been declared.

A decade ago, when Myanmar held its second election since the end of five decades of military rule in 2011, streets were awash with sign boards and flags in the signature red of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD), creating a carnival-like atmosphere.

Even the 2020 election, subdued by COVID-19 restrictions, had a more visible campaign , four people said.

In the city of Mandalay, about 600 km (370 miles) north of Yangon, the lack of campaigning is palpable, with no sustained canvassing for votes just days ahead of the polls, two residents said.

"The only real activity is the setting up of campaign billboards," 36-year-old Nwe told Reuters, adding that the few rallies being held were under guard.

"When parties campaign in neighborhoods, they don't go alone," she said, "They travel in groups with security."

The USDP, led by former generals from Myanmar's armed forces known as the Tatmadaw, has the most visible campaign presence on the streets, all five voters said.

The United Nations said on Tuesday that civilians were being threatened over their participation in the polls, both by Myanmar's military authorities and by armed groups opposing the Tatmadaw.

"These elections are clearly taking place in an environment of violence and repression," said UN Human Rights Chief Volker Turk.

All five residents interviewed by Reuters said they had received no direct instruction from junta officials asking them to vote, although there was fear of the consequences of not casting their ballot.

The shadow National Unity Government, which contains remnants of the NLD and other anti-junta entities, said it was not putting pressure on people to abstain from voting.

Mandalay resident Nwe said people worry that not voting could lead to travel restrictions and other repercussions.

"Rumors are rampant, so even though there is no official news, people are privately terrified," she said.

In Yangon, a 34-year-old resident said his family doesn't want him to vote, fearing that he might be included in a military conscription scheme that the Tatmadaw enacted in 2024.

"For me, I am scared of getting arrested if I don't vote," he told Reuters.

Ahead of the polls, Myanmar's junta has said the election is not being conducted with coercion, force or suppression.

In an opinion piece on Thursday, the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar argued that observers were wrong to judge the upcoming polls by Western standards.

"They fail to see that for ordinary citizens, this election – however imperfect – is an exit strategy from the state of emergency and a path back into a legal framework," it said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:09:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LRWZGXWGEBLUNGFQLKXKMXMS3A.jpg?auth=63d5de6a5c6dc1cccabed1f06578fe62e426706a0c710b310117ce35aa3032e7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 7 killed in Vietnam after bus overturns</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/least-7-killed-vietnam-after-bus-overturns-2025-12-27/</link><description>HANOI, Dec 27 (Reuters) - At least seven people died on Saturday when a bus carrying 19 passengers overturned on a mountainous road in Vietnam's northern province of Yen Bai, state-run media reported.

The 29-seat bus carrying a charity group was travelling downhill when it flipped and was crushed, according to Vietnam News Agency.

Rescue teams pulled 10 survivors from the wreckage, while others remained trapped as of 10:30 a.m. (0330 GMT) as heavy equipment was deployed to cut through the vehicle, Hoang Anh Tuan, chairman of Phinh Ho commune, told VNA.

Tuan said the crash was likely caused by brake failure.

Calls to authorities of Yen Bai province and Phinh Ho commune went unanswered.

Police, military units, local officials and residents were mobilised for rescue efforts, while authorities said an investigation into the cause of the accident was ongoing, according to VNA.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 04:52:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S.-backed airstrikes in Nigeria hit two ISIS-linked camps, government says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/us-backed-airstrikes-nigeria-hit-two-isis-linked-camps-government-says-2025-12-27/</link><description>LAGOS, Dec 27 (Reuters) - U.S.-backed air strikes in Nigeria hit two Islamic State-linked camps in the Bauni forest of Sokoto State, targeting foreign fighters infiltrating from the Sahel, the Nigerian government said.

The strikes carried out on Thursday were approved by President Bola Tinubu and launched from maritime platforms domiciled in the Gulf of Guinea, after extensive intelligence gathering, operational planning, and reconnaissance, the information ministry said in a statement on Friday.

U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Truth Social on Thursday that U.S. forces had launched a strike against Islamic State militants in northwest Nigeria at the request of Nigeria's government. He said the group had been targeting Christians in the region.

"A total of 16 GPS-guided precision munitions were deployed using MQ-9 Reaper unmanned aerial platforms, successfully neutralising the targeted ISIS elements attempting to penetrate Nigeria from the Sahel corridor," the Nigerian government statement said.

Intelligence indicated the camps were being used by foreign ISIS elements working with local affiliates to plan large-scale attacks inside Nigeria, it added. No civilian casualties were reported, although debris fell in two towns in Sokoto and Kwara states.

Trump described the operation as “numerous perfect strikes” and warned there would be “more to come.”

The operation marks a rare joint action between Abuja and Washington and underscores growing security cooperation as Islamist violence spreads south from the Sahel.

Sokoto State authorities confirmed the strikes and urged residents to remain calm. “The ongoing operations are geared towards securing the state and ensuring the protection of lives and property,” the state government said.

Nigeria has battled Islamist insurgents for more than a decade, but the presence of foreign fighters linked to ISIS signals an escalation in the threat. The Nigerian government said it remains “fully committed to the protection of lives and property” and vowed further action against transnational extremist networks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D2ZJDB7AMVPU5C3YSCUW4ALY3U.jpg?auth=71b3a410e821b269427c5f7412d0e365548ce4741c7aa961fd1997985fa70e06&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen's Saudi-led coalition says it will deal with military moves in Hadramout</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemens-saudi-led-coalition-says-it-will-deal-with-military-moves-hadramout-2025-12-27/</link><description>CAIRO, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Yemen's Saudi-led coalition said any military moves by the main southern separatist group STC in the eastern province of Hadramout contrary to de-escalation efforts will be dealt with to protect civilians, the Saudi state news agency reported on Saturday.

The statement from the coalition spokesperson, General Turki al-Malki, was in response to a request from the head of Yemen's Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, to the coalition to take immediate measures to protect civilians in Hadramout from "violations committed armed groups affiliated with the STC".

The STC, which is supported by the United Arab Emirates, has pushed the Saudi-backed, internationally recognised government from its headquarters in Aden while claiming broad control across the south this month.

On Friday the STC rejected a Saudi call for its forces to withdraw from areas it seized earlier in December, saying it would continue securing the eastern provinces of Hadramout and Mahra.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DHIGYFAPQVIIVGRXLLRZQ4H27I.jpg?auth=24ec9fdc25b80ddfe088ebce9aca7faab43d36ce92e8c08425a1471822207b39&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China passes revised foreign trade law to bolster trade war capabilities</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-passes-revised-foreign-trade-law-bolster-trade-war-capabilities-2025-12-27/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China on Saturday passed revisions to a key piece of legislation aimed at strengthening Beijing's ability to wage trade war, curb outbound shipments from strategic minerals to sex dolls, and further open its $19 trillion economy.

The latest revision to the Foreign Trade Law, approved by China's top legislative body, will take effect on March 1, 2026, state news agency Xinhua reported on Saturday.

The world's second-largest economy is overhauling its trade-related legal frameworks partly to convince members of a major trans-Pacific trade bloc created to counter China's growing influence that the manufacturing powerhouse deserves a seat at the table, as Beijing seeks to reduce its reliance on the U.S.

Adopted in 1994 and revised three times since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, most recently in 2022, the Foreign Trade Law empowers policymakers to hit back against trading partners that seek to curb its exports and to adopt mechanisms such as "negative lists" to open restricted sectors to foreign firms.

The revision also adds a provision that foreign trade should "serve national economic and social development" and help build China into a "strong trading nation", Xinhua said.

It further "expands and improves" the legal toolkit for countering external challenges, according to the report.

The revision focuses on areas such as digital and green trade, along with intellectual property provisions, key improvements China needs to make to meet the standards of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership, rather than the trade defence tools the 2020 revamp honed in on following four years of tariff war with the first Trump administration.

Beijing is also sharpening the wording of its powers in anticipation of potential lawsuits from private firms, which are becoming increasingly prominent in China, according to trade diplomats.

"Ministries have become more concerned about private sector criticism," said one Western trade diplomat with decades' of experience working with China. "China is a rule-of-law country, so the government can stop a company's shipment, but it needs a reason."

"It's not totally lawless here. Better to have everything written out in black and white," they added, requesting anonymity, as they were not authorised to speak with media.

China's private exporting firms attracted global attention in November after the French government moved to suspend the Chinese e-commerce platform Shein amid an uproar over childlike sex dolls sold on its marketplace into the French market.

The Chinese government increasingly could also find itself at odds with private enterprise when seeking to carry out sweeping bans, such as Beijing's prohibition of all Japanese seafood imports, as Asia's top two economies continue to feud over Taiwan, trade diplomats say.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 06:32:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4WJ67X4DTNP37H6ZVA2L4FWAK4.jpg?auth=6e6bf242c2950dbe833f407d84c50416c28c8ead098ad6a3e1b1c62f3b6db035&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Poland temporarily closes two airports after Russian strikes on Ukraine</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251227-live-poland-temporarily-closes-two-airports-after-russian-strikes-on-ukraine</link><description>Several powerful explosions rocked Kyiv on Saturday as authorities warned that the Ukrainian capital was under threat of missile attack.

Yet in 2025, one experience brought them together: protests. Generation Z – born between the late 1990s and early 2010s – shared frustration and anger at elites seen as out of touch, and a determination to be heard.

Across countries separated by thousands of kilometres, similar scenes unfolded, featuring young crowds, hand-painted placards, viral slogans born on platforms like TikTok or Discord and simple demands.

"This is a generation that is not acting only for itself, but so that everyone has access to education, healthcare and housing, and to put an end to corruption in power," said sociologist Michel Wieviorka, director of studies at the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (EHESS). “It is a protest driven by universal values.”

The movement began in Indonesia at the end of the summer. In Jakarta, the announcement of housing allowances for MPs – nearly ten times the minimum wage – acted as a trigger, prompting students to take to the streets.

One symbol quickly emerged from the marches: the pirate flag from the world’s best-selling manga, "One Piece", which became the emblem of the Gen Z revolt.

In September, the movement gained dramatic momentum in Nepal. Viral videos on Instagram and TikTok exposed the lavish lifestyles of “nepo-kids”, while the government blocked around twenty digital platforms.

Anger erupted in Kathmandu, where parliament was set on fire . For two days, the country was gripped by violent riots.

The shockwave then reached Africa . In Madagascar’s capital Antananarivo, youth-led protests no longer denounced only water and power cuts but also demanded the resignation of the president.

"We are not asking for luxury, just the means to live with dignity," demonstrators chanted, many of them students or young precarious workers.

In Morocco , mobilisation took a different form. The Gen Z 212 collective – a reference to the country’s telephone code – organised on Discord, coordinating calls to demonstrate and pushing its priorities, including school reform, access to healthcare and social justice.

On the American continent, Peruvian youth mobilised from Lima to Cusco against political instability, corruption and record levels of insecurity.

While demands differed, the broader context was similar.

"These are countries where democracy, if it exists, remains illiberal or weakly liberal," Wieviorka said. "They are also more or less authoritarian regimes, where power responds with repression, fuelling a spiral of violence."

The toll was heavy: a dozen people were killed in Indonesia, at least three in Morocco and five in Madagascar . In Nepal , at least 76 people died and more than 2,000 were injured, according to police.

Despite repression, Generation Z made gains. In Nepal, the protest movement led to the fall of the government.

In an unprecedented move, an interim prime minister – former Supreme Court chief justice Sushila Karki – was appointed following a vote organised on Discord.

A commission of inquiry was tasked with shedding light on the deaths of protesters.

For Nepal’s youth, this marked a victory: for the first time, a mobilisation born online and on the streets resulted in a tangible political transition.

In Madagascar, the outcome left a bitter taste. After several weeks of demonstrations, President Andry Rajoelina was overthrown in a military coup.

The government that followed, however, remained in the hands of a familiar actor in the country’s political life: the army.

"The military hijacked a protest that had failed to constitute itself as a political force," Wieviorka said.

In Morocco, the protest did not shake the monarchy but forced the authorities to respond.

The royal cabinet announced modernisation measures and investments in hospitals and schools, implicitly acknowledging the legitimacy of the demands.

Repression nevertheless tempered the momentum. According to official figures, 1,473 young people remain detained, including 330 minors.

In Nepal, mobilisation has not subsided. Early legislative elections are scheduled for March 2026.

"We are in the second phase of the movement," protester Yujan Rajbhandari told AFP.

The focus has shifted to voter registration and the fight against corruption.

"We won’t stop," he said.

Elsewhere, the future remains uncertain.

"This movement can endure and produce lasting effects, or on the contrary, fade away as a whole," Wieviorka said. "There are no rules."

Recent history urges caution. From the Arab Spring to Spain’s “indignados”, from Occupy Wall Street to France’s Nuit debout , movements have emerged, lost momentum and sometimes left lasting traces, sometimes not.

"Social movements are not eternal," Wieviorka said.

One feature nevertheless distinguishes Generation Z: its ability to organise, impose its themes and extract concessions without immediately seeking to take power.

"They do not have a fully formed political platform,” Wieviorka said. “But they do have a clear horizon: that of profound change."

The issue is one of 20 points laid out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in a framework peace proposal.

Here are some of the issues regarding the facility:

Russia took control of the plant in March 2022 and announced plans to connect it to its power grid. Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Zelenskiy stated at the end of December that the U.S. side had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.

Zelenskiy said the Ukrainian proposal envisages Ukrainian-American use of the plant, with the U.S. itself determining how to use 50% of the energy produced.

Russia has considered joint Russian-U.S. use of the plant, according to the Kommersant newspaper.

The plant is located in Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnipro River and the Kakhovka Reservoir, 550 km (342 miles) southeast of the capital Kyiv.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed reactors. They were all built in the 1980s, although the sixth only came online in the mid-1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. It has a total capacity of 5.7 gigawatts, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) database.

Four of the six reactors no longer use Russian nuclear fuel, having switched to fuel produced by then-U.S. nuclear equipment supplier Westinghouse.

After Russia took control of the station, it shut down five of its six reactors and the last reactor ceased to produce electricity in September 2022. Rosatom said in 2025 that it was ready to return the U.S. fuel to the United States.

According to the Russian management of the plant, all six reactors are in "cold shutdown."

Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of striking the nuclear plant and of severing power lines to the plant.

The plant's equipment is powered by electricity supplied from Ukraine. Over the past four years these supplies have been interrupted at least eleven times due to breaks in power lines, forcing the plant to switch to emergency diesel generators.

Emergency generators on site can supply electricity to keep the reactors cool if external power lines are cut.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi says that fighting a war around a nuclear plant has put nuclear safety and security in constant jeopardy.

Russia has been preparing to restart the station but says that doing so will depend on the situation in the area. Rosatom chief Alexei Likhachev has not ruled out the supply of electricity produced there to parts of Ukraine.

Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said Moscow intended to use the plant to cover a significant energy deficit in Russia's south.

"That's why they are fighting so hard for this station," he said.

In December 2025, Russia's Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision issued a license for the operation of reactor No. 1, a key step towards restarting the reactor.

Ukraine's energy ministry called the move illegal and irresponsible, risking a nuclear accident.

Russia has been pummelling Ukraine's energy infrastructure for months and some areas have had blackouts during winter.

In recent months, Russia has sharply increased both the scale and intensity of its attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, plunging entire regions into darkness.

Analysts say Ukraine's generation capacity deficit is about 4 gigawatts, or the equivalent of four Zaporizhzhia reactors.

Kharchenko says it would take Ukraine five to seven years to build the generating capacity to compensate for the loss of the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Kharchenko said that if Kyiv regained control of the plant, it would take at least two to three years to understand what condition it was in and another three years to restore the equipment and return it to full operations.

Both Ukrainian state nuclear operator Energoatom and Kharchenko said that Ukraine did not know the real condition of the nuclear power plant today.

In the long term, there is the unresolved problem of the lack of water resources to cool the reactors after the vast Kakhovka hydro-electric dam was blown up in 2023, destroying the reservoir that supplied water to the plant.

Besides the reactors, there are also spent fuel pools at each reactor site used to cool down used nuclear fuel. Without water supply to the pools, the water evaporates and the temperatures increase, risking fire.

An emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel pool caused an explosion in Japan's Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011.

Energoatom said the level of the Zaporizhzhia power plant cooling pond had dropped by more than 15%, or 3 metres, since the destruction of the dam, and continued to fall.

Ukrainian officials previously said the available water reserves may be sufficient to operate one or, at most, two nuclear reactors.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 10:22:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4G3ZSP2FQJLVJCVJUTH77ISEZU.jpg?auth=d67762e0ceecda8e582464dbdb667325e0464e9babe76e6a28911c25a7900967&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Army chief says Switzerland can't defend itself from full-scale attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/army-chief-says-switzerland-cant-defend-itself-full-scale-attack-2025-12-27/</link><description>ZURICH, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Switzerland cannot defend itself against a full-scale attack and must boost military spending given rising risks from Russia, the head of its armed forces said.

The country is prepared for attacks by "non-state actors" on critical infrastructure and for cyber attacks, but its military still faces major equipment gaps, Thomas Suessli told the NZZ newspaper.

"What we cannot do is defend against threats from a distance or even a full-scale attack on our country," said Suessli, who is stepping down at the end of the year.

"It's burdensome to know that in a real emergency, only a third of all soldiers would be fully equipped," he said in an interview published on Saturday.

Switzerland is increasing defence spending, modernising artillery and ground systems and replacing ageing fighter jets with Lockheed Martin F-35As.

But the plan faces cost overruns, while critics question spending on artillery and munitions amid tight federal finances.

Suessli said attitudes towards the military had not shifted despite the war in Ukraine and Russian efforts to destabilise Europe.

He blamed Switzerland's distance from the conflict, its lack of recent war experience and the false belief that neutrality offered protection.

"But that's historically inaccurate. There are several neutral countries that were unarmed and were drawn into war. Neutrality only has value if it can be defended with weapons," he said.

Switzerland has pledged to gradually raise defence spending to about 1% of GDP by around 2032, up from roughly 0.7% now – far below the 5% level agreed by NATO countries.

At that pace, the Swiss military would only be fully ready by around 2050.

"That is too long given the threat," Suessli said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 10:45:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VBXQOJDH6RPCVC5JX3ONHMLNFQ.jpg?auth=7b73f4696593685ced02fa0e49db175cc19985b628f8514b5d86894a22fac7af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish family missing after boat sinks off Indonesia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/spanish-family-missing-after-boat-sinks-off-indonesia-2025-12-27/</link><description>MADRID, Dec 27 (Reuters) - A Spanish family of four is missing after a boat carrying eleven people sank off the coast of Indonesia in extreme weather, Spanish authorities and an Indonesian news agency said on Saturday.

The Nigerian government said it remains “fully committed to the protection of lives and property” and vowed further action against transnational extremist networks.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 11:39:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8c3e567c-e314-11f0-b89a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-26T163203Z-839028605-RC2BOIAF5Q1O-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-NIGERIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least 15 dead, 19 injured in Guatemala bus accident</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/least-15-dead-19-injured-guatemala-bus-accident-2025-12-27/</link><description>GUATEMALA CITY, Dec 27 (Reuters) - At least 15 people were killed and 19 injured after a passenger bus plunged into a ravine on the Inter-American Highway in western Guatemala, authorities said on Saturday.

“Fifteen people have died in this traffic accident — 11 men, three women and a minor,” Leandro Amado, a spokesperson for local firefighters, told reporters, adding that around 19 injured people were taken to hospitals near the scene.

The crash occurred in the Solola Department between kilometres 172 and 174, an area known for dense fog that reduces visibility for drivers.

Ukraine was embroiled in a string of corruption scandals that led to the resignation of the chief of staff to President Volodymyr Zelensky . They also revealed a $100 million kickback scheme in the battered energy sector, masterminded by an alleged personal friend of the president.

"NABU and SAPO, following an undercover operation, exposed an organised criminal group that included current members of parliament," the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) said.

"Employees of the State Security Department are resisting NABU officers during investigative actions in committees of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine," it added, referring to Ukraine's parliament.

The anti-corruption agency did not reveal details related to the investigation .

Journalists from Ukrainska Pravda media outlet Mykhailo Tkach said in a social media post that detectives were allowed into the government quarters.

The investigation became public as Zelensky departed for talks in the US about efforts to formulate a plan to end the war in Ukraine, and after Russia sent scores of drones and missiles against the capital Kyiv, killing one and wounding dozens.

The reform, presented by Giorgia Meloni's coalition two years ago, limits the powers of Italy's powerful court of auditors, responsible for ensuring compliance with Italian and European Union rules on the use of public funds.

Meloni's right-wing government has clashed frequently with various branches of Italy's judiciary , accusing judges of leftist bias and hampering its initiatives on areas from public works to immigration.

Just two months ago the auditors' court refused to authorise a landmark government plan to build a bridge connecting Sicily to the mainland, a ruling denounced by Meloni as "intolerable interference."

The bill was passed in the upper house Senate on Saturday by 93 votes to 51.

Among the changes introduced, it stipulates that the maximum penalty for administrators who are negligent in the use of public money cannot exceed 30% of the loss caused by their actions, or the equivalent of two years of their salary.

The bill also contains a "silence means consent" clause by which if an administrator requests the court's opinion on a spending authorisation, it must reply within 30 days or else the authorisation is deemed valid and the administrator is shielded from any future sanctions.

The government says the changes will help the economy by speeding up procedures and overcoming a widespread hesitation among politicians to sign off on public works for fear of running foul of the auditors' court.

Members of the court and opposition lawmakers have warned it will lead to wasteful spending and possible malfeasance.

Alfredo Bazoli, a Democratic Party senator, said it showed the government aimed to "demolish controls on those with power."

The reform comes ahead of a more sweeping and contentious overhaul of Italy's justice system to separate the career paths of prosecutors and judges, a move the government says will curb conflict of interest between the two groups and political bias.

That reform faces a national referendum in the spring.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 16:24:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YOOJMYDPAVIFRALS75XXKR5TNA.jpg?auth=4250de28f6fee788ada883859db76185f83c1452ab224aa156af71cfec24296a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canada to provide $2.5 billion in economic aid for Ukraine, prime minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canada-provide-25-billion-economic-aid-ukraine-prime-minister-says-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 27 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney on Saturday announced an additional $2.5 billion of economic aid for Ukraine.

Putin said that if Ukraine did not want to resolve the conflict peacefully then Russia would accomplish all goals of its "special military operation" by force, Russian state news agency TASS reported.

Earlier on Saturday, responding to Russia's vast overnight drone and missile attack , Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said that Russia was demonstrating its wish to continue the war, while Kyiv wanted peace.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Putin's remarks.

The Kremlin said earlier that the Russian president, who inspected one of the command posts of the Russian armed forces, received reports from the chief of general staff, Valery Gerasimov, and commanders of the "Centre" and "East" groups of Russian forces.

Russian commanders told Putin that Moscow's forces had captured the towns of Myrnohrad, Rodynske and Artemivka in Ukraine's Donetsk region, as well as Huliaipole and Stepnohirsk in the Zaporizhzhia region, the Kremlin and Russian agencies said on Telegram.

Ukraine’s military said in its regular battlefield update on Saturday that its forces had beaten back Russian attempts to advance in the vicinity of Myrnohrad and Huliaipole.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 18:51:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3GAORQTQ5ONVOLAY6RL57L5SI.jpg?auth=f76b3678cac1169bd5e133cc3027d3f1598e5c544247204af3575e1c71b5dcff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy arrests nine over alleged Hamas funding through charities</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/italy-arrests-nine-over-alleged-hamas-funding-through-charities-2025-12-27/</link><description>ROME, Dec 27 (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors said on Saturday they had arrested nine people on suspicion of financing Hamas through charities based in Italy, in an operation coordinated by anti-mafia and anti-terrorism units.

The suspects are accused of "belonging to and having financed" the Palestinian group, which the European Union designates as a terrorist organisation, prosecutors in the northern Italian city of Genoa said in a statement.

Those arrested allegedly diverted to Hamas-linked entities around 7 million euros ($8.24 million) raised over the last two years for ostensibly humanitarian purposes, prosecutors said. Police seized assets worth more than 8 million euros.

The investigation began after suspicious financial transactions were flagged and expanded through cooperation with Dutch authorities and other EU countries, coordinated through the EU judicial agency Eurojust.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni thanked the authorities for "a particularly complex and important operation" which had uncovered financing for Hamas through "so-called charity organisations."

The Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Meloni's support for Israel during its war with Hamas in Gaza has triggered large and repeated street protests in Italy.

Israel's assault on Gaza has killed more than 71,000 people, according to the enclave's health ministry. It was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.

Bolsonaro, 70, was hospitalized last Wednesday for a separate hernia surgery on the following day which took place uneventfully. At the request of his defense lawyers he was authorized by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to leave prison, where he is serving a 27-year sentence for plotting a coup.

In a statement from the hospital, he endorsed his son Flavio's 2026 presidential bid.

The former president has faced health problems since a stabbing he suffered in September 2018, during a presidential campaign event that year in the town of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais state.

Since toppling democratically elected president Mohamed Bazoum in a July 2023 coup, the military junta in Niger has been forced to contend with attacks from Islamist militants on multiple fronts.

The country's new rulers adopted the mobilisation and requisition measures at a cabinet meeting on Friday.

"People, property, and services may be requisitioned during general mobilisation to contribute to the defence of the homeland, in compliance with the legislation and regulations in force," said a government statement after the meeting.

"Every citizen is required to respond immediately to any call-up or recall order, to comply without delay with the implementation of measures for the defense of the homeland, and to submit to requisition," it added.

The measures were required by the need to "preserve the integrity of the national territory" and "protect the population", said the statement.

The country has been fighting a deadly jihadist insurgency for a decade now, waged by fighters from Al-Qaeda and Islamic Jihad which has left nearly 2,000 people dead, according to ACLED, an NGO that monitors conflicts.

Niger's southeast has also been targeted by Boko Haram and rival militant group ISWAP.

Niger's mobilisation plan comes five years after the country doubled the size of its military to 50,000 troops, and raised the retirement age for ranking officers to 52 years from 47.

The government has also been urging citizens to make "voluntary" contributions to a fund started in 2023 that helps pay for military hardware and agricultural projects.

Soon after taking power, the junta asked French and US soldiers who had been fighting jihadists, notably in the west of the country, to leave Niger.

Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso – all three run by military juntas – have created a joint anti-jihadist force of 5,000 troops.</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 22:22:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4850fcb6-e36a-11f0-878e-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-36XV4M9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Myanmar polls open amid civil war, junta-backed party tipped to win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/myanmar-polls-open-amid-civil-war-junta-backed-party-tipped-win-2025-12-27/</link><description>Dec 28 (Reuters) - Overshadowed by civil war and doubts about the credibility of the polls, voters in Myanmar were casting their ballots in a general election starting on Sunday, the first since a military coup toppled the last civilian government in 2021.

The junta that has since ruled Myanmar says the vote is a chance for a fresh start politically and economically for the impoverished Southeast Asian nation.

But the election has been derided by critics - including the United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups - as an exercise that is not free, fair or credible, with anti-junta political parties not competing.

Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi, deposed by the military months after her National League for Democracy won the last general election by a landslide in 2020, remains in detention, and the political party she led to power has been dissolved.

Mass protests followed the ouster of Suu Kyi's party, only to be violently suppressed by the military. Many protesters then took up arms against the junta in what became a nationwide rebellion.

In this election, the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party, led by retired generals and fielding one-fifth of all candidates against severely diminished competition, is set to return to power, said Lalita Hanwong, a lecturer and Myanmar expert at Thailand's Kasetsart University.

"The junta's election is designed to prolong the military's power of slavery over people," she said. "And USDP and other allied parties with the military will join forces to form the next government."

Following the initial phase on Sunday, two rounds of voting will be held on January 11 and January 25, covering 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, although the junta does not have complete control of all those areas as it fights in the war that has consumed the country since the coup.

Dates for counting votes and announcing election results have not been declared.

With fighting still raging in parts of the country, the elections are being held in an environment of violence and repression, UN human rights chief Volker Turk said last week.

"There are no conditions for the exercise of the rights of freedom of expression, association or peaceful assembly that allow for the free and meaningful participation of the people," said Turk, the high commissioner for human rights.

The junta maintains that the elections provide a pathway out of the conflict, pointing to previous military-backed polls, including one in 2010 that brought in a quasi-civilian government that pushed through a series of political and economic reforms.

The polls "will turn a new page for Myanmar, shifting the narrative from a conflict-affected, crisis-laden country to a new chapter of hope for building peace and reconstructing the economy," an opinion piece in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said on Saturday.

On the streets of Myanmar's largest cities, there has been none of the energy and excitement of previous election campaigns, residents said, although they did not report any coercion by the military administration to push people to vote.

In the lacklustre canvassing, the USDP was the most visible. Founded in 2010, the year it won an election boycotted by the opposition, the party ran the country in concert with its military backers until 2015, when it was swept away by Suu Kyi's NLD.

The junta's attempt to establish a stable administration in the midst of an expansive conflict is fraught with risk, analysts say, and significant international recognition is unlikely for any military-controlled government - even if it has a civilian veneer.

Myanmar's weakened economy, relentless conflict and a seemingly preordained political route have left some voters dejected, including a 31-year-old man who lives in the commercial capital Yangon.

"No matter who I vote for, the USDP will win," he said, asking not to be named for fear of retribution from junta authorities. "So, I will just vote USDP."</description><pubDate>Sat, 27 Dec 2025 23:40:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KN3UVWDGI5OP5JHMDA6XSDKBU4.jpg?auth=5babfb54dca188386b8ac68e5ada7427bb722f6e11ccb64c0368779d9e9569f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Central African Republic votes, Russia ally Touadera seeks third term</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/central-african-republic-votes-russia-ally-touadera-seeks-third-term-2025-12-28/</link><description>BANGUI Dec 28 (Reuters) - Central African Republic President Faustin-Archange Touadera is seeking a third term on Sunday as the chronically unstable country holds national elections, touting security gains made with the help of Russian mercenaries and Rwandan soldiers.

The 68-year-old mathematician oversaw a constitutional referendum in 2023 that scrapped the presidential term limit, drawing an outcry from his critics who accused him of seeking to rule for life.

A Touadera victory - the expected outcome - would likely further the interests of Russia, which has traded security assistance for access to resources including gold and diamonds. Touadera is also offering access to the country's lithium and uranium reserves to anyone interested.

The opposition field of six candidates is led by two former prime ministers, Anicet-Georges Dologuele and Henri-Marie Dondra, both of whom survived attempts by Touadera's supporters to have them disqualified for allegedly holding foreign citizenship.

Though both men remain on the ballot, Touadera is still seen as the favourite given his control over state institutions and superior financial resources, analysts say.

The challenges to the candidacies of Dologuele and Dondra "aligned with an apparent pattern of administrative manoeuvring that has disproportionately impeded opposition politicians while favouring the ruling United Hearts Party," Human Rights Watch said last month.

"Their late admission to the race raises questions about whether voters have been given a genuine choice."

In 2018, CAR became the first country in West and Central Africa to bring in Russia's Wagner mercenaries, a step since also taken by Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.

Two years later Rwanda deployed troops to shore up Touadera's government as rebel groups threatened the capital and tried to disrupt the 2020 elections, ultimately preventing voting at 800 polling stations across the country, or 14% of the total.

The country is more secure now after Touadera signed several peace deals with rebel groups this year.

But those gains remain fragile: Rebels have not fully disarmed, reintegration is incomplete, and incursions by combatants from neighbouring Sudan fuel insecurity in the east.
Beyond the presidential contest, the elections on Sunday cover legislative, regional and municipal positions.

Provisional results are expected by January 5.

If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, a presidential runoff will take place on February 15, while legislative runoffs will take place on April 5.

Pangea-Risk, a consultancy, wrote in a note to clients that the risk of unrest after the election was high as opponents were likely to challenge Touadera's expected victory.

A smooth voting process could reinforce Touadera's claim that stability is returning, which was buttressed last year with the U.N. Security Council's lifting of an arms embargo and the lifting of a separate embargo on diamond exports.

In November, the U.N. Security Council extended the mandate of its peacekeeping mission. The U.S. opposed the decision, calling for a shorter extension and a handover of security to Bangui.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:54:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YR7LFF27BJNFHJZ3GMVLGE56SU.jpg?auth=63f50cc94543c24098e2b7fdff061d68e56de6eafc14bff6d81896ab39a44c2b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo votes in bid to end year-long political impasse</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovo-votes-bid-end-year-long-political-impasse-2025-12-28/</link><description>PRISTINA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Kosovo will hold a parliamentary election on Sunday as nationalist Prime Minister Albin Kurti's party seeks a majority to end a year-long political deadlock that has paralysed parliament and delayed international funding.

The vote is the second this year in Europe's youngest nation after Kurti's Vetevendosje party fell short of a majority in February. Months of failed coalition talks prompted President Vjosa Osmani to dissolve parliament in November and call an early election.

Failure to form a government and reopen parliament would prolong the crisis at a critical time: lawmakers must elect a new president in April and ratify 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) in loan agreements from the European Union and World Bank that expire in the coming months.

The Balkan country's opposition parties have refused to govern with Kurti, criticising his handling of ties with Western allies and his approach to Kosovo's ethnically divided north, where a Serb minority lives. Kurti blames the opposition for the impasse.

To woo voters, Kurti has pledged an additional month of salary per year for public sector workers, one billion euros per year in capital investment and a new prosecution unit to fight organised crime. Opposition parties have also focused on improving living standards.

Opinion polls are not published in Kosovo, leaving the outcome uncertain. Many voters say they are disillusioned.

"There wouldn’t be great joy if Kurti wins, nor would there be if the opposition wins. This country needs drastic changes, and I don’t see that change coming," said Edi Krasiqi, a doctor.

Polls open at 7 a.m. (0600 GMT) and close at 7 p.m. Exit polls are expected soon after voting ends.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. backing, including a 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbian forces trying to crush an uprising by the 90% ethnic Albanian majority.

Despite international support, the country of 1.6 million has struggled with poverty, instability and organised crime. Kurti's tenure, which began in 2021, was the first time a Pristina government completed a full term.

Tensions with Serbia flared in 2023, prompting the EU to impose sanctions on Kosovo. The bloc said this month it would lift them after ethnic Serb mayors were elected in northern municipalities, but the measures likely cost Kosovo hundreds of millions of euros .

The former special forces commander , believed to be in his early 40s, faces eight other candidates in a fragmented field with no strong challenger. Ousted president Alpha Conde and longtime opposition leader Cellou Dalein Diallo remain in exile.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou, officially launched last month after years of delay.

Doumbouya has claimed credit for pushing the project forward and ensuring Guinea benefits from its output.

His government this year also revoked EGA subsidiary Guinea Alumina Corporation's license after a refinery dispute, transferring its assets to a state-owned firm.

The turn toward resource nationalism - echoed in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger - has boosted his popularity, as has his youth in a country where the median age is about 19.

"For us young people, Doumbouya represents the opportunity to send the old political class into retirement," said Mohamed Kaba, a mechanic in Conakry. "There is a lot of corruption right now, but I hope these things will be sorted out."

If elected, Doumbouya "will likely utilise his position to further entrench his power and that of the military over Guinea," said Benedict Manzin, lead Middle East and Africa analyst at risk consultancy Sibylline.

"In particular he is likely to position his allies and associates to benefit from the expected economic boom associated with the launch of production" at Simandou, Manzin added.

A transition charter adopted after the coup barred junta members from contesting elections. But in September, Guineans overwhelmingly backed a new constitution removing that clause, extending presidential terms to seven years and creating a Senate.

Provisional results showed turnout at 86.42%, though opposition figures disputed that.

Political debate has been muted under Doumbouya. Civil society groups accuse his government of banning protests, curbing press freedom and restricting opposition activity.

The campaign period "has been severely restricted, marked by intimidation of opposition actors, apparently politically motivated enforced disappearances, and constraints on media freedom," U.N. rights chief Volker Turk said Friday. These conditions "risk undermining the credibility of the electoral process," he added.

The government did not respond to a request for comment.

Doumbouya kept a low profile during the campaign, leaving surrogates to make his case.

At a closing rally on Thursday in Conakry, he skipped a speech although he danced with his wife while Congolese star Koffi Olomide performed.

He wore a white baseball cap and track jacket emblazoned with the name of his movement: "Generation for Modernity and Development."

About 6.7 million people are registered to vote, with provisional results expected within 48 to 72 hours of polls closing.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5U7BMFNWMZNBZA43VRCDNIQENA.jpg?auth=ffa2cc9c592e41afaa0cf6c66302c19c2973f8383c92d1ef4fa5ab64dcaa867c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria Super Eagles fly off with 3 points against Tunisia</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-nigeria-super-eagles-fly-off-with-3-points-against-tunisia</link><description>Produced by Emily Boyle and Julia Terradot</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0429da76-e379-11f0-8e59-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/WB999021-O-01-20251227-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON big cat fight ends in draw: Senegal 1-1 DR Congo</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-afcon-big-cat-fight-ends-in-draw-senegal-1-1-dr-congo</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2d47441c-e378-11f0-9f3a-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/WB999022-O-01-20251227-01.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>AFCON Daily Round Up: Super Eagles beat Tunisia 3-2, Big cats Senegal and DRC stay level</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/africa-cup-of-nations/20251227-afcon-daily-round-up-super-eagles-beat-tunisia-3-2-big-cats-senegal-and-drc-stay-level</link><description>Produced by Emily Boyle and Julia Terradot</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 01:55:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20600e62-e375-11f0-be8b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-12856428126950607fcdcfd4-33199485.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia opposes Taiwan independence in any form, FM Lavrov says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/russia-opposes-taiwan-independence-any-form-fm-lavrov-says-2025-12-28/</link><description>Dec 28 (Reuters) - Russia opposes Taiwan’s independence in any form and considers the island an inseparable part of China, Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in remarks published on Sunday.

Russia struck Kyiv and other parts of war-torn Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the capital. Zelenskiy called it Russia's response to the ongoing U.S.-brokered peace efforts.

Zelenskiy has told journalists that he plans to discuss the fate of eastern Ukraine's contested Donbas region during the meeting at Trump's Florida residence, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other topics.

Moscow has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine yield all of the Donbas, even areas still under Kyiv's control, and Russian officials have objected to other parts of the latest proposal, sparking doubts about whether Russian President Vladimir Putin would accept whatever Sunday's talks might produce.

The Ukrainian president told Axios on Friday he still hopes to soften a U.S. proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas. Failing that, Zelenskiy said the entire 20-point plan, the result of weeks of negotiations, should be put to a referendum vote.

Axios said U.S. officials viewed Zelenskiy's willingness to hold a referendum as a major step forward and a sign that he was no longer ruling out territorial concessions, although he said Russia would need to agree to a 60-day ceasefire to allow Ukraine to prepare for and hold such a vote. A recent poll suggests that Ukrainian voters may also reject the plan.

Zelenskiy's in-person meeting with Trump, scheduled for 1 p.m. (1800 GMT), follows weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to sketch out the contours of a post-war security guarantee for Kyiv that would be supported by the United States.

Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, and Zelenskiy said on Friday that the 20-point plan was 90% finished. But the issue of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved.

While Moscow insists on getting all of the Donbas, Kyiv wants the map frozen at current battle lines.

The United States, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, although it remains unclear how that zone would function in practical terms.

Zelenskiy, whose past meetings with Trump have not always gone smoothly, worries along with his European allies that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated nation, after Russian forces took 12 to 17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of its territory per day in 2025.

Russia controls all of Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12% of its territory, including about 90% of Donbas, 75% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that he thought a peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024: Ukraine withdrawing from all of the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim to join NATO.

Ukrainian officials and European leaders view the war as an imperial-style land grab by Moscow and have warned that if Russia gets its way with Ukraine, it will one day attack NATO members.

The 20-point plan was spun off from a Russian-led 28-point plan , which emerged from talks between U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian special envoy Kirill Dmitriev, and which became public in November.

Subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and U.S. negotiators have produced the more Kyiv-friendly 20-point plan.

Saturday's air attacks show that Putin does not want peace, Zelenskiy said to reporters after arriving in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.

In a brief statement with Zelenskiy by his side, Carney said peace "requires a willing Russia."

"The barbarism that we saw overnight — the attack on Kyiv — shows just how important it is that we stand with Ukraine in this difficult time," Carney said, pledging C$2.5 billion (US$1.83 billion) in additional economic aid to Ukraine.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who spoke with Zelenskiy along with other European leaders on Saturday, said on X that their shared objective remained "a just and lasting peace" that preserved Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, while strengthening the country’s security and defense capabilities.

Zelenskiy said he would speak with European leaders again after his meeting with Trump.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 05:25:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/24KOYIIMQVIRJIVG623QEAKVIA.jpg?auth=74a22907fdcd0ee35979b1676e1ba8deac77372a8fd90fbbad1bdbd593f7a9a5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Zelensky to meet Trump for talks on Ukraine peace plan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251228-live-zelensky-to-meet-trump-for-talks-on-ukraine-peace-plan</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will sit down with US President Donald Trump on Sunday and seek to secure his approval for a new proposal to end the nearly four-year war with Russia.

Then it zeroed in on him.

Ossetchkine immediately threw himself to the ground, as did his family – all of whom managed to survive the September 12 assassination attempt .

One month later, four French residents were charged with trying to kill Ossetchkine , who is the director of an NGO that advocates for human rights in Russian prisons and who has lived in France since fleeing Russia 10 years ago.

Were the Biarritz snipers working on the Kremlin’s orders? Some of those arrested were originally from Dagestan , a Russian republic in the North Caucasus, according to an AFP source. `

Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, President Vladimir Putin has been accused of orchestrating a vast hybrid-warfare campaign in Europe, including several assassination attempts.

Assassins operating under the Kremlin’s orders are suspected of trying to kill the CEO of Rheinmetall, a German arms manufacturer sending weapons to Ukraine.

FSB Russian intelligence is suspected of coordinating an attempt by six Bulgarians based in the UK to kidnap investigative journalist Christo Grozev and deliver him to Russian operatives.

Three of the group were found guilty by British courts on espionage charges .

But Russia’s hybrid-warfare strategy makes it difficult to trace operations directly back to Moscow.

“An essential characteristic of a hybrid operation is that it is deniable, that you're not sure who is behind it,” says Bart Schuurman, a specialist in political violence at Leiden University in the Netherlands, who is part of a research group compiling a list of hybrid warfare operations targeting Europe.

Across the European continent, a diverse range of hybrid-warfare attacks garnered headlines in 2025, including drone incursions around airports, the sabotage of Polish railways , pigs’ heads left outside mosques in Paris, anti-Semitic acts and assassination attempts.

Russia’s hybrid-warfare campaign appears focused on punishing Europe for its support of Ukraine by destabilising European society, driving wedges between communities and attempting to fracture support for its battlefield adversary.

Schuurman says Moscow’s hybrid campaign is “an attempt to further divide Europe”.

Sabotage, cyber-attacks, vandalism and influence operations “are all an attempt to undermine public and political support for Ukraine in Europe, ultimately helping Russian soldiers win the war”, he adds.

“Hybrid warfare attempts to support what Russia is doing on the battlefield in Ukraine using irregular or covert operations,” he says.

Threatening the CEO of Germany’s Rheinmetall directly sends the message that there is a price to pay for supporting Ukraine.

The hybrid-warfare attacks began in earnest in 2022, coinciding with the full-scale invasion of Ukraine – which Putin reportedly believed would be complete within 10 days.

As the war dragged on, Schuurman notes, hybrid attacks attributed to Russia became more frequent in 2023 and even more so in 2024. “Initially, Russia had hopes that it could win quite simply on the battlefield alone. And as it got more difficult for them to do so, they were looking for other ways to increase their chances of success.”

Overall, 2025 saw a drop in hybrid-warfare operations, despite headline-grabbing incidents like drones closing down airports around Copenhagen and Oslo.

“If we look at the more classic techniques like influence, sabotage, arson, vandalism and terrorism, we're looking at about half of what we saw last year,” says Schuurman.

But why would Russia scale back such efforts when the war in Ukraine is ongoing?

“Maybe there's less of a need for hybrid warfare,” Schuurman says, noting that Russia may be hoping to achieve what it wants through peace negotiations led by the administration of US President Donald Trump.

Moreover, Europe might be getting better at counter-operations.

“European intelligence services have been facing this Russian hybrid threat for a few years, and they have learned how to adapt to it. They've gotten a lot better at detecting plots before they happen,” Schuurman says.

Three Ukrainians were arrested in Germany in May, accused of trying to send packages of explosives on Moscow’s orders. One year earlier, a similar operation resulted in several packages exploding while they were being transported by postal service DHL.

The success of negotiations between Moscow and Washington are likely to dictate whether the Kremlin expands its hybrid-warfare operations in the months ahead, says Schuurman. “If the whole thing falls apart, I think we will see a return to more hybrid operations.”

An increase in operations is also possible if the US decides to withdraw support for Ukraine, he says, “which seems to be more and more likely” under the new administration.

“Then Europe will be more alone, and I think we can expect more tests by Russia to see if it is an opponent to take seriously or not.”

This could also mean that attacks might become more ambitious in scale – and could continue to test the resolve of Europeans, even if Putin gets what he wants in Ukraine.

A target of particular concern is elections, which Moscow have repeatedly tried to influence in favour of extremist parties.

France faces a key municipal vote in 2026 and a presidential election in 2027, with several European nations also set for elections in the coming year.

A Ministry of Defence statement said the deal would provide the British Army with an early capability demonstrator of the RCH 155 system and two units for Germany to test.

The system is manufactured by Franco-German defence group KNDS and Germany's Rheinmetall.

The system can fire eight rounds per minute on the move, operate with two crew members and travel 700 km without refuelling, the statement said.

Sunday’s election is the culmination of a transition process that began four years ago after President Mamady Doumbouya ousted then president Alpha Condé . There are eight other candidates in the race.

Despite Guinea’s rich mineral resources – including as the world’s biggest exporter of bauxite, used to make aluminium – more than half of its 15 million people are experiencing record levels of poverty and food insecurity, according to the World Food Program.

“This vote is the hope of young people, especially for us unemployed," said Idrissa Camara, an 18-year-old resident of Conakry, who said he has been unemployed since graduating from university five years ago. "I’m forced to do odd jobs to survive. I hope this vote will improve the standard of living and the quality of life in Guinea," he added.

The election is the latest such vote among African countries that have seen a surge in coups in recent years. At least 10 countries in the young continent have experienced soldiers forcefully taking power after accusing elected leaders of failing to provide good governance and security for citizens.

A total of nine candidates are contesting the election, and Doumbouya’s closest challenger is the little-known Yero Baldé of the Democratic Front of Guinea party, who was education minister under Condé.

Two opposition candidates, former Prime Minister Lansana Kouyaté and former government minister Ousmane Kaba, were excluded on technical grounds while longtime opposition leaders Cellou Dalein Diallo and Sidya Toure have been forced into exile.

About 6.7 million registered voters are expected to cast ballots at roughly 24,000 polling stations nationwide, with results expected within 48 hours. There will be a runoff if no candidate wins a majority of the votes.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:21:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6055dc2a-e3cc-11f0-8187-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-25T212635Z-123616946-RC2ONIAQDO8X-RTRMADP-3-GUINEA-ELECTION.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brigitte Bardot, icon of French cinema, dies at 91</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/brigitte-bardot-has-died-her-foundation-has-said-2025-12-28/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Actress Brigitte Bardot shot to international fame dancing the mambo barefoot in "And God Created Woman", her tousled hair and fierce energy radiating a sexual magnetism rarely before seen in mainstream cinema.

A global icon was born.

At just 21, she scandalised censors and captivated audiences. Her free-spirited performance in the 1956 film, shot by her husband Roger Vadim, marked a decisive break from the demure heroines of the previous era.

Brigitte Bardot, often referred to in France simply as "B.B." and whose later years were marked by animal rights campaigns and far-right political sympathies, has died at the age of 91, her foundation said on Sunday. The cause was not immediately known.

Born in Paris on September 28, 1934, Bardot grew up in an upper-middle-class household. She described herself as a shy, self-conscious child who "wore spectacles and had lank hair".

By 15, however, she graced the cover of Elle magazine, launching a modelling career that soon led to film.

Bardot’s character in "And God Created Woman" was the embodiment of liberated femininity. The controversy only fuelled her appeal. Bardot became a symbol of 1950s and 60s France.

Her allure extended far beyond French cinema. At 15, Bob Dylan is said to have written his first song about her, the never-released "Song for Brigitte", while Andy Warhol painted her portrait.

Bardot's ability to subvert traditional gender roles made her not just a sex symbol, but a pop culture icon and a touchstone for shifting social attitudes.

In 1959, Simone de Beauvoir penned an article for Esquire magazine in which she lionised Bardot's conspicuous sense of freedom. "B.B. does not try to scandalise," the feminist philosopher wrote. "She follows her inclinations. She eats when she is hungry and makes love with the same unceremonious simplicity.

"Moral lapses can be corrected, but how could B.B. be cured of that dazzling virtue — genuineness? It is her very substance."

De Beauvoir concluded: "I hope she will mature, but not change."

Despite her influence, Bardot found celebrity life isolating. She often spoke of being a prisoner of her own fame, unable to enjoy life’s simple pleasures.

"Nobody can imagine how horrific it was, such an ordeal," she reflected decades later. "I couldn't go on living like that."

Her personal life was shaped by four marriages, widely reported affairs, and well-documented struggles with depression.

On her 26th birthday she was found unconscious at a house on the French Riviera after trying to take her own life. Rumours of another attempted suicide surfaced years later when she mysteriously cancelled a 49th birthday party then appeared in hospital.

Alongside her acting, Bardot enjoyed a successful music career. Her collaborations with singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg, including the erotic "Je t’aime ... moi non plus" ("I Love You ... Neither Do I"), drew both acclaim and controversy.

In the late 1960s she modelled for a bust of Marianne, the personification of the French Republic.

But she found little satisfaction in the praise she garnered.

"I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy," she told the magazine Paris Match around the time of her 50th birthday. "I've been let down too often. I've had really terrible disappointments in my life. That is why I've chosen to withdraw, to live alone."

Bardot made the last of her 42 films in 1973. Disenchanted with the industry, she declared the world of cinema "rotten" and left public life.

"I will have given 20 years of my life to cinema, that's enough," she said in a TV interview at the time.

She settled in the fashionable French resort of Saint-Tropez, where she found solace among animals and the Mediterranean landscape.

There, she began a passionate defence of animal welfare. "This is my only battle, the only direction I want to give my life," Bardot said in 2013.

Her devotion to animals became legendary. In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals, auctioning off personal souvenirs the following year to raise funds for her cause.

Bardot supported high-profile activists, such as anti-whaling campaigner Paul Watson, and campaigned vigorously against animal cruelty, at times threatening to leave France over animal welfare disputes.

When actor Gérard Depardieu accepted Russian citizenship after a public spat with French authorities, in 2013, Bardot threatened to follow suit if France euthanised two sick circus elephants.

For much of the latter part of her life, Bardot lived alone behind high walls in Saint-Tropez, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses.

This passion, she often suggested, was an antidote to her disappointing relationships. "I gave my beauty and my youth to men," she once said. "I am going to give my wisdom and experience to animals."

As her advocacy intensified, so too did the backlash to her political statements.

Bardot’s public remarks on immigration, Islam and homosexuality led to a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred.

Between 1997 and 2008, she was fined six times by French courts for her comments, particularly those targeting France’s Muslim community.

In one case, a Paris court fined her €15,000 ($17,000) for describing Muslims as "this population that is destroying us, destroying our country by imposing its acts".

In 1992, she married Bernard d’Ormale, a former adviser to the far-right National Front, and later publicly endorsed the party's successive leaders, Jean-Marie Le Pen and his daughter Marine Le Pen. Bardot called the latter "the Joan of Arc of the 21st century".

Yet, for all her polarising views, Bardot’s influence endured, whether in fashion - with media noting regular comebacks of her trademark hairstyle - or through regular documentaries and coffee‑table books celebrating her rare impact on French cinema.

Asked by French channel BFM TV in May 2025 if she considered herself a symbol of the sexual revolution, she said: "No, because before me, plenty of wild things had already happened — they didn’t wait for me. Feminism isn't my thing; I like men."

In the same interview, she was asked how often she reflected on her film career. "I don’t think about it," she said, "but I don’t reject it, because it’s thanks to it that I’m known everywhere in the world as someone who defends animals."</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:44:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SQHBFHT33JNS5PSZ42YZAIV6OY.jpg?auth=283044af9db33579d5cee1d1decd9c8c5e5f5bde102903461bb1f8c3895cebbb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's DTEK says power restored to 1 million Kyiv-area households</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/ukraines-dtek-says-power-restored-1-million-kyiv-area-households-2025-12-28/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine's leading private energy provider said on Sunday that it had restored power to more than a million households in and around Kyiv a day after a Russian air attack had forced emergency outages.

A combined missile and drone attack early on Saturday had killed two people and knocked out power across broad swathes of the capital and its surrounding region.

In a statement, DTEK said it had restored electricity to 748,000 households in Kyiv and 347,000 outside the city.

It added that consumers on Kyiv's right bank were back to planned power cuts but that the situation remained "more difficult" on the left bank, where emergency outages were still in force.

Two districts of the Kyiv region were also still experiencing emergency outages, DTEK said.

Russia has stepped up its massive strikes on Ukraine's energy system in recent weeks as it presses ahead with a battlefield offensive amid a U.S.-led peace effort to end the nearly four-year-old war.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 10:45:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EYW5E5URMNI7RANG6ZTFKOWFYQ.jpg?auth=5272d91b5e597ea30c116985ebf67dfcf38defb499c1ff7329679a93bb8e157a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Reactions to the death of French film icon Brigitte Bardot</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/reactions-death-french-film-icon-brigitte-bardot-2025-12-28/</link><description>Dec 28 (Reuters) - Tributes to Brigitte Bardot , an icon of French cinema, poured in on Sunday following the announcement of her death at the age of 91. Below are a selection.

"Her films, her voice, her dazzling fame, her initials, her sorrows, her generous passion for animals, her face that became Marianne - Brigitte Bardot embodied a life of freedom. A French existence, a universal radiance. She moved us. We mourn a legend of the century."

(Bardot's face was used as the model for an official bust of Marianne, an allegorical female figure who symbolizes the values of the French Republic, which was installed in town halls across the country from the late 1960s onward.)

THE BRIGITTE BARDOT FOUNDATION

"Mrs Brigitte Bardot (was) a world-renowned actress and singer, who chose to give up her prestigious career in order to devote her life and energy to the defence of animals and to her Foundation," it said.

"The Brigitte Bardot Foundation wishes to honour the memory of an exceptional woman who gave everything and gave up everything for a world more respectful of animals."

"The French people today lose the Marianne they so deeply loved and whose beauty astonished the world. Brigitte Bardot was a woman of heart, conviction, and character. A passionate patriot and a lover of animals that she protected throughout her life, she alone embodied an entire era of French history, and above all a certain idea of courage and freedom."

"The SPA pays tribute to Brigitte Bardot, an iconic figure and a passionate advocate for the animal cause. Since the 1970s, and later through her foundation created in the 1980s, she devoted her life to defending those who have no voice. Her unwavering commitment helped change attitudes and achieve major advances in animal protection ... Thank you, B.B., for all that you have accomplished."

"An icon of French cinema and an international figure, Brigitte Bardot will forever be associated with Saint-Tropez, of which she was the most radiant ambassador. Through her presence, her personality, and her aura, she left her mark on the history of our town and helped to make Saint-Tropez shine across the world," the city said. "Brigitte Bardot now belongs to the collective memory of Saint-Tropez, which we must preserve. She will continue to inhabit the soul of our town."

"She wasn't just one of the most beautiful women in the world - she was the most beautiful woman in the world, and she still is, in fact," he said.

"She had a courage that men still don't reference, and if she cared so deeply about animals ... it's probably because she had been disappointed by men - all men - and I understand that. We are relatively disappointing; I can speak for my own gender."</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 11:40:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S3WKWUL5ONI6HFWW5WISKOOF6M.jpg?auth=6e61a667dde1d3eaf4280de7556aaf992be92ba2a86fbd474e45901dacb42573&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bardot leaves controversial legacy of activism for France’s far right</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251228-bardot-leaves-controversial-legacy-of-activism-for-france-far-right</link><description>French cinema legend Brigitte Bardot, whose death at the age of 91 was announced on Sunday. During her life, she was a 1960s sex symbol who later became a militant animal rights activist and outspoken supporter of France's far right .

After her film career catapulted her to global stardom and sex-symbol status, she suddenly retreated into a hermit-like existence in the French Riviera resort of Saint-Tropez at the age of just 39.

In 1986 she set up the Brigitte Bardot Foundation dedicated to animal protection. She crusaded for baby seals and elephants , called for the abolition of ritual animal sacrifice and the closure of horse abattoirs.

As her advocacy intensified, so too did the backlash to her political statements. Bardot’s public remarks on immigration , Islam and homosexuality led to a string of convictions for inciting racial hatred.

Between 1997 and 2008, she was fined six times by French courts for her comments, particularly those targeting France’s Muslim community.

Jordan Bardella , the head of Le Pen's far-right National Rally party, was among the first to pay hommage.

"Today the French people have lost the Marianne they so loved, whose beauty astonished the world," he wrote on X.

In her final book, "Mon BBcedaire" ("My BB Alphabet"), published weeks before her death, she fired barbs at what she described as a "dull, sad, submissive" France and at her home town of Saint-Tropez, now packed with the wealthy tourists she helped attract. The book also contained derogatory remarks about gay and transgender people.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:42:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ddb28f24-e3e0-11f0-a811-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23108353048742.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Memorable moments from French actress Brigitte Bardot's on-screen career</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251228-memorable-moments-from-french-actress-brigitte-bardot-screen-career</link><description>French 1960s sex symbol Brigitte Bardot , considered one of the major screen sirens of the 20th century, died at the age of 91 , her foundation announced on Sunday.

"And God created Brigitte Bardot" ran the headline in the Financial Times in 2009 when the actress turned 75, capturing the enduring connection between Bardot and the film that catapulted her to stardom as a sexually charged 18-year-old orphan in Saint-Tropez.

The image of a bikini-clad, bronzed Bardot emerging from the sea was the "original epitome of the youthful sexuality that tanned itself on the Cote d'Azur once the austerity of war had worn off", US film historian David Thomson said in his bestselling book "The New Biographical Dictionary of Film" (1975).

Made by her husband at the time, Roger Vadim, the film was a hit both in France and the US, where it took in $4 million at the box office .

It inspired Simone de Beauvoir in 1960 to say, "BB now deserves to be considered an export product as important as Renault automobiles."

Jean-Luc Godard 's arthouse classic set on the island of Capri opened with what would become one of Bardot's most famous scenes but also her most subversive: intercut shots of her body as she lies on a bed in a dark room, asking her husband, "Which part of me do you like best?"

Bardot's full naked figure is never shown as Godard resisted the demands of his producers, and in doing so encouraged a more critical gaze on Bardot's sexualised on-screen body.

Playing a jilted wife whose disdain for her husband swells as the film progresses, "Contempt" was one of Bardot's rare critically acclaimed films, with The New York Times praising it as her best acting performance.

Bardot had a brief and tumultuous affair with legendary French songwriter Serge Gainsbourg .

Their dalliance gave rise to a track based on a poem written by the notorious US outlaw Bonnie Parker, before she and her partner in crime Clyde Barrow were shot dead.

For the video clip of the duet shot in a hay barn, Gainsbourg and Bardot dressed as the legendary pair, with Bardot donning a black beret, dragging on a cigarette and clutching a machine gun around her neck.

The single was from an album of the same name that reached number 12 on the Billboard Top 200.

Gainsbourg also first recorded his famously steamy "Je t'aime... moi non plus" duet with Bardot but she later opposed its release.

He re-recorded the hit with Jane Birkin.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 12:42:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4d5656e-e3da-11f0-9e06-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23108352888792.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China welcomes Thailand-Cambodia truce ahead of trilateral talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-welcomes-thailand-cambodia-truce-ahead-trilateral-talks-2025-12-28/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 28 (Reuters) - China on Sunday congratulated Cambodia on reaching a ceasefire with Thailand after weeks of deadly border fighting , as officials from the three countries prepared to open a two-day meeting in southwestern China.

Thailand and Cambodia on Saturday ended weeks of fierce border clashes that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million by agreeing their second ceasefire in recent months.

Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, in a meeting with his Cambodian counterpart, called the ceasefire "an important step towards restoring peace" and said it was "in line with the shared expectations of countries in the region."

Cambodia's top diplomat, Prak Sokhonn, and his Thai counterpart, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, are both expected to meet Wang in the Chinese province of Yunnan on Sunday and Monday to discuss the border situation.

Cambodia and Thailand should "promote a complete and lasting ceasefire, resume normal exchanges and rebuild mutual trust" Wang said, according to the official Xinhua news agency.

The two countries' diplomats and military officials should use the meeting in Yunnan as an opportunity to "communicate in a flexible manner and enhance understanding," Wang added.

China is willing to provide humanitarian aid to Cambodia for the settlement of those displaced in the border regions, he said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:20:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3T3P6YVJRRKFVBFQQGVYOVYVAE.jpg?auth=0e9d9a7ac152612730c560560e3a8794fb20b12cc874787eb64087ecaa8fe97e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>The week in pictures: US strikes on Nigerian jihadists, AFCON 2025 and the death of Brigitte Bardot</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20251228-the-week-in-pictures-us-strikes-nigerian-jihadists-afcon-2025-death-brigitte-bardot</link><description /><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:22:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/435010f4-e32d-11f0-97fb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360683962222.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Clashes erupt in Syria as Alawite minority protests deadly Homs mosque bombing</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251228-clashes-erupt-syria-alawite-minority-protests-deadly-homs-mosque-bombing</link><description>Clashes broke out on Syria’s coast between protesters from the Alawite religious minority and counter-demonstrators on Sunday, two days after a bombing at an Alawite mosque in the city of Homs killed eight people and wounded 18 others during prayers.

Thousands of protesters gathered in the coastal cities of Latakia and Tartous, and elsewhere. Officials have said that preliminary investigations indicate that explosive devices were planted inside the mosque in Homs, but authorities haven’t publicly identified a suspect yet in Friday’s bombing. Funerals for the dead were held on Saturday.

A little-known group calling itself Saraya Ansar al-Sunna claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on its Telegram channel, in which it indicated that the attack intended to target members of the Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shiite Islam whom hard-line Islamists consider to be apostates.

Sunday’s demonstrations were called for by Ghazal Ghazal, an Alawite sheikh living outside of Syria who heads a group called the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council in Syria and the Diaspora.

An Associated Press photographer in Latakia saw pro-government counterprotesters throw rocks at the Alawite demonstrators, while a group of protesters beat a counterdemonstrator who crossed to their side.

According to The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, at least two people were killed as security forces tried to disperse the protests – and a medical source said two bodies had been taken to a local hospital.

Syrian authorities did not confirm they had opened fire but said they had “contained the situation”. They accused what they called “remnants” of former ruler Bashar al-Assad’ s government of attacking security forces.

Syria’s state-run television also reported that two members of the security forces had been wounded in the area of Tartous after someone threw a hand grenade at a police station. Cars belonging to security forces were also set on fire in Latakia.

The country has experienced several waves of sectarian clashes since the fall of former president Assad in a lightning rebel offensive in December 2024 that brought to an end nearly 14 years of civil war. Assad, an Alawite, fled the country to Russia.

In March, an ambush carried out by Assad’s supporters against security forces triggered days of violence that left hundreds of people dead, most of them Alawites. Since then, although the situation has calmed, Alawites have been targeted sporadically in sectarian attacks. They have also complained of discrimination against them in public employment since Assad’s fall and of young Alawite men detained without charges.

During the rein of the Assad dynasty, Alawites were over-represented in government jobs and in the army and security forces.

Government officials condemned Friday’s attack and promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but have not yet announced any arrests.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 14:44:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/bae6ec84-e3f3-11f0-885d-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362464071814.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Three dead in Alawite protests on Syrian coast, local officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/three-dead-alawite-protests-syrian-coast-local-officials-say-2025-12-28/</link><description>LATAKIA, Syria Dec 28 - Three people were killed on Sunday when protests in Syria's Alawite heartland of Latakia spiralled into gunfire and other violence, according to the province's media office.

Syria has been rocked by several episodes of sectarian bloodshed since longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who hails from the Muslim Alawite minority, was ousted by a rebel offensive last year and replaced by a Sunni-led government.

Thousands of Alawite protesters gathered on Sunday in Azhari Square in Latakia city to demand a decentralized political system in Syria and the release of thousands of Alawite prisoners.

About two hours into the protest, gunshots rang out from an unidentified location, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene. Security forces then fired in the air and the protest descended into chaos, with demonstrators carrying wounded people away on foot.

A written statement from the Latakia province's media office that was distributed to reporters said three people were killed and more than 40 people wounded. It did not specify if the casualties were all in Azhari Square or in other towns where protests were also taking place.

Syrian state news agency SANA reported that one member of the security forces was killed by gunfire from "armed remnants of the former regime" in Latakia. It said civilians and security personnel were wounded in gunfire by unknown assailants near Azhari Square.

Sunday's rally had been called for by the head of the Supreme Alawite Islamic Council, Ghazal Ghazal.

A similar protest in November lasted barely an hour before being confronted by a rival protest in support of Syria's new government. Syrian security forces used gunfire to break up both.

Protesters on Sunday chanted: "We want federalism!" and, "The Syrian people are one!"

"We came to demand our dignity, a living, we came to demand political federalism just like big states such as America, Germany and the (United Arab) Emirates," one demonstrator, Salman Mansour, told Reuters.

"We came to ask for our right of living after we were killed in our lands," he added. More than 1,000 Alawites were killed in March after a failed insurrection by Assad loyalists sparked revenge killings by government-affiliated forces.

Last week, eight people were killed when a bomb detonated at an Alawite mosque in the nearby city of Homs.

"ًWe will keep asking for federalism for our dignity. They say we hate each other - no!" said another protester, Nisreen Khazem.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 15:20:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2AH4DIIDZRMMZNEPGZ4E264E5A.jpg?auth=573e4bb098941f45462672bf6d6bfff4e0b22041608dc9c364c0dee1358fd846&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's student-led party allies with Islamists ahead of election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-student-led-party-allies-with-islamists-ahead-election-2025-12-28/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The student-led Bangladeshi party born out of the protest movement that toppled Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has forged an electoral alliance with Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami ahead of February's parliamentary election, stirring internal rifts.

Since last year's uprising, the National Citizen Party (NCP) has cast itself as a centrist, reformist alternative to nepotism and two-party dominance, but as the election nears, it is struggling to turn street power into voter support.

NCP chief Nahid Islam said on Sunday the party had decided to enter into the alliance for greater unity, adding that the final list of candidates would be announced on Monday. Other NCP figures have described the alliance as a pragmatic step in a fragmented political landscape.

But the decision to join forces with Jamaat has already prompted internal ructions.

Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the NCP, becoming a leader in the party, resigned on Saturday and said she would contest the election as an independent candidate. Several other members have also quit.

The alliance has drawn attention because Jamaat has long faced criticism for opposing Bangladesh's independence from Pakistan and its alleged role in 1971 war crimes. Years of trials, leadership bans and political marginalisation have left the party with a limited but loyal support base.

Critics of the NCP's move said it undermined the party's founding ideals.

"The moral support I had for the NCP will no longer exist due to this ideological mismatch," said one university student, asking not to be named.

The partnership comes amid broader political realignments, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) - aligned with ailing former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and effectively led by her son, acting chair Tarique Rahman - regaining momentum following Rahman's return after nearly 17 years in exile.

The February 12 election will be held under an interim administration headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who took charge after Hasina's ouster and is seen as crucial to restoring political stability after nearly two years of turmoil.

A December survey by the U.S.-based International Republican Institute showed the NCP in a distant third place with 6% support, behind the BNP at 30% and Jamaat on 26%.

The alliance might shift voting trends but could hurt the NCP's long-term bid to become a dominant force, said Shakil Ahmed, a government and politics professor at Jahangirnagar University.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 16:26:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LPOIOBCLCVNY3KY4BGOCKTNFKQ.jpg?auth=08719981d0b364fd2c4c5ed0f3ea8cd0a0c3133119dd9ccc5b76ed58829b5f9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian attack damages Kherson heating plant</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/russian-attack-damages-kherson-heating-plant-2025-12-28/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Russian forces struck an important heating plant in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson, causing "significant damage" to the facility, state oil and gas firm Naftogaz said on Sunday.

Officers shot the suspect in the legs during his arrest after he attacked police with a sharp object, authorities added.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 18:30:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo's ruling party set to win vote, exit poll shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovos-ruling-party-set-win-vote-exit-poll-shows-2025-12-28/</link><description>PRISTINA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Kosovo's ruling Vetevendosje party was set to come first with 45.7% of a vote on Sunday, an exit poll on Dukagjini television showed.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 18:53:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GSXYYYR52JLLNFNUIBQBVV6SGQ.jpg?auth=5c988b132ca4063d5acc0b37128771d46050e83c82166d0f1d7b86c0dbf7b031&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin and Trump do not support European-Ukrainian temporary ceasefire idea, the Kremlin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/putin-trump-do-not-support-european-ukrainian-temporary-ceasefire-idea-kremlin-2025-12-28/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 28 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Sunday that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump do not support a European-Ukrainian push for a temporary ceasefire ahead of a settlement, and that Moscow thinks Kyiv needs to make a decision on Donbas.

Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov said that a call between Putin and Trump lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes and took place at the request of Trump ahead of Trump's meeting in Miami with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

"The main thing is that the presidents of Russia and the United States hold similar views that the option of a temporary ceasefire proposed by the Ukrainians and the Europeans under the pretext of preparing for a referendum or under other pretexts only leads to a prolongation of the conflict and is fraught with renewed hostilities," Ushakov said.

Ushakov said that for hostilities to end, Kyiv needed to make a "bold decision" in line with Russian-U.S. discussions on Donbas.

"Given the current situation on the fronts, it would make sense for the Ukrainian regime to make this decision regarding Donbas."

Russia, which controls 90% of Donbas, wants Ukraine to withdraw its forces from the 10% of the area that Kyiv's forces still control. Overall, Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine.

Trump has repeatedly promised to end the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two and his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner have been negotiating with Russia, Ukraine and European powers.

Ukraine and its European allies are worried that Trump could sell out Ukraine and leave European powers to foot the bill for supporting a devastated Ukraine after Russian forces took 12-17 square km (4.6-6.6 square miles) of Ukraine per day in 2025.

"Donald Trump listened attentively to Russian assessments of the real prospects for reaching an agreement," Ushakov said.

"Trump persistently pursued the idea that it was really necessary to end the war as soon as possible, and spoke about the impressive prospects for economic cooperation between the United States and Russia and Ukraine that were opening up," Ushakov said.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 18:53:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QQPTBBYEJRPCTFANHMQCYSC5YI.jpg?auth=a0bd6b08fd627fde8e40c68dd0ae9967323347aab1a79d248473703811c5f0d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One dead, two missing in southern Spain as torrential rains cause flash floods</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/one-dead-two-missing-southern-spain-torrential-rains-cause-flash-floods-2025-12-28/</link><description>VALENCIA, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Torrential rains flooded Spain's southern and eastern provinces over the weekend, with one person dead and two missing on Sunday evening as overflowing riverbeds swept away cars and motorcycles and authorities warned residents to stay indoors.

In Valencia, where deadly floods in October last year killed over 220 people and caused billions of euros in damage, authorities issued red alert warnings to people's phones on Sunday evening urging them to stay indoors and on high ground.

Eight other provinces were on orange alert, warning citizens of serious risks to themselves or property and to be prepared for worsening conditions.

The heavy rains in Valencia last year caught authorities off guard, with many blaming local and national officials for warning people of the danger too late, eventually prompting the leader of the region to resign .

In Malaga, Spain's Civil Guard found the body of a man whose van was swept away by an overflowing riverbed on Sunday, according to a post on their X account. A second passenger of the van was still missing.

Emergency teams were also searching for a young person in Granada who was swept away trying to cross a riverbed on a motorcycle, according to state news agency EFE.

In Barcelona, Catalonia, a woman was hospitalised on Saturday after being hit by a lamppost torn down by 70-kilometre-per-hour winds, the regional government's civil protection agency told Europa Press.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 18:53:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OSDUXFVMWFP43HV3QOGLESGYOI.jpg?auth=51d2453bb7aa9eccb9ed12b4a117111ae79a34b30ab22212b2a08cea60f37def&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jong Un oversees long-range strategic cruise missile launching drill, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-oversees-long-range-strategic-cruise-missile-launching-2025-12-28/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a long-range strategic cruise missile launching drill on Sunday, state media KCNA said on Monday.

Kim said "checking the reliability and rapid response of the components of the DPRK's nuclear deterrent on a regular basis... are just a responsible exercise," as the country "is facing various security threats", using North Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

Netanyahu said this month that Trump had invited him for talks, as Washington pushes to establish transitional governance and an international security force for the Palestinian enclave.

Trump has said he could meet with the Israeli leader soon, but the White House has not confirmed details. The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the meeting.

Netanyahu, who is expected to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago beach club, said on December 22 that discussions were expected to cover the second phase of the Gaza ceasefire, as well as Iran and Lebanon.

Washington brokered ceasefires on all three fronts, but Israel is wary of its foes rebuilding their forces after they were considerably weakened in the war.

All sides agreed in October to Trump's ceasefire plan, which calls for Israel to withdraw from Gaza and Hamas to give up its weapons and forgo a governing role in the enclave.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said last week that Washington wants the transitional administration envisioned in Trump's plan - a Board of Peace and a body made up of Palestinian technocrats - to be in place soon to govern Gaza, ahead of the deployment of the international security force that was mandated by a November 17 U.N. Security Council resolution.

But Israel and Hamas have accused each other of major breaches of the deal and look no closer to accepting the much more difficult steps envisaged for the next phase .

Hamas, which has refused to disarm and has not returned the remains of the last Israeli hostage, has been reasserting its control, as Israeli troops remain entrenched in about half the territory.

Israel has indicated that if Hamas is not disarmed peacefully, it will resume military action to make it do so.

While the fighting has abated, it has not stopped entirely. Although the ceasefire officially began in October, Israeli strikes have killed more than 400 Palestinians — most of them civilians, according to Gaza health officials — and Palestinian militants have killed three Israeli soldiers.

In Lebanon, a U.S.-backed ceasefire that was agreed to in November 2024 ended more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah and required the disarmament of the powerful Iran-backed Shiite group, beginning in areas south of the river adjacent to Israel.

While Lebanon has said it is close to completing the mission within the year-end deadline of disarming Hezbollah, the group has resisted calls to lay down its weapons.

Israel says progress is partial and slow and has been carrying out near-daily strikes in Lebanon, which it says are meant to stop Hezbollah from rebuilding.

Iran, which fought a 12-day war with Israel in June, said last week that it had conducted missile exercises for the second time this month. Netanyahu said Israel is not seeking a confrontation with Iran, but was aware of the reports, and said he would raise Tehran's activities with Trump.

Trump in June ordered U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites but has since then broached a potential deal with Tehran.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:19:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PEIWAXI2RFKI3GZ2RDKNROVAVQ.jpg?auth=315c5d0fbfa1ea0701ec71f3cbaf20547ce1b51adc1c61e98f518fafa501198c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo's Prime Minister Kurti set for second term after decisive election win</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251228-kosovo-prime-minister-kurti-election-win</link><description>Kosovo ’s Prime Minister Albin Kurti appeared set for another term in office after his party on Sunday convincingly won an early parliamentary election in the Balkan country, preliminary results showed.

The Vetevendosje, or Self-Determination, party won nearly 50% of the ballots, far ahead of the opposition Democratic Party of Kosovo with 21%, and the Democratic League of Kosovo with nearly 14%, state election authorities said after nearly all the ballots were counted.

“Congratulations on the biggest victory in the history of the country,” a cheerful Kurti said after results were announced. “Now we have a lot of work ahead of us.”

The snap ballot on Sunday was scheduled after the Self-Determination party failed to form a government despite also winning the most votes in a February 9 election, which led to a months-long political deadlock.

It was not immediately clear whether the Self-Determination party had won 61 seats in the 120-member parliament to be able to rule alone. Kurti said a new parliament and a government would be formed as soon as possible.

“We don’t have time to lose and must move forward together as quickly as possible,” he said.

Hundreds of ruling party supporters gathered outside the party offices in Pristina in celebration, chanting Kurti’s name.

The previous post-election stalemate marked the first time Kosovo could not form a government since it declared independence from Serbia in 2008 following a 1998–99 war that ended in a NATO intervention.

Kosovo has not approved a budget for next year, sparking concern over the already poor economy in the country of 2 million people. Lawmakers are also set to elect a new president in March, as current President Vjosa Osmani’s mandate expires in early April.

After voting on Sunday, Kurti urged Kosovo’s 1.9 million voters to turn out in large numbers to grant “more legitimacy for our institutions”.

Turnout was around 44%, according to state election authorities.

Under Kosovo’s election laws, 20 parliamentary seats are automatically assigned to ethnic Serb representatives and other minority parties.

Opposition parties have accused Kurti of authoritarianism and of alienating Kosovo’s U.S. and European Union allies since he came to power in 2021. Kurti also briefly served as prime minister in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Lumir Abdixhiku from the Democratic League of Kosovo earlier on Sunday urged voters to “move away from the gloom, the deadlock and the division that has accompanied us for these years”.

A former political prisoner during Serbia’s rule in Kosovo, the 50-year-old Kurti has taken a tough stance in talks mediated by the European Union on normalising relations with Belgrade. In response, the EU and the United States imposed punitive measures.

Kurti has promised to buy military equipment to boost security.

Ilmi Deliu, a 71-year-old pensioner from the capital, Pristina, said he hoped the election would bring a change or “we will end up in an abyss”.

“Young people no longer want to live here,” he said.

Tensions with restive ethnic Serbs in the north erupted in clashes in 2023 when scores of NATO-led peacekeepers were injured. In a positive step, ethnic Serb mayors this month took power peacefully there after a municipal vote.

Kurti has also agreed to accept third-country migrants deported from the United States as part of tough anti-immigration measures by the administration of President Donald Trump. One migrant has arrived so far, authorities told The Associated Press.

Kosovo has one of the poorest economies in Europe. It is one of the six Western Balkan countries seeking eventual membership of the EU , but both Kosovo and Serbia have been told they must first normalise relations.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:20:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75fc16dc-e0ef-11f0-a6b4-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/b2912494762f74dd46eef31671f6149ffd86e550.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump, Zelensky say Ukraine peace deal edging closer but key issues unresolved</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251228-trump-zelensky-say-ukraine-peace-deal-closer-key-issues-unresolved</link><description>US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were “getting a lot closer, maybe very close” to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, though both leaders acknowledged that some of the thorniest details remain unresolved.

The two leaders spoke at a joint press conference late on Sunday afternoon after meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Trump said it would be clear “in a few weeks” whether negotiations to end the war would succeed.

Zelensky said an agreement on security guarantees for Ukraine had been reached. Trump was slightly more cautious, saying they were 95% of the way to such an agreement and that he expected European countries to “take over a big part” of that effort with US backing.

Zelensky has said previously that he hopes to soften a US proposal for Ukrainian forces to withdraw completely from the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine, a Russian demand that would mean ceding some territory held by Ukrainian forces.

Both Trump and Zelensky said on Sunday that the future of the Donbas had not been settled. “It’s unresolved, but it’s getting a lot closer. That’s a very tough issue,” Trump said.

Just before Zelensky and his delegation arrived at Trump’s Florida residence, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke in a call described as “productive” by the US president and “friendly” by Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov.

Ushakov, speaking in Moscow, said Putin told Trump that a 60-day ceasefire proposed by the European Union and Ukraine would prolong the war. The Kremlin aide also said Ukraine needed to make a decision regarding the Donbas “without further delay”, and that Russia had agreed to establish working groups to resolve the conflict, focusing on economic and security concerns.

Zelensky arrived at Mar-a-Lago early on Sunday afternoon as Russian air raids piled pressure on Kyiv. Russia hit the capital and other parts of Ukraine with hundreds of missiles and drones on Saturday, knocking out power and heat in parts of the city.

Zelensky has described the weekend attacks as Russia ’s response to US-brokered peace efforts, but Trump said on Sunday that he believes both Putin and Zelensky are serious about peace.

The US president said he would call Putin again after meeting with Zelensky. Zelensky had previously told journalists he planned to discuss the fate of the contested Donbas region with Trump, as well as the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and other issues.

Putin said on Saturday that Moscow would continue waging its war if Kyiv did not seek a quick peace. Russia has steadily advanced on the battlefield in recent months, claiming control over several more settlements on Sunday.

While Kyiv and Washington have agreed on many issues, the question of what territory, if any, will be ceded to Russia remains unresolved. Moscow insists on gaining all of the Donbas, while Kyiv wants the map frozen along current battle lines.

The US, seeking a compromise, has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine leaves the area, though it remains unclear how such a zone would function in practice.

US negotiators have also proposed shared control over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Power line repairs have begun there after another local ceasefire brokered by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the agency said on Sunday.

Russia controls all of Crimea , which it annexed in 2014, and since its invasion of Ukraine nearly four years ago has taken control of about 12% of Ukrainian territory, including about 90% of the Donbas, 75% of the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and smaller parts of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Putin said on December 19 that any peace deal should be based on conditions he set out in 2024, including Ukraine withdrawing from the Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions and Kyiv officially renouncing its aim of joining NATO .

Zelensky’s past encounters with Trump have not always gone smoothly, but Sunday’s meeting followed weeks of diplomatic efforts. European allies, while at times cut out of the loop, have stepped up efforts to outline post-war security guarantees for Kyiv with US support.

Ahead of the Mar-a-Lago visit, Zelensky said he held a detailed phone call with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer . Trump said he and Zelensky would also hold a call with European leaders during the Florida meeting.

A 20-point plan emerged from subsequent talks between Ukrainian officials and US negotiators, spun off from a Russian-led 28-point proposal that became public in November following discussions involving US special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev.</description><pubDate>Sun, 28 Dec 2025 23:20:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/52e02106-e438-11f0-a2a5-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-28T215401Z-15833044-RC2XPIAPYRS2-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-TRUMP-ZELENSKIY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to press Netanyahu on stalled Gaza ceasefire, Iran and Lebanon</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251228-trump-to-press-netanyahu-on-stalled-gaza-ceasefire</link><description>US President Donald Trump is expected to push for progress in the stalled ceasefire in Gaza when he meets Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday, for talks that will also include Israel’s concerns over Hezbollah in Lebanon and Iran.

The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills will involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, in a statement containing a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that will be under sea and air space restrictions for 10 hours from 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT).

This marks China's sixth major round of war games since 2022 after then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the self-governed island, and follow a rise in Chinese rhetoric over Beijing's territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

"This (the drills) serves as a serious warning to 'Taiwan Independence' separatist forces and external interference forces," Shi Yi, a spokesperson for China's Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement.

"The exercise focuses on training for maritime and aerial combat readiness patrols, gaining integrated control, sealing off key ports and areas and conducting multi-dimensional deterrence."

The military released a poster titled "Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions," featuring two golden shields emblazoned with the Chinese People's Liberation Army insignia and the Great Wall of China, along with three military aircraft and two ships.

Taiwan's defence ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

While the PLA had practiced port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island are aimed at "deterrence" of outside military intervention.

The drills began 11 days after the U.S. announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever weapons package for the island, drawing a protest from China's defence ministry and warnings the military would "take forceful measures" in response.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 01:52:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QUU5URKWYZLEFB3N3RLSMXX43I.jpg?auth=912d85daeae673f9f941cec74ffbda966c0aefd103b4c332dd340e2aa96679df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexican train derailment kills at least 13 people, 98 injured</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/least-13-dead-after-train-derails-mexico-2025-12-29/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Mexican authorities said on Sunday that at least 13 people were killed after an Interoceanic Train carrying 250 people derailed in the southern state of Oaxaca.

The Mexican Navy said the train, which derailed near the town of Nizanda, was carrying nine crew members and 241 passengers.

Of those on board, 139 were reported to be out of danger, while 98 were injured, including 36 who were receiving medical assistance.

President Claudia Sheinbaum said on X that five of the injured were in critical condition, adding that senior officials had been dispatched to the site to assist the families of those killed.

The governor of Oaxaca, Salomon Jara Cruz, expressed condolences to the families of those killed in the accident and said state authorities were coordinating with federal agencies to assist those affected.

Mexico's Attorney General's Office has already opened an investigation into the incident, Attorney General Ernestina Godoy Ramos said in a social media post.

The Interoceanic Train, inaugurated in 2023 under former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, forms part of the broader Interoceanic Corridor project.

The initiative was designed to modernize the rail link across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, connecting Mexico's Pacific port of Salina Cruz with Coatzacoalcos on the Gulf Coast.

The Mexican government has sought to develop the isthmus into a strategic trade corridor, expanding ports, railways and industrial infrastructure with the goal of creating a route that could compete with the Panama Canal.

The train service is also part of a broader push to expand passenger and freight rail in southern Mexico and stimulate economic development in the region.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 01:52:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven Turkish police wounded in clash with Islamic State militants, media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/seven-turkish-police-wounded-clash-with-islamic-state-militants-media-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Seven Turkish police officers were wounded during a clash with suspected Islamic State militants in Yalova province in northwest Turkey on Monday, state broadcaster TRT Haber reported.

Rapper turned-Kathmandu mayor Balendra Shah, known as Balen, a popular elected official, joined the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) or national independent party, led by a former TV host-turned politician Rabi Lamichhane on Sunday, party officials said.

They said under the agreement with RSP, 35-year old Balen will become the prime minister if the RSP wins the March 5 elections while Lamichhane will remain the party chief.

Both have vowed to address the demands raised during the "Gen Z" or youth-led protests against widespread corruption in September in which 77 people were killed and led to Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli resigning.

“It is a very smart and strategic move by the RSP to bring in Balen and his young supporters into its fold,” analyst Bipin Adhikari said.

“Traditional political parties are in pain for fear of losing their young voters to RSP,” he said.

The election commission says nearly 19 million of Nepal’s 30 million people are eligible to vote in the elections. Nearly one million voters – mostly youths – were added after the protests.

Balen was in the spotlight after the protests and was an undeclared leader of the youngsters who led the September protests.

He also helped form the interim government of former Chief Justice Sushila Karki to oversee the vote.

Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) or UML and the centrist Nepali Congress party have shared power between them for most of the past three decades and are most likely to be challenged by Balen.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:49:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OTIX5GVP7JKRPKAC4ZSUWJU6OU.jpg?auth=18f1297836944b44c9843d9c21be3d9e15906fee91282defbd77f3c4140d3a9f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korean president vows to reveal truth on anniversary of Jeju Air crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korean-president-vows-reveal-truth-anniversary-jeju-air-crash-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - South Korean President Lee Jae Myung on Monday apologised to the families of the 179 people who died in a Jeju Air (089590.KS) , opens new tab crash a year ago, vowing to reveal the truth behind the worst aircraft accident on the country's soil.

"As president who has the responsibility to protect the lives and safety of the people, I offer my deepest apologies," Lee said in a message released on Monday.

Relatives of the victims have demanded answers about the accident, after investigators delayed releasing a report on what went wrong on December 29, 2024, when the Jeju Air jet crash-landed and slammed into an embankment at the end of the runway.

It erupted in a ball of flames, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes.

But questions remain about safety lapses, the design of the runway at Muan International Airport where the crash occurred and what actions the pilots took in the last few minutes of the flight.

"The disaster clearly revealed the systematic problems and limitations of our society," Lee said. "What's needed now is not perfunctory promises or empty words but rather real change and action."

Parliament has been reviewing a plan to overhaul the aircraft accident investigation board to ensure independence and greater expertise.

Relatives of the victims are scheduled to hold a memorial service later on Monday at Muan International Airport in the country's southwest to mark the anniversary.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3QWGBPMONLQDJTEYV6WJ2G7IM.jpg?auth=b21b8f6fcc3ee8caf08bbf0f3faa84b1f9bcd1a0753499e75593dd38e6d048f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia says Bondi review to check if terror attack could have been averted</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-says-bondi-review-check-if-terror-attack-could-have-been-averted-2025-12-29/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Monday an independent review into law enforcement agencies set up after the Bondi mass shooting will assess whether authorities could have taken additional steps to prevent the terror attack.

Albanese said the review will examine whether existing laws or information gaps stopped police and security agencies from acting against the alleged attackers, a father and son, who police say were inspired by the militant group Islamic State.

Fifteen people were killed in the mass shooting at a Jewish Hanukkah celebration at Sydney's famed Bondi Beach on December 14, shocking a country with strict gun laws and fuelling calls for tougher controls and stronger action against antisemitism.

Families of those killed and injured on Monday urged Albanese to set up a royal commission, the most powerful type of government inquiry, to probe the rise of antisemitism and any intelligence failures tied to the attack, Australian media reported on Monday.

"Announcements made so far by the federal government in response to the Bondi massacre are not nearly enough ... You owe us answers. You owe us accountability. And you owe Australians the truth," said a statement from the families of those involved in the mass shooting, according to media reports.

Reuters could not immediately contact the families for comment.

Albanese, who is facing mounting criticism from opponents who argue his government has not done enough to curb a rise in antisemitism, has been resisting calls to set up a royal commission into the attack. He reiterated it would take years for the inquiry to submit the report.

"The government is committed to making sure that we can't wait years for answers. We need to get on with any changes that are required," Albanese told reporters, while announcing the terms for the review into the attack.

Albanese said the independent committee will submit the report in April and the Parliament will resume as soon as possible next year to consider any legislation.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TXRO3KJKURNC7N32SYKIRDAZIY.jpg?auth=3c0a27f5fea00cbf706768d004620fd3ce96e722a4b28437868b278fdc0f5d05&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea's ex-First Lady Kim received bribes and meddled in state affairs, prosecutor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/south-koreas-ex-first-lady-kim-received-bribes-meddled-state-affairs-prosecutor-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The wife of former South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol interfered in state affairs in return for expensive valuables and money, a special prosecutor said on Monday.

The special prosecutor's investigations, which wrapped up on Sunday, came amid a year-long probe into Yoon's brief imposition of martial law last year and related scandals linked to the once-powerful couple.

The prosecution team earlier this month sought a 15-year prison sentence for former First Lady Kim Keon Hee, who is under detention and currently on trial for suspected acceptance of bribes for mediation and other charges.

Kim has denied any wrongdoing. She apologised to the public for causing concerns during a court hearing earlier this month.

Kim "took advantage of the status of the president's spouse to receive money and expensive valuables, and has been widely involved in various personnel appointments and nominations," special prosecutor Min Joong-ki said at a news conference marking the end of his investigation.

A lower court ruling on Kim is expected on January 28.

The prosecution team has also indicted Unification Church leader Han Hak-ja, now on trial, after the religious group was suspected of giving Kim valuables including two Chanel bags and a diamond necklace as part of its efforts to win influence.

Han has denied that she directed her church to bribe Kim.

"Various people who did not have a common denominator with each other visited Kim Keon Hee, not the president, and asked for what they wanted, and gave money and goods," said assistant special prosecutor Kim Hyeong-geun.

"As a result, their request was realised."

Ousted President Yoon is on trial for suspected masterminding of an insurrection, a charge that could mean a life sentence or even a death penalty. He has denied the charges.

A lower court ruling on Yoon is expected early 2026.

The report, conducted by the country's natural resources ministry, also said that "illegal fishing" and frequent intrusion activities in recent years have threatened the ecosystem around the shoal.

China and the Philippines both claim territorial rights to Scarborough Shoal , one of Asia's most contested maritime features prized for its rich fisheries, its protective lagoon and proximity to major shipping lanes. But sovereignty has never been established.

It is effectively under Beijing's control although Filipino boats continue to operate there.

In September, China approved the creation of a national nature reserve at the shoal, a plan the Philippines condemned as a "clear pretext for occupation".</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China conducts large-scale Taiwan drills amid rising tensions</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251229-china-conducts-large-scale-taiwan-drills-amid-rising-tensions</link><description>China 's military moved army, naval, air force, and artillery units around Taiwan on Monday for its "Justice Mission 2025" drills, as the island vowed to defend democracy and mobilised troops to rehearse repelling a potential Chinese attack.

The Eastern Theatre Command announced the drills would involve live-fire exercises on Tuesday, accompanied by a graphic demarcating five zones surrounding the island that would be under sea and airspace restrictions for ten hours from 8:30 a.m. (0030 GMT).

This marks China's sixth major round of war games since 2022, following then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s visit to the democratically governed island, and comes amid heightened Chinese rhetoric over Beijing's territorial claims after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi suggested a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could prompt a military response from Tokyo .

The drills began 11 days after the US announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan—the largest ever weapons package for the island—drawing a protest from China's defence ministry and warnings that the military would "take forceful measures" in response. Beijing's exercises increasingly blur the line between routine training and what analysts say could be stage-setting for an attack, a strategy designed to give the US and its allies minimal warning of a potential assault.

China's military said it had deployed fighter jets, bombers, unmanned aerial vehicles, and long-range rockets, and would practise striking mobile land-based targets while simulating a coordinated assault on the island from multiple directions.

"This [the drills] serves as a serious warning to 'Taiwan Independence' separatist forces and external interference forces," said Shi Yi, a spokesperson for the Eastern Theatre Command.

Taiwan's government condemned the drills. A presidential office spokesperson urged China not to misjudge the situation or undermine regional peace, calling on Beijing to immediately halt what they described as irresponsible provocations.

The island's defence ministry said two Chinese military aircraft and 11 ships had been operating around Taiwan over the past 24 hours, and that Taiwan's military remained on high alert and poised to carry out "rapid response exercises."

The drill is specifically designed to enable rapid troop mobilisation in case China suddenly turns one of its frequent exercises around the island into an attack.

"All members of our armed forces will remain highly vigilant and fully on guard, taking concrete action to defend the values of democracy and freedom," the ministry said.

Taiwan's stock markets were largely unaffected by the drills, rising 0.3% to a record high in morning trading.

The Chinese military released two posters titled "Shields of Justice: Smashing Illusions" and "Arrows of Justice: Control and Denial", alongside a graphic depicting four locations across the island with targets locking on, following the drill announcement.

China's state broadcaster said the drills would focus on sealing off Taiwan's vital deep-water ports of Keelung to the north and Kaohsiung to the south, the island’s largest port city.

The first poster features two golden shields emblazoned with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army insignia and the Great Wall of China, along with military aircraft and two ships. China is mobilising an armada of civilian ships capable of supporting an attack on Taiwan. Vessels with ramps and open decks similar to military landing craft used in amphibious assaults since World War Two appear in the poster.

"Any foreign interference that touches the shield [of justice] shall perish! Any separatist scoundrels who encounter the shield shall be destroyed!" the poster reads.

The second poster shows flaming arrows raining down on Taiwan, spearing green cartoon bugs. Beijing regularly labels Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te a "parasite" and began using the green bug caricature to represent separatist forces during April’s war games.

While the PLA practised port blockades around Taiwan during war games last year, this marks the first time it has publicly stated that drills around the island aim to deter outside military intervention.

Takaichi's remarks triggered a surge in Chinese messaging emphasising its sovereignty claims. Chinese leader Xi Jinping told US President Donald Trump in November that Taiwan's "return to China" after World War Two was central to Beijing's vision of the global order.

Taiwan rejects China's claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island's future.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 03:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/785e510a-e460-11f0-90fa-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-29T021724Z-670509462-RC22QIATVZGB-RTRMADP-3-CHINA-TAIWAN-DRILLS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kim oversees cruise missile launch as North Korea touts nuclear readiness</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251229-kim-oversees-cruise-missile-launch-as-north-korea-touts-nuclear-readiness</link><description>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un oversaw the launch of long-range strategic cruise missiles on Sunday, which confirmed the integrity of the country’s nuclear power and counter-attack readiness in the face of security threats, state media KCNA said on Monday.

The launch is the latest event attended by Kim in a flurry of activity by the North Korean leader to underscore the country’s military and economic progress ahead of a key ruling party congress expected to be held in early 2026.

Kim expressed “great satisfaction” as the cruise missiles flew along their orbit above the sea west of the Korean Peninsula and hit their target, KCNA said.

Kim said that “checking the reliability and rapid response of the components of the DPRK’s nuclear deterrent on a regular basis … (is) just a responsible exercise”, as the country “is facing various security threats”, using North Korea ’s official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.

He affirmed that North Korea would continue devoting all its efforts to the “unlimited” development of its nuclear combat force, KCNA added.

South Korea ’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said on Monday that its military had detected the launch of multiple cruise missiles at around 8 a.m. on Sunday (2300 Saturday GMT) from the Sunan area near Pyongyang .

A series of military activities by the North in the past week, including ongoing work to build a nuclear-powered submarine, are “activities that undermine peace and stability on the Korean peninsula”, a South Korean defence ministry spokesperson said.

Sunday’s launch followed a KCNA report last week that Kim had observed the construction of a nuclear-powered submarine with his daughter, a possible successor, and oversaw the test-firing of long-range surface-to-air missiles.

North Korea could conduct additional missile tests around New Year’s Day, Yonhap news agency said, citing a South Korean military official. South Korea’s military declined to comment on the possibility of further launches.

Hong Min, an expert on North Korea at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, said Sunday’s launch was likely intended to test an upgraded cruise missile capable of delivering both conventional and nuclear weapons.

Kim also attended the opening ceremony of a paper mill on Sunday, KCNA said.

Over the past month, Kim has attended multiple openings of facilities including factories and hotels, as the country races to wrap up its current five-year development plan before convening the Ninth Congress of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea in early 2026.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 04:51:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/20251284-e128-11f0-8d6b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-24T224143Z-208249276-RC29NIAR68AC-RTRMADP-3-NORTHKOREA-POLITICS-MISSILES.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kolkata's iconic trams face final stop as modernization rolls in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/india/kolkatas-iconic-trams-face-final-stop-modernization-rolls-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 05:54:12 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>No New Year fireworks in Indonesia as nation mourns Sumatra flood victims</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/no-new-year-fireworks-indonesia-nation-mourns-sumatra-flood-victims-2025-12-29/</link><description>JAKARTA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Indonesia's central government will support the plans of several regions to forgo fireworks while celebrating New Year this week in solidarity with the victims of recent floods on the island of Sumatra, an official in the president's office said on Monday.

Several governments and police forces, including those in the capital Jakarta and on the popular tourist island of Bali, have said they will not allow firework displays out of respect for the victims on Sumatra, where floods and landslides have killed over 1,100 people, with around 400,000 still displaced.

Prasetyo Hadi, spokesperson for President Prabowo Subianto's office, told reporters that the government thinks it is correct that regional governments should ban fireworks or urge people not to set them off during the celebrations.

"It is correct because we have to show empathy and solidarity ... as a nation, that there are some who suffered from a disaster," he said.

Police in Bali's capital of Denpasar have banned New Year's fireworks, state news agency Antara reported on Saturday. Jakarta's governor also said last week that there will be no firework displays in the city of 10 million people, and urged residents not to set any off.

Indonesian authorities have built bridges and housing in the areas of Sumatra hit by the floods, which include the provinces of North Sumatra, West Sumatra, and Aceh. The recovery is expected to cost at least $3.11 billion .

Several regions on the island remain in a state of emergency, coordinating minister for human development Pratikno said in a press conference on Monday.

Over 20 villages across the three provinces "disappeared" after being swept away by the floods, home affairs minister Tito Karnavian said during the same briefing.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 06:36:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UQOQ67SX7VPVPDVQI4N2ENTM7A.jpg?auth=4f35c9311d3c8ad811470a19319fb9935bd7727ef12756272e6ab0ff95666740&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After 2025 recognition of a Palestinian state, what's next ?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-after-2025-recognition-of-a-palestinian-state-what-s-next</link><description>The Palestinian cause scored a symbolic victory in 2025 as several Western countries that had long shown caution or ambiguity formally recognised the State of Palestine.

In September, on the sidelines of the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York, France, Britain, Portugal, Canada, Australia and Belgium, among others, announced they were recognising Palestine, as Israel continued its war in Gaza and stepped up settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank.

France played a driving role in the unprecedented wave of recognitions, prompting strong opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who rejected the creation of a Palestinian state and described it as "a huge reward for terrorism", referring to Hamas and the October 7 attacks.

After years of rhetorical support for a Palestinian state, conditioned on prior peace with Israel, Paris ultimately decided to move to formal recognition on September 22, when President Emmanuel Macron addressed the UN General Assembly.

The decision was presented as an explicit endorsement of the two-state solution, long viewed as the central framework for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

"This recognition is unquestionably a very important moment in the history of this conflict, as well as for French diplomacy, particularly in the way it was carried out," said Jean-Paul Chagnollaud, emeritus professor and honorary president of the Institute for Research and Studies on the Mediterranean and the Middle East (IREMMO). "There is indeed a symbolic dimension, but it is more than that, because it is a significant political act."

"France sought to rally part of the Western world that had previously been reluctant," he added, noting that the broader French initiative led to the New York Declaration, signed by 142 states.

France’s recognition formed part of a wider diplomatic push, including an international conference co-chaired with Saudi Arabia that culminated on September 12 in the UN General Assembly’s adoption of the New York Declaration , which described recognition of the Palestinian state as "essential and indispensable".

The declaration laid out what was described as an "irreversible" roadmap for a political settlement based on the two-state solution and excluded Hamas from any political role in Gaza.

"Ultimately, this kind of recognition comes down to the decision of one person – the president – who, like anyone else, has doubts and hesitations," Chagnollaud said. "Last spring, I wouldn’t have bet a euro on France recognising the (Palestinian) state. But what Emmanuel Macron saw in April, when he travelled close to Gaza during a visit to Egypt, and the atrocities then being committed, pushed him to act."

Despite opening the way for closer bilateral ties and increasing pressure on the Palestinian Authority to pursue reforms, the recognitions remain largely insufficient given the realities on the ground.

Even if France said the move increased pressure on Israel to accept the Gaza ceasefire demanded by US President Donald Trump a couple of weeks after the UN General Assembly, recognition has not ended the occupation, halted settlement expansion or stopped violence against Palestinian civilians. Nor has it sidelined Hamas, which continues to control the Gaza strip.

Without concrete implementation of the New York Declaration, stronger pressure on the Israeli government and a clear US willingness to rebalance power dynamics, the recognitions risk remaining largely symbolic, with little impact on Palestinians’ daily lives.

"The effects are clearly limited and, in some respects, counterproductive," Chagnollaud said. "They are limited because recognition has no direct impact, and because France and the Europeans lack leverage on the ground, unlike the Americans, who are clearly opposed to this recognition and to the New York Declaration."

"The move is counterproductive if all these states that have taken the step of recognition stop there,” he added. “And unfortunately, that is the case since they have not lifted a finger to jointly impose a reality on the ground, for example through sanctions against Israel, which has waged a war that has annihilated an entire society and is doing everything, including in the West Bank, to undermine the very idea of a Palestinian state."

The diplomatic momentum was soon overshadowed by Donald Trump’s peace plan, which succeeded in imposing a ceasefire in Gaza but was structured around US and Israeli security priorities, leaving intact the grievances that fuel violence and undermine prospects for lasting peace.

"We are heading towards the crushing of the Palestinian question, both literally and figuratively,” Chagnollaud said. “I even think that in 2026 we will witness one of the worst periods in Palestinian history."

Trump and Putin agree that a "temporary ceasefire" would "merely prolong the conflict and risk a renewed escalation on the battlefield," Kremlin diplomatic advisor Yuri Ushakov said.

He said that Trump and Putin would speak again "promptly" after the Zelensky meeting.

US President Donald Trump said on Sunday that talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky were moving “very close” to an agreement to end the war in Ukraine, though both leaders acknowledged that major sticking points, including territory and security guarantees, remain unresolved.

French President Emmanuel Macron announced on Monday that Kyiv's allies would meet in Paris next month to discuss security guarantees as part of a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia.

The site, in the Dhumair desert east of Damascus, was used during Assad’s rule as a military weapons depot, according to a former Syrian army officer with knowledge of the operation. It was later emptied of personnel in 2018 to ensure secrecy for a plot that involved unearthing the bodies of thousands of victims of the dictatorship buried in a mass grave on the outskirts of Damascus and trucking them an hour’s drive away to Dhumair.

The plot, orchestrated by the dictator’s inner circle, was called “ Operation Move Earth .” Soldiers are stationed at the Dhumair site again, this time by the government that overthrew Assad.

The Dhumair military installation was also reactivated as a barracks and arms depot in November, after seven years of disuse, according to an army officer posted there in early December, a military official and Sheikh Abu Omar Tawwaq, who is the security chief of Dhumair.

The Dhumair site was completely unprotected over the summer, when Reuters journalists made repeated visits after discovering the existence of a mass grave there.

Within weeks of the report in October, the new government created a checkpoint at the entrance to the military installation where the site lies, according to a soldier stationed there who spoke to Reuters in mid-December. Visitors to the site now need access permits from the Defense Ministry.

Satellite images reviewed by Reuters since late November show new vehicle activity around the main base area.

The military official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the reactivation of the base is part of efforts to “secure control over the country and prevent hostile parties from exploiting this open strategic area.” The road through the desert connects one of Islamic State’s remaining Syrian strongholds with Damascus.

In November, police opened an investigation into the grave, photographing it, carrying out land surveys and interviewing witnesses, according to Jalal Tabash, head of the al-Dhumair police station. Among those interviewed by police was Ahmed Ghazal, a key source for the Reuters investigation that exposed the mass grave.

“I told them all the details I told you about the operation and what I witnessed during those years,” said Ghazal, a mechanic who repaired trucks carrying bodies that broke down at the Dhumair grave site. Ghazal confirmed that during the time of “Operation Move Earth,” the military installation appeared vacant except for the soldiers involved in accompanying the convoys.

Syria’s Information Ministry did not respond to requests for comment about the re-activation of the base or the investigation into the mass grave.

The National Commission for Missing Persons, which was established after Assad’s ouster to investigate the fate of tens of thousands of Syrians who vanished under his rule, told Reuters it is in the process of training personnel and creating laboratories in order to meet international standards for mass grave exhumations. Exhumations at Syria’s many Assad-era mass graves, including the site at Dhumair, are scheduled for 2027, the commission told Reuters.

The police have referred their report on Dhumair to the Adra district attorney, Judge Zaman al-Abdullah. Al-Abdullah told Reuters that information about Assad-era suspects involved in the Dhumair operation, both inside and outside Syria, is being cross-referenced with documents obtained by security branches after the dictator’s fall in December 2024. He would not describe the suspects, citing the ongoing investigation.

According to military documents reviewed by Reuters and testimony from civilian and military sources, logistics for “Operation Move Earth” were handled by a key man, Col. Mazen Ismander. Contacted through an intermediary, Ismander declined to comment on the initial Reuters report or the new investigation into the mass grave.

When the conspiracy was hatched in 2018, Assad was verging on victory in the civil war and hoped to reclaim legitimacy in the international community after years of sanctions and allegations of brutality. He had been accused of detaining and killing Syrians by the thousands, and the location of a mass grave in the town of Qutayfah, outside Damascus, had been reported by local human rights activists.

So an order came from the presidential palace: Excavate Qutayfah and hide the bodies on the military installation in the Dhumair desert.

For four nights a week for nearly two years, from 2019 to 2021, Ismander oversaw the operation, Reuters found. Trucks hauled corpses and dirt from the exposed mass grave to the vacated military installation in the desert, where trenches were filled with bodies as the Qutayfah site was excavated.

In revealing the conspiracy, Reuters spoke to 13 people with direct knowledge of the two-year effort and analyzed more than 500 satellite images of both mass graves. Under the guidance of forensic geologists, Reuters used aerial drone photography to create high-resolution composite images that helped corroborate the transfer of bodies by showing color changes in the disturbed soil around Dhumair’s burial trenches.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 07:26:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WWGRJCMSQBKVFPRAEJFYQ44XNA.jpg?auth=140586332e11004300634408aaa4b8b3e8e14e1264bcbb1e772293d6c4a7b971&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand and Cambodia agree to 'consolidate ceasefire' in China talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-cambodia-will-gradually-consolidate-ceasefire-china-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>BEIJING, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Thailand and Cambodia plan to rebuild mutual trust and gradually consolidate a ceasefire after weeks of border clashes, Beijing said in a communique with the two countries following talks in southwestern China.

The Southeast Asian neighbours on Saturday ended weeks of fierce fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million with their second ceasefire since late October.

Thailand and Cambodia's top diplomats travelled to the Chinese province of Yunnan for trilateral talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi to discuss the border situation on Sunday and Monday.

In a meeting with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts, Wang called the ceasefire "hard-won," and urged the two nations not to abandon it halfway or allow fighting to resume.

"Discussions between the three parties were beneficial and constructive, and an important consensus was reached," Wang said, according to a statement released by his ministry, which did not mention ASEAN's role in facilitating a ceasefire.

The parties involved must "look forward and move forward," Wang added.

Thailand and Cambodia will "rebuild political mutual trust, achieve a turnaround in relations, and maintain regional peace," according to a joint communique released by China's official Xinhua news agency.

The latest round of clashes began early this month after a breakdown in a ceasefire that U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Kuala Lumpur to halt a previous round of fighting.

"The implementation of the ceasefire agreement requires continued communication and consultation, and the restoration of bilateral relations must also proceed gradually," Wang said on Monday.

Thai and Cambodian defence officials also joined the talks in China.

Diplomats and defence officials from Thailand and Cambodia held a number of bilateral meetings, the Chinese foreign minister said, adding that both sides held in-depth discussions and showed a "positive and open attitude."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 07:46:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CSNYTMHK4ZOEHL56UYJOWREDSI.jpg?auth=ab768503da1c6cf7141dbc9d3cf39d48b917074461e6778148b8457d989d3616&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One migrant dead and three missing after boat sinks off Greek island of Samos</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/one-migrant-dead-three-missing-after-boat-sinks-off-greek-island-samos-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - A woman was found dead and three people remain missing after a migrant boat sank off the Greek island of Samos early on Monday, the coast guard said.

A search and rescue operation is under way, involving a coast guard vessel, a helicopter, a private boat and land-based personnel, the coast guard added.

The local government tore down the monument honouring Chinese contributions to the Panama Canal, citing safety issues and an expired land concession, drawing ire from the local Chinese community and criticism from Panama's president.

"The nature of the forced demolition is very bad, which has seriously damaged the feelings of the vast number of overseas Chinese in Panama, and runs counter to the overall situation of China-Panama friendship," foreign ministry spokesperson, Lin Jian, told a regular press briefing.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 08:35:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W6GF7QXQLZOBZNE6REPMDBAW6E.jpg?auth=c52dabcd71c012fa122dc983286eff15027a18fec2bf062bfee492a93e2b5353&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netanyahu and Trump to meet in Florida to discuss second phase of Gaza ceasefire</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-netanyahu-and-trump-to-meet-in-florida-to-discuss-second-phase-of-gaza-ceasefire</link><description>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet US President Donald Trump in Florida on Monday, with the US president pushing to move to the next stage of the fragile Gaza truce plan.

The crucial meeting at Trump's lavish Mar-a-Lago resort comes as some White House officials fear both Israel and Hamas are slow-walking the second phase of their ceasefire.

Trump, who said Netanyahu had asked for the talks, is reportedly keen to announce – as soon as January – a Palestinian technocratic government for Gaza and the deployment of an international stabilisation force.

The two leaders are to meet at 1pm (1800 GMT), the White House said.

Israeli government spokeswoman Shosh Bedrosian said Netanyahu would discuss the second phase, which involves making sure that "Hamas is disarmed, Gaza is demilitarised."

But Netanyahu will also try to shift the focus onto Iran during his fifth meeting in the United States with Trump this year, amid reports he will push for more US strikes on Tehran's nuclear program.

Netanyahu would also bring up the "danger Iran poses not only to the region of the Middle East , but the United States as well", Bedrosian said before flying out with the Israeli premier.

Netanyahu's visit caps a frantic few days of international diplomacy in Palm Beach, where Trump hosted Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky on Sunday for talks on ending Russia's invasion.

The Gaza ceasefire in October is one of the major achievements of Trump's first year back in power, but his administration and regional mediators want to keep up the momentum.

Trump's global envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner hosted senior officials from mediators Qatar , Egypt and Turkey in Miami earlier this month.

The timing of the Netanyahu meeting is "very significant", said Gershon Baskin, the co-head of peacebuilding commission the Alliance for Two States, who has taken part in back-channel negotiations with Hamas.

"Phase two has to begin," he told AFP, adding that "I think the Americans realise that it's late because Hamas has had too much time to re-establish its presence."

The first phase of the truce deal saw Hamas release the remaining hostages, both dead and alive, from the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel. Hamas has returned all but the body of one hostage. Both sides allege frequent ceasefire violations.

Under the second stage, Israel is supposed to withdraw from its positions in Gaza, while Hamas is supposed to lay down its weapons – a major sticking point for the Islamist movement.

An interim authority is meanwhile meant to govern the Palestinian territory, and the international stabilisation force (ISF) is to be deployed.

The Axios news outlet reported on Friday that Trump wanted to convene the first meeting of a new Gaza "Board of Peace" that he will chair at the Davos forum in Switzerland in January.

But it said that senior White House officials were growing exasperated with what they viewed as efforts by Netanyahu to stall the peace process.

"There are more and more signs that the American administration is getting frustrated with Netanyahu," said Yossi Mekelberg, a Middle East expert at London-based think-tank Chatham House.

"The question is what it's going to do about it," he added, "because phase two is right now going nowhere".

For his part, Netanyahu is set to focus with Trump on Iran's nuclear programme, which the United States and Israel struck in June but which Israel fears Tehran is rebuilding.

Israel is also continuing to strike Hamas targets in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon despite a ceasefire there. Syria will also be on the agenda.

Mekelberg said Netanyahu could be attempting to shift attention from Gaza onto Iran as Israel enters an election year.

"Everything is connected to staying in power," he said of the long-time Israeli premier.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 08:36:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d74759c6-e48a-11f0-969c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25290000837382.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh’s Gen-Z party faces revolt over Islamist alliance, risking its future</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-gen-z-party-faces-revolt-over-islamist-alliance-risking-its-future-2025-12-29/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - A Bangladeshi youth-driven party born out of the country's 2024 uprising is facing an open revolt from within after sealing an election alliance with an Islamist group, a move analysts say could jeopardise its future and reinforce established parties.

At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami , announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest.

The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on February 12.

Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place.

"The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain," said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. "Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity."

The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the protests that ousted long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August, 2024, forcing her to flee to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina's Awami League and the BNP.

With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh's secular constitution.

An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus revoked , opens new tab all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024.

The NCP's struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said.

NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent killing of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi , a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence.

"The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat,” said Nahid, 27.

"This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions."

Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them.

Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time.

One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent.

"I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture," she said on Facebook. "Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise."

Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was "doomed".

"If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you," he said. "It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:31:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OIKRZJV43BO5DAIZHUTJNKJYCM.jpg?auth=132cc1b6e546b04f409d1cb80d882cfbc792b522bfc9bf471c11d5b0d2996049&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says 20-point peace plan should be put to referendum in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-20-point-peace-plan-should-be-put-referendum-ukraine-2025-12-29/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Monday that a 20-point peace plan to end Russia's war should be put to a referendum in Ukraine.

"As a small, export-oriented country, we simply cannot afford to forgo such an opportunity," Kocher told Austrian news agency APA in an interview.

Austrian lawmakers in 2019 passed a resolution setting the country against a Mercosur trade deal, since when the government has repeatedly said it must uphold that position.

The EU and the bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay reached agreement last December to create the EU's largest ever trade accord, some 25 years after negotiations were launched. However, the bloc is struggling to win support from Italy and deal critics France, Poland and Hungary.

Approval of the accord requires a qualified majority of 15 EU members representing 65% of the EU population.

Kocher said plenty had changed since Austrian lawmakers voted to oppose a deal six years ago, and that the present agreement had significant safeguards for farmers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 09:33:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UOEEXK3FEROZZK2PVJWATQGGR4.jpg?auth=5424a46be2b26d427b76b5188279cccc8a760e91cf31aae353cdb2e692283b3c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesian authorities recover body during search for drowned Spanish soccer coach and his children</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesian-authorities-recover-body-during-search-drowned-spanish-soccer-coach-2025-12-29/</link><description>JAKARTA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Indonesian rescuers on Monday found a body during the search for Spanish soccer coach Fernando Martin and his children after their boat sank near the coast of a popular tourist spot on Friday, the country's rescue agency said.

Martin was a coach with the Spanish club Valencia CF, which said he and his three children died "in the tragic boat accident in Indonesia, as confirmed by local authorities."

The boat Martin and his family were on capsized on Friday after suffering engine failure during bad weather in the Padar Island Strait, close to the resort town of Labuan Bajo, authorities said. The location is near the Komodo National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage site where the rare Komodo dragons live.

Fathur Rahman, the chief of a local search and rescue agency, said they have recovered the body of a female "highly suspected of being a victim" of the accident. Authorities are currently trying to secure an identification, he added.

The search for the bodies of Martin and his children are ongoing despite strong currents and tall waves, Fathur said, adding it will also continue going into Tuesday.

Martin's wife and one daughter, as well as four crew members and a tour guide, survived the accident. The boat was carrying 11 people.

Indonesia has placed a temporary ban on tour boats sailing in the waters of Labuan Bajo and the Komodo Islands, its tourism ministry said on Sunday.

Separately, a speedboat carrying 21 people capsized in the waters near Indonesia's Papua, with 17 people missing and one dead, a local search and rescue agency official said on Monday.

Boats and ferries are a regular mode of transport in Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, with accidents caused by bad weather and lax safety standards that often allow vessels to be overloaded.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BGNSZUREVNKXFPWEDQO6XIZGVQ.jpg?auth=205f201e024fd6d70315ae6d305333c4af0529ceef3d3905c74a57920124700e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia raids several firms as part of anti-graft probe into army procurement</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysia-raids-several-firms-part-anti-graft-probe-into-army-procurement-2025-12-29/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Malaysia's anti-graft agency said on Monday that it has raided several firms alleged to be involved in bribery linked to army procurement projects, days after the country's army chief was placed on leave pending an investigation into the matter.

Azam Baki, chief commissioner at the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission, said the agency had also frozen six bank accounts belonging to a suspect and their family members as part of the probe.

He did not provide details about the suspect or the companies involved, but said investigations were being carried out under an anti-corruption law related to corporate liability for bribery.

"MACC officers have conducted searches at several companies believed to be involved to obtain relevant documents and evidence," Azam said in a statement.

Malaysia's army chief Muhammad Hafizuddeain Jantan was put on immediate leave on Saturday to allow room for authorities to fully investigate allegations involving him "without any conflict of interest", defence minister Mohamed Khaled Nordin said in a statement over the weekend, without providing specifics.

Citing sources, state news agency Bernama reported last week that MACC had recorded statements from three people as part of a probe into army procurement projects between 2023 and 2025.

A preliminary review found that several firms had repeatedly secured high-value contracts, Bernama quoted one of the sources as saying.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, became Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending much of his adult life in and out of detention due to his activism and was a rare symbol of opposition during a far-reaching crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

He arrived in Britain last Friday after obtaining British citizenship in 2021 through his mother, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was "delighted" by the news.

In the following days, British newspapers ran stories about posts made by Fattah on the former Twitter platform between 2008 and 2014, seen by Reuters, which endorsed violence against "Zionists" and police.

In a statement, Abd el-Fattah said many of his tweets had been misunderstood but that others were unacceptable.

"Looking at the tweets now - the ones that were not completely twisted out of their meaning - I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise," Fattah said.

"They were mostly expressions of a young man's anger and frustrations in a time of regional crises - the wars on Iraq, on Lebanon and Gaza - and the rise of police brutality against Egyptian youth."

Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK party which currently tops opinion polls, called for Abd el-Fattah's deportation from Britain. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said the country should consider it.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said his posts were of "profound concern" and showed a lack of due diligence among British authorities.

Britain's foreign office said it condemned Abd el-Fattah's historic tweets and called them "abhorrent", in a statement published on Sunday.

Abd el-Fattah was most recently serving a five-year sentence in Egypt imposed in December 2021, after he shared a social media post about a prisoner's death.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zaporizhzhia power plant could restart in 18 months once the war ends, head says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/zaporizhzhia-power-plant-could-restart-18-months-once-war-ends-head-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The head of the Russian-controlled Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southeastern Ukraine said on Monday the facility could restart power generation by the middle of 2027 if the war concludes in the near future.

"If this (the end of the conflict) happens tomorrow, we will be ready to start up in mid-2027," Ramil Galiyev was cited as saying by Russia's RIA state news agency.

The nuclear plant, Europe's largest, has been under Russian control since March 2022, when Russian forces overran much of southeastern Ukraine. It is not currently producing electricity but relies on external power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.

Power line repairs are currently underway at the plant under the watch of a team from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and are expected to last a few days.

Galiyev said "serious issues" at the plant would have to be addressed before it could go online, including replenishing the cooling pond and preparing railway tracks.

Both Russia and Ukraine regularly accuse one another of shelling the plant, risking a nuclear disaster.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4G3ZSP2FQJLVJCVJUTH77ISEZU.jpg?auth=d67762e0ceecda8e582464dbdb667325e0464e9babe76e6a28911c25a7900967&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's war games around Taiwan over the years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-war-games-around-taiwan-over-years-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - China launched its most extensive war games around Taiwan on Monday called "Justice Mission 2025" to showcase Beijing's ability to cut off the island from outside support in a conflict.

The People's Republic of China has claimed Taiwan through its "one China" policy since the Chinese civil war forced the defeated Republic of China government to flee to the island in 1949, and has vowed to bring Taiwan under Beijing's rule, by force if necessary.

The government in Taiwan strongly rejects the Chinese sovereignty claims, saying it is already an independent country called the Republic of China, and that only its people can decide their future.

Here are some facts on military tensions between China and Taiwan and previous Chinese military exercises.

- China and Taiwan have nearly gone to war several times since 1949. The two sides last joined battle on a large scale in 1958, when Chinese forces bombed the Taiwan-controlled Kinmen and Matsu islands for more than a month, alongside naval and air combat.

- Ahead of Taiwan's first direct presidential election in 1996, China carried out missile tests in waters close to the island, hoping to prevent people voting for Lee Teng-hui, whom China suspected of harbouring pro-independence views. Lee won convincingly.

- In August 2022, furious at a visit to Taipei by then-U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, China held several days of war games around Taiwan, including launches of ballistic missiles, some of which flew over Taipei, and simulated sea and air attacks in surrounding skies and waters.

- In April 2023, China held three days of drills around Taiwan, saying they had tested integrated military capabilities under combat conditions, having practised precision strikes and blockading the island. Those drills came after Taiwan's then-President Tsai Ing-wen returned to Taipei following a meeting in Los Angeles with Kevin McCarthy, who at the time was U.S. House speaker.

- In August 2023, China launched military drills around Taiwan as a "serious warning" to "separatists" in an angry but widely expected response to then-Vice President Lai's visit to the United States.

- In May 2024, shortly after Lai's inauguration as president, China launched "punishment" drills dubbed "Joint Sword - 2024A" around Taiwan in what it said was a response to "separatist acts", sending up heavily armed warplanes and staging mock attacks.

- In October 2024, China held one day of "Joint Sword - 2024B" war games around Taiwan in response to a national day speech by Lai. Taiwan said China used a record number of military aircraft in those exercises.

- In December 2024, Taiwan reported a large rise in Chinese air force and navy activity around the island and in waters in the region, though China never officially confirmed it was holding exercises.

- In April 2025, China held " Strait Thunder-2025 ", saying it was a "stern warning" against separatism.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:25:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7NRXODZ2ZKO5IELAYZ7U6B4UU.jpg?auth=8696306dbe01c73d3bfb33e06a18d2f019c38a5b4fb941de61f27f4b3b802c80&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zaporizhzhia power plant could restart in 18 months once the war ends, head says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/zaporizhzhia-power-plant-could-restart-18-months-once-war-ends-head-says-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:08 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>China's war games around Taiwan over the years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-war-games-around-taiwan-over-years-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:11 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Thailand's army says Cambodia violated truce with more than 250 drones</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251229-thailand-s-army-says-cambodia-violated-truce-with-more-than-250-drones</link><description>Thailand 's army on Monday accused Cambodia of violating a newly signed ceasefire agreement, reached after weeks of deadly border clashes, by flying more than 250 drones over its territory.

The Thai army said "more than 250 unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) were detected flying from the Cambodian side, intruding into Thailand's sovereign territory" on Sunday night, according to a statement.

"Such actions constitute provocation and a violation of measures aimed at reducing tensions, which are inconsistent with the Joint Statement agreed" during a bilateral border committee meeting on Saturday, it added.

Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn said in remarks aired on state television on Monday that the two sides had discussed the incident and agreed to investigate and "resolve it immediately".

Prak Sokhonn described it as "a small issue related to flying drones seen by both sides along the border line".

Thailand and Cambodia agreed to the "immediate" ceasefire on Saturday, pledging to end renewed border clashes that killed dozens of people and displaced more than a million this month.

The reignited fighting spread to nearly every border province on both sides, shattering an earlier truce for which US President Donald Trump took credit.

Under the agreement signed on Saturday, the Southeast Asian neighbours agreed to cease fire, freeze troop movements and co-operate on demining efforts and combatting cybercrime.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:26:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e7a98c9a-e498-11f0-892e-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25360527101264.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Ukraine should withdraw troops from Donbas, and a Putin-Trump call expected soon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kremlin-says-ukraine-should-withdraw-troops-donbas-putin-trump-call-expected-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the part of Donbas that it still controls if it wanted peace, and that if Kyiv did not strike a deal then it would lose yet more territory.

Putin and Trump spoke on Sunday ahead of Trump's meeting in Miami with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said another call was planned very soon.

Peskov refused to comment on the idea of a free economic zone in Donbas or on the future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, which is controlled by Russia, saying that the Kremlin felt it was inappropriate.

When asked about Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov's remarks about the decision that Kyiv needed to take on Donbas, Peskov said that Ukraine should withdraw its troops from the parts they still controlled.

"We are talking about the withdrawal of the regime's armed forces from the Donbas," Peskov said. When asked it that applied to the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions too, he refused to discuss details.

Russia currently controls a fifth of Ukraine, including Crimea which it annexed in 2014, about 90% of Donbas, 75% of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, and slivers of the Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions, according to Russian estimates.

Russia claims Donbas, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson as part of Russia, though most countries consider the regions to be part of Ukraine.

Peskov said no call between Putin and Zelenskiy was being discussed.

Peskov paraphrased Trump's remarks that Ukraine could lose more territory to Russia over coming months unless Kyiv struck a deal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 10:49:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SB7XZLJKLNJZPDNPOEUMI72S4M.jpg?auth=fd16f403ab4d121951b0fd7dcead01ca67230583a5c242c573234435c2f84321&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iraq's newly elected parliament holds first session</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iraqs-newly-elected-parliament-holds-first-session-2025-12-29/</link><description>BAGHDAD, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Iraq's newly elected parliament convened on Monday for its first session since the November national election, opening the way for lawmakers to begin the process of forming a new government.

The programme is aiming to reach around 55 million recipients by early January, Zulkifli Hasan told reporters after a meeting with government bodies to discuss food reserves for 2026.

The scheme was President Prabowo Subianto's flagship campaign promise in 2024, with the aim of distributing food to as many as 83 million school children and pregnant women, but it has been controversial due to its high costs and mounting food safety concerns.

Since its launch in January, more than 11,000 children nationwide have been affected by food poisoning, according to data from the agency overseeing the programme.

Prabowo had originally targeted the programme's full roll-out by the end of 2025. However, in October the target was scaled back to around 70 million as a result of a kitchen shortage.

Zulkifli did not explain why the targets have been scaled back again.

Indonesia has earmarked 171 trillion rupiah ($10.19 billion) for the programme this year under the original target, and the allocation for 2026 is set to be doubled to 335 trillion rupiah.

Hundreds of people surrounded the site at Muan International Airport where the Boeing (BA.N) , opens new tab 737-800 crash-landed without wheels deployed, slammed into the barrier and exploded into a fireball on December 29, 2024.

Relatives - who have said they are outraged by the lack of progress in finding out what went wrong - sobbed on Monday as they lit candles on a cake and sang 'Happy Birthday' for the 16 victims who were born in December.

"We will not stop until the truth is finally revealed and those responsible are held accountable so that the lives of the 179 were not lost for nothing," Kim Yu-jin, representing the families, said at a memorial service in the airport.

Addressing mourners, government officials and the Parliament speaker, Kim accused the government of focusing its energies on clearing up the aftermath of the crash rather than carrying out a proper investigation.

Relatives laid flowers on a memorial altar and looked on as the names of the dead were read out and displayed on a screen, written on cards in the shape of boarding tickets.

"I hope the investigation will be conducted thoroughly, so that those who deserve to be punished ... are punished,” Ryu Kum-Ji, who lost both her parents in the crash, told Reuters.

President Lee Jae Myung - who came to office six months after the disaster - apologised to the families in a statement earlier on Monday and said it was his duty to make sure there was no repeat of the tragedy.

"The disaster clearly revealed the systematic problems and limitations of our society," Lee said.

"What's needed now is not perfunctory promises or empty words but rather real change and action."

The government-led Aviation and Railway Accident Investigation Board has failed to meet a one-year deadline to release a report into the accident.

It said in a preliminary report in January that both of the plane's engines sustained bird strikes in an earlier approach to the airport.

In July, investigators said the left engine, which sustained less damage than the right one following the bird strikes, was shut down before the crash landing.

Few other details have emerged since then , with questions remaining about the design of the runway including the heavy embankment, and what actions the pilots may have taken in the last few minutes of the flight.

Representatives of the families have raised questions about the board's independence and expertise and said investigators appear to be blaming the pilots rather than looking into other factors.

Parliament has been reviewing a plan to overhaul the board.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:19:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQUOPCLLYFP4RCWEKWRSJ2RX6U.jpg?auth=7ef5075ddedbc119cbf9caaae973a8044a166e47e1e5b3c2bd4638bc8301ed7e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US pledges $2 billion in humanitarian support to UN, State Department says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-pledges-2-billion-humanitarian-support-un-state-department-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>GENEVA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The United States has made a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid, a U.S. State Department official said on Monday, following major foreign aid cuts by the Trump administration in 2025.

The U.S. slashed its aid spending this year, and leading Western donors such as Germany also pared back assistance as they pivoted to increased defense spending, triggering a severe funding crunch for the United Nations.

The U.S. is pledging to commit $2 billion in funding to the U.N. for humanitarian aid, the U.S. State Department official said. No further details were provided on how the money would be allocated or if additional pledges would follow.

U.N. data shows total U.S. humanitarian contributions to the U.N. fell to about $3.38 billion in 2025, equating to about 14.8% of the global sum. This was down sharply from $14.1 billion the prior year, and a peak of $17.2 billion in 2022.

Earlier in December, the United Nations launched a 2026 aid appeal for $23 billion to reach 87 million people at risk - half the $47 billion sought for 2025, reflecting plunging donor support despite record global needs.

U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher has said the U.N.'s humanitarian response is overstretched and underfunded, meaning "brutal choices" had to be made to prioritise those most in need.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:19:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IJR273B4RBNXHGOCXUMHN5YYW4.jpg?auth=33f6e1048905cd59dabbb9bcb82195072afa8c0e9925ef7fad0b7dfab27a8754&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Is peace in Ukraine any closer after Trump-Zelenskiy talks?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/is-peace-ukraine-any-closer-after-trump-zelenskiy-talks-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW/KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump met his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday and said the two were "maybe very close" to a deal to end the war with Russia.

But they gave few details on how the most contentious issues between the warring parties would be resolved, namely territorial concessions and security guarantees for Ukraine.

Here are some of the main sticking points after weeks of intense diplomacy:

Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, controls about 116,000 square km (44,800 square miles), or about 19.2%, of Ukrainian territory.

That is roughly 1.2% more than three years ago, according to pro-Ukrainian maps. Russia's forces have advanced in 2025 at the fastest pace since 2022.

Russia says Crimea, which Moscow annexed in 2014, the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk - together known as Donbas - plus Zaporizhzhia and Kherson are now legally part of Russia. Most of the international community says they were annexed illegally.

But Russia has not achieved its main aim of taking the whole of Donbas and on Monday it repeated demands that Ukraine withdraw from the area of Donetsk it still holds - about 5,000 square km - if it wants peace.

The Kremlin added that if Kyiv did not strike a deal it would lose more territory.

Kyiv rejects the idea of ceding territory it has been defending for nearly four years, saying it wants the fighting to be halted along current front lines.

Both Trump and Zelenskiy said on Sunday the future of Donbas had not been settled, although the U.S. president said discussions were "moving in the right direction."

Under its initial 28-point peace plan , the United States, seeking compromise, proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine left the area, although it remains unclear how any such zone would function in practice.

Russia also does not control all of Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, while it has taken small parts of Kharkiv, Sumy, Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk regions.

Russia's Kommersant newspaper reported that Putin said he might be open to swapping some territory controlled by Russian forces elsewhere in Ukraine in exchange for all of Donbas.

Ukraine, wary of failed assurances from allies in the past, says it needs robust security guarantees to prevent another Russian attack.

Zelenskiy said on Monday a draft peace framework to end Russia's war envisages U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine for 15 years. He added he had asked Trump to provide guarantees of up to 50 years.

Trump wants Europe to take on the lion's share of providing any guarantees, albeit with U.S. backing, although what form they take remains unclear. Russia, for example, has stated that any foreign troop deployment in Ukraine would be unacceptable.

Russia has also demanded caps on the size of Ukraine's army and protection for Russian speakers and Orthodox believers in Ukraine, and says Ukraine should be neutral.

Kyiv says Russian speakers are protected and that Ukraine adheres to EU legislation. Under a Ukrainian 20-point peace proposal , Ukraine would maintain its armed forces at their present strength of 800,000 personnel.

One of Putin's central demands for ending the war is that Western leaders pledge in writing to stop enlarging the U.S.-led military alliance NATO eastwards.

The initial U.S. peace proposals included a clause that NATO would not expand further, that Ukraine would enshrine in its constitution that it will not join NATO and that NATO would include in its statutes a provision that Ukraine will not be admitted in the future.

Ukraine would get short-term preferential access to the European market while its bid to join the European Union was being considered.

Under Ukraine's framework peace proposal, the United States, NATO and European countries would provide Ukraine with security guarantees that mirror Article 5, the mutual-defence clause of NATO's founding treaty.

The initial U.S. proposals state that Russia, under Western sanctions over the war, would be reintegrated into the global economy and invited to be part of the G8.

The United States said in its initial proposals that it will strike a long-term agreement with Russia to develop "energy, natural resources, infrastructure, artificial intelligence, data centres, rare-earth metal extraction projects in the Arctic, and other mutually beneficial corporate opportunities."

European Union leaders decided in December to borrow cash to loan 90 billion euros ($105 billion) to Ukraine to fund its defence against Russia for the next two years.

They decided not to use frozen Russian assets, sidestepping divisions over an unprecedented plan to finance Kyiv with Russian sovereign cash.

Peace moves could possibly entail Russia and the United States agreeing to resume talks on strategic nuclear arms control.

The future of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Ukrainian territory controlled by Russia, is unclear.

There has been media speculation that Russia might offer U.S. companies stakes in its vast natural resources sector.

Washington has floated the idea of holding elections in Ukraine. Putin says the Kyiv leadership lost legitimacy after refusing to hold elections when Zelenskiy's elected term expired. Kyiv says it cannot hold elections while under martial law and defending its territory against Russia.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 11:43:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HCPI5OLYDJJLNOSFEJJWP7GI5Q.jpg?auth=57c69ea45ff15746995f2d1e4c30125cc8b04f95a0698a58d09e7ed14238f555&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian shopkeepers protest, shut stores as currency hits record low</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-iranian-shopkeepers-protest-shut-shop-as-currency-hits-record-low</link><description>Iranian traders and shopkeepers staged a second day of protests Monday after the country’s currency plummeted to a new record low against the US dollar.

Videos on social media showed hundreds taking part in rallies in Saadi Street in downtown Tehran as well as in the Shush neighborhood near Tehran's main Grand Bazaar, which played a crucial role in the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ousted the monarchy and brought Islamists to power.

Witnesses told The Associated Press that traders shut their shops and asked others to do the same. The semiofficial ILNA news agency said many businesses and merchants stopped trading even though some kept their shops open.

There was no reports of police raids though security was tight at the protests, according to witnesses.

On Sunday, protest gatherings were limited to two major mobile market in downtown Tehran, where the demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans.

Iran 's rial on Sunday plunged to 1.42 million to the dollar. On Monday, it traded at 1.38 million rials to the dollar.

The rapid depreciation is compounding inflationary pressure, pushing up prices of food and other daily necessities and further straining household budgets, a trend that could worsen by a gasoline price change introduced in recent days.

According to the state statistics center, inflation rate in December rose to 42.2% from the same period last year, and is 1.8% higher than in November. Foodstuff prices rose 72% and health and medical items were up 50% from December last year, according to the statistics centre. Many critics see the rate a sign of an approaching hyperinflation.

Reports in official Iranian media said that the government plans to increase taxes in the Iranian new year that begins March 21 have caused more concern.

Iran’s currency was trading at 32,000 rials to the dollar at the time of the 2015 nuclear accord that lifted international sanctions in exchange for tight controls on Iran’s nuclear programme. That deal unraveled after US President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from it in 2018.

There is also uncertainty over the risk of renewed conflict following June’s 12-day war involving Iran and Israel . Many Iranians also fear the possibility of a broader confrontation that could draw in the United States, adding to market anxiety.

In September, the United Nations reimposed nuclear-related sanctions on Iran through what diplomats described as the “snapback” mechanism. Those measures once again froze Iranian assets abroad, halted arms transactions with Tehran and imposed penalties tied to Iran’s ballistic missile programme.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 12:46:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/cd09a586-e4b2-11f0-9085-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP22357588236786.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump-Zelenskiy talks yield no progress on Ukraine-Russia territorial issues</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-zelenskiy-talks-yield-no-progress-ukraine-russia-territorial-issues-2025-12-29/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russia and Ukraine on Monday remained far apart on territorial issues that are blocking a peace deal, despite progress on security guarantees for Kyiv at talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

Trump said after his talks with the Ukrainian president on Sunday that they were "getting a lot closer, maybe very close" to an agreement to end Russia's war in Ukraine but that "thorny issues" were still there.

Zelenskiy said two main issues outlined in a 20-point peace proposal remained to be resolved - control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Russian hands, and the fate of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine.

"Two questions remain: the station - how will the station operate? - and the territory," Zelenskiy told reporters on Monday.

Underlining how far apart Kyiv and Moscow are on territory, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Ukraine must withdraw its troops from the small part of Donbas that it still controls, and that Kyiv would lose more land if it did not agree to a deal.

"We are talking about the withdrawal of the regime's armed forces from the Donbas," Peskov said.

He said a call was planned soon between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, but did not say when.

Trump 's decision to hold talks with Zelenskiy in Florida on Sunday had widely raised hopes of at least some progress being made towards ending what has become Europe's deadliest conflict since World War Two.

Russia controls about a fifth of Ukraine, including the Crimean peninsula, which it annexed in 2014. It claims Donbas - comprising the Donetsk and Luhansk regions - as well as the Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, although they are all internationally recognised as Ukraine's sovereign territory.

Russia wants Kyiv to withdraw troops from parts of the Donetsk region it has failed to occupy in four years of war since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Kyiv wants fighting halted along current front lines, and Washington has proposed a free economic zone if Ukraine pulls troops back.

"There is no detailed concept for a free economic zone yet," Zelenskiy said.

Russia has rejected the idea of a ceasefire to allow a referendum to be held on any territorial concessions by Ukraine.

One sign of progress on Sunday came when Zelenskiy said a bilateral agreement had been reached on security guarantees for Kyiv although Trump said they were only 95% ready.

"I told (Trump) that we have been at war for almost 15 years, and would very much like the guarantees to be for longer," Zelenskiy said, adding that he had asked Trump to consider a security deal for up to 50 years.

Trump said on Sunday he expected European countries to "take over a big part" of that effort with U.S. backing. Agreement on such moves could be complicated as Russia has said any foreign troop deployment in Ukraine would be unacceptable.

French President Emmanuel Macron said progress was being made on security guarantees, and countries in the so-called "Coalition of the Willing" would meet in Paris in early January to "finalise concrete contributions".

Despite the recent peace overtures, and some exchanges of prisoners of war, mistrust runs deep between Ukraine and Russia.

Russia launched a heavy attack on Ukraine before the talks in Florida began, and has stepped up attacks on Ukraine's energy facilities as winter approached. Large parts of the capital Kyiv were without power on Monday after the strike as temperatures were below freezing.

Trump repeated on Sunday after his call with Putin that he believed the Russian leader wants the war to end.

"In my opinion, (Putin's) actions do not coincide with the seemingly peaceful rhetoric he uses in his dialogue with the U.S. president," Zelenskiy said, questioning Putin's commitment to peace.

Zelenskiy said he was open to any format of communication with Russia, and a meeting would be possible after Trump and European leaders agree on the framework for peace. Peskov said no call between Putin and Zelenskiy was being discussed.

Putin has said Russia will achieve its aims in Ukraine by force if Kyiv does not want to resolve the conflict diplomatically - making clear it must accept Moscow's demands.

Several Ukrainians who spoke to Reuters in Kyiv on Monday voiced scepticism about prospects for a lasting peace.

"Putin doesn't need territory; he doesn't need Donbas — he wants to destroy the Ukrainians. He destroys us as a nation," said Nadiia Yevtushenko, a 57-year-old Kyiv resident.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:37:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TIQQZVFAUZLC7AALHROSZIDXKY.jpg?auth=66d75f21ac9cddf8c0be51efbeb50922907b90bddc26584d1a68b7978fdcd493&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin amends law to let Russia ignore foreign criminal courts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/putin-amends-law-let-russia-ignore-foreign-criminal-courts-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed into law changes that give Russia the right to ignore judgements in criminal cases issued by foreign and international courts amid Ukrainian and European attempts to punish Moscow for its actions in Ukraine.

The move, which comes as U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to broker a peace deal in Ukraine, appears to be a response to several initiatives to go after Russian officials and military officers for alleged war crimes in Ukraine, something Moscow denies its forces are guilty of.

Ukraine and the Council of Europe human rights body signed an agreement in June forming the basis for a special tribunal, and Europe this month launched an International Claims Commission for Ukraine in an effort to ensure Kyiv is compensated for hundreds of billions of dollars in damage from Russian attacks and alleged war crimes.

The International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague has also issued arrest warrants for Putin and five other Russians, accusing them of illegally deporting hundreds of children from Ukraine.

The Kremlin, which called the ICC move outrageous, says the allegation is false and that Moscow has only acted to remove children from a conflict zone for their own safety.

Under the changes to Russian law backed by Putin on Monday, Moscow will formally have the right under its own domestic legislation to disregard rulings in criminal cases taken by foreign courts on behalf of foreign governments without Russia's participation.

Rulings issued by international legal bodies whose authority is not based on an international agreement with Russia or a U.N. Security Council resolution can also be ignored under the changes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U7BSDZTPBBKVTKVY2LY6FL77AI.jpg?auth=e83a7516e7fbcac2c3a4fe63a029031fd49270f21ee506d12950338fd6ed8bbc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo's 'political earthquake' election sees Kurti resurgent</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovos-political-earthquake-election-sees-kurti-resurgent-2025-12-29/</link><description>PRISTINA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - An emphatic election victory for Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti marks a resurgence for the nationalist leader, ending a political deadlock in Europe's youngest state and potentially determining its domestic and international agenda for years.

The win strengthens Kurti's mandate to push through domestic reforms, including welfare expansion and higher salaries for public workers, although he faces major problems including tensions with Serbia and health and education systems that lag Kosovo's Balkan neighbours.

With nearly all the votes counted, Kurti's Vetevendosje Party led with more than 49% of Sunday's vote, official results show, meaning he only requires some very small coalition partners to form a majority.

It signals a turnaround for Kurti, whose failure to win enough votes in the last poll in February or form a coalition with larger opposition parties meant that parliament did not function for most of 2025, an impasse that led to delays in the delivery of around 1 billion euros in international funding vital for one of Europe's poorest countries.

The exact outcome of another term for Kurti is unclear, but at stake is Kosovo's relations with its historic international allies, including the United States, and its attempts to join the European Union, which Kurti supports.

"It's a political earthquake that has shattered the opposition parties, and we are going to feel the consequences of this result for the next decade," said political commentator Ilir Deda.

"Kosovo has decided to replace this political pluralism with a model of very strong government and weak opposition, like other countries in the Western Balkans."

Sunday's poll took place over the holiday period when Kosovo's diaspora are typically at home in force, which may have aided Kurti, who was previously elected in 2021. According to an exit poll conducted by Ubo Consulting, 61.7% of people from the diaspora voted for the prime minister's party.

"We are tired of this nine-month blockade that has cost us our nerves, cost Kosovo millions of euros, and set back our development. With this result there is a solution, which is why we are happy," said Tahir Shabani, 58, who lives in Germany but returned to Pristina to vote.

Still, others wanted to see immediate changes after the impasse, especially in quality of life, healthcare, and education.

"Institutions must be established and the state must continue to function. We have a lot of work to do, just as the Prime Minister said. The budget must be approved, we must approve international agreements, and progress must be made," said Pristina voter, Skender Halimi, 52.

Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 with U.S. backing, including a 1999 NATO bombing campaign against Serbian forces trying to crush an uprising by the 90% ethnic Albanian majority.

Despite international support, the country of 1.6 million has struggled with poverty, instability and organised crime. While over 100 countries recognise Kosovo's statehood, Serbia, Greece, Spain, Russia and many others do not.

Tensions with Serbia flared violently in 2023, prompting the EU to impose sanctions on Kosovo - in part due to Kurti's policies against the Serb minority that still live in northern Kosovo. The measures likely cost Kosovo .

While that hit Kurti's reputation at home and abroad, the EU said it would lift the sanctions just as campaigning began this month.

"I think the electorate interpreted it as a sign that there are no problems between the Kurti government and the West," Deda said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PPYKFGOLEJN2HDWAWGTCAOZ264.jpg?auth=dc342393df8f9eb949db09b8af8bf9250e4c5f47e0f2f2ff7d019c7011d173eb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>British boxer Joshua hurt in fatal car crash in Nigeria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sports/briton-joshua-hurt-fatal-car-crash-nigeria-local-paper-reports-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - British former heavyweight boxing champion Anthony Joshua was involved in a car accident in Nigeria's Ogun State that killed two people, local police said on Monday.

The three eastern Mediterranean nations have drawn closer over the past decade through joint military drills, defence procurement and energy cooperation, developments closely watched by regional rival Turkey.

Greece’s armed forces general staff (GEETHA) said senior military officials from the three countries signed a joint action plan for defence cooperation last week in Cyprus. It gave no further details.

The deal follows a meeting in Jerusalem between Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at which they signed a deal to strengthen maritime security cooperation and advance energy interconnection projects.

A senior Greek official familiar with the matter said the military deal would encompass joint naval and air exercises and the transfer of know-how from Israel to Greece and Cyprus to address both “asymmetrical” and “symmetrical” threats.

“Greece and Israel will intensify joint exercises after the ceasefire in Gaza , with Cyprus participating,” the official said, adding that Greece plans to join Israel’s Noble Dina naval exercise in the coming months in the eastern Mediterranean.

There was no immediate comment from the Cypriot government, but a key opposition party, the Communist AKEL, expressed misgivings. "Mr Christodoulides proceeds to deepen military-political cooperation with Israel without considering the risks and consequences of this choice," it said in a statement.

Greece and Cyprus have already purchased missile systems from Israel worth billions of euros. Athens is also in talks to buy from Israel medium- and long-range anti-aircraft and anti-ballistic missile systems for a planned multi-layer air and drone defence system known as the “Achilles Shield”, estimated to cost about 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

This month, the Greek parliament approved the purchase of 36 PULS rocket artillery systems from Israel to bolster defences along Greece’s northeastern border with Turkey and on Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.

"Tomorrow ... scheduled flights, including about 296 international departures, around 265 international arrivals and roughly 296 transit flights," will be affected, the administration said, adding it anticipated the hitches would snarl travel for "more than 100,000 passengers".

China's military on Monday dispatched air, navy and rocket troops to conduct joint military drills around the island of Taiwan, a move Beijing called a “stern warning” against separatist and “external interference” forces. Taiwan said it was placing its forces on alert and called the Chinese government “the biggest destroyer of peace".

The first of two days of drills came after Beijing expressed anger at US arms sales to the territory and a statement by Japan’s prime minister, Sanae Takaichi , saying its military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan, the self-governing island that the world’s second-biggest economy says must come under its rule. The Chinese military did not mention the United States and Japan in its statement on Monday morning.

Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said in a post on X that rapid response exercises were under way, with forces on high alert to defend the island. In a separate statement, it said it had deployed appropriate forces in response, conducting combat readiness drills.

“The Chinese Communist Party’s targeted military exercises further confirm its nature as an aggressor and the biggest destroyer of peace,” the ministry said.

Senior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson of China's People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command, said the drills would be conducted in the Taiwan Strait and areas to the north, southwest, southeast and east of the island.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 13:38:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/db87c414-e4b5-11f0-ae4e-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24276120271264-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hamas confirms deaths this year of armed wing spokesperson Abu Ubaida and Gaza chief Sinwar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-confirms-deaths-this-year-armed-wing-spokesperson-abu-ubaida-gaza-chief-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Hamas confirmed on Monday that its armed wing spokesperson, Abu Ubaida, and then Gaza chief Mohammed Sinwar were killed in the Gaza war earlier this year.

The actress, who became a symbol of 1950s and 60s France, made her home in the resort where she said she found solace among animals and dedicated her life to their welfare.

"She was lovely, lovely, there's no other word. Yes, we will really miss her," Saint-Tropez resident Philippe Volmier told Reuters on Monday.

Volmier said he had known her for 30 years and used to see her walking her dogs on the beach. "One time, she fell into the water with her dog. I had to pick her out," he added. "She was a friend who helped people a lot."

President Emmanuel Macron said on Sunday Bardot embodied "a life of freedom". "A French existence, a universal radiance. She moved us. We mourn a legend of the century," he added.

For much of the latter part of her life, she lived alone behind high walls in the resort, surrounded by a menagerie of cats, dogs and horses.

She told French weekly Paris Match in 2024 that she wanted to be buried in her garden.

The Var Prefecture told Reuters it had not received any request for a private burial, which would have been needed to bury her in her garden.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:49:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KRLTKBNT7VIFJOA24XKFQDILXY.jpg?auth=882a7b9e7e9c27d9e1769f8f619ca19b0ffb61d7fda831c5a03a7dad7bdefaa2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Aid workers find little life in Sudan's al-Fashir after paramilitary takeover</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/aid-workers-find-little-life-sudans-al-fashir-after-paramilitary-takeover-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 - International aid staff who accessed Sudan's al-Fashir for the first time since its takeover by a paramilitary force found the city largely deserted, with a few people sheltering in buildings or under plastic sheets, a senior U.N. official said on Monday.

More than 100,000 are estimated to have fled al-Fashir since late October after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces took control there following an 18-month siege that plunged the city into famine.

Survivors reported ethnically-motivated mass killings and widespread detentions during and after the takeover. Many people remain unaccounted for in al-Fashir and surrounding areas.

In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Denise Brown, the U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Sudan, described al-Fashir as a "crime scene".

"The town was not teeming with people. There were very few people that (they) were able to see," she said, describing a visit to al-Fashir by U.N. staff on Friday that lasted several hours.

U.N. requirements of safe passage and free movement took weeks to negotiate, despite RSF attempts to portray the city as back to normal soon after its takeover.

Brown said it was not possible to give a precise number of those remaining in al-Fashir. Those who U.N. staff did see were living inside empty buildings or in rudimentary camps using basic plastic sheets.

There was a small market functioning, but with few items, mainly locally grown vegetables.

"We have photos of people, and you can see clearly on their faces the accumulation of fatigue, of stress, of anxiety, of loss," Brown said.

Other aid workers have previously said that those remaining are most likely those too old, sick, or injured to leave.

Satellite imagery from December 16 analysed by the Yale Humanitarian Research Lab showed signs of the removal of bodies but few signs of life.

At the Saudi Hospital , which the World Health Organization says was the site of a massacre of 460 people, Brown said medical personnel were observed, but they had no supplies.

Brown said villages around the city appeared to be deserted.

The attack on al-Fashir was one of the most violent episodes of a war that has raged since April 2023 between the RSF and the Sudanese army. It allowed the RSF to consolidate control over the Darfur region in Sudan's west, a push that continued in the northwest of the state this month.

Brown said Friday's visit was aimed at assessing whether al-Fashir could be accessed safely as the U.N. looks into what basic supplies can go in. "But to be honest, we're still very concerned about those who are injured, who we didn't see, those who may be detained," she said.

Later visits will look at water and sanitation, she said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:50:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KMVVSRF2UJKBXCMM37GA4NAOOE.jpg?auth=3cc228b8c3dde4a0b324932542609aa81329f9a64a9a92bb786008b6990b5264&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>First UN visit to Sudan's El-Fasher finds traumatised civilians amid reports of mass atrocities</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251229-first-un-visit-to-sudan-el-fasher-finds-traumatised-civilians-amid-reports-mass-atrocities-rsf</link><description>A small UN humanitarian team was able to visit Sudan 's El-Fasher, a city that fell to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in October amid reports of mass atrocities. They found traumatised civilians living without water or sanitation in a city haunted by famine, according to UN aid coordinator Denise Brown.

El-Fasher fell to the paramilitary RSF in October after more than 500 days of siege, and last Friday a small UN humanitarian team was able to make its first short visit in almost two years.

The capture of the city was reportedly accompanied by mass atrocities, including massacres, torture and sexual violence. Satellite pictures reviewed by AFP show what appear to be mass graves.

Brown described the city as a "crime scene", but said investigations would be carried out by human rights experts while her office focuses on restoring aid to the survivors.

"We weren't able to see any of the detainees, and we believe there are detainees," she said.

From a humanitarian point of view, she said, El-Fasher remains Sudan's "epicentre of human suffering" and the city – which once held more than a million people – is still facing a famine.

"El-Fasher is a ghost of its former self," Brown said in an interview.

"We don't have enough information yet to conclude how many people remain there, but we know large parts of the city are destroyed. The people who remain, their homes have been destroyed."

"These people are living in very precarious situations," warned Brown, a Canadian diplomat and the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator in Sudan.

"Some of them in abandoned buildings. Some of them... in very rudimentary conditions, plastic sheeting, no sanitation, no water. So these are very undignified, unsafe conditions for people."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 14:51:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1964d254-e4c0-11f0-8e41-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25338411988211.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin tells army to press on with campaign to take southern Ukrainian region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/putin-tells-army-press-with-campaign-take-southern-ukrainian-region-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin on Monday told his army to press on with a campaign to take full control of the Zaporizhzhia region in southern Ukraine after a Russian commander said Moscow's forces were 15 kilometres (9.3 miles) from its biggest city.

Putin made the comments a day after speaking to U.S. President Donald Trump about the prospects for a peace deal in Ukraine and was speaking at a televised Kremlin meeting with top military commanders and Andrei Belousov, the defence minister.

Colonel-General Mikhail Teplinsky, commander of Russia's Dnieper military grouping, told Putin that Russian forces were getting closer to the city of Zaporizhzhia, which had a pre-war population of over 700,000 people.

The wider Zaporizhzhia region - which Moscow controls around 75% of - is one of four Ukrainian provinces which Putin claimed as part of Russia in 2022, a move denounced by Kyiv and many Western countries as an illegal land grab.

"Frontline (Russian) units are located about 15 kilometres from the southern outskirts of the city of Zaporizhzhia," Teplinsky told Putin who responded:

"We understand and are aware that the enemy directly opposite you has been preparing its defence for many years, and we know how difficult the situation is there. But nevertheless, you are managing to accomplish the tasks facing the grouping."

The Kremlin chief told Teplinsky that he wanted more of the same.

"In the near future, it is necessary to continue the offensive, together with the East grouping to liberate Zaporizhzhia," said Putin.

General Valery Gerasimov, the chief of Russia's General Staff, had earlier told Putin that Moscow's forces were advancing along nearly the entire front line, while Kyiv's forces were focused on defence and attempting to counter attack.

Gerasimov reported that Russian forces in 2025 had captured 6,640 square kilometres (2,563 square miles) of territory in Ukraine, including 334 villages, and that advances notched up in December were the fastest this year.

Lavrov said that on Dec. 28-29, Ukraine had attacked the Russian president's state residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range drones which were all destroyed by Russian air defences.

"Such reckless actions will not go unanswered," Lavrov said, adding that the attack amounted to "state terrorism."

He said that targets had already been selected for retaliatory strikes by Russia's armed forces.

Lavrov noted that the attack took place during negotiations about a possible Ukrainian peace deal and that while Russia would not leave the negotiations, Moscow's position will be reviewed.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the accusation was a lie, adding that Moscow was preparing the ground to strike government buildings in Kyiv.

Brian Cole, 30, of Virginia admitted to planting the devices , neither of which exploded, outside the headquarters of the Democratic and Republican national committees following his arrest earlier this month , according to the filing, which was made public on Sunday.

Cole told FBI agents “something just snapped” and that he wanted to do something “to the parties” because of their influence in U.S. politics, adding “I really don’t like either party at this point,” according to excerpts of his interview cited in the filing.

Prosecutors revealed new details about the investigation as they argued that Cole should be detained while awaiting a trial. A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in Washington federal court.

Cole is facing two explosives-related charges. He has not yet entered a plea.

Cole’s arrest nearly five years after the incident came after top officials at the FBI ordered a fresh look at a case that had long vexed investigators and became fodder for right-wing theories tied to the Capitol riot.

Cole denied in the FBI interview that the placement of the bombs on January 5, 2021 was connected to the certification of the election in Congress on the following day.

The pipe bombs were not discovered until about 1 p.m. on January 6, diverting police resources just as a mob of supporters of President Donald Trump surged into the Capitol.

He initially denied planting the devices, telling the FBI that he had been in Washington to attend a protest to support Trump's false claims that his defeat in the 2020 election was the result of rampant voter fraud.

Cole told the FBI that powerful people needed to speak out if “something as important as voting in the federal election is being tampered with.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:27:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VAJWJVTBVNNW7A2LU2CNZ4444E.jpg?auth=4ef2a32979395681a8ac49221a00bf365b263e4d5ac0af92f76922db1948d8c1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egyptian-British activist apologises for past social media posts as police launch review</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/egyptian-british-activist-apologises-past-social-media-posts-police-launch-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Activist Alaa Abd el-Fattah, freed from prison in Egypt and now in Britain, apologised on Monday for his "shocking and hurtful" social media posts made more than a decade ago, which counter terrorism police said they are assessing.

Abd el-Fattah, 44, became Egypt's most prominent political prisoner after spending years in and out of detention and a rare symbol of opposition during a crackdown under President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

He arrived in Britain last Friday after obtaining British citizenship in 2021 through his mother, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was "delighted" by the news.

In the following days, British newspapers ran stories about posts he made on the former Twitter platform between 2008 and 2014, seen by Reuters, which endorsed violence against "Zionists" and police.

In another he called British people "dogs and monkeys".

Counter Terrorism Policing said the posts were being assessed following referrals from the public.

In a statement, Abd el-Fattah said many of his tweets had been misunderstood but that others were unacceptable.

"Looking at the tweets now - the ones that were not completely twisted out of their meaning - I do understand how shocking and hurtful they are, and for that I unequivocally apologise," he said.

He added they were mostly "expressions of a young man's anger and frustrations" at wars in Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza, and "the rise of police brutality against Egyptian youth."

Nigel Farage, leader of the right-wing Reform UK party which tops opinion polls, called for Abd el-Fattah's deportation. Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the opposition Conservative Party, said the country should consider it.

A spokesperson for Starmer said he was not aware of the tweets when he campaigned for Abd el-Fattah's release and called the comments "abhorrent".

But the spokesperson added the government has a record of helping its citizens overseas.

The Board of Deputies of British Jews said his posts were of "profound concern."

Abd el-Fattah was most recently serving a five-year sentence in Egypt imposed in December 2021, after he shared a social media post about a prisoner's death.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:28:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QK76DQG2HVNC5LEUBHVEPACXME.jpg?auth=5cf49f84ff6c118c612ab2b6e20b24978573a6b58d7e099e4cda93131f6cf9fd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Egyptian-British activist apologises for past social media posts as police launch review</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/egyptian-british-activist-apologises-past-social-media-posts-police-launch-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:28:42 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>External power line to Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant has been restored, management says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/external-power-line-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-plant-has-been-restored-management-says-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - An external power link has been restored to the Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station in Ukraine after the completion of repairs, the plant's Russian management said on Monday.

A statement said the line had been put out of action by "fire from the Ukrainian armed forces". Repairs were carried out with monitors present from the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. It said the situation at the plant was under control, with normal radiation levels.

The station is connected to the power grid by two lines -- the second had remained in operation through the repair work.

In September and October, the plant was without external power for 30 days, relying on backup diesel generators, until a damaged line was reconnected during a local ceasefire arranged with the IAEA's help.

Russian forces seized the nuclear plant, Europe's largest, in the early weeks of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine and each side regularly accuses the other of actions endangering safety there.

The plant is not producing electricity but relies on external power to keep nuclear fuel cool and avoid a meltdown.

The future of the plant's operations is one of the sticking points in talks to resolve the nearly four-year-old conflict pitting Moscow against Kyiv.

Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in December that the U.S. had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:50:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TPR4EJB3NRP77ORUJE5FNMEOIM.jpg?auth=a0634d7c12f492c874fb792d5fe4458a35783a0f2b08ba7516bf8f6e698dba89&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin told Trump that Russia's position will change after Ukrainian drone attack on residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-told-trump-that-russias-position-will-change-after-ukrainian-drone-attack-2025-12-29/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin told U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday that Russia would review its position in peace negotiations after what Moscow said was a Ukrainian drone attack on a Russian presidential residence, the Kremlin said.

Ukraine has dismissed the Russian statements that 91 drones attacked Putin's residence in northern Russia as lies, and has accused Moscow of attempting to undermine the peace talks.

Kremlin foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov said that Putin and Trump spoke on Monday and that Putin was briefed by Trump and his senior advisers about the negotiations with Ukraine.

Putin informed Trump about the drone attack on the Russian presidential residence and told Trump that Russia was reviewing its position as a result.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:50:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PW5AWIDFMZN5ZOR3PTWEWWYF6A.jpg?auth=85375f54a0d5bf4dd2f6392668a69014a793937e5750cb25fff4216c7bf77e49&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S. could block asylum on public health grounds under Trump regulation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-could-block-asylum-public-health-grounds-under-trump-regulation-2025-12-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. could deny migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border access to asylum under a newly finalized regulation drafted during the COVID-19 pandemic in President Donald Trump's first term.

The regulation, which goes into effect on Wednesday, allows U.S. authorities to bar asylum based on "emergency public health concerns generated by a communicable disease," according to a copy posted in the Federal Register on Monday.

The restrictions would not have any immediate effect but would provide the Trump administration with another tool to turn away would-be asylum seekers at the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of migrants caught crossing illegally dropped to the lowest levels in decades after Trump took office in January and implemented a sweeping asylum ban at the border.

When COVID-19 took root in 2020 during Trump's first term, his administration used a U.S. health authority known as Title 42 to rapidly expel migrants crossing the border back to Mexico, saying it was needed to limit the spread of the virus. Former President Joe Biden, a Democrat who followed Trump in 2021, kept the Title 42 restrictions in place until 2023 , partly due to legal challenges that stalled attempts to end it.

Advocates have criticized the use of health emergencies to broadly deny access to asylum, saying U.S. law has been twisted to fulfill Trump's goal of turning away migrants.

"Considering the large amount of discretion the regulation grants the administration, and the president’s hyperfixation on immigration enforcement, we can expect this new authority to be overused and abused," said Sarah Pierce, director of social policy at the center-left group Third Way.

The Biden administration postponed the effective date of the regulation five times, but did not take steps to terminate it.

In addition to asylum, the measure also allows federal agencies to deny another form of protection known as "withholding of removal."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:50:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D36XCNWKNZIWXKBFJN57YSPP6Y.jpg?auth=9e52782b4c66d7612badbe21c4628c8da1a294ea8d47f7e9a8677b61fd6197c7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine bonds at post-restructuring highs as investors see some progress in peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-bonds-post-restructuring-highs-investors-see-some-progress-peace-talks-2025-12-29/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Ukraine's government bonds rallied on Monday as investors saw some positive signs in talks on a deal to end the war with Russia, with some bonds hitting their highest since emerging from last year's $20 billion sovereign debt restructuring.

There was progress on security guarantees for Kyiv at talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday but Russia and Ukraine on Monday remained far apart on the main territorial issues blocking a peace agreement.

Ukraine's bonds have surged in the last 1-1/2 months amid a renewed push to halt the near four-year-old war and most added another 1 cent on the dollar , , , on Monday, following a busy weekend of diplomacy.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy were now "getting a lot closer, maybe very close " to an agreement to end the war.

Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a call on Monday with Moscow also saying Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's Dolgiye Borody, or Long Beards, residence in northern Russia, an accusation that Kyiv denied.

Hopes for peace have been repeatedly dashed over the last year, but the moves in Ukraine's bonds have signalled renewed optimism, among investors at least, that a truce might now be within reach.

Monday's gains notably left Ukraine's 4.5% coupon 2034 and 2035 bonds - two of its most widely-traded - almost exactly where they were in early February before Trump's branding of Zelenskiy as a "dictator" and then scolding of him in the Oval Office triggered a major collapse in prices.

The bonds have also been boosted over the last six weeks by plans for a new four-year, $8.2 billion International Monetary Fund programme and a 90 billion euro ($105.83 billion) European Union loan to shore up the government's finances.

Kyiv has also just struck a long-awaited deal to replace the so-called 'GDP warrants' that helped it clinch is 2015 post-Crimea annexation debt restructuring, but had risked draining its finances once the current war ends.

Despite their widespread gains, not all of Ukraine's bonds are above or back to their early February highs.

Two where the payments are linked to the country's future economic growth rather than via regular coupons, and that won't mature for at least another 10 years , , remain well below, at roughly 57 cents on the dollar, compared to almost 70 cents back in February.

The confirmation of the visit follows a report published on Monday by British newspaper The Telegraph that said Milei planned to visit Britain.

The president's office did not provide details on the purpose of the visit or who Milei would meet with.

The Telegraph said that Milei confirmed in an interview that talks had begun to lift a ban on weapons sales stemming from the conflict over the British-run Falkland Islands.

Milei has previously maintained that Argentina should try to take back the islands, known in Argentina as the Islas Malvinas, through diplomatic channels.

Argentina has long claimed sovereignty over the islands, which Britain and Argentina fought a war over in 1982. The islands are in the South Atlantic about 600 kilometers from the Argentine mainland.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JYDEIPIUHRK55OEHM5SDJN546A.jpg?auth=8a32c0bca714c40a95f585fd06b169a17ff192e20c0a4ae255a73e0cd55a9435&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine bonds at post-restructuring highs as investors see some progress in peace talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-bonds-post-restructuring-highs-investors-see-some-progress-peace-talks-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:15 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Argentina's Milei to visit UK this year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/argentinas-milei-visit-uk-this-year-2025-12-29/</link><description /><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:16 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Hamas armed wing confirms spokesman Abu Obeida killed by Israeli strike in August</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-hamas-armed-wing-confirms-spokesman-abu-obeida-killed-by-israeli-strike-august</link><description>Hamas 's armed wing confirmed on Monday the death of its spokesperson, Abu Obeida, months after Israel announced he had been killed in an air strike in Gaza.

The Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades released a video statement on its Telegram channel, saying: "We pause in reverence before... the masked man loved by millions... the great martyred commander and spokesperson of the Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida."

Israel previously announced it had killed Abu Obeida in a strike on Gaza on August 30.

During the war, Abu Obeida, whose real name was Hudhayfa Samir al-Kahlout, emerged as a central figure eagerly awaited by Gazans, as well as by Arab and international media, for official statements from Hamas's military wing, particularly those related to prisoner-exchange operations.

Born on February 11, 1985, and raised in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza, Abu Obeida joined Hamas at an early age before becoming a member of the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades.

He later became the group's sole spokesman, delivering video statements in military uniform with his face consistently concealed by a red keffiyeh.

He had been the target of multiple Israeli assassination attempts.

According to Hamas officials, Abu Obeida embodied what they describe as "resistance" and was known for fiery and impactful speeches, many of which included threats against Israel or announcements of military operations.

"For many years, only a very small circle of Hamas officials knew his true identity," a Hamas official told AFP.

Israel has decimated Hamas's leadership, saying it seeks to eradicate the group following Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war.

The video announcing Abu Obeida's death was delivered by a masked man dressed in the former spokesperson's distinctive style, who said he would adopt his predecessor's name for future statements.

In the same video, he also announced the deaths of four other Hamas commanders in Israeli attacks during the war.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 16:51:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fded5282-e4d1-11f0-b132-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP100326133624.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What's next for Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251229-what-next-for-ukraine-zaporizhzhia-nuclear-power-plant-russia-peace-plan</link><description>The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant , Europe's largest, is one of the main sticking points in the US peace plan to end the war between Russia and Ukraine. The issue is one of 20 points laid out by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a framework peace plan that he discussed with his American counterpart Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday.

Here are some of the issues regarding the facility:

Russia took control of the plant, which lies close to the front ​lines, in March 2022 and announced plans to connect it to its power grid.

Almost all countries consider that it belongs to Ukraine but Russia says it is owned by Russia ‍and a unit of Russia's state-owned Rosatom nuclear corporation runs the plant.

Zelensky stated in December that the US had proposed joint trilateral operation of the nuclear power plant with an American chief manager.

Zelensky said the Ukrainian proposal envisages Ukrainian-American use of the plant, with the US itself determining how ​to use 50% of the energy produced.

Russia has considered joint Russian-US use of the plant, according to the Kommersant newspaper.

After his talks with Zelenskiy on ​Sunday, Trump said negotiators had made progress on deciding the fate of the plant, which can "start up almost immediately". The US president said "it's a big step" that Russia had not bombed the facility.

The plant is located in Enerhodar on the banks of the Dnipro River and the Kakhovka Reservoir, 550 km (342 miles) southeast of the capital Kyiv.

The Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant has six Soviet-designed reactors with a total capacity of 5.7 gigawatts, according to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) database.

It is not currently producing electricity but relies on external power to keep the nuclear material cool and avoid a meltdown.

The plant's equipment is powered by electricity supplied from Ukraine. Over the past four years these supplies have been interrupted at least 11 times due to breaks in power lines, forcing the plant to switch to emergency diesel generators.

Both Russia and Ukraine accuse each other of striking the nuclear plant and of severing power lines ‍leading to it.

IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi says fighting a war around a nuclear plant has put nuclear safety and security in constant jeopardy.

The Russian head of the station said on Monday the facility could restart power generation by mid-2027 if the war concluded soon.

Russia has been preparing to restart the station but says that doing so will depend on the situation in the area. Rosatom chief Alexei Likhachev has not ruled out the supply of electricity produced there to parts of Ukraine.

Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said Moscow intended to use the plant to cover a significant energy deficit in ‌Russia's south.

In December, Russia's Federal Service for Environmental, Technological and Nuclear Supervision issued a license for the operation of reactor No. 1, a key step towards restarting the reactor.

Ukraine's energy ministry called the move illegal and irresponsible, risking a nuclear accident.

Russia has been pummelling Ukraine's energy infrastructure throughout the war. In ‍recent months, Russia has sharply increased the scale and intensity of its attacks, plunging entire regions into darkness.

Analysts say Ukraine's generation capacity deficit is about 4 gigawatts, or the equivalent of four Zaporizhzhia reactors.

Kharchenko says it would take Ukraine five to seven years to build the generating capacity to compensate for the loss of the Zaporizhzhia plant.

Kharchenko said that if Kyiv regained control of the plant, it would take at least two to three years to understand what condition it was in and another three years to restore the equipment and return it to full operation.

Both Ukrainian state nuclear operator Energoatom and Kharchenko said Ukraine did not know the real condition of the nuclear power plant today.

In the long term, there is the unresolved problem of the lack of water resources to cool the reactors after the vast Kakhovka hydro-electric dam was blown up in 2023, destroying the reservoir that supplied water ‍to the plant.

Besides reactors, there are spent fuel pools at each reactor site used to cool down used nuclear fuel. Without water supply to the pools, the water evaporates and temperatures increase, risking fire.

An emission of hydrogen from a spent fuel ‌pool caused an explosion in Japan's Fukushima ​nuclear disaster in 2011.

Energoatom said the level of the Zaporizhzhia power plant cooling pond had dropped by more than 15%, or 3 metres, since the destruction of the dam, and continued to fall.

Ukrainian officials previously said the available water reserves may be sufficient to operate one or, at most, two nuclear reactors.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 17:22:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/75da110e-9ec8-11f0-91d6-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-09-30T193638Z-1410058750-RC2GJ1AWM0PS-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-ZAPORIZHZHIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria: Construction of new tunnels in Raqqa sparks fears of renewed conflict</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251229-syria-construction-new-tunnels-raqqa-sparks-fears-renewed-conflict</link><description>Raqqa , located on the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in northeast Syria , has experienced every stage of the war in Syria. It was the first large city to join the uprising against former president Bashar al-Assad in 2013. Then, it was taken over by the Islamic State group in 2014, becoming its de facto capital. In October 2017, after a destructive campaign led by an international coalition, the town was taken back by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

However, many of its residents now say that they are worried. Images and videos taken since spring 2025 show heavy machinery being used to dig the entrances to tunnels in a number of residential areas. So far, there has been no official explanation given by local authorities, who are affiliated with the SDF.

This construction is taking place as the December 31 expiration date approaches quickly for the deal signed on March 10, 2025, between the SDF and the Syrian government. The agreement was meant to establish the progressive integration of the Kurds’ civil and military institutions into the central government.

Analysts say that there are two possible outcomes. Either the deal will be extended in the hopes that the SDF can be integrated into the national government, or the new Syrian government may launch an offensive to recapture the areas under SDF control.

Several people died when clashes between the SDF and the Syrian government forces broke out on December 22 in Aleppo .

Salamah (not his real name) lives in Raqqa and has been observing the recent activity with trepidation.

“After the agreement was signed last March between the SDF and the new Syrian government, I noticed that I was seeing more and more tunnel entrances in the city’s streets. Wherever I go, I see workers coming out of these openings.

The sound of digging is audible even when you are inside your house because these tunnels go under civilian residences.

Back in May, there was a collapse on al-Wadi street . Dozens of families have left the al-Firdous neighbourhood because of the construction of tunnels. This neighbourhood is strategic because it sits above the rest of the city.”

Salamah says that there are at least 30 visible tunnel entrances in the city. Workers involved in the excavation work come and go from some of the tunnel entrances, in particular those near Raqqa’s National Hospital.

A video published on April 6 shows excavation work being carried out near the entrance to the National Hospital. You can see three workers gathering around a winch positioned on a metal frame. At a certain point in the video, one of the workers seems to disappear into a hole.

The mounds of earth visible in the image look like what is removed when a tunnel is dug out. The metal frame is what is known in Syria as a “raf‘a”: you affix a motor onto it and then use it to lower down a wheelbarrow then lift it back up filled with dug-out earth.

Aside from the building site near the National Hospital, people also observed other sites near Al-Mawasi Hospital , near the city’s municipal stadium and in residential neighbourhoods , as shown in the photos posted online. Local people were able to verify the authenticity of the images for us.

A photo published on Facebook on June 11, 2025, shows a truck carrying concrete supports . The caption explains that the blocks will be used to provide reinforcements for Raqqa’s tunnels. Another post, this one from November 9, 2025, shows the SDF opening a centre for making concrete blocks in Al-Aqtan Place, in the north of the city. Residents say that the centre is in constant operation.

Our team reached out to the SDF officials to ask them about the existence, the nature and the goals of the tunnels dug in the city of Raqqa. They had not responded to our questions by the time of publication.

According to an analyst specialised in the region, these building sites are part of an old strategy often used in zones under the control of the SDF. Back in 2014, it was adopted by the YPG, the Syrian Kurdish militia, whose full name is the People’s Protection Units.

“The People's Protection Units (YPG) started to dig tunnels beginning in mid-2014 in the region of Hassaké when the region was being bombarded with Turkish strikes. Initially, the aim was to protect themselves from the Turkish planes. [After the SDF was created in 2015], digging operations intensified in all the regions under their control, including Manbij, Afrin and Hassaké.”

According to another analyst, based in Raqqa, the building work began to accelerate after March 2025, despite the deal reached with Damascus . He said the building sites are being run by entrepreneurs – most of them Kurdish – who responded to a call for applications. He describes the creation of a giant, regional subterranean network.

“The tunnels have been dug in order to prepare for urban fighting, to fortify positions and to build secret passages that allow for mobility during military clashes. The tunnels are divided into three categories: there are galleries meant for the displacement of personnel, corridors that are large enough to allow vehicles to pass and still other tunnels are meant to be used as shelters and command centres.

Because the tunnels are connected, the collapse of just one could lead to the collapse of dozens of buildings and lead to mass civilian casualties.”

Locals say there is a palpable disquiet. Salamah explained this to us.

“I have the sense that the SDF is preparing the city for some kind of resistance. Like many other residents, I fear a new war.”

Another city resident, whom we are calling Qassem, says that he is worried about the structural integrity of the buildings with tunnels under them:

“The situation is frightening. A few months ago, the SDF kicked out a family living near Raqqa’s municipal stadium because they wanted to create a tunnel starting in a room in their house.

It’s catastrophic. The tunnels are everywhere – under mosques, hospitals, public gardens. All of that seems to indicate preparation for a military confrontation with the army.”

Raqqa’s predominantly sandy soil sits close to the groundwater table. It’s also an area prone to seismic activity. All of this frightens residents. Collapses are common.

Photos posted on November 15 show a collapse in a residential neighbourhood near Al-Furusiyah, located to the north of the city. Locals blamed the collapse on tunnels under the ground.

Trump made the comments on Friday, December 26 in an interview with John Catsimatidis, a billionaire talk show host, on the WABC radio station in New York. They were discussing Washington's campaign to target vessels in the Caribbean and off the coast of Venezuela suspected of trafficking drugs to the U.S.

"They have a big plant or a big facility where the ships come from,” Trump said on the radio show. “Two nights ago we knocked that out.”

If Trump's statement is accurate, it would mark the first known U.S. land attack related to the administration’s campaign against Venezuela.

Trump did not say which facility the U.S. had targeted, nor did he make clear if this operation was conducted by a branch of the military or some other entity. Trump has previously said that he has authorized the CIA to carry out covert operations in Venezuela.

The Central Intelligence Agency, the White House and the Pentagon have not publicly elaborated on Trump’s comments and declined to comment on questions posed by Reuters. It is unusual for the administration to decline to address questions related to on-the-record statements made by Trump, especially about Venezuela.

The Venezuelan government has not commented on the incident Trump described and there have been no independent reports from Venezuela of it.

The administration has previously touted its success in taking out suspected drug trafficking vessels. The Pentagon has even posted footage of several of its strikes on social media.

The lack of response by U.S. national security agencies raises questions about whether the incident Trump mentioned was carried out covertly. Such an operation would likely limit the ability of U.S. officials to speak on the matter.

Last month Reuters reported that the U.S. was poised to launch a new phase of Venezuela-related operations, as the Trump administration escalates pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government.

At the time, two U.S. officials said covert operations would likely be the first part of the new action against Maduro.

The U.S. mission has primarily focused on military strikes against suspected drug trafficking vessels and has prompted intense oversight from Congress. More than 100 people have been killed in more than 20 strikes in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.

Earlier this month, U.S. military leaders briefed lawmakers on an incident in September in which an American strike killed 11 people but left several survivors. They were killed in a second strike ordered by Admiral Frank Bradley.

Democrats on Capitol Hill have questioned whether the second strike was conducted in accordance with international law.

Trump's comments come amid a massive U.S. military build up in the Caribbean, including more than 15,000 troops.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 18:31:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T2RMY6MV3ROH7OP5JMZP4ZZ4QA.jpg?auth=ee561b5215605a15c7d96a1828588a661b2043fe06f2736028986c35209d10ab&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy backs Ukraine military aid through 2026 after coalition clash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italy-backs-ukraine-military-aid-through-2026-after-coalition-clash-2025-12-29/</link><description>ROME, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Italy's cabinet on Monday approved a decree to keep military aid flowing to Ukraine through 2026, sealing a coalition compromise after weeks of debate that exposed divisions over foreign policy within Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government.

The accord followed threats by the far-right League, which had close ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin before Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine , to abstain on the measure and thereby exacerbate rifts over Italy's stance on the war.

League leader Matteo Salvini, who serves as deputy prime minister, had argued that dispatching additional military aid to Ukraine could fuel corruption in Kyiv and would not help end the war. Critics accused him of promoting Putin's agenda.

The new decree is similar to bills approved in the past three years, stating that the government will transfer military vehicles, materials and equipment to Ukraine.

However, the League said that in a change from the 2025 text, the new decree stated that priority would be given to logistical and medical items for civilian use, and for equipment needed to defend against missile, drone and cyber attacks.

Meloni's office did not immediately release the text.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani, who heads the coalition Forza Italia party, welcomed the new bill, which has to be approved by parliament within two months.

"It's an absolutely balanced decree, like the previous ones. Italy will continue to support Ukraine militarily, economically, financially, and politically," he was quoted as saying by Corriere della Sera daily.

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Italy has sent 12 packages of military aid to Kyiv, although it has never revealed exactly what it has dispatched, saying this is classified information.

Defence Chief of Staff General Luciano Portolano told Il Sole 24 Ore newspaper on Sunday that Italy had so far sent supplies worth more than 3 billion euros ($3.5 billion).

While Italy has been a consistent contributor of aid to Ukraine, it has lagged behind other major European economies, notably Germany, which has sent more than 15 billion euros in military supplies to Ukraine, with billions more promised.

Trump made the comments as he greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs. They load the boats up with drugs.

The publication, in France 's government gazette, confirms an ambition Clooney alluded to early in December when he hailed French privacy laws that keep his family shielded from paparazzi.

"I love the French culture , your language, even if I'm still bad at it after 400 days of courses," the 64-year-old actor told RTL radio at the time – in English.

"Here, they don't take photos of kids. There aren't any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That's number one for us," he said.

The now-dual US-French citizen has a long attachment to Europe, which even pre-dates his 2014 marriage to Amal, a British-Lebanese human rights lawyer who speaks fluent French.

Clooney owns an estate in Italy's picturesque Lake Como region, purchased in 2002, and he and Amal bought a historic manor in England.

Their property in southern France – a former wine estate called the Domaine du Canadel, near the village of Brignoles – was purchased in 2021.

They also own a New York apartment and a property in Kentucky, but reportedly sold homes in Los Angeles and Mexico over the past decade.

The glamorous couple are parents to eight-year-old twins.

Clooney told RTL that although the family jet-sets around, their French home "is where we're happiest".

Clooney is also a director and producer, and has two Oscars to put on whichever mantlepiece suits: one for best supporting actor in 2006's "Syriana" and as a producer on 2012's "Argo".

On top of his cinema pay cheques, he has raked in millions for celebrity endorsements, including for Nespresso, and got a windfall pay-out for selling his stake in a tequila brand.

Clooney is not the only Hollywood luminary to want to go French: US director Jim Jarmusch on Friday told France Inter radio that he plans to apply for French nationality.

"I would like a place that will allow me to escape from the United States," he said, also saying he was attracted to French culture.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:18:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fdc226ea-e4d9-11f0-9783-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-78E38F3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Judge grants release of redacted transcript of Charlie Kirk case hearing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/judge-grants-release-redacted-transcript-charlie-kirk-case-hearing-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - A Utah judge overseeing the trial of the accused killer of conservative activist Charlie Kirk on Monday ordered the release of most of the transcript and audio of a closed-door hearing on safety and security measures for the proceedings, but said media outlets who had asked for the records did not need special status to cover the proceedings.

Judge Tony Graf made his two rulings on media requests during a video hearing that suspect Tyler Robinson attended by audio link. Robinson spoke only once, replying "yes, your honor," when asked by Graf whether he was present.

Robinson is accused of firing a single round from a rooftop that killed Kirk as he debated students on a stop on a U.S. university tour.

Robinson is charged with seven criminal counts, including aggravated murder, obstruction of justice for disposing of evidence, and witness tampering for asking his roommate to delete incriminating texts. Prosecutors said they would seek the death penalty .

Media outlets covering the case had asked for records of a closed hearing on Oct. 24 that dealt with what safety restraints and clothing Robinson was required to wear in court. The judge on Monday ordered the redaction of about one page worth of text of the 80-page transcript and the corresponding audio.

Graf has ruled Robinson may appear in court in regular clothes but must be physically restrained, and prohibited media from filming or photographing Robinson's handcuffs and shackles after his lawyers said such images could prejudice potential jurors.

Media outlets had asked for status that would have ensured they received notice of attempts to close hearings or otherwise limit access to the proceedings to give them time to challenge restrictions. Graf denied that request, citing a prior order that lawyers for both sides must notify the media before attempting to have future hearings held behind closed doors.

At a February hearing, Graf will consider a defense request to ban cameras from the courtroom.

Kirk's death sparked denunciations of political violence across the ideological spectrum.

The doctors carried out a "phrenic nerve block procedure" on Bolsonaro to block his left phrenic nerve, after he had undergone a similar surgery on Saturday to treat the right one.

In medical literature, the phrenic nerve is described as a vital nerve originating in the neck that controls the diaphragm, the primary muscle for breathing.

The surgery at the DF Star hospital in capital Brasilia lasted for about an hour and was concluded near 3 p.m. local time (1800 GMT), according to information provided by his wife, former First Lady Michelle Bolsonaro, on social media.

A medical note on the surgery is expected to be released later.

Bolsonaro, 70, had been hospitalized on Wednesday for hernia surgery on Christmas Day. His doctors then decided to also carry out procedures to treat his hiccups during his hospital stay.

The ex-president has faced health problems since a stabbing he suffered in September 2018, during a presidential campaign event in the town of Juiz de Fora, in Minas Gerais state.

Bolsonaro was convicted and sentenced to over 27 years in prison by Brazil's Supreme Court in September for plotting a coup to overturn his 2022 election loss. He started to serve his sentence last month.

He was authorized by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes to leave prison for the hernia surgery.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:38:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E32YRRPSUVIL3P75QNK75HRTRU.jpg?auth=8452fd8c86974026cf729b05231e8823c21841e42cb1011c587fdb4b9b7ad530&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says of alleged Ukraine attack on Putin: 'I was very angry about it'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-alleged-ukraine-attack-putin-i-was-very-angry-about-it-2025-12-29/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday said Russian President Vladimir Putin told him Ukraine tried to attack Putin's residence in northern Russia, which Kyiv has denied.

"I don't like it. It's not good," Trump told reporters when asked if he was worried the allegation could affect his efforts to broker peace. "I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

"It's a delicate period of time. This is not the right time. It's one thing to be offensive, because they're offensive. It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that," he said.

When asked if there was any evidence of such an attack, Trump said: "We'll find out."

He described his call with Putin earlier on Monday as a "very good talk."

"We have a few very thorny issues," Trump said about talks to end the war in Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 19:38:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5E7PFYTYA5OP5HANBXUIJ42DEI.jpg?auth=38f6541c9ce2621f762e6908e721dc118076245a383f1c8e567fb3b47be42eb1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says Netanyahu pardon 'on its way'; Herzog's office disputes it</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-netanyahu-pardon-on-its-way-herzogs-office-disputes-it-2025-12-29/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Israeli President Isaac Herzog had told him a pardon for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was “on its way,” an assertion Herzog’s office was quick to challenge.

"He's a wartime prime minister who's a hero. How do you not give a pardon?" Trump told reporters while standing beside Netanyahu before a meeting in Florida. "I spoke to the president ... he tells me it's on its way."

Asked about the U.S. president's remarks, Herzog's office said the Israeli president had not had any conversations with Trump since a pardon request was submitted several weeks ago.

Herzog's office said Herzog had spoken to a representative for Trump then and it was explained that any decision would be made in accordance with established procedures.

Netanyahu, Israel's first sitting prime minister to be charged with a crime, denies bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges dating back to his 2019 indictment.

His own request for a pardon, submitted on November 30, argued that frequent court hearings impair his ability to govern and that clemency serves the national interest.

The appeal was lodged following the start of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza, as his government sought to bring an end to Hamas' rule under Trump's plan to end two years of war and expand diplomatic ties across the region.

The request by the six-time prime minister had drawn fierce criticism from opponents, who said that pardoning him mid-trial would be a total breach of the rule of law.

According to Israeli law, the president has authority to pardon convicts. But there is no precedent for issuing a pardon mid-trial.

Netanyahu's pardon quest has been boosted by Trump, a close ally who wrote a formal letter to Herzog in November urging him to grant clemency and describing the case as "political, unjustified prosecution."</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 20:25:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6EHQLLIIAVPJZIA4AGNAVAZFBU.jpg?auth=c131b08858f1b901247fe8b349dc633030dae904734e745b75b1055f707a3974&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Winter Storm Ezra snarls US travel as meteorologists warn of 'bomb cyclone'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/winter-storm-ezra-snarls-us-travel-meteorologists-warn-bomb-cyclone-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Winter Storm Ezra disrupted holiday travel across the U.S. Northeast, Midwest and Great Lakes for a third straight day on Monday, causing thousands of flight delays and hundreds of cancellations as airlines scrambled to recover and meteorologists warned of a brewing "bomb cyclone" that could further snarl trips ahead of the New Year's holiday.

Nearly 6,000 flights were delayed and 751 canceled as of 3:25 p.m. ET, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Since Friday, weather disruptions have canceled over 3,600 flights and delayed more than 30,000 others.

The storm hit during one of the year's busiest travel periods, when airlines operate near capacity with limited flexibility to rebook passengers. Holiday travelers faced long waits, rebooking difficulties and accommodation challenges as airlines coped with severe winter weather.

AccuWeather meteorologists warned the powerful storm would intensify into a "bomb cyclone" through Monday night, bringing blizzard conditions, dangerous ice, flooding rain and strong winds from Wisconsin to Maine.

A bomb cyclone occurs when rapidly dropping atmospheric pressure produces hurricane-force winds and heavy precipitation. The arctic cold front driving the storm brought with it wild swings in temperatures. In Philadelphia, temperatures, which soared close to 60 degrees on Monday, were expected to drop into the 20s overnight.

Major travel disruptions, regional power outages and hazardous conditions were expected through early Tuesday.

The harsh weather also disrupted road travel, with poor visibility, icy surfaces and blowing snow contributing to several multi-vehicle pileups and prompting authorities in parts of the region to urge drivers to avoid non-essential travel.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency warned travelers that driving could be dangerous as blizzard-like conditions, high winds and ice descend across the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes.

The Federal Aviation Administration issued a ground stop at Washington's Dulles International Airport until 4:15 p.m. ET due to high winds. Delays at airports in Boston and Newark, New Jersey, which serves New York City, were imposed due to low visibility and windy conditions.

Detroit-bound flights faced additional disruption after the FAA ordered a ground stop at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport through 8 a.m. ET on Monday. The halt, affecting only Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) , opens new tab flights, was imposed for undisclosed operational reasons, and delays were expected to continue until midnight.

Delta had the highest share of cancellations and delays on Monday, and its shares fell nearly 3% in afternoon trading.

Shares of United Airlines (UAL.O) , opens new tab , American Airlines (AAL.O) , opens new tab and Alaska Air Group (ALK.N) , opens new tab were each down about 2%.

The FAA also said departures from Albany, Bangor, Burlington and Minneapolis-St. Paul were delayed as ground crews cleared snow and ice from planes.

Airline operations are tightly interlinked, meaning canceled flights can leave aircraft and crews out of position, complicating efforts to restore normal schedules.

American Airlines, United Airlines, JetBlue Airways and Delta told Reuters they had waived change fees for passengers affected by weather-related disruptions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:19:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HE7D4GGTAVJCZDVEECIBX63CZU.jpg?auth=ab0e2969a8dfb5f889fba7031d628a6ca13de2e3a1b0e6b37ba7222004f69d32&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea leader Kim says multiple rocket launch system key to artillery, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-leader-kim-says-multiple-rocket-launch-system-key-artillery-kcna-2025-12-29/</link><description>SEOUL, Dec 30 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un inspected a munitions factory and said the multiple rocket launcher system being produced there will be the mainstay of modernized long-range artillery for fast precision strikes and strategic attacks, KCNA news agency reported on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 21:41:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lavrov: the West must recognise that Russia holds strategic initiative in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/lavrov-west-must-recognise-that-russia-holds-strategic-initiative-ukraine-2025-12-29/</link><description>Dec 29 (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, in an interview published late on Monday, said the West must understand that Russia holds the strategic initiative in Ukraine as discussions move forward on a possible settlement.

Lavrov told RIA news agency that the West had to come to terms with the territorial realities on the ground nearly four years after the launch of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, which it describes as a "Special Military Operation".

He said the United States now supported the notion, which had become clear to all, that with the expiry of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's mandate, a new election was needed.

Lavrov also again stressed that a settlement required an end to any notion of a NATO presence in Ukraine and that the country had to adopt a neutral, non-aligned status.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:21:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BU6HN5ZAA5JUBMGAJ7NDMOEXPU.jpg?auth=d344103e5e8e372d83a88fd0215888cb16929a93b6562d8d9b6fd4a98676cb74&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says he and Netanyahu don't fully agree on West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-he-netanyahu-dont-fully-agree-west-bank-2025-12-29/</link><description>PALM BEACH, Florida, Dec 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that he and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not agree fully on the issue of the Israeli-occupied West Bank but the Republican leader did not lay out what the disagreement was.

In a briefing after a meeting with Netanyahu at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, Trump was asked if he had a message for Netanyahu about the West Bank and if he was concerned that settler violence in the West Bank could undermine peace.

"We have had a discussion, big discussion for a long time on the West Bank. And I wouldn't say we agree on the West Bank 100%, but we'll come to a conclusion on the West Bank," Trump said.

"I don't want to do that, it will be announced at an appropriate time," Trump said when asked what the disagreement between them was. Netanyahu "will do the right thing," Trump added.

Israel has been under mounting international pressure to curb attacks by settlers on Palestinians in the West Bank. Home to 2.7 million Palestinians, the West Bank has long been at the heart of plans for a future Palestinian state alongside Israel.

The United Nations, Palestinians and most countries regard settlements as illegal under international law. Israel disputes this, citing biblical ties to the land and security concerns. Around half a million Israeli settlers live in the West Bank.

The United Nations' highest court said last year Israel's occupation of Palestinian territories and settlements there were illegal and should be dismantled.

Over a thousand Palestinians were killed in the West Bank between October 2023 and October 2025, mostly in operations by security forces and some by settler violence, the U.N. has said. In the same period, 57 Israelis were killed in Palestinian attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:44:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J6LGPNNTLZIH5LLYSE46AGZ6GA.jpg?auth=512ced44653cc6822ab889b363e156e762ff9ff7c1027fc24771318d680327f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Peru shamans foretell illness for Trump, Maduro's exile in 2026</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/peru-shamans-foretell-illness-trump-maduros-exile-2026-2025-12-29/</link><description>LIMA, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Shamans in Peru gathered for an annual New Year's ritual on Monday where they made predictions for the year to come, including illness for U.S. President Donald Trump and the downfall of Venezuelan counterpart Nicolas Maduro.

"The United States should prepare itself because Donald Trump will fall seriously ill," Juan de Dios Garcia proclaimed as he gathered with other shamans on a beach in southern Lima, wearing colorful ponchos and sprinkling flowers on the sand.

The shamans carried large posters of world leaders, over which they crossed swords, burned incense and some of which they stomped on.

As well as Trump and Maduro, shamans waved posters of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Chinese President Xi Jinping, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.

"We see Nicolas Maduro defeated," said Garcia. "Nicolas Maduro will flee Venezuela. He will not be captured."

Closer to home, Garcia predicted that Keiko Fujimori , the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, will emerge victorious in Peru's presidential election after three failed bids.

"The woman who dreams of ruling Peru, I have been able to see through the wachuma (ancestral plant) that Keiko Fujimori will be president in 2026," he said.

The shamans also foretold the end of Russia's war in Ukraine . "I see that the conflict will end, they will raise the flag of peace," Garcia predicted.

The ceremony is performed every year in late December. The shamans had previously predicted an end to the Ukraine war - in 2023.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 22:44:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/72QYNORCWBJZBJKTSVYIA62SZE.jpg?auth=aec74af66887c09c82050e1c0bd5b660175ef8322f50d44af52721ce9ce40a46&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel defends Somaliland move at UN amid concerns over Gaza motives</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-defends-somaliland-move-un-amid-concerns-over-gaza-motives-2025-12-29/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Israel defended on Monday its formal recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, but several countries at the United Nations questioned whether the move aimed to relocate Palestinians from Gaza or to establish military bases.

Israel became the first country to recognize Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday.

The 22-member Arab League, a regional organization of Arab states in the Middle East and parts of Africa, rejects "any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases," Arab League U.N. Ambassador Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz told the U.N. Security Council.

"Against the backdrop of Israel's previous references to Somaliland of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza, its unlawful recognition of Somaliland region of Somalia is deeply troubling," Pakistan's Deputy U.N. Ambassador Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon told the council.

Israel's U.N. mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks or address any of them in its statement at the council meeting. In March, the foreign ministers of Somalia and Somaliland said they had not received any proposal to resettle Palestinians from Gaza.

U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza states: "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return."

Israel's coalition government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in its history, includes far-right politicians who advocate the annexation of both Gaza and the West Bank and encouraging Palestinians to leave their homeland.

Somalia’s U.N. Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said council members Algeria, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Somalia "unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to the northwestern region of Somalia."

Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy - and relative peace and stability - since 1991 when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.

"It is not a hostile step toward Somalia, nor does it preclude future dialogue between the parties. Recognition is not an act of defiance. It is an opportunity,” Israel’s Deputy U.N. Ambassador Jonathan Miller told the council.

In September, several Western states, including France, Britain, Canada and Australia announced they would recognize a Palestinian state, joining more than three-quarters of the 193 U.N. members who already do so.

Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Tammy Bruce said: "This council’s persistent double standards and misdirection of focus distract from its mission of maintaining international peace and security."

Slovenia's U.N. Ambassador Samuel Zbogar disputed her argument, saying: "Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory ... Palestine is also an observer state in this organization."

He added: "Somaliland, on the other hand, is a part of a U.N. member state and recognizing it goes against ... the U.N. Charter."

Israel said last week that it would seek immediate cooperation with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. The former British protectorate hopes Israeli recognition will encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing its diplomatic heft and access to global markets.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 23:41:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXXSK76A4VPXDLWZF3RPF5QBCQ.jpg?auth=b98e2b50a883851882f8af976a00c317a9efd53194cb0af6f45987f407c7e58c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says two men killed in strike on suspected drug vessel in Pacific</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-says-two-men-killed-strike-suspected-drug-vessel-pacific-2025-12-29/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 29 (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it killed two men in a strike on a boat suspected of carrying drugs in international waters in the eastern Pacific Ocean on Monday.

"This contract provides for the design, integration, instrumentation, test, production, and delivery of 25 new F-15IA aircraft for the Israeli Air Force with an option for an additional 25 F-15IA aircraft," the Pentagon said.

The Pentagon said the contract involved foreign military sales to Israel. The U.S. has long been by far the largest arms supplier to its closest Middle East ally.

Pro-Palestinian and anti-war protesters around the U.S. had demanded an end to Washington's military support for Israel due to its devastating assault on Gaza but those demands have not been met in the administrations of President Donald Trump and former President Joe Biden .

Contract work will be performed in St. Louis, and was expected to be complete by Dec. 31, 2035, the Pentagon said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2025 23:42:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6NFGAGOGNBPBLFCWB7R67HHIWM.jpg?auth=fde69e2929e327957ef43a7057ee56c03ffc0de49e0de6503965db79e38797df&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-80-2025-12-30/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party said on Tuesday.

The Eastern Theatre Command said the drills would take place until 6 p.m. (1000 GMT) in the sea and airspace of five locations surrounding the island, demonstrating the Chinese military's resolve to "combat separatism and promote unification without hesitation."

China's Maritime Safety Administration on Monday designated two further zones within which live-firing would take place, making the "Justice Mission 2025" drills the largest to date by total coverage and in areas closer to Taiwan than previous exercises.

The war games began 11 days after the U.S. announced a record $11.1 billion arms package to Taiwan, drawing the Chinese defence ministry's ire and warnings that the military would "take forceful measures" in response.

The exercises - China's sixth major round of war games since 2022, when then-U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited the democratically governed island - are intended to rehearse a rapid encirclement of the island to destroy its weapons stockpile and obstruct efforts to resupply Taiwan from Japan or nearby U.S. bases, analysts say.

"This constitutes a blatant provocation of the international situation," said a senior Taiwan security official, who requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. "As one of the world's most critical shipping lanes, they seek to reshape the international order according to their own agenda."

The official said Taipei is closely monitoring whether China would seek "further provocation" in the drills on Tuesday, including flying missiles over Taiwan, similar to the Chinese drills in 2022.

"China is trying to make progress in asserting dominance over the entire island chain through extreme pressure tactics in various ways," the official said.

The Chinese military said it had deployed destroyers, bombers and other units to drill sea-based assaults, air defence and anti-submarine operations on Tuesday, to "test sea and air forces' ability to coordinate for integrated containment and control."

Taiwan rejects China's claimed sovereignty, maintaining that only its people can decide the island's future.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:44:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EJAH5A42ZVN35GDPA6TTVRMAZM.jpg?auth=5b127bd16b75cce009ebd974404fd085526e5f10ced4433b19733844d5b4db25&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainians withstand days-long power cuts in crowded 'resilience' shelters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukrainians-withstand-days-long-power-cuts-crowded-resilence-shelters-2025-12-30/</link><description>VYSHHOROD, Ukraine, Dec 30 (Reuters) - For three days, after the latest Russian air attacks on Ukraine, Olena Pazhydaieva has had no power or heat in her apartment in Vyshhorod, a satellite town 20 km (12 miles) north of Kyiv.

With night-time temperatures dipping to -3 C (27 Fahrenheit), she now spends much of the day with her six-year-old son in a shelter the size of a small shack, but with heating and power to connect the devices she needs to work.

About 20 people crowd into the building - dubbed "islet of warmth and power" on the sign outside - with mobile phones and laptops charging in order to keep working and connected.

"After the last attack, we haven't had electricity for the third day, power hasn't appeared at all, and now we're forced to work here in a shelter, where we can charge our stations, charge our laptops," Pazhydaieva said.

"It's good that there's internet. We can work. I’m not the only person here, there are many people."

Russian drone and missile attacks have long targeted energy facilities throughout Ukraine, triggering blackouts.

The latest massive attack knocked out power to 19,000 customers in Kyiv region surrounding the capital, according to Ukraine's Energy Ministry.

The shack is one of a large network of "resilience points" set up by authorities to keep people warm and able to function.

But family life without power can be complicated.

"We go to an after-school group and they usually take the kids in on holidays, too," Pazhydaieva said. "But when we went there today, we went inside, it was super cold and all the kids were wearing jackets...At least it's warm here."

Each family finds new ways to cope.

For Pazhydaieva, that means spending time at the "islet" to recharge devices and then trying to connect the water heater at home to a portable power station to keep everyone warm.

She has little faith in the U.S.-backed talks on resolving the conflict, particularly U.S. President Donald Trump's remark at a meeting on Sunday in Florida that Russian President Vladimir Putin "wants Ukraine to succeed".

"When Trump says that Putin wants prosperity for Ukraine as missiles are flying at us, somehow these two statements don't really match up," she said.

"Right now we're just observing and not much depends on us. We're doing the best we can here where we are now."

"If it were up to me, I would stay for 10 more years," Bukele said in a video interview published by Spanish YouTuber TheGrefg on Monday. He noted that he had initially agreed with his wife that he would leave politics in 2029.

El Salvador is expected to hold its next presidential election in 2027, to decide who will run the country through to 2033.

Bukele will be eligible to run for a third term, after the ruling party-controlled Congress pushed through a constitutional reform in July to abolish term limits, bring forward the next election and extend presidential terms from five to six years.

Legal experts at home and abroad have questioned the legality of Bukele's attempts to extend his term. The country's constitution prohibits presidents' consecutive reelection in at least six of its articles.

Early in 2024, Bukele won his second term with a landslide victory despite a constitutional ban.

The wildly popular 44-year-old publicist enjoys some of the world's highest approval ratings thanks to a hardline approach to crime which has helped drastically reduce murder rates.

Critics say this has come at the expense of civil rights and people have been arbitrarily detained, tortured and even killed in custody.

Bukele, who once described himself on his Twitter account as "the world's coolest dictator," said he did not plan to establish a dictatorship in El Salvador and it would be up to Salvadorans to decide whether he should continue in power.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:44:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZPN432ZXFVMHJODMOTYD7TBFY4.jpg?auth=0fc740cd9c27241c3ae578df52e71800f18b21caeef78e3c5d6d1bde5bd63564&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: What is 'Taiwan independence' and is Taiwan already independent?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/what-is-taiwan-independence-is-taiwan-already-independent-2025-12-30/</link><description>TAIPEI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China said on Tuesday it would "never hesitate to combat separatism" as it held a second day of war games around Taiwan, describing the drills it calls "Justice Mission 2025" as a warning against independence and foreign interference.

Below are some questions and answers about what is meant by the term "Taiwan independence".

Previously known as Formosa, the island has been home to indigenous people for thousands of years, before the Dutch and Spanish briefly ruled parts of it in the 1600s.

The Qing dynasty incorporated Taiwan as part of Fujian province in 1684 and only declared it a separate Chinese province in 1885.

Following the Qing's defeat in a war with Japan, it became a Japanese colony in 1895. In 1945, it was handed over to the Republic of China government at the end of World War Two.

In 1949 after being defeated by Mao Zedong's communist forces, the Republic of China government fled and moved its capital to Taiwan, and Republic of China remains the island's formal name.

Mao set up the People's Republic of China, and claimed it was the only legitimate Chinese government for the whole of China, including Taiwan, as the Republic of China's successor state.

For decades, the Republic of China in Taipei also claimed to be the legitimate Chinese government, but in 1971 Beijing took over the China seat at the United Nations from Taipei.

Currently only 12 countries maintain formal ties with Taipei, mostly small and poorer developing nations such as Belize and Tuvalu.

Most major Western countries and U.S. allies maintain close unofficial ties with Taiwan by recognising the Republic of China passport and having de facto embassies in each other's capitals. Taiwanese citizens can freely travel to most countries using their Taiwanese passports.

The U.S. severed official ties with Taipei in 1979 but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself. The U.S. officially takes no position on Taiwan's sovereignty under Washington's "One China" policy.

China says it will not renounce the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. Beijing has offered Taiwan a "one country, two systems" model similar to Hong Kong, which promised the city a high degree of autonomy, though no major political party in Taiwan supports that.

Opinion polls in Taiwan have repeatedly shown most Taiwanese wish to maintain the current status quo in relations with China.

China also says that United Nations resolution 2758, passed in 1971, means the world legally recognises Taiwan belongs to China. The resolution states that the People's Republic of China is the only legitimate government of China, and resulted in Taipei losing China's U.N. seat to Beijing,

The government in Taipei says that is nonsense given the resolution made no mention of Taiwan or its status.

Taiwan, whose people elect their own leaders and whose government controls a defined area of territory with its own military, passport and currency, enjoys de facto independence even if that is not formally recognised by most countries.

Taiwan's government says the Republic of China is a sovereign state and that Beijing has no right to speak for or represent it given the People's Republic of China has no say in how it chooses its leaders and has never ruled Taiwan.

It would be very difficult and require parliamentary approval of a constitutional amendment and then a referendum, rather than a simple declaration by President Lai Ching-te.

At least 75% of lawmakers would need to pass that amendment, and the ruling Democratic Progressive Party and main opposition party the Kuomintang (KMT) currently have an equal number of seats.

The DPP, which has been in power since 2016, has not made an attempt to change the constitution. The KMT strongly opposes any attempts to change the name of Republic of China.

China detests Lai and calls him a "separatist". Before Lai was elected president he made comments about being a "practical worker for Taiwan independence". Lai maintains he simply meant Taiwan is already an independent country.

Since taking office in 2024, Lai has said on several occasions that the Republic of China and People's Republic of China are "not subordinate to each other", which Beijing says means he believes the two are separate countries and so he is therefore pushing an independence narrative.

In 2005, China's largely rubber-stamp parliament passed the Anti-Secession Law that gives the country the legal basis for military action against Taiwan if it secedes or if the "possibilities for a peaceful reunification should be completely exhausted", but the law is vague and does not give details.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:45:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/S7NRXODZ2ZKO5IELAYZ7U6B4UU.jpg?auth=8696306dbe01c73d3bfb33e06a18d2f019c38a5b4fb941de61f27f4b3b802c80&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US destroyed dock used by Venezuelan drug traffickers</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251230-trump-says-us-destroyed-dock-used-by-venezuela-drug-traffickers</link><description>The United States has hit and destroyed a docking area for alleged Venezuela drug boats, President Donald Trump said Monday, in what could amount to the first land strike of the military campaign against trafficking from Latin America.

The US leader's confirmation of the incident comes as he ramps up a pressure campaign against Venezuela's leftist President Nicolas Maduro , who has accused Trump of seeking regime change.

"There was a major explosion in the dock area where they load the boats up with drugs," he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as he hosted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

"So we hit all the boats and now we hit the area, it's the implementation area, that's where they implement. And that is no longer around."

The US leader would not say if it was a military or CIA operation or where the strike occurred, saying only that it was "along the shore."

Asked if he had spoken to Maduro recently, following an earlier phone call in November, Trump said they had talked "pretty recently" but said that "nothing much comes out of it."

Trump had been asked to elaborate on apparent throwaway comments he made in a radio interview broadcast Friday that seemed to mention a land strike for the first time.

"They have a big plant or a big facility where they send, you know, where the ships come from," Trump told billionaire supporter John Catsimatidis on the WABC radio station in New York.

"Two nights ago we knocked that out. So we hit them very hard."

Trump did not say in the interview where the facility was located or give any other details.

There has been no official comment from the Venezuelan government.

The Pentagon earlier referred questions to the White House. The White House did not respond to requests for comment from AFP.

Trump has been threatening for weeks that ground strikes on drug cartels in the region would start "soon," but this is the first apparent example.

US forces have also carried out numerous strikes in both the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean since September, targeting what Washington says are drug-smuggling boats.

The administration has provided no evidence that the targeted boats were involved in drug trafficking, however, prompting debate about the legality of these operations.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings, a charge that Washington denies.

After Trump spoke Monday, the US military announced on X that it had carried out another deadly strike on a boat in the Eastern Pacific, killing two and bringing the total killed in the maritime campaign to at least 107.

It did not specify where exactly the strike took place.

The Trump administration has been ramping up pressure on Maduro, accusing the Venezuelan leader of running a drug cartel himself and imposing an oil tanker blockade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 01:45:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/58a4b490-e518-11f0-8bab-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362800912978.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bondi gunmen acted alone, no evidence they were part of militant cell, Australian police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bondi-gunmen-acted-alone-no-evidence-they-were-part-militant-cell-australian-2025-12-30/</link><description>SYDNEY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Two gunmen who allegedly opened fire on a Jewish celebration on Sydney's Bondi Beach earlier this month acted alone and there was "no evidence" they were part of a militant cell, police said on Tuesday.

Naveed Akram and his father Sajid Akram are alleged to have killed 15 people at a Hanukkah event on December 14, Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades that shocked the nation and led to immediate reforms of already strict gun laws.

Police have previously said the men were inspired by Islamic State, with home made flags of the militant group found in their car after the attack, and a month-long trip by the pair to a Philippines island previously plagued by militancy a major focus of investigation.

But on Tuesday, Australian Federal Police Commissioner Krissy Barrett said there was no indication the men had received formal training on the November trip to Mindanao in the Philippines.

"There is no evidence to suggest these alleged offenders were part of a broader terrorist cell, or were directed by others to carry out an attack," Barrett told a news conference.

She added the findings were an initial assessment, and authorities in Australia and the Philippines were continuing their investigation.

"I am not suggesting that they were there for tourism," she said, referring to the Philippines trip.

Sajid Akram was shot dead by police during the attack, while his son Naveed, who was also shot by police, was charged with 59 offences after waking from a days-long coma earlier this month. Naveed Akram faces charges ranging from 15 counts of murder to terror and explosives offences.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EATWMSVCXBJ7JCLVEZC3CHYNHM.jpg?auth=a5bf430308c2f8106c9b3157ba572471636cfb071b39d8c663b76727cd2247d4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's first female prime minister, dies at 80</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/obituary-khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-dies-80-2025-12-30/</link><description>DHAKA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Khaleda Zia, who became Bangladesh's first female prime minister in 1991 and went on to develop a bitter rivalry with Sheikh Hasina as they spent decades trading power, died on Tuesday after a long illness. She was 80.

Her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said that she died after a prolonged illness. She had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, and chest and heart problems, her doctors said.

She went to London for medical treatment in early 2025, staying for four months before returning home.

Though Khaleda had been out of power since 2006 and had spent several years in jail or under house arrest, she and her centre-right BNP continued to command much support.

The BNP is seen as the frontrunner to win the parliamentary election slated to take place in February. Her son and acting chairman of the party, Tarique Rahman, 60, returned to the country last week from nearly 17 years in self-exile and is widely seen as a strong candidate to become prime minister.

Since August 2024, after a student-led uprising led to the ouster of Hasina, Bangladesh has been run by an interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel peace laureate and microfinance pioneer.

In November, Hasina was sentenced to death in absentia for her deadly crackdown on the student protests.

Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.

Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of "liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness".

She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh's founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.

But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed "the battling Begums" - a phrase that uses an Urdu honorific for prominent women.

Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.

Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.

In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the country's largest Islamic party, Jamaat-e-Islami.

In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh's first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, elected to lead Pakistan three years earlier.

Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.

She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.

Her second term was marred by the rise of Islamist militants and allegations of corruption.

In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded. Khaleda's government and its Islamic allies were widely blamed.

In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh's highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.

Although Khaleda later clamped down on Islamist radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.

The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.

Khaleda never regained power. With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.

Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.

In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister - charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.

She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.

Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina's ouster.

In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh's Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:28:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LTFVWONNVROGJPEP2PMVMMUXOY.jpg?auth=3fbc932da9cb22772b802d36bb4ad7ab1ecdacca442d5bb4fd3d6016cfd19635&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN ambassadors condemn Israel's recognition of Somaliland</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251230-un-security-council-members-condemn-israel-recognition-of-somaliland-somalia-international-law</link><description>Israel defended on Monday its formal recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland , but several countries at the United Nations questioned whether the move aimed to relocate Palestinians from Gaza or to establish military bases.

Israel became the first country to recognise Somaliland as an independent and sovereign state on Friday.

The 22-member Arab League, a regional organisation of Arab states in the Middle East and parts of Africa, rejects "any measures arising from this illegitimate recognition aimed at facilitating forced displacement of the Palestinian people or exploiting northern Somali ports to establish military bases," Arab League UN Ambassador Maged Abdelfattah Abdelaziz told the UN Security Council.

"Against the backdrop of Israel's previous references to Somaliland of the Federal Republic of Somalia as a destination for the deportation of Palestinian people, especially from Gaza , its unlawful recognition of Somaliland region of Somalia is deeply troubling," Pakistan's Deputy UN Ambassador Muhammad Usman Iqbal Jadoon told the council.

Israel's UN mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the remarks or address any of them in its statement at the council meeting. In March, the foreign ministers of Somalia and Somaliland said they had not received any proposal to resettle Palestinians from Gaza.

US President Donald Trump's peace plan for Gaza states: "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return."

Israel's coalition government, the most right-wing and religiously conservative in its history, includes far-right politicians who advocate the annexation of both Gaza and the West Bank and encouraging Palestinians to leave their homeland.

Somalia’s UN Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman said council members Algeria, Guyana, Sierra Leone and Somalia "unequivocally reject any steps aimed at advancing this objective, including any attempt by Israel to relocate the Palestinian population from Gaza to the northwestern region of Somalia."

Somaliland has enjoyed effective autonomy - and relative peace and stability - since 1991 when Somalia descended into civil war, but the breakaway region has failed to receive recognition from any other country.

"It is not a hostile step toward Somalia, nor does it preclude future dialogue between the parties. Recognition is not an act of defiance. It is an opportunity,” Israel’s Deputy UN Ambassador Jonathan Miller told the council.

In September, several Western states, including France, Britain, Canada and Australia announced they would recognise a Palestinian state, joining more than three-quarters of the 193 UN members who already do so.

Deputy US Ambassador to the UN Tammy Bruce said: "This council’s persistent double standards and misdirection of focus distract from its mission of maintaining international peace and security."

Slovenia's UN Ambassador Samuel Zbogar disputed her argument, saying: "Palestine is not part of any state. It is illegally occupied territory ... Palestine is also an observer state in this organisation."

He added: "Somaliland, on the other hand, is a part of a UN member state and recognising it goes against ... the UN Charter."

Israel said last week that it would seek immediate cooperation with Somaliland in agriculture, health, technology and the economy. The former British protectorate hopes Israeli recognition will encourage other nations to follow suit, increasing its diplomatic heft and access to global markets.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 03:29:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/06921c66-e521-11f0-b452-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Somali-Ambassador.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi-led coalition launches air strike at Yemen's Mukalla port</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-led-coalition-yemen-calls-civilians-mukalla-port-evacuate-saudi-state-news-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen launched a limited air strike targeting what it called foreign military support at Mukalla port, days after it warned the main southern separatist group against making military moves in the eastern province of Hadramout.

An offensive by Yemen's southern separatists earlier this month pitted the United Arab Emirates-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) against Saudi-supported Yemeni government troops, bringing the two nations closer than they have ever been to an all-out conflict. Yemen has been mired in a civil war since 2014.

A coalition spokesperson said two ships arriving from the UAE port of Fujairah entered Mukalla port on Saturday and Sunday without authorisation from the coalition, disabled their tracking systems and unloaded large quantities of weapons and combat vehicles "to support the (STC)."

The coalition said there were no casualties or collateral damage from the strike at Mukalla port, Saudi state media reported.

The UAE's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Acting on a request from the head of Yemen’s Presidential Leadership Council, Rashad al-Alimi, to protect civilians in Hadramout and al-Mahra, coalition air forces carried out a limited military operation early on Tuesday targeting the unloaded weapons and vehicles, Saudi state media said citing Turki al-Malki, the coalition spokesperson.

Two sources told Reuters that the strike targeted the dock where the cargo of the two ships was unloaded.

The STC separatists were initially part of the Saudi-led alliance that intervened in Yemen in 2015 against the Houthis. But they subsequently decided to seek self-rule in the south.

Since 2022, they have been part of an alliance that controls southern areas outside Houthi control under a Saudi-backed power-sharing initiative.

At present, UAE-backed forces control large swathes of land in the south including the strategically important Hadramout province.

Hadramout is on the border with Saudi Arabia and they have cultural and historical ties; many prominent Saudis trace their origins to the area.

The Houthis control the northern part of the country, including the capital Sanaa, after forcing the Saudi-backed government to flee south.

"We will continue to prevent any military support from any country to any Yemeni faction without coordination with the legitimate government," the coalition added.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 04:24:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Malaysia's jailed ex-PM Najib files appeal against 1MDB conviction</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/malaysias-jailed-ex-pm-najib-files-appeal-against-1mdb-conviction-2025-12-30/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Jailed former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak has filed an appeal against his conviction last week on corruption charges related to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal, which saw him sentenced to an additional 15 years in prison, his lawyer said on Tuesday.

Najib, 72, has been in jail since 2022 on graft offences linked to allegations that about $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) , a state fund he co-founded while serving as premier in 2009.

U.S. and Malaysian investigators have said more than $1 billion of the misappropriated funds made their way into accounts linked to Najib, who has consistently denied wrongdoing.

On December 26, Najib was found guilty of four charges of abuse of power and 21 counts of money laundering for illegally receiving about 2.3 billion ringgit ($567.90 million) originating from 1MDB, in the biggest trial he has faced.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison and slapped with a record fine of nearly $3 billion. The court ordered Najib to begin serving the additional sentence after his current six-year jail term ends in 2028, though the term may be reduced by one-third for good behaviour.

Najib's lawyer Muhammad Farhan Shafee confirmed in a brief text message that an appeal had been filed on Monday night against both the verdict and the sentence.

Najib has also filed an appeal against a separate court ruling this month denying his bid to serve the remainder of his current prison term under house arrest, media reports said.

Both court decisions have stoked tensions within Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's ruling alliance, with some members of Najib's party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), expressing disappointment with the verdicts.

UMNO campaigned against Anwar in a 2022 election but joined his coalition to form a government after the poll resulted in a hung parliament. Anwar last week urged calm, calling on parties to accept the court's decisions with "full patience and wisdom".

As Zelensky faced a verbal lashing from his hosts for not “thanking” Trump enough, heads of state, multinational corporations and international institutions across the world took note – and many responded by adopting baroque levels of “flattery diplomacy” to deal with the US president.

Pomp, splendour and courtesy have long greased diplomatic wheels. But with Trump this year, it was taken to personal – often incredible – levels that critics say crossed the line into servility and vassalage.

Here are some of 2025's top moments of Trump praise:

The prize never existed before, but after Trump waged a war of words against the Democrat-led US cities chosen to host next year’s World Cup , FIFA President Gianni Infantino decided to act. And how.

Infantino, a Trump ally, tapped into the US president’s disappointment over being skipped for the Nobel Peace Prize and cooked up a new, made-to-order award. On a plinth emblazoned with an all-cap “Donald J. Trump”, a metal globe perched atop five gnarled hands: the FIFA Peace Prize.

“This is your prize – this is your prize, your peace prize,” Infantino gushed as Trump beamed on the John F. Kennedy Center stage.

It didn’t end there. “There is also a beautiful medal for you that you can wear everywhere you want to go,” Infantino continued as Trump plucked the shiny object up and promptly put it on, like a modern-day Napoleon crowning himself.

In a year that saw world leaders tripping over themselves to sign deals with the US, Qatar went the furthest, gifting Trump a luxury Boeing valued at $400 million to update Air Force One; his presidential aircraft.

The offer was first reported by US media on the eve of Trump’s Middle East visit in May to Saudi Arabia , Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

The gift, the most expensive – and controversial – ever received by a US president in the country’s nearly 250-year history, kicked up a storm, with Democrats warning about ethical implications and legality and security concerns.

Trump however scoffed away the dismay, noting that Qatar's offer was a nice gesture that would be "stupid" to turn down.

With the Trump administration threatening to disengage from NATO , it was essential to keep the US president on board at the bloc’s 2025 summit in The Hague.

But NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte went overboard.

In a private message to Trump before the summit, Rutte noted, “You are flying into another big success in The Hague ... Europe is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it will be your win.”

Trump promptly posted Rutte’s message on his Truth Social platform, sparking cringes in many quarters.

But there was more. At a June 25 joint press conference during the NATO summit, Trump was asked about the Israel-Iran war , which was then raging.

The US president responded by likening the two countries to "kids in a schoolyard".

Rutte, in obsequious overdrive, couldn’t leave it at that. "Daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop," said the head of the world’s most powerful military alliance.

As the “Daddy” quote grabbed headlines, Trump was asked if he views NATO allies as children. "No, [Rutte] likes me,” the US president replied. “I think he likes me. If he doesn't, I'll let you know. I'll come back and I'll hit him hard, OK? He did it very affectionately, 'Daddy, you're my Daddy.'"

Trump’s obsession with winning a Nobel Peace Prize saw a number of world leaders trip over themselves to nominate the US president for the prize his predecessor, former president Barack Obama , won back in 2009.

None did it with as much flourish as Israeli Prime Benjamin Netanyahu . Before a dinner at the White House Blue Room in July, Netanyahu kicked off the proceedings with a monologue as the cameras rolled.

“I want to express the appreciation and admiration not only of all Israelis, but of the Jewish people,” began Netanyahu. As US and Israeli teams beamed, the Israeli prime minister held up a letter. “I want to present to you, Mr. President, the letter I sent to the Nobel prize committee,” said Netanyahu.

“Oh,” said Trump as he took the letter from Netanyahu.

“It’s nominating you for the Nobel Peace Prize, which is well-deserved,” explained Netanyahu. “I think you should get it.”

The Nobel committee didn’t think so. The 2025 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado .

Handing letters to the king became a thing this year. In February, “King Donald” – as some critics have dubbed Trump – received one from the real McCoy. In a desperate bid to maintain the US-UK “special relationship”, Britain’s Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer ceremoniously handed Trump a state visit invitation from his sovereign, King Charles III .

At an Oval Office meeting, the cameras rolled with the praises. Reaching into his jacket breast pocket, Starmer extricated an envelope proclaiming, “It is my pleasure to bring from his majesty, the king, a letter.”

“Thank you very much,” said Trump as he took the letter. And held it. As the agonising seconds stretched, the court held its breath. The future of Ukraine , Europe, the transatlantic alliance, world order hung in the balance.

“Am I supposed to read it now?” asked Trump, uncharacteristically deferential when handed an authentic royal object.

“Yes, please do,” Starmer replied.

The seconds stretched again as Trump silently read the letter. It was left to Starmer to explain that it was a “really special” invitation to an “unprecedented” second state visit.

Having admired the British monarch’s “beautiful” signature, Trump accepted the invitation, sparking months of excruciating “Royal Household prepares for state visit” coverage. A nine-minute royal family video even featured the elaborate prep work by livery officers, chefs, gardeners, military musicians and other staff.

They did their jobs. The visit in September took place without a royal hitch.

It was left to the British newspapers to examine if it was all worth the glitz. In its editorial, The Guardian concluded that, “there was an inverse relationship between the pomp and ceremony of this trip and its real import”.

The editorial however acknowledged that, “in the world of President Trump, a diplomatic interaction that avoids the outright disaster of a public dressing down, or doubling of tariffs , is now regarded as a triumph by US allies”.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:35:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0c94f066-da8b-11f0-87e2-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-EN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Trump 'very angry' about alleged Ukrainian attack on Putin's home</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251230-live-trump-very-angry-about-alleged-ukrainian-attack-on-putin-s-home</link><description>Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence in the Novgorod region west of Moscow on December 28-29 with 91 long-range drones which were all destroyed by Russian air defences.

"Such reckless actions will not go unanswered," Lavrov said in a statement, describing the attack as "state terrorism" and adding that targets had already been selected for retaliatory strikes by Russia's armed forces.

US President Donald Trump said Putin had told him about the alleged attack targetting one of his residences in a phone call on Monday morning, which had angered him.

"It's one thing to be offensive," Trump told reporters. "It's another thing ​to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

On Sunday, Trump met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Florida ‍and the U.S. president said they were "getting a lot closer, maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 06:35:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/df54e002-e543-11f0-9f9d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362811343246.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey detains 110 suspects in operation targeting Islamic State after deadly clash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-detains-110-suspects-operation-targeting-islamic-state-after-deadly-clash-2025-12-30/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Turkish police detained 110 suspects in an operation against Islamic State on Tuesday, a day after three police officers and six militants were killed in a gunfight in northwest Turkey, the Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office said.

Police conducted an eight-hour siege at a house in the town of Yalova, on the Sea of Marmara coast south of Istanbul, a week after more than 100 suspected IS members were detained in connection with alleged plans to carry out Christmas and New Year attacks.

Eight police officers and another security force member were wounded in the raid on the property, which was one of more than 100 addresses targeted by authorities on Monday.

In Tuesday's operation, police carried out raids on 114 addresses in Istanbul and two other provinces, arresting 110 of the total 115 suspects that they sought, the prosecutor's statement said. It said various digital materials and documents were seized.

Turkey has stepped up operations against suspected IS militants this year, as the group returns to prominence globally.

The U.S. carried out a strike against the militants in northwest Nigeria last week, while two gunmen who attacked a Hanukkah event at Sydney's Bondi Beach this month appeared to be inspired by IS , Australian police have said. On December 19, the U.S. military launched strikes against dozens of IS targets in Syria in retaliation for an attack on American personnel.

Almost a decade ago, the jihadist group was blamed for a series of attacks on civilian targets in Turkey, including gun attacks on an Istanbul nightclub and the city's main airport, killing dozens of people. Turkey was a key transit point for foreign fighters, including those of IS, entering and leaving Syria during the war there.

Police have carried out regular operations against the group in subsequent years and there have been few attacks since the wave of violence between 2015-2017.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 07:25:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7ZWI7FCWMNOE5BHQ376UM3YURI.jpg?auth=d0478b0a65f25f74709106c87ebbfb78bb672236d285c49d33d0a98ac8419edd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: Facing Alawite backlash, Syria’s new leaders take controversial steps to win loyalty</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/facing-alawite-backlash-syrias-new-leaders-take-controversial-steps-win-loyalty-2025-12-30/</link><description>QARDAHA, Syria, Dec 30 (Reuters) - He carried no weapons and helped keep government security forces alive, but Khairallah Dib still needed a promise of amnesty to come out of hiding.

He had been lying low for weeks after Alawite fighters staged a March insurrection against Syria’s new Islamist-led rulers. The uprising by loyalists of ousted President Bashar al-Assad killed more than 200 Syrian security forces and triggered days of vengeance .

The killings by government-affiliated forces left nearly 1,500 Alawites dead and led tens of thousands to flee out of fear for their lives. It broke the fragile relationship between Alawites, the sect from which Assad hailed, and the new government.

Syria’s new rulers have since tried to undo the damage by providing amnesty to people like Dib and others swept into the March violence, and offering limited economic aid to the wider community.

Reuters accompanied 
 people working with 
 the 
 government 
 committee 
 created 
 to oversee that process in the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartous, speaking to dozens of Alawite
 s who have received 
 its support and 15 Alawite former security officials now working with 
 Syria’s government. 
 The body is formally known as the Supreme Committee for the Preservation of Civil Peace.

Both the committee and its beneficiaries 
 described a fledgling and controversial attempt to win the loyalty of Syria’s Alawites,
 
 many of whom also suffered 
 poverty
 under Assad despite
 privileged access to state jobs given 
 their shared sect. Securing their allegiance could help the 
 new 
 government exert control over the region and 
 show progress on
 President Ahmed al-Sharaa
 ’s promise
 to govern for all Syrians.

Run by ex-militant leaders on opposing sides during Syria’s brutal 14-year war, the initiative offers financial help, jobs and medical services to hundreds of Alawites, including dozens of men who received amnesties in exchange for promising not to fight again or to help demobilize other fighters.

In response to questions for this story, civil peace committee member Hassan Soufan told Reuters the government was calibrating its efforts for Alawites with the vast needs of the wider Syrian population, including Sunnis harmed by Assad’s government.

“There is a balance we must strike” 
 to ensure everyone feels treated fairly
 , he said in an interview.

Soufan acknowledged some public anger that new authorities were cooperating with members of the fallen dictator’s security establishment. But he said Syria’s leadership took a longer view.

“The Syrian people should go forward. That doesn’t mean accepting the big crimes that took place. Those who committed serious crimes should be held accountable. But the vast majority of Syrians are innocent,” he said.

Dib has been one beneficiary of that forgiving approach.

He denied taking part in any violence during the March insurrection. He said h
 is only role was communication and that he additionally helped keep scores of security forces taken hostage by insurgents in Qardaha alive 
 and mediated their return.
 His account was confirmed by a government official familiar with his settlement.

“I decided to do something for the future,” Dib said from the cafe he set up in Assad’s hometown of Qardaha with money from the initiative.

A Reuters visit arranged by the committee found the cafe 
 frequented 
 by students, the unemployed and local elders.

The cafe helped Dib scrape together enough money to get engaged, which he had never been able to afford under Assad. He’s planning for kids.

“I want girls though. They're sweeter and cuter,” he said. “The boys always want to carry guns.”

THE UNLIKELY PEACEMAKERS

Those steering the committee have their own history of warfare.

Soufan, 
 a Sunni from Latakia, 
 is a former rebel commander.

Another is Khaled al-Ahmad, who helped Assad recapture territory during the war through surrender deals, then fell out with the dictator and eventually switched sides to back Sharaa, his childhood friend.

Ahmad’s man on the ground is Fadi Saqr, an Alawite who commanded an infamous pro-Assad militia known as the National Defense Forces, which was accused by rights groups of committing massacres, looting and extortion. Saqr is blacklisted by the U.S. , opens new tab and European Union for his role in wartime massacres.

Saqr denied any role in massacres in comments to Reuters but declined to answer further questions. Soufan has acknowledged Syria’s government is working 
 with Saqr
 , saying he helped prevent bloodshed when Assad fell.

Saqr’s involvement has led to criticism of the initiative as a skin-deep effort by the new government to cement its rule while allowing notorious regime figures to walk free.

“Who are you to forgive those who killed our people in the ugliest ways? And even more, you elevate them to become symbols of civil peace,” said Osama Othman, who more than a decade ago helped smuggle out thousands of pictures of dead detainees in Assad’s prisons, known as the “Caesar files.”

The government says amnesty candidates are vetted to ensure no one who committed serious crimes during the civil war is pardoned. But the process itself is opaque.

The Syrian Network for Human Rights says the committee’s power to grant amnesties and free detainees undermines transparency, accountability and an independent judiciary.

“Fadi Saqr’s efforts have done a lot to maintain literal peace but not much to ease fears and build trust in communities compared to other grassroots initiatives working with local officials,” said Gregory Waters, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Syria Program.

The work of the committee is also opposed by many in the Alawite community, including hardliners who see cooperation with Syria’s Islamist-led authorities as tantamount to treason. Individuals linked to the committee told Reuters they know they could be targeted by Alawite militants. An Alawite candidate in state-organized parliamentary elections was shot dead in September.

While Reuters was reporting on the committee’s work in Dalieh, 
 a remote and picturesque mountain village
 where the March insurrection began, an anti-government Alawite Facebook page alleged Saqr had brought the reporters there as part of “disgusting plans.” The journalists were followed out of the town by a car with tinted windows, which was ultimately warned off by a government security patrol.

Saqr was not present during the reporting trip, but members of his civil peace team were nearby during interviews with residents. Reuters later followed up with those residents by phone.

Some Alawites initially saw Assad's ouster last year as a potential opening for their broadly destitute community. Tens of thousands of former soldiers signed temporary settlements with the new government and relinquished their weapons.

But mass layoffs and killings of Alawites in the ensuing months left them feeling increasingly sidelined and fearful. Then, the March killings hardened distrust of Sharaa, who led Al Qaeda’s Syrian branch before disavowing the organization.

In a goodwill gesture, the committee has granted amnesty to at least 50 Alawite men linked to the March violence, Tartous governor Ahmed al-Shami told Reuters.

“We told them: ‘you were deceived ... were hasty and implicated yourself, we will be merciful with you and give you a second chance,’” Shami said.

The committee has also freed hundreds of Assad-era soldiers detained after his ouster and arranged more than 90 family visits to some of the thousands of others still imprisoned, a committee official said.

A mother of three former soldiers who are in prison said she was able to visit one of them in September, with the small but still unaffordable cost of travel covered by the committee.

The mother, who asked not to be named, said it was painful to observe her son through a pane of glass and she was only allowed to provide him with underwear.

“They haven't seen the new Syria yet,” she said, tears rolling down her cheeks. “They don’t know anything. They just know that they are in prison.”

Forgiven fighters provide information on people who might still be plotting attacks and help authorities find hidden caches of light arms and ammunition, according to Shami and a statement by the security chiefs of Latakia and Tartous. They also convince others not to fight.

After striking a settlement in April, one of Saqr’s former militiamen was given a job in carpentry. While he said he still wanted revenge for the Alawite blood spilled, the fighter, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisal, said no one wanted to fight anymore.

“People are tired. They just want security and to feed their kids,” he told Reuters.

Alawite residents on the coast said the efforts are too small to address vast damage from the March violence as well as entrenched poverty and persistent insecurity in the coastal areas. Soufan acknowledged the financial constraints.

“We are doing something symbolic that clears the air and gets us moving forward,” he told Reuters.

More than nine months after the violence, the committee says it has refurbished less than 10% of roughly 1,000 damaged homes.

Osama Twayyer, a 32-year-old Alawite in the Jableh countryside, said his extended family had 13 houses torched and livestock stolen in March. The committee has been unable to locate two of his relatives who have been missing since then, he said.

The committee began basic repairs in some of his relatives’ homes. But after Reuters visited in September, Twayyer said repairs ground to a halt.

He said fears of renewed violence were keeping people away from his garage, slashing his income.

“After 6 p.m., my own brother could knock on the door and I wouldn’t open it,” Twayyer said.

Alawite rallies in recent days and last month showed the challenges the committee faces.

On December 28, thousands of Alawites chanted for decentralized rule and the release of detainees. Their demonstration barely lasted an hour before they were confronted by a pro-government protest. Gunfire from security forces broke up that gathering
 
 and one last month with similar demands.

Authorities have launched public trials over the March violence. Their results remain a litmus test for accountability in the new Syria.

Wael Hasan, a 59-year-old farmer whose charred home the committee has promised to repair, told Reuters there was a long way to go before Syria’s communities could live together without fear.

“Deep inside, we’re ready for it. But right now it feels far away because justice and law must come first,” he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 07:25:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LU5K6IVSTRMHDMH5P6WVCZMJXY.jpg?auth=8e3e97c8b315cb59cbc4b891cee741d8f0805debcd46fface0cbfbea746f14d6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's president urges government to listen to protesters 'legitimate demands'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251230-iran-s-president-urges-government-to-listen-to-protesters-legitimate-demands</link><description>Iran 's president urged his government to listen to the "legitimate demands" of protesters, state media reported Tuesday, after several days of demonstrations by shopkeepers in Tehran over economic hardships.

Shopkeepers in the capital had shut their stores for the second day in a row on Monday, after Iran's embattled currency hit new lows on the unofficial market.

The US dollar was trading at around 1.42 million rials on Sunday – compared to 820,000 rials a year ago – and the euro nearing 1.7 million rials, according to price monitoring websites.

"I have asked the Interior Minister to listen to the legitimate demands of the protesters by engaging in dialogue with their representatives so that the government can do everything in its power to resolve the problems and act responsibly," President Masoud Pezeshkian said, according to the state-run IRNA news agency.

Protesters "are demanding immediate government intervention to rein in exchange-rate fluctuations and set out a clear economic strategy", the pro-labour news agency ILNA reported Monday.

Price fluctuations are paralysing the sales of some imported goods, with both sellers and buyers preferring to postpone transactions until the outlook becomes clearer, AFP correspondents noted.

"Continuing to do business under these conditions has become impossible," ILNA quoted protesters as saying.

The conservative-aligned Fars news agency released images showing a crowd of demonstrators occupying a major thoroughfare in central Tehran, known for its many shops.

Another photograph appeared to show tear gas being used to disperse protesters.

"Minor physical clashes were reported ... between some protesters and the security forces," Fars said, warning that such gatherings could lead to instability.

Iranian Chief Justice Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei called for "the swift punishment of those responsible for currency fluctuations", the justice ministry's Mizan agency reported Monday.

The government has also announced the replacement of the central bank governor.

"By decision of the president, Abdolnasser Hemmati will be appointed governor of the Central Bank," presidency communications official Mehdi Tabatabaei posted on X.

Hemmati is a former economy and finance minister who was dismissed by parliament in March because of the sharp depreciation of the rial.

Pezeshkian delivered on Sunday the budget for the next Persian year to parliament, vowing to fight inflation and the high cost of living.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics. But this figure still falls far short of many price increases, especially for basic necessities.

The country's economy, already battered by decades of Western sanctions, was further strained after the United Nations in late September reinstated international sanctions linked to the country's nuclear programme that were lifted 10 years ago.

The retired retail worker was learning how to use her new metal detector when it started bleeping by the moss-covered ruins of a building. After Plumridge dug the nugget out of the shallow dirt with a plastic trowel, a guide estimated it was around 0.2 of a gram of gold, worth about A$40 ($26.58).

“But to me, it’s worth a million dollars,” said the 63-year-old, who had bought the detector only a few days before. “My heart is singing.”

Plumridge's story is becoming more common, as hobbyists flock to Australia's 9,600 sq km "golden triangle" in the heart of Victoria state, known as one of the world's most prospective regions for gold nuggets.

Prospectors have been spurred on by record gold prices, social media, the success of TV show Aussie Gold Hunters, and a love for the outdoors, according to Reuters interviews with a dozen gold hunters.

Plumridge's detector, Minelab's Gold Monster 2000, which she bought for A$2,999, sold out across the country within weeks of its October 20 launch, according to Leanne Kamp, joint owner of Lucky Strike Gold, a prospecting shop in Geelong.

"It’s a great price point and we have seen a big jump in sales this year, partly because the gold price has got everyone’s interest," said Kamp, who has led prospecting tours since 2007.

"We get a lot of internationals. Next week we have some Germans coming. Germans love the gold. The Swiss seem to love the gold too. And we have some coming over from the U.S.,” she said.

The chance of finding nuggets on historic sites improves with each iteration of detectors, which is why there is a rush for new models as soon as they are released, she added.

Hobbyists have flocked to 19th-century gold rush towns like Ballarat, which laid the foundation for Melbourne's early wealth and helped make Australia one of the world's top three gold producers.

The region has yielded the world's biggest nugget, the Welcome Stranger at 72 kg, found in the 1860s, as well as the Hand of Faith, the largest nugget found with a metal detector at 27.2 kg in 1980. As recently as February 2023, an amateur prospector unearthed a 4.6 kg nugget in the region with a detector, according to the state government.

The lure of large nuggets is one of the draws for Damian Duke, 39, who works in construction. Duke used to go prospecting with his father who died three years ago. Now he takes his own son, Ethan.

The 11-year-old inherited his grandfather’s detector, and Duke has recently upgraded his machine, he told Reuters.

“Where prices are now, you do have the chance of striking a life-changing piece of gold," he said.

Gold has chalked up successive records this year, surging above $4,500 a troy ounce on Friday. Goldman Sachs expects prices will reach $4,900 by the end of 2026, with further gains likely if private investors continue diversifying their portfolios amid geopolitical and fiscal uncertainty.

In Victoria, fossickers must buy a permit from the state government. The permit allows them to fossick using only hand tools and to keep any gold they find.

Demand for the miner's right permits, which cost A$28.60 each and last for a decade, has hit all-time highs, at almost 16,000 by November, from nearly 11,000 last year, according to figures from Victoria's Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action, supplied exclusively to Reuters.

In total, there are more than 100,000 active miner’s right permits in Victoria.

A dream of riches may drive people to get out, but they stay out because of the psychological benefits that come from the focus on the hunt, being outside in nature, and connecting with others, prospectors said.

"It's really good for your mental health, being out here. You take it all in, you can't think about anything else - I love looking at all the wildflowers," said Kelly Smith, a 50-year-old from the country town of Koondrook, who was prospecting with her partner on a training session organised by The Gold Centre in Maryborough.

"You're not guaranteed to find anything. But you're not going to find anything at all if you don't look."

Victoria's latest gold rush is part of a broader phenomenon, said Ben Harvey, executive general manager of Minelab at Adelaide-headquartered Codan (CDA.AX) , opens new tab , which is the world's largest maker of hand-held metal detectors.

Alongside Codan's communications division, strong detector sales in its home market of Australia as well as in Africa and the Americas have helped double the firm's share price this year.

In Africa, demand may be led by artisanal miners working in cooperatives to improve their standard of living, Harvey said. In Latin America, there is also recreational interest from hobbyists searching for coins and other treasure, he told Reuters in an interview.

Behind the success is a push by Codan's team of engineers to improve technology to cut down on background noise so detectorists can focus on the gold, he said.

"What a prospector is looking for is, when they go out, they want to find gold, and they want to find more gold than they found last time," he said.

The downgrade comes at a delicate time for Budapest, which is run by the liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, as nationalist Prime Minister Orban will likely face parliamentary elections in April. The centre-right opposition Tisza party is leading most polls.

"The action follows the disclosure of Budapest's liquidity position highlighting concerns about the city's capacity to repay all of its obligations as required by 31 December 2025," Moody's said late on Monday.

"Uncertainty around the timing and receipt of ordinary transfers, together with very weak liquidity to absorb unexpected cash flow gaps, materially increases the city's near-term credit risk."

Moody's put Budapest's rating on review for a further downgrade "to reflect the increased risk of default and the potential acceleration of repayment of the city's long-term debt due to liquidity concerns."

On Facebook, Karacsony said the downgrade was the result of "the government's irrational and narrow-minded tax policy."

Budapest's leadership has been in conflict with Orban's government over the "solidarity tax," a levy the city has to pay to the state. Moody's said the tax rose 31% from a year earlier to 76 billion forints ($231.50 million) in 2024 and is expected to be 89 billion forints in 2025, or 21% of projected revenues.

"Ongoing legal disputes over the tax amount, which exceeds the funding received from the central government, add system instability and jeopardize the budgeting process and cash balances," Moody's said, adding the ratings also reflected the partial freezing of European Union funds to Hungary.

The EU has suspended billions of euros in funds to Hungary over the government's erosion of democratic rights, allegations that Orban denies.

Orban has said the government was ready to throw a financial lifeline to Budapest.

Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, a staunch ally of President Vladimir Putin who has also embarked on talks with the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, announced the deployment of the intermediate-range ballistic earlier this month.

Some Western experts have said that the deployment, which would make it slightly faster for Russian nuclear missiles to reach European targets in the event of a war, underscores the Kremlin’s growing reliance on the threat of nuclear weapons as it seeks to deter NATO members from supplying Kyiv with weapons that can strike deep inside Russia.

Two U.S. researchers have said that, according to their study of satellite images, Moscow is likely stationing the missiles and their mobile launchers at a former airbase in eastern Belarus.

Video released by the Belarusian Defence Ministry on Tuesday did not disclose the location of the missile systems, but showed mobile launchers and their crews driving along forest roads and specialist troops camouflaging the systems with netting.

A senior officer was shown telling troops that the systems had officially been placed on combat duty and, as light snow fell in the background, speaking of regular training and reconnaissance routines for the missile crews.

Moscow tested a conventionally armed Oreshnik – Russian for Hazel tree - against a target in Ukraine in November 2024.

The investigation looked into an alleged payment of 1.5 million euros ($1.8 million) for security at two homes in the Bavarian lakeside community of Rottach-Egern between April and September 2022.

Prosecutors also claimed that Usmanov failed to declare jewellery, paintings and wines to Germany's export control office, BAFA, in accordance with European Union sanctions rules. Usmanov has denied any wrongdoing.

Usmanov, who has a net worth of $18.8 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, is subject to EU and U.S. sanctions and a travel ban, which were imposed after the start of the war in Ukraine.

Usmanov's lawyers said he had no links to the companies involved in the alleged payments nor did he own or control the properties in question, adding that the EU sanctions were not directly applicable to the probe. Prosecutors were expected to release a statement on the matter later on Tuesday.

His lawyers said it was agreed to close the case to save time and resources. They added that their statement had been coordinated with the prosecutors.

They said Usmanov had agreed to pay 10 million euros split between the German state budget and German charity groups as part of an arrangement to close the probe. They said that the payment was neither a fine nor a form of punishment.

In November 2024, German prosecutors dropped a money laundering investigation against Usmanov on similar terms.

The Southeast Asian neighbours agreed on a ceasefire that took effect at noon (0500 GMT) on Saturday, halting 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides, and included fighter-jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages.

The border clashes reignited early this month, following the breakdown in a ceasefire deal that U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker to halt a previous round of conflict in July.

Under the agreement signed by the defence ministers of both countries on Saturday, Thailand said that after the ceasefire held for 72 hours it would release 18 Cambodian soldiers who have been in detention since July. By mid-afternoon on Tuesday there was no news on the status of the soldiers.

Earlier in the day, Thai Foreign Minister Sihasak Phuangketkeow said the ceasefire was fragile and needed both sides to ensure that it was sustained and that bilateral relations were gradually repaired.

"The ceasefire has only just been agreed so there is fragility," Sihasak told reporters. "We should avoid instigation or things that could diminish the ceasefire," he said.

On Monday, the Thai army said Cambodia had breached the ceasefire by flying more than 250 drones over Thailand on Sunday night, and threatened to reconsider the decision to hand over the detained Cambodian soldiers.

Cambodian authorities strongly rejected the accusation, and issued an order prohibiting the use of drones across the country.

The Thai Foreign Ministry also sent a formal protest to Cambodia after a Thai soldier lost a limb on Monday in a landmine blast at a border area.

Landmine incidents were a catalyst for the renewed clashes.

China's Foreign Minister hosted two days of talks with his Thai and Cambodian counterparts, reaching an agreement on Monday that the two countries would work to rebuild mutual trust and gradually consolidate the ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 08:55:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BHVGJP6QLNMRLHFJOW3TUDRSUE.jpg?auth=6f0652db4ee00b2625ebfb2d205b0862764680589960204c349ebdca6ae03148&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ASEAN to assess post-election developments in Myanmar, Malaysia PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/asean-assess-post-election-developments-myanmar-malaysia-pm-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KUALA LUMPUR, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Tuesday that leaders from the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN will consider developments in Myanmar following the first phase of its election over the weekend.

The polls are being held in several phases amid an ongoing civil war that has ravaged parts of Myanmar and led to one of Asia's worst humanitarian crises .

The election has been widely derided by the United Nations, Western governments and human rights groups as a sham and an attempt by the ruling junta to entrench military rule through political proxies.

The junta has denied the charge, saying the election was not being conducted through coercion or force and has public support.

Anwar, the current chair of the 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, said the bloc's leaders will monitor the situation in Myanmar with care, including steps underway that relate to the political process.

"Any assessment will proceed in a sequenced manner, guided by the need to reduce violence, avoid actions that could deepen divisions or confer premature legitimacy, and preserve the possibility of an inclusive and credible pathway forward," he said in a televised press conference.

Malaysia's foreign minister has previously said that ASEAN wants the election to be fair and inclusive, and also urged the Myanmar junta to adhere to a peace agreement it agreed with the bloc in 2021.

The "Five-Point Consensus" peace plan has been largely seen as a failure, with Myanmar's military rulers refusing to meet with opponents it deemed to be terrorists.

Myanmar has been in turmoil since the military overthrew a civilian democratic government in a 2021 coup, triggering an armed rebellion that has captured large swathes of territory across the country.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 09:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQNX7VTE4ZN5FPPQPSGSZBCDYA.jpg?auth=47d280b0eb7fa0754212d15f8cdfd3dc2334bd252cb0c7a9f903eabd9d758ad6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: China mandates 50% domestic equipment rule for chipmakers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-mandates-50-domestic-equipment-rule-chipmakers-sources-say-2025-12-30/</link><description>SINGAPORE, Dec 30 (Reuters) - China is requiring chipmakers to use at least 50% domestically made equipment for adding new capacity, three people familiar with the matter said, as Beijing pushes to build a self-sufficient semiconductor supply chain.

The rule is not publicly documented, but chipmakers seeking state approval to build or expand their plants have been told by authorities in recent months that they must prove through procurement tenders that at least half their equipment will be Chinese-made, the people told Reuters.

The mandate is one of the most significant measures Beijing has introduced to wean itself off reliance on foreign technology, a push that gathered pace after the U.S. tightened technology export restrictions in 2023, banning sales of advanced AI chips and semiconductor equipment to China.

While those U.S. export restrictions blocked the sale of some of the most advanced tools, the 50% rule is leading Chinese manufacturers to choose domestic suppliers even in areas where foreign equipment from the U.S., Japan, South Korea and Europe remain available.

Applications failing the threshold are typically rejected, though authorities grant flexibility depending on supply constraints, the people said. The requirements are relaxed for advanced chip production lines, where domestically developed equipment is not yet fully available.

"Authorities prefer if it is much higher than 50%," one source told Reuters. "Eventually they are aiming for the plants to use 100% domestic equipment."

China's industry ministry did not respond to a request for comment. The sources did not wish to be identified as the measure is not public.

China's President Xi Jinping has been calling for a "whole nation" effort to build a fully self-sufficient domestic semiconductor supply chain that involves thousands of engineers and scientists at companies and research centers nationwide.

The effort is being made across the wide supply-chain spectrum. Reuters reported earlier this month that Chinese scientists are working on a prototype of a machine capable of producing cutting-edge chips, an outcome that Washington has spent years trying to prevent.

"Before, domestic fabs like SMIC would prefer U.S. equipment and would not really give Chinese firms a chance," a former employee at local equipment maker Naura Technology (002371.SZ) , opens new tab said, referring to the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (0981.HK) , opens new tab .

"But that changed starting with the 2023 U.S export restrictions, when Chinese fabs had no choice but to work with domestic suppliers."

State-affiliated entities placed a record 421 orders for domestic lithography machines and parts this year worth around 850 million yuan, according to publicly available procurement data, signaling a surge in demand for locally developed technologies.

To support the local chip supply chain, Beijing has also poured hundreds of billions of yuan into its semiconductor sector through the "Big Fund ", which established a third phase in 2024 with 344 billion yuan ($49 billion) in capital.

The policy is already yielding results, including in areas such as etching, a critical chip manufacturing step that involves removing materials from silicon wafers to carve out intricate transistor patterns, sources said.

China's largest chip equipment group, Naura, is testing its etching tools on a cutting-edge 7nm (nanometre) production line of SMIC, two sources said. The early-stage milestone, which comes after Naura recently deployed etching tools on 14nm successfully, demonstrates how quickly domestic suppliers are advancing.

"Naura's etching results have been accelerated by the government requiring fabs to use at least 50% domestic equipment," one of the people told Reuters, adding that it was forcing the company to rapidly improve.

Advanced etching tools had been predominantly supplied in China by foreign firms such as Lam Research (LRCX.O) , opens new tab and Tokyo Electron (8035.T) , opens new tab , but are now being partially replaced by Naura and smaller rival Advanced Micro-Fabrication Equipment (AMEC) (688012.SS) , opens new tab , sources say.

Naura has also proven a key partner for Chinese memory chipmakers, supplying etching tools for advanced chips with more than 300 layers. It developed electrostatic chucks — devices that hold wafers during processing — to replace worn parts in Lam Research equipment that the company could no longer service after the 2023 restrictions, sources said.

Naura, AMEC, YTMC, SMIC, Lam Research, and Tokyo Electron did not respond to requests for comment.

China's progress is being viewed with concern by global competitors, as foreign suppliers are squeezed out of the China market.

Naura filed a record 779 patents in 2025, more than double what it filed in 2020 and 2021, while AMEC filed 259, according to Anaqua's AcclaimIP database, and verified by Reuters.

That's also translating into strong financial results. Naura's revenue for the first half of 2025 jumped 30% to 16 billion yuan. AMEC reported a 44% jump in first-half revenue to 5 billion yuan.

Analysts estimate that China has now reached roughly 50% self-sufficiency in photoresist-removal and cleaning equipment, a market previously dominated by Japanese firms, but now locally led by Naura.

"The domestic equipment market will be dominated by two to three major manufacturers, and Naura is definitely one of them," said a separate source.

Once the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

Here is a timeline of how the relationship has evolved:

2011: As the Arab Spring spreads, the two form a unified front against Islamist movements, deploying joint forces to Bahrain to quell an uprising and coordinating support for Egypt’s 2013 military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government.

March, 2015: They launch a military intervention in Yemen to restore the government ousted by the Iran-aligned Houthis. UAE troops lead ground operations, while Saudi air power controls the skies.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has dismissed the Russian accusations as "another round of lies" aimed to justify additional attacks against Ukraine and to prolong the war.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted Ukraine's denial of the drone attack - and said that many Western media were playing along with Kyiv's denial.

"This terrorist action is aimed at collapsing the negotiation process," Peskov told reporters. "The diplomatic consequence will be to toughen the negotiating position of the Russian Federation."

The Russian military, he said, knew how and when to respond.

"We see that Zelenskiy himself is trying to deny this, and many Western media outlets, playing along with the Kyiv regime, are starting to spread the theme that this did not happen," Peskov said. "This is a completely insane assertion."

Peskov declined to say where Putin was at the time of the attack, saying that in light of recent events such details should not be in the public domain.

When asked if Russia had physical evidence of the drone attack, he said air defences shot the drones down but that the question of wreckage was for the defence ministry.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:24:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4VEKYATHCNKTZBIGCDOQ6ODCGA.jpg?auth=f4b6179aaf0154ca9c834db678db97623c1d79457f510815d663d578507fdf72&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin says Russia is toughening its stance on Ukraine after drone attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-says-russia-is-toughening-its-stance-ukraine-after-drone-attack-2025-12-30/</link><description /><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:24:59 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>George Clooney, his wife Amal and their children obtain French citizenship</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/george-clooney-his-wife-amal-their-children-obtain-french-citizenship-2025-12-30/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Hollywood star George Clooney and his wife, human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, have obtained French citizenship, along with their two children, official French government documents show.

Clooney told broadcaster RTL earlier this month that it was essential for him and his wife that their eight-year-old twins Alexander and Ella could live in a place where they had a chance to live a normal life.

“Here, they don’t take photos of kids. There aren’t any paparazzi hidden at the school gates. That’s number one for us,” he told RTL on December 2.

The couple purchased a house on a vineyard, with an estimated value of around 9 million euros ($10.59 million), in the southern French town of Brignoles in 2021.

The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court, according to French media.

"We also have a house in the United States, but our happiest place is on this farm where the kids can have fun," he said.

U.S. film director Jim Jarmusch on Friday told France Inter radio that he would also make an application to obtain French citizenship.

"I would like to have another place to escape from America if necessary," he told France Inter.

"And France, and Paris, and French culture are very deep in me. So I think I would be very honored if I could have a French passport," he said.

"It is essential for Turkey to play a role of facilitator, constructively and aimed at dialogue ... This is crucial for both regional peace and to strengthen its own internal peace," Ocalan, founder of the Kurdistan Workers' Party ( PKK ) militant group, said in a message relayed by Turkey's pro-Kurdish DEM party.

Earlier this year, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) ended its four-decade armed struggle against Turkey at the urging of its jailed founder Abdullah Ocalan, shifting its focus to a democratic political struggle for the rights of Turkey's Kurdish minority.

The ongoing process has raised hopes among Kurds across the region, notably in Syria where the Kurds control swathes of territory in the north and northeast.

Turkey has long been hostile to the Kurdish SDF force that controls swathes of northeastern Syria, seeing it as an extension of PKK, and pushing for the US-backed force to integrate into the Syrian military and security apparatus.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 10:51:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/43654ba8-e55e-11f0-bad3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25328691950897.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's government offers dialogue to protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/irans-government-offers-dialogue-protesters-2025-12-30/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Iran's government said on Tuesday it would seek dialogue with protest leaders after demonstrations in Tehran and other cities over a plunge in the currency's value that has accelerated inflation, with the central bank chief resigning.

Protests, which included shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar, were held on Sunday and Monday according to Iranian state media, the latest demonstrations in the Islamic Republic where bouts of unrest have repeatedly erupted in recent years.

President Masoud Pezeshkian said in a social media post late on Monday that he had asked the interior minister to listen to "legitimate demands" of protesters. Government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said a dialogue mechanism would be set up and include talks with protest leaders.

"We officially recognise the protests ... We hear their voices and we know that this originates from natural pressure arising from the pressure on people's livelihoods," she said on Tuesday in comments carried by state media.

The Iranian rial has been falling as the economy has suffered from the impact of Western sanctions, sinking to a record low on Monday at around 1,390,000 to the U.S. dollar, according to websites monitoring open market rates.

"We have fundamental measures on the agenda to reform the monetary and banking system and maintain the purchasing power of the people," Pezeshkian posted on X.

Iranian media have said the government's recent economic liberalisation policies have put pressure on the open-rate rial market, where ordinary Iranians buy foreign currency.

In 2022, Iran was buffeted by protests across the country over price hikes, including for bread, a major staple .

Over the same period and into 2023, the country's clerical rulers faced the boldest unrest in years touched off by the death of a young Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of the morality police, who enforce strict dress codes.

Iranian security services suppressed previous rounds of protests with violent crackdowns and widespread arrests rather than dialogue.

Iran remains under intense international pressure, with U.S. President Donald Trump saying on Monday that he might back another round of Israeli airstrikes if Tehran resumed work on ballistic missiles or any nuclear weapons programme.

The U.S. and Israel carried out 12 days of airstrikes on Iran's military and its nuclear installations in June aimed at stopping what they believe were efforts to develop the means to build an atomic weapon.

Iran says its nuclear energy programme is entirely peaceful and that it has not tried to build a nuclear bomb.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:19:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/46ZYRWDPDNNVHOCZ3AMQSHRKOE.jpg?auth=203722e36d4bb544c44b0b6cca9f5449a1115ae6282b84a6b8a1dc53669da1e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ivory Coast's ruling party increases its majority in weekend vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ivory-coasts-ruling-party-increases-its-majority-weekend-vote-2025-12-30/</link><description>ABIDJAN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast's ruling party increased its majority in parliament in elections held at the weekend, while the main opposition party, led by former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam, lost half of its seats, provisional results showed.

The strong showing for the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace, or RHDP, should make it easier for President Alassane Ouattara to implement his agenda that includes luring private investment to French-speaking West Africa's largest economy, the world's biggest cocoa grower.

Ouattara, an 83-year-old former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund who secured a fourth term in October, has also said he would use his mandate to prepare the way for a new generation of political leaders.

The RHDP took 197 of 255 seats in the National Assembly in Saturday's elections, according to provisional results announced on Monday by the electoral commission, up from 163.

Thiam's Democratic Party of Ivory Coast, or PDCI, won 32 seats, down from 65, while independent candidates won 23 seats.

Voter turnout was 35.04%, down from 37.88% during the last legislative elections in 2021.

Ouattara first came to power in 2011 after a four-month war.

He was re-elected with more than 89% of the vote in the presidential contest on October 25 in which Thiam and former President Laurent Gbagbo were barred from running.

Gbagbo's party boycotted this year's legislative elections, saying they would not be credible.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 11:21:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X63UQXNYKBPEPEGTVPU4DRLZWU.jpg?auth=2951cab850ee3f67df798c16db92b6b8cc87e1fd4a956795a3811d5a5a1125ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia attacks Ukraine's Black Sea ports, damages civilian ship, Kyiv says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/russia-attacks-ukraines-black-sea-ports-damages-civilian-ship-kyiv-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Russia attacked infrastructure in Ukraine's Odesa region on Tuesday, damaging a civilian ship and facilities in the Black Sea ports of Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk, Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said.

Kuleba said a civilian Panama-flagged ship loaded with grains was damaged, and that oil storage tanks were also hit. One person was wounded, he said on the Telegram app.

"This is yet another targeted attack by Russia on civilian port infrastructure. The enemy is trying to disrupt logistics and complicate shipping," Kuleba said.

Despite the attacks, both ports continued to operate, he said.

Odesa and the wider nearby region are home to the Black Sea ports that are crucial for Ukraine's foreign trade and the survival of its wartime economy.

Ukraine is a major global producer and exporter of agricultural products. During nearly four years of the war, the role of Odesa and its two other ports - Pivdennyi and Chornomorsk - as major trading hubs grew as other Ukrainian ports were destroyed, occupied, or disrupted by Russia's forces.

In the past several months, maritime warfare between Ukraine and Russia has intensified. Both sides have attacked naval and commercial assets in the Black Sea and beyond.

Ukraine is increasingly using its sea drones for attacks on ships connected to Russia’s shadow fleet.

At the same time, Russia has stepped up its attacks on the city of Odesa and its port infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria imposes curfew in Latakia days after protests turn violent, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-imposes-curfew-latakia-days-after-protests-turn-violent-state-media-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - Syrian security forces imposed a curfew on Latakia city, a bastion of the country's Alawite minority, state media reported on Tuesday, days after four people were killed in protests that spiralled into violence.

Syria has been rocked by several episodes of sectarian bloodshed since longtime leader Bashar al-Assad, who hails from the Muslim Alawite community, was ousted by a rebel offensive last year and replaced by a Sunni-led government.

State media said the curfew was set to last from 5 p.m. (1400 GMT) on Tuesday until 6 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday.

Security forces reinforced their deployment in a number of neighborhoods in Latakia city on the Mediterranean coast, which witnessed riots on Monday that injured about a dozen people.

Thousands of Alawite protesters gathered on Sunday in Azhari Square in Latakia city to demand a decentralized political system in Syria and the release of thousands of Alawite prisoners.

A similar protest in November lasted barely an hour before being confronted by a rival protest in support of Syria's new government. Syrian security forces used gunfire to break up both.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W4GNKFLRVBM67IXHUZNGDUSBTQ.jpg?auth=7a270c0266c936ad246352c4395399e5d176cb5b30730cfd5427ce187de5fe6c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Polish prime minister says peace could be achieved in Ukraine within weeks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/polish-prime-minister-says-peace-could-be-achieved-ukraine-within-weeks-2025-12-30/</link><description>WARSAW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Peace could be achieved in Ukraine in a matter of weeks, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday after talks with other European leaders, Canada and NATO.

He made his remarks despite the Kremlin saying its negotiating position would toughen after accusing Kyiv of attacking a Russian presidential residence, an allegation that Kyiv said was baseless and intended to prolong the conflict.

"Peace is on the horizon, there is no doubt that things have happened that give grounds for hope that this war can end, and quite quickly, but it is still a hope, far from 100% certain," Tusk told a government meeting.

"When I say peace is on the horizon, I'm talking about the coming weeks, not the coming months or years. By January, we'll all have to come together... to make decisions about the future of Ukraine, the future of this part of the world."

Tusk said security guarantees offered to Kyiv by the United States were a reason to hope the conflict could end soon, but that Kyiv would need to compromise on territorial issues.

U.S. President Donald Trump said after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy on Sunday that they were "getting a lot closer, maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although "thorny issues" remained.

Zelenskiy said control of Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power station , which is in Russian hands, and the fate of the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine were still unresolved.

Russia wants Kyiv to withdraw troops from parts of the Donetsk region it has failed to occupy in almost four years of war since its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.

WHAT IS RUSSIA'S ACCUSATION?

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Monday accused Ukraine of attacking a presidential residence in the Novgorod region overnight with 91 long-range attack drones and said Russia would retaliate.

He said no one was injured and that although Moscow was not quitting talks on ending the war in Ukraine, its negotiating position was being reviewed following the attack, which he described as "state terrorism".

Lavrov did not provide any evidence for the accusation. He said Russia had already identified targets in Ukraine.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy dismissed the Russian accusations as "another round of lies" aimed at justifying additional attacks on Ukraine and to prolong the war under way since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.

"This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies," he said.

Russia has often launched hundreds of drones as well as firing missiles in almost daily attacks on Ukraine.

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha urged world leaders on Monday to condemn Russia over its allegations, and added on Tuesday: "Almost a day passed and Russia still hasn’t provided any plausible evidence to its accusations of Ukraine’s alleged 'attack on Putin’s residence'. And they won’t. Because there’s none. No such attack happened."

The Valdai residence, also known as "Uzhin" or "Dolgiye Borody", is a heavily guarded complex on the shores of Lake Valdai about 360 km (225 miles) north of Moscow.

It was unclear where Putin was at the time of the alleged attack but he held meetings on Saturday and Monday in the Kremlin. Putin has yet to comment in public on the situation and Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday that in light of recent events such details should not be in the public domain.

Shortly before Lavrov released his statement, Putin held a meeting in the Kremlin with Defence Minister Andrei Belousov, Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov and top generals about the war in Ukraine. He did not mention any Ukrainian drone attack on the residence.

Putin informed Trump of the attack on Monday.

"I don't like it. It's not good," Trump told reporters.

"It's one thing to be offensive," Trump said. "It's another thing to attack his house. It's not the right time to do any of that. And I learned about it from President Putin today. I was very angry about it."

After Lavrov's statement, Russia's defence ministry said 91 drones had been downed on their way to the presidential residence, including 49 shot down over the Bryansk region which is 450 km from Valdai, one over the Smolensk region and 41 over the heavily forested Novgorod region.

The defence ministry had not mentioned any attack on the residence in its earlier reports of military action. The governor of Novgorod, Alexander Dronov, had said air defence and fighter jets were shooting down Ukrainian drones.

Asked if Russia had physical evidence of the drone attack, Peskov said on Tuesday the question of wreckage was for the defence ministry.

Russia accused Ukraine in 2023 of attacking the Kremlin with drones in what it said was an attempt to assassinate Putin. Ukraine denied any involvement in the incident and accused Russia of manufacturing a pretext for an escalation of the war.

The New York Times later reported that U.S. intelligence agencies believed Ukraine's security services were behind the attack but that it was unclear whether Zelenskiy or his top officials were aware of the operation. Some officials believed Zelenskiy was not aware, it reported.

Russia said on Monday it would retaliate and that it will review its position in peace talks although it said it was not quitting the negotiations.

"The diplomatic consequence will be to toughen the negotiating position of the Russian Federation," Peskov said on Tuesday. He did not say what targets Russia might strike but that the military knew when and how to respond.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:44:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TDKA4EZPEVKUVLOEWMUCEBIMYY.jpg?auth=1ec45a9063500ee0520858e67785f5289bdfae66734a7d2700d6a6d19fd9571a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain exempts Airbus from Israeli tech ban</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spain-exempts-airbus-israeli-tech-ban-2025-12-30/</link><description>MADRID, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Spain has granted Airbus (AIR.PA) , opens new tab exceptional permission to produce aircraft and drones using Israeli technology at its Spanish plants even though it banned military and dual-use products from Israel two months ago over its war in Gaza .

Approved last Tuesday by the cabinet and defended by several ministers this week, the exemption reflects the pressure from companies and domestic interests that some of Europe's toughest critics of Israel's recent war have faced as they attempt to impose trade sanctions.

It also risks increasing tensions within the ruling coalition between the Socialists and their hard-left partner Sumar when the government is already weakened by internal disputes and scandals over corruption and accusations of sexual harassment.

Neither Airbus nor the defence ministry was immediately available for comment.

Spain in September passed a law to take "urgent measures to stop the genocide in Gaza", banning trade in defence material and dual-use products from Israel, as well as imports and advertising of products originating from illegal Israeli settlements.

Its consumer ministry on Tuesday ordered seven tourist accommodation websites to remove 138 advertisements for holiday homes in occupied Palestinian territories or face the threat of sanctions in Spain.

Spain has already blocked 200 attempts to buy material linked to Israel, its digital transformation minister Oscar Lopez told national broadcaster TVE on Tuesday.

Airbus, which employs about 14,000 people in Spain and accounts for 60% of its air and defence exports, was granted the first exception in a cabinet meeting last week, written minutes showed, citing the "great industrial and export potential" of its aircraft "considered essential ... for preserving thousands of highly skilled jobs in Spain".

The European aerospace company produces its A400M and C295 transport planes, an A330 MRTT refuelling aircraft and SIRTAP surveillance drones at its sites in Madrid and Seville, all using Israeli technology.

The company is working with Spain's Ministry of Defence on a "plan to disconnect from Israeli technology", according to the minutes published last Tuesday, which did not provide further details.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:22:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NZV6T6A56FP5ZNXBF6Z3WRAV4Q.jpg?auth=2e742ec4ca5152205ad0be6bd51ae11432199dd1ade5cca1d2b3a95df5fc821b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, partner forces killed or captured nearly 25 Islamic State operatives since strikes in Syria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-partner-forces-killed-or-captured-nearly-25-islamic-state-operatives-since-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The United States and its partner forces killed or captured nearly 25 Islamic State operatives since it launched retaliatory strikes in Syria earlier this month, the U.S. military said on Tuesday.

The lawsuit alleged that action by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security was unlawful and exposed them to being deported to a country facing a series of humanitarian crises.

South Sudan has been ravaged by conflict since winning independence from Sudan in 2011. Fighting has persisted in much of the country since the end in 2018 of a five-year civil war that killed an estimated 400,000 people, and the U.S. State Department advises citizens not to travel there.

The United States began designating South Sudan for temporary protected status, or TPS, in 2011.

That status is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

About 232 South Sudanese nationals have been beneficiaries of TPS and have found refuge in the United States, and another 73 have pending applications for that same protection, according to the lawsuit.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem published a notice on November 5 terminating TPS for South Sudan, saying the country no longer met the conditions for the designation.

Her department has moved to similarly end temporary protections to foreign nationals from countries including Syria , Venezuela , Haiti , Cuba and Nicaragua, prompting several court challenges.

"With the renewed peace in South Sudan, their demonstrated commitment to ensuring the safe reintegration of returning nationals, and improved diplomatic relations, now is the right time to conclude what was always intended to be a temporary designation," a Homeland Security Department spokesperson said in a statement ahead of the court ruling.

The lawsuit argues the agency's action violated the statute governing the TPS program, ignored the dire humanitarian conditions that remain in South Sudan, and was motivated by discrimination against migrants who are not white in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:49:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IIVEYADSFFPBTPSINDLSK3DXEU.jpg?auth=4624682c77119d5b92492184ef8774bacd7d92318f0c58d3c8b1a92b26d9d7a8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Power failure halts Channel Tunnel rail traffic, causing travel mayhem</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eurostar-flags-severe-delays-cancellations-due-power-supply-issues-channel-2025-12-30/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Train services through the Channel Tunnel linking Britain and continental Europe were suspended on Tuesday following a power supply failure, disrupting peak winter holiday travel.

A spokesperson for Eurostar, which operates high-speed trains linking London to Paris, Brussels, Amsterdam and Disneyland Paris, said services were halted indefinitely. Travellers at Paris' Gare du Nord station were told operations would be interrupted until the end of the day.

Getlink (GETP.PA) , opens new tab , which operates the tunnel infrastructure and the Le Shuttle service carrying cars and trucks, said repairs to the power supply were underway and that traffic was expected to resume gradually from 1400 GMT.

"Due to a problem with the overhead power supply in the Channel Tunnel and a subsequent failed Le Shuttle train, we strongly advise all our passengers to postpone their journey to a different date," Eurostar said in a statement.

The disruption affects one of Europe’s busiest international rail corridors at the height of the New Year travel season.

Several hundred Le Shuttle passengers were stuck in their vehicles after passing through passport checks and security at the terminal in Folkestone.

Officials said that for the time being they could neither go forward - there were no trains - nor backwards, because they had already crossed into the French control zone.

Alison Raby said she had booked a day trip to a theme park in Belgium, but the four-hour delay made the excursion pointless.

"We’re stuck, basically,” she told Reuters.

Fellow passenger Phil Groves, who works for Britain's National Health Service and was en route to Paris for New Year's Eve, said he and his family had been stuck at Folkestone for six hours and were held in a "mammoth queue".

"We've received no information other than the services are suspended," he said.

Britain's Port of Dover said it was operating a 'turn up and go' system for passengers affected by the tunnel disruption and that ferry operators currently had capacity to take extra travellers.

Le Shuttle carried 2.2 million passenger vehicles and 1.2 million trucks through the tunnel in 2024. Eurostar carried 19.5 million customers in the same year, its most successful to date.

Stranded passengers crowded the concourse at London's St Pancras station. One was led away by police, shouting "I just want to know if I'll see my family" after an exchange with a Eurostar worker.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:50:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X4FXH77Z55OJZHKBXVBTU5FMQM.jpg?auth=128228a3fde54085106dc8db738fdd128042d7f40634df0d8b1ea482ee1eb635&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Poland acts to improve status of same-sex couples with cohabitation bill</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/poland-acts-improve-status-same-sex-couples-with-cohabitation-bill-2025-12-30/</link><description>WARSAW, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Poland's government approved a bill on Tuesday introducing "cohabitation contracts" for couples living together, a measure of recognition for same-sex unions in one of the few European Union countries with few rights for LGBT people.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who took office in 2023 pledging to reverse arch-conservative party policies criticised by Brussels for undermining democracy and minority rights, has struggled to deliver reforms on abortion and LGBT rights.

Those have faced resistance from his conservative junior coalition partner PSL and veto threats from two successive presidents aligned with the right-wing nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party that lost power in the 2023 election.

"We are going to the parliament with a conciliation project for which we believe there is a majority in the lower and upper House," Katarzyna Kotula, the government official overseeing equality issues, told reporters after a cabinet session.

The bill would allow two people, regardless of gender, to sign a cohabitation contract at a notary’s office. It covers housing rights, alimony, access to health information and health insurance, care leave, joint tax returns and tax exemptions.

The measure stops short of legalising same-sex marriage, which remains banned.

Tusk's pro-European government hopes the limited scope of the bill will secure approval from nationalist President Karol Nawrocki. LGBT groups voiced frustration but said the measure might be the only one with any chance to pass in parliament.

"This is not a moment of triumph. After two years of Donald Tusk's government, the ruling coalition has finally developed a joint proposal," the Campaign Against Homophobia said in a statement after the initial publication of the bill.

"This is not the bill we've been fighting for over the years. It's a meagre response to great expectations – and the only one that, in the current situation, can offer any sense of security."

Mostly Catholic Poland remains among the most restrictive EU states on LGBT rights, despite growing public support for legal recognition of same-sex couples.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 14:50:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3C2VZQBKX5IVBL6YAQYP3E3IAU.jpg?auth=223d7c9ed2b3d60fa561d796128d43df7b4a7a0c61c14fd12d0d584a367f7ffd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Shootings in Sweden halved in 2025 as police tackle gang crime</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/shootings-sweden-halved-2025-police-tackle-gang-crime-2025-12-30/</link><description>STOCKHOLM, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The number of shootings in Sweden has more than halved since hitting a peak in 2022, reflecting new policing approaches introduced by the right-wing government, which is readying for parliamentary elections next year.

Shooting incidents fell to 147 so far this year, a 63% decrease compared to 2022 when there were 390 shootings and a 49% decrease compared to 2024, according to a Reuters analysis of official figures.

The number of fatalities, however, was unchanged from last year at 43, though lower than the 62 killed in 2022.

The government won the 2022 election on a pledge to stop gang crime and drastically reduce immigration. It trails the opposition in opinion polls ahead of the next election in September, but the gap has narrowed.

Gang-related crime has been high in Sweden for more than two decades and, over that period, the amount of gun violence has risen to among the highest in Europe from among the lowest.

Among those killed this year, 11 died in a school shooting in February, which was not gang-related.

"New tools, resources and methods are starting to hit the criminal networks," Sweden's Minister of Justice Gunnar Strommer told Reuters, but said more needed to be done. "I want to remain humble. This is complicated and we still have levels of violence no decent society can accept."

Legislation that has drawn criticism from lawyers and some politicians has introduced changes such as anonymity for some court witnesses, increased electronic surveillance, tougher sentences and what are known as safety zones, where police can search people even if they are not suspected of any crime.

Johan Olsson, head of the Police National Operations Department, said the measures had allowed police to seize gangs' assets and become more efficient in preventing shootings.

"Where we don't see much success is stopping the recruitment to the gangs," he told Reuters, adding that much of the recruitment happened online.

Sweden has around 17,500 active gang members, according to police figures.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:44:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KB7AMZVGBRIVVNYTU5SRCPVTWI.jpg?auth=75626b9c8863368fb3f22f0d2dd9851629b096150f2b900b978952dc94de0f68&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine, 'Coalition of the Willing' to meet early January, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-coalition-willing-meet-early-january-zelenskiy-says-2025-12-30/</link><description>KYIV, Dec 30 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that Ukraine and the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' group of nations backing Kyiv plan to hold their next meetings at the start of January.

The move followed a Saudi-led coalition airstrike on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla.

UAE-backed separatists in Yemen dismissed the calls to withdraw and vowed to hold and reinforce their territory.

"There is no thinking about withdrawal. It is unreasonable for the landowner to be asked to leave his own land. The situation requires staying and reinforcing," said Anwar Al-Tamimi, the spokesman for the separatist Southern Transitional Council (STC), in comments to AFP.

The attack on ‍what Riyadh said was a UAE-linked weapons shipment marked the most significant escalation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to date in a widening rift between the two Gulf powers.

Once ​the twin pillars of regional security, the two Gulf heavyweights have seen their interests diverge on ​everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

Declaring its national security a red line, Saudi Arabia earlier on Tuesday alleged the UAE had pressured Yemen's southern separatists to conduct military operations that had reached the kingdom's borders .

It was Riyadh's strongest language yet in the falling-out between the neighbours, who once cooperated in a coalition against Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthis but whose interests in Yemen have steadily grown apart in recent years.

Frictions grew inside the coalition as Abu Dhabi backed southern separatists seeking self-rule while Riyadh kept supporting Yemen's internationally recognised government, eventually creating an open rift ‍between the Gulf allies.

On Tuesday the coalition struck what it said was a dock used to provide foreign military support to the UAE-backed separatists. The head of Yemen's Saudi-backed ​presidential council gave Emirati forces an ultimatum of 24 hours to leave.

The UAE said in a statement that it had been surprised by the airstrike, and that the shipment that had been attacked did not contain weapons and was ‌destined for Emirati forces.

Yemen's presidential council head, Rashad al-Alimi, cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, the Yemeni state news agency said, and accused the UAE in a televised speech of fuelling strife in ‍Yemen with its support for the separatist Southern Transitional Council.

"Unfortunately, it has been definitively confirmed that the United Arab Emirates pressured and directed the STC to undermine and rebel against the authority of the state through military escalation," he said.

The UAE earlier stressed that "dealing with recent developments must be done responsibly and in a way that prevents escalation, based on reliable facts and existing coordination between the concerned parties".

Major stock indexes in the Gulf fell. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are both major players in the OPEC+ oil exporters' group, and any disagreements between ‍the two could hamper consensus on oil output decisions.

They and six other OPEC+ members are meeting online on Sunday, and OPEC+ delegates say they will ‌continue their current policy for ​no change in first-quarter production.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 15:46:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1284f68c-e590-11f0-962b-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/Yemen-new-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US issues sanctions related to Iran and Venezuela weapons trade</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-issues-sanctions-related-iran-venezuela-weapons-trade-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Tuesday it has added 10 individuals and entities based in Iran and Venezuela to its sanctions list, citing their aggressive weapons program.

The U.S. Treasury has designated Venezuela-based Empresa Aeronautica Nacional SA and its chair, Jose Jesus Urdaneta Gonzalez, who it said have contributed to Iran's trade of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), or drones, with Venezuela.

"Urdaneta, on behalf of EANSA, has coordinated with members and representatives of the Venezuelan and Iranian armed forces on the production of UAVs in Venezuela," Treasury said in a statement.

"We will continue to take swift action to deprive those who enable Iran’s military-industrial complex access to the U.S. financial system," said John Hurley, the department's undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence.

The U.S. has ramped up pressure on Venezuela in recent months, executing a large-scale military buildup in the southern Caribbean.

The statement, published online by the British Foreign Office, said Israel should allow non-governmental organisations to work in Israel in a sustained and predictable way, and ensure the U.N. could continue its work in the Palestinian enclave.

"(We) express serious concerns about the renewed deterioration of the humanitarian situation in Gaza which remains catastrophic," read the statement from the foreign ministers of Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

It also said Israel should lift what it called "unreasonable restrictions" on certain imports including medical and shelter equipment, and open border crossings to increase the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October after two years of intense Israeli bombardment and military operations in Gaza that followed a deadly attack by Hamas-led fighters on Israeli communities in October 2023.

A global hunger monitor said on December 19 that there was no longer famine in Gaza after access for humanitarian and commercial food deliveries improved following the ceasefire.

But humanitarian agencies say far more aid needs to get into the small, crowded territory and that Israel is blocking needed items from entering. Israel says more than enough food gets in and that the problems are with distribution within Gaza.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:29:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J3TUJE2K6RNWXLBR67XGE6HVFE.jpg?auth=537314f481a89b38d0ea7a8684cdeefb5f43afdd3eefb3aa88ca70dd1351af35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey's Erdogan says Israeli decision to recognise Somaliland unacceptable, illegal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkeys-erdogan-says-israeli-decision-recognise-somaliland-unacceptable-illegal-2025-12-30/</link><description>ANKARA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Israel's decision to formally recognise of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland was an illegal and unacceptable step, adding that it was trying to drag the horn of Africa into destabilisation.

Nasralla finished second to conservative candidate Nasry Asfura, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump and was declared the winner on Christmas Eve, more than three weeks after the November 30 election.

Less than 1% of votes separated the two candidates, according to the CNE, Honduras' electoral authority.

Nasralla's legal team filed an appeal with Honduras' Electoral Justice Tribunal (TJE) on Monday, prompting the tribunal to issue a resolution late on Monday evening calling for additional documentation before it decides whether to admit the challenge.

"There have been too many inconsistencies in this electoral process," Nasralla's lawyer Karla Romero said on Monday night, asserting that in many departments of the country, votes for Asfura had been "inflated."

Nasralla's lawyers have not made evidence of fraud presented in the appeal publicly available.

Asfura's party has denied Nasralla's accusations of fraud.

Nasralla, a centrist who has unsuccessfully run for president twice before, is seeking a comprehensive review and recount of presidential ballots in at least 12 of Honduras' 18 departments.

The TJE has set a 48-hour deadline for the CNE to submit paperwork pertaining to the recount requests.

The challenge unfolds amid heightened political tension and public mistrust in the electoral process.

Nasralla, who also disputed his loss in the 2017 general election, rejected the CNE's declaration of Asfura's victory last week, saying the electoral authority had excluded ballots that should have been counted.

The head of the Honduran Congress, from the ruling Libre party, has also rejected the results. Libre supporters demonstrated outside the CNE headquarters in Tegucigalpa on Monday.

Asfura is due to take office on January 27 for the 2026-2030 term.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:22:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/44N6V3BKIVP6RI47F4XWMBSRZA.jpg?auth=573923b6834399a0cebb9b6ed1abf1bead6cb326789989f2e8f678954a6fc04f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Why China is bringing out the big guns for military drills around Taiwan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251230-why-china-is-bringing-out-the-big-guns-for-military-drills-around-taiwan</link><description>On the first day of a massive military exercise around the island of Taiwan on Monday, menacing, AI-generated scenes frame the narrative in a propaganda video released by China : An eagle transforms into an attack drone, fish become frigates and destroyers and wolves running through a forest turn into robot soldiers storming a ravaged city.

The clip, which was shared by the China Daily English-language newspaper and other platforms, presents a dehumanised, victimless vision of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, which Beijing considers part of its sovereign territory.

“I suppose the animals represent the natural, almost instinctive, nature of the military operation, while the machines and weapons symbolise the controlled and precise aspect of the invasion. The message is that this is not a political choice, but a natural, inevitable and bloodless process,” said Simona Grano, head of research on China-Taiwan relations at the University of Zurich’s Institute of Asian and Oriental Studies.

China ended the year with two days of war games, code-named "Justice Mission 2025" and involving a massive show of force with the deployment of frigates, destroyers, fighter jets, bombers, drones and missiles as well as heavy artillery.

They were accompanied by bellicose official statements, including a “stern warning” by the Chinese military to “separatist” and “external interference” forces that might be “plotting” Taiwan’s independence.

In one post on the Chinese social media site Weibo, the military's Eastern Theatre Command, which is responsible for the Taiwan Strait, thundered that, “All those plotting independence will be annihilated upon encountering the shield of justice!”

Watch more Chinese military releases footage of drills around Taiwan

On the second day of its most extensive war games to date, China fired rockets that fell into Taiwan’s contiguous zone, according to Taiwan’s defence ministry, referring to the waters off the democratically self-governed island.

“Justice Mission 2025” also featured live-fire exercises, which have not been conducted since April.

“These manoeuvres are all the more significant because they are a joint operation involving land, naval, air and rocket forces,” noted Jonathan Sullivan, a China specialist at the University of Nottingham. But overall, “the Chinese military is not demonstrating anything it has not demonstrated before”, he said.

Beijing has stepped up its military drills since the summer of 2022, when Nancy Pelosi , then speaker of the US House of Representatives, visited Taiwan, an act Beijing viewed as a provocation.

Since then, the Chinese military has been keen to demonstrate “its ability to quickly organise a complete air and sea blockade of the island in preparation for a [land] invasion”, explained Zeno Leoni, a specialist in Chinese security issues at King's College London.

Grano notes that over the past few years, “the Chinese armed forces are moving a little closer to Taiwan's territorial waters, which is in line with Beijing’s gradual strangulation tactic”.

Beyond the impressive military mobilisation, the latest exercises are significant because they come at a crucial moment for Chinese President Xi Jinping . “The geopolitical context has changed a lot since the last exercises nine months ago,” noted Grano.

“Relations between China and the United States, which were particularly poor in April due to the tariff war, improved slightly after the meeting between Xi Jinping and Donald Trump at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) summit at the end of October,” Sullivan said.

The easing of ties after the Trump-Xi meeting didn’t last very long. Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced a huge arms sale worth around $11 billion to Taiwan, which includes advanced rocket-launchers, self-propelled howitzers and a variety of missiles. It was the second package of arms sales to Taipei since Trump returned to the White House in January.

The Chinese authorities “felt betrayed by Washington's approval of one of the largest arms sales to Taiwan last week”, Sullivan explained.

Beijing felt compelled to set the record straight and reiterate its determination to eventually integrate Taiwan into its territory.

For more US arms package to Taiwan seen as a 'move to use Taiwan to contain China'

The US was not the only major player to offend Chinese nationalist sensibilities in recent weeks. Beijing also took issue with Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi 's statement in November that any conflict in Taiwan would be a matter of national security for Japan .

“China perceived this statement as a threat of Japanese intervention on Taiwan's side in the event of a conflict, which it considers unacceptable,” said Leoni. “It is true that, given its proximity to the Japanese islands, the fate of this territory is important to Japan. But in the current context, Sanae Takaichi's statements may appear diplomatically clumsy,” he added.

For Beijing, the Japanese leader’s statement along with the US arms sales announcement was viewed as “external interferences”, representing “a setback for the Chinese diplomatic narrative, which insists on the internal nature of the Taiwan issue”, Grano explained.

But China’s latest show of force near Taiwanese ports is not just a signal to foreign powers tempted to strongly support Taipei. It is also a way of hitting Taiwan where it hurts.

“These military exercises are intended to further weaken [Taiwan’s] President Lai Ching-te , who is already under strong internal pressure from opposition parties,” said Grano.

“He faces impeachment proceedings next May. Opposing him, the Kuomintang party has been given a boost by public opinion, which is clearly wary of Lai Ching-te's hardline anti-China stance. This Beijing-friendly party also recently appointed a new chairwoman, Cheng Li-wun, who is more openly pro-China than her predecessor,” explained Sullivan.

“It's a message to the Taiwanese people saying, ‘Look what's in store for you if you continue to support someone like Lai Ching-te,’” said Grano.

Practically speaking, the Chinese army also needs to reassure itself and others. These exercises are the first major test for Yang Zhibin, who was appointed commander-in-chief of the Eastern Theatre Command in September. “It is one of the most sensitive and important positions in the Chinese army,” said Leoni.

His predecessor, Lin Xiangyang, was accused of corruption and dismissed from the army, while the political commissar for the Eastern Theatre Command, Liu Qingsong, has simply disappeared for several months. A large-scale military exercise “allows the Chinese public to see that the military command is strong and that the page has been turned on the scandals”, said Grano.

And this messaging is not just catering to domestic audiences. “The purges of military personnel have led to speculation in the West that Xi Jinping was losing control of his army,” Sullivan noted. Organising highly ambitious manoeuvres just two months after the arrival of a new commander-in-chief of the Eastern Theatre Command is Beijing's way of saying, ‘Move along, there's nothing to see here.’”

They did not elaborate on the suspected planned attack or on their suspicions that the man was a member of Islamic State.

The man was arrested on December 18 in his house in Vlissingen in the southwest of the Netherlands, and a court on Tuesday ruled that his detention would be extended by at least 30 days as an investigation continued.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 17:46:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey arrests 357 people in operation against Islamic State group</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251230-turkey-arrests-357-people-in-operation-against-islamic-state-group</link><description>Turkish security forces on Tuesday arrested 357 people during operations across the country against the Islamic State group (also known as ISIS), Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said.

"During simultaneous operations carried out this morning by our police forces in 21 provinces, we apprehended 357 suspects linked to ISIS," the minister said on X, using another name for the group.

"We have never given the slightest chance to those who try to bring this country to its knees through terrorism ."

Three police officers were killed Monday during an operation against the group in Yalova, in northwestern Turkey .

The clash, which lasted several hours, also left six IS group members dead, all Turkish nationals.

Last Thursday, the Istanbul prosecutor ordered the arrest of 137 suspected IS group members "following intelligence indicating that the ISIS terrorist organisation was planning attacks during the Christmas and New Year celebrations".

Zelenskiy told the media in a WhatsApp chat that Kyiv was committed to continuing talks on how to end the war triggered by Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion and he was ready to meet Putin in any format.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he and Zelenskiy were "maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although "thorny" territorial issues lingered. He was more cautious than Zelenskiy on security guarantees, but said they were 95% of the way to such an agreement and that he expected European countries to "take over a big part" of that effort with U.S. backing.

On Tuesday, Russia said its negotiating stance would toughen after it accused Kyiv of attacking one of Putin's Russian presidential residences - an allegation that Kyiv said was baseless and intended to scuttle arduous peace talks.

Zelenskiy said in his WhatsApp chat that a U.S. troop presence in Ukraine would be a major security boost for Kyiv.

"Of course, we are discussing this with President Trump and with representatives of the (Western) coalition (supporting Kyiv). We want this. We would like this. This would be a strong position of the security guarantees," he said.

The White House had no comment on the issue of dispatching U.S. troops to Ukraine under any peace settlement with Russia.

Zelenskiy said he was willing to meet Putin despite the deep lack of mutual trust he underlined on Monday.

"I told President Trump, European leaders I am ready for any format of meeting with Putin. I am not afraid of any format ... The main thing is for Russians not to be afraid."

Russia said on Monday Kyiv had targeted a presidential residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones, all of which it said it had intercepted.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the alleged attack as "state terrorism" and said Moscow had already identified targets for retaliatory strikes in Ukraine.

The Kremlin provided no physical evidence of the alleged incident, saying it would retaliate and review its negotiating stance but would not quit talks on a possible peace deal.

Zelenskiy said earlier on Tuesday: "This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies."

In Paris, a source close to French President Emmanuel Macron said there was no substance to corroborate Moscow's accusation of an attack on Putin’s residence.

"Ukraine and its partners are committed to a path of peace, while Russia has chosen to continue and intensify its war against Ukraine. This is in itself an act of defiance against President Trump's peace agenda," the source said.

The White House declined further comment on the reported attack on Putin's residence after Zelenskiy said he brought it up with Trump, who on Monday said he was informed of the matter by Putin and was angry about it. Asked if there was evidence of such an attack, Trump said, "We'll find out."

In Warsaw, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Tuesday peace could be achieved in Ukraine within weeks thanks to U.S. security guarantees although success remained "far from 100% certain".

Tusk also hinted at the possibility of U.S. troops being sent to the line of contact between Ukraine and Russia, but he gave no details of such a proposal and the White House did not immediately comment on his remarks.

Tusk, whose country is one of Kyiv's closest Western allies, underlined the need for movement on territorial issues. Russia had demanded Ukrainian forces withdraw from the last part of the Donbas area in eastern Ukraine that they still hold nearly four years after Russia's invasion. Kyiv wants fighting halted along current front lines.

Amid the intensifying peace diplomacy, Russia launched more waves of drones against port infrastructure and civilian ships in Ukraine's Odesa region on Tuesday, Ukrainian navy and government officials said.

Odesa and the wider region nearby are home to the Black Sea ports that are crucial for Ukraine's foreign trade and the survival of its wartime economy.

In the past several months, maritime warfare between Ukraine and Russia has intensified. Both sides have attacked naval and commercial assets in the Black Sea and beyond.

Ukraine is increasingly using its sea drones for attacks on ships connected to Russia’s sanctions-busting shadow fleet.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CYSOHZ7XKZPWNK3TUM77ZDUMJI.jpg?auth=41a3d03035d4c141280cc48ebb2b52a67f924bccc5e3af030ce6d74b5e2ee3f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thieves drill into German bank vault and make off with millions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/thieves-drill-into-german-bank-vault-make-off-with-millions-2025-12-30/</link><description>BERLIN, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Thieves used the quiet Christmas period to drill their way into the vault of a German retail bank and make off with at least 10 million euros' worth of money and valuables from customers' deposit boxes, police said on Tuesday.

The perpetrators drilled through a thick concrete wall at a branch of Sparkasse bank in the western city of Gelsenkirchen and then broke into several thousand safe deposit boxes and stole a sum estimated in the double-digit millions of euros, the police said in a statement.

Most shops and banks close in Germany over the Christmas period starting from the evening of December 24, and police only discovered the hole after a fire alarm went off in the early hours of Monday, December 29.

Dozens of angry customers gathered in front of the bank on Tuesday loudly chanting "Let us in!".

"I couldn't sleep last night. We're getting no information," one man told the Welt broadcaster as he waited outside the branch, adding that he had been using the safe for 25 years and that it contained his savings for old age.

Another man said he used his deposit box to store cash and jewellery for his family.

A spokesperson for the Sparkasse bank in Gelsenkirchen did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Police said witnesses have reported that they saw several men on Saturday night carrying large bags in the stairwell of an adjacent parking garage.

There were also reports of a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage early on Monday morning with masked men inside. The vehicle's licence plate was that of a car stolen in Hanover, more than 200 kilometres to the northeast of Gelsenkirchen, police said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FNHIFKWLSNOS5NM5MU4NXYTEFM.jpg?auth=931def1bf922e267777e1c57e72e6aca860e437a5bcf9f75e02a16530c760a8c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mexico train derailment piles pressure on Sheinbaum over safety of megaprojects</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/mexico-train-derailment-piles-pressure-sheinbaum-over-safety-megaprojects-2025-12-30/</link><description>MEXICO CITY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum deferred questions on Tuesday about the record of a passenger train that derailed over the weekend, killing 13 people and injuring 98 others, the latest in a series of accidents that have put pressure on her government to improve the safety of flagship projects.

The conductor of the train, who survived, has been taken in for questioning, and opposition lawmakers have called for an investigation.

"The prosecutor's office has already interviewed the operator and several other people - they will have to report what happens next," Sheinbaum said at her regular press conference on Tuesday.

The crash in the southern state of Oaxaca marks the third train accident this year in Mexico. The new tourist-focused Mayan Train in the Yucatan Peninsula has suffered two derailments. No one was killed in those accidents.

Mexico's military operates both the Mayan Train and the Interoceanic Train that derailed on Sunday, which has led some to question both its role and what the Sheinbaum government is doing to deliver safety on flagship infrastructure projects.

"The government should be very concerned with the safety record and go to great lengths to determine the cause of the derailment," said Gustavo Flores-Macias, dean of the University of Maryland School of Public Policy.

Survivors told local news outlets that Sunday's crash happened as the train rounded a curve. It occurred on the Interoceanic Railway of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a narrow stretch of land connecting the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico.

The railway forms part of a trade and transit project known as the Interoceanic Corridor, which was launched in 2023 by Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor, former President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, with the aim of creating an alternative to the Panama Canal.

But the project has faced multiple allegations of corruption, weak oversight and potential conflicts of interest.

Mexico's federal audit office reported irregularities in four Interoceanic Train construction contracts, including overpayment for materials, in a 2020 report.

Following Sunday's crash, local media outlets also reported that companies linked to associates of Lopez Obrador's sons may have benefited from government contracts tied to major infrastructure projects, including the Interoceanic Train.

Lopez Obrador has denied the accusations, calling them politically motivated.

Opposition lawmakers called for an independent investigation into the accident. Alejandro Moreno, leader of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), urged the government to suspend all projects linked to the former president's sons and their business partners.

Senator Mario Vazquez of the opposition National Action Party (PAN) called the derailment "criminal negligence."

The accident risks denting confidence in Sheinbaum's broader infrastructure agenda, said Antonio Ocaranza, a Mexican political consultant.

"The discussion surrounding this accident could trigger a broader and more damaging conversation about other projects," Ocaranza said, highlighting the Mayan Train and the Olmeca refinery , both megaprojects with ballooning budgets.

"If these accidents become more frequent and the causes are deemed unreliable, there will be increased public scrutiny and a higher cost to the government," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:32:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MLPUUCUJFRM25KHBLMQNHLSAKM.jpg?auth=a67911477701fdd1172c819aced4cf706d55af68a5d4fba88a1205161dcf7032&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Bolsonaro undergoes new procedure to treat hiccups</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-bolsonaro-undergoes-new-procedure-treat-hiccups-2025-12-30/</link><description>SAO PAULO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro was undergoing an unscheduled procedure on Tuesday to treat persistent hiccups, his wife Michelle said on social media.

Monday's lawsuit , opens new tab marked the latest in a campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to challenge state laws that extend tuition and financial aid benefits to non-citizens living in their states regardless of their immigration status.

The lawsuit targets a Virginia law that has since 2022 allowed immigrants who entered the country unlawfully to access reduced, in-state tuition rates at public universities and colleges if they can establish they reside in the state.

Supporters of the measure, which was signed into law in 2021 by then-Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, argued it would remove financial barriers that had limited the ability of immigrant students in the state to pursue higher education like other Virginia residents.

The Justice Department argues the measure conflicts with federal immigration law in violation of the U.S. Constitution because it gives educational benefits to illegal immigrants that are denied to U.S. citizens from other states.

The lawsuit cites the federal Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which restricts states' ability to grant immigrants in the country illegally certain postsecondary education benefits.

"This is a simple matter of federal law: in Virginia and nationwide, schools cannot provide benefits to illegal aliens that they do not provide to U.S. citizens," U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. "This Department of Justice will not tolerate American students being treated like second-class citizens in their own country."

The Justice Department filed the lawsuit in Richmond federal court days before Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin leaves office and hands control to Democrat Abigail Spanberger. His office did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.

At least 21 other states and the District of Columbia have similar "tuition equity" laws and policies that allow certain students who graduated from high schools in their states to pay in-state tuition regardless of their immigration status, according to the National Immigration Law Center.

According to the immigrant rights group, 14 states, including Virginia, also provide state financial aid to eligible students regardless of their immigration status.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has filed at least six lawsuits challenging similar policies in Texas, Kentucky, Illinois, Oklahoma, Minnesota and California.

Texas and Oklahoma, both led by Republican governors, quickly settled by agreeing to consent decrees blocking enforcement of their state laws.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 18:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CECJ53VF3FOLPAD36EQ2BS36C4.jpg?auth=ccbbf6a01a72c88cb50f4453d481a6397e2ae6949aaaa95e24f715e33dd3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Yemen strike shows depth of distrust between Saudi Arabia and UAE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/yemen-strike-shows-depth-distrust-between-saudi-arabia-uae-2025-12-30/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 30 (Reuters) - The withdrawal of Emirati forces from Yemen following a Saudi airstrike may help defuse a confrontation between the UAE and Saudi Arabia, but the incident has exposed simmering distrust between two Gulf oil powers with long-running differences.

The airstrike by a Saudi-led coalition early on Tuesday on the southern Yemeni port of Mukalla was followed by calls on all UAE forces to leave Yemen, and a statement from Riyadh that its national security was a red line.

The UAE said it was surprised by the strike, shortly before announcing that it was pulling its remaining forces from Yemen for their safety.

The crisis, precipitated by the surprise advance of UAE-backed separatists through southern Yemen in early December, brings to the surface years of divisions between the two Gulf heavyweights on everything from oil quotas to geopolitical influence.

A Gulf source familiar with Saudi thinking told Reuters that the escalation had been triggered by a misperception resulting from talks in Washington in November between Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and U.S. President Donald Trump about the war in Sudan.

High-level talks including phone calls between Saudi Arabia and the UAE had taken place since December though they had not yet yielded results on the ground, the source said.

Any further conflagration between Saudi Arabia and the UAE would bode ill for the financially powerful Gulf, which prides itself on being an island of stability in a turbulent Middle East. Disagreements between Saudi Arabia and the UAE could hamper consensus on oil output decisions. The two are preparing for a virtual meeting with other OPEC+ members on Sunday.

"Relations between the two states are never easy, but the friction does appear to be at its most intense for years," said Neil Quilliam, associate fellow at think tank Chatham House.

Following their sudden advance in early December, the UAE-backed Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces now hold large swathes of land in Yemen, including in the strategically important Hadramout province.

The STC had previously been an important part of the coalition fighting alongside the Saudi-backed, internationally-recognized government against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, which holds Yemen's capital Sanaa and the heavily populated northwest.

Their sweep through the south brought the STC within reach of Yemen's border with Saudi Arabia, in an area to which many prominent Saudis trace their origins, lending it cultural and historical significance for them.

It also put Saudi Arabia and the UAE on opposing sides of a smouldering civil war that erupted in Yemen in 2014.

Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE have publicly said they are in talks with Yemeni groups to try and bring the situation under control, but the coalition has now carried out airstrikes in the province twice in the last few days.

The STC has been rejecting calls by the Saudi coalition for its forces to withdraw from the areas it seized, saying it will continue securing Hadramout and Mahra province to its east.

In a statement on the strike in Mukalla, the UAE said it had tried to de-escalate since the STC's advance and denied being behind any operations that would undermine Saudi security or target its borders.

"Both countries like to play down friction in the relationship and argue that competition amongst states is a normal state of affairs," said Quilliam. "But the intensity of the competition has certainly sharpened in the past year and is playing out in multiple theatres."

One such place is Sudan, a country engulfed in civil war and one of the world's worst humanitarian crises since April 2023.

The Quad, which groups Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the U.S. and the UAE, has led diplomacy on the conflict, but the war has raged on.

Sudan is a sensitive issue for the UAE. U.N. experts and members of the U.S. Congress have accused the country of sponsoring Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), who are fighting the Sudanese army. The UAE denies backing either side.

Trump and the Saudi Crown Prince discussed Sudan at the November meeting in Washington.

The Gulf source said the UAE leadership was angered as they had been "misinformed" that during the November meeting the Saudi Crown Prince had not just asked for further sanctions against the RSF, but also for more direct sanctions against the UAE for its alleged support to the group.

The misperception led to the escalation in Yemen, the source said.

The UAE foreign ministry did not confirm or deny this account and referred Reuters to an earlier statement issued on Friday in which the UAE had welcomed Saudi Arabia's efforts to support security and stability in Yemen and said it also remained committed to backing stability in the country.

Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the UAE president, said on Saturday in a post on X that dialogue and political solutions that preserve friendships and alliances were essential in what he called a "critical stage". He did not clearly reference Yemen or Saudi Arabia in his remarks.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment when asked about the issue.

The Gulf has witnessed instability in the past.

In 2017, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain, Oman and Egypt choked off Qatar's economy with a boycott, accusing it of backing terrorists, a charge Doha denied.

The latest flare-up appears unlikely to spur a repeat of the Qatar crisis.

"We do have differences over Yemen 100%, and the difference has gone to a higher level with current escalation," said Abdulkhaleq Abdullah, an Emirati academic.

"Allies clash ... But they mend their differences and build on what they have in common."</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:17:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/37CKWWVHZBOFPF5VX7GUF4SIEM.jpg?auth=f7889bd00b17bf6a03761c06ea2a974f89edb5add0113916b36c965b8dda8677&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Oil tankers still arriving in Venezuela despite US blockade, data shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/oil-tankers-still-arriving-venezuela-despite-us-blockade-data-shows-2025-12-30/</link><description>Dec 30 (Reuters) - At least two oil tankers have made their way to Venezuela in recent days and others are navigating towards the country, a sign of state-run PDVSA's effort to expand floating storage and keep selling crude even as a U.S. blockade has reduced exports to a minimum.

U.S. President Donald Trump this month announced a blockade of all sanctioned vessels going in or out of Venezuelan waters as part of a strategy to pressure Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. The U.S. move has cut oil exports this month to about half of their November level.

The U.S. has seized two fully loaded cargoes of Venezuelan oil and its ships are patrolling the Caribbean Sea. The pressure has scared many vessel owners, prompting re-routings and u-turns. Only a fraction of ships have kept on course to the OPEC country.

Some tanker owners have insisted. At least two ships under sanctions have arrived in Venezuela over the last few days and two more that are not under sanctions are approaching its coast, according to monitoring service TankerTrackers.com.

As part of swaps and arrangements made since the country was first placed under U.S. energy sanctions in 2019, Maduro's administration pays for a long list of purchases and services with oil, including debt service to China.

The two vessels approaching Venezuela are part of a fleet used by China and Venezuela to pay debt service with crude bound for Chinese ports. It was unclear whether China will press for a U.S. waiver to secure delivery of those cargoes.

PDVSA did not reply to a request for comment. Venezuela's oil ministry and Maduro have said oil exports will continue.

PDVSA has been negotiating price discounts and contract changes with customers this month to avoid cargo returns or crude production cut-backs. But many buyers are growing impatient as there are no real alternatives to get oil cargoes out of the country, even in non-sanctioned tankers, company sources said.

A cyberattack forced PDVSA to shut down its centralized administrative system this month. The company is now delivering cargoes at its ports at a slower pace, both to fulfill loading windows for export and to store crude and fuel in ships, expanding its storage capacity.

The only loaded vessels departing are Chevron's tankers, which continue setting sail for the U.S. under Washington's authorization, and small ships carrying oil byproducts and petrochemicals, shipping data and PDVSA documents showed.

A similar situation in 2020, when Washington ramped up pressure on Maduro by imposing sanctions on PDVSA's main trading partners, forced the country to switch to little-known intermediaries to keep selling its oil to Chinese buyers.

Those U.S. measures triggered oil output cuts, oilfield shutdowns and severe scarcity of motor fuel. It took Venezuela years to reach 1 million barrels per day (bpd) of output again, recover some refining capacity and stabilize exports.

As of this week, almost two dozen tankers were visible from shore near the Jose port waiting for loading windows or for departure instructions. The volume of oil stuck in undeparted tankers increased to some 16 million barrels, from 11 million barrels in mid-December, according to the data and documents.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:17:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L4THJSUB6FKTTBTJME3URXEE3U.jpg?auth=a7bb3d87f6ad4126d219cc50b274ef4207b6a175f442fedaf79ff55eab3da616&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US NATO envoy casts doubt on Russian claim that Ukraine attacked Putin’s residence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-nato-envoy-casts-doubt-russian-claim-that-ukraine-attacked-putins-residence-2025-12-30/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - U.S. ambassador to NATO Matthew Whitaker cast doubt on Tuesday on Russia’s accusation that Ukraine attacked President Vladimir Putin’s residence, saying he wants to see U.S. intelligence on the incident.

"It is unclear whether it actually happened," Whitaker told Fox Business "Varney &amp; Co." in an interview about an alleged incident which Ukraine has denied.

"It seems to me a little indelicate to be this close at a peace deal, Ukraine really wanting to get a peace deal done, and then to do something that would be viewed as reckless or not helpful," he said.

Russia said on Monday that Ukraine had attacked a presidential residence in the Novgorod region with 91 long-range attack drones. It said it would retaliate and that its negotiating stance would toughen in the talks.

Ukraine called Russia's accusations "lies" aimed at justifying more attacks on Ukraine, and its foreign minister said on Tuesday that Russia had not provided any evidence "because there's none."

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Putin told him in a phone call that Ukraine tried to attack the residence. Trump said he was "very angry" about it. Asked if there was evidence of such an attack, Trump said, "We'll find out."

The White House declined further comment on the alleged incident, while officials from the U.S. intelligence community have been close-lipped about the incident. The CIA declined to comment.

"We're going to get to the bottom of the intelligence. And for me, the most important thing is what the United States and our allies' intelligence services say about whether or not this attack actually happened," Whitaker said.

After a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Florida on Sunday, Trump said he and Zelenskiy were "maybe very close" to an agreement to end the war although the most contentious territorial issues lingered.

Zelenskiy said earlier on Tuesday : "This alleged 'residence strike' story is a complete fabrication intended to justify additional attacks against Ukraine, including Kyiv, as well as Russia’s own refusal to take necessary steps to end the war. Typical Russian lies."

Russia, which invaded Ukraine in February 2022, controls just under a fifth of its neighbour's territory and says its troops are advancing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 19:38:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HAGI4TWH55OCHKSG4CWNCYAXQA.jpg?auth=57c8de43fe3cb11262a28e95c4319e9f627dc057ad2462d2456b70dd01010c79&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Court allows Trump-backed cuts to Planned Parenthood's Medicaid funding in 22 states</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/court-allows-trump-backed-cuts-planned-parenthoods-medicaid-funding-22-states-2025-12-30/</link><description>BOSTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday allowed President Donald Trump's administration to enforce in a collection of Democratic-led states a provision of his signature tax and domestic policy bill that deprives Planned Parenthood health centers of Medicaid funding if they perform abortions.

A three-judge panel of the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at the administration's request put on hold , opens new tab an injunction issued by a lower-court judge who barred the law from being enforced in 22 states and the District of Columbia.

It marked the latest instance of the appeals court lifting an order by U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani preventing the law from being implemented, after the 1st Circuit on December 12 overturned a ruling she issued in another case brought by Planned Parenthood declaring the law unconstitutional.

A provision in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by the Republican-led Congress, bars Medicaid funding for tax-exempt organizations that provide family planning and reproductive health services if they perform abortions and received more than $800,000 in Medicaid funds during the 2023 fiscal year.

Planned Parenthood says the law was passed with it in mind and is already having devastating effects, resulting in at least 20 of its health centers closing since Trump signed the measure into law in July.

After the 1st Circuit earlier this year paused Talwani's initial injunction in Planned Parenthood's favor, a group of Democratic state attorneys general asked her to block the law's enforcement again but on different grounds.

The judge, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama, agreed to do so on December 2 , saying the states were likely to succeed in establishing that the law constitutes an unconstitutional retroactive condition on their participation in the Medicaid healthcare program.

But Tuesday's 1st Circuit panel, comprised only of judges appointed by Democratic presidents, said the Trump administration had demonstrated it was likely to prevail on the merits when its appeal is ultimately heard.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 22:21:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TBJACYTI5BL5XEPY5ZGCFPXBJQ.jpg?auth=883bda5d4dbea185bac2804f20f2edeb1cac5556e56978f87b2d46abce2fdead&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany's Merz tells Europe to assert itself to safeguard peace, prosperity</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/germanys-merz-tells-europe-assert-itself-safeguard-peace-prosperity-2025-12-30/</link><description>BERLIN, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Europe must assert its interests more strongly to ensure peace and prosperity in 2026 amid challenges from Russian aggression, global protectionism and changing ties with the U.S., German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in his annual address.

Since taking office in May, Merz has helped spearhead European efforts to support Ukraine against Russia's invasion. Berlin has also ramped up defence spending since 2023 in a bid to show it is ready to assume more responsibility.

In his New Year's speech, Merz pulled no punches, saying the "terrible" war raging on Europe's doorstep posed a direct threat to continental freedom and security.

"We are seeing more and more clearly that Russia’s aggression was and is part of a plan targeted against the whole of Europe," said Merz, adding that Germany faced sabotage, espionage and cyberattacks on a daily basis.

He said a further challenge came from protectionism in the global economy, and that Europe's dependence on imported raw materials was increasingly being wielded as a political lever against it.

Struggling to revive its export-oriented economy , Germany is trying to reduce reliance on China as it also grapples with global trade tensions and the effects of U.S. President Donald Trump 's trade tariff policies.

Europe's biggest economy has also been hit by what many economists say has been a lack of domestic reform and investment in recent years, and is expected to grow only modestly this year after two years of contraction.

Merz also addressed a more difficult partnership with the United States, long the reliable guarantor of German and European security, since Trump returned to the White House in January 2025.

"For us Europeans, this means that we must defend and assert our interests much more strongly by ourselves," said Merz.

However, he said Europe must be guided by confidence, not fear, and must take matters into its own hands.

"This can be a decisive year for our country and for Europe. It can be a year in which Germany and Europe, with new strength, reconnect with decades of peace, freedom and prosperity."</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:20:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BWQBPRB7WZKUJE6GUTOFZXASCU.jpg?auth=be98dcf0a7c92b5b3418ad2e086b6a52b8f94ce2459da49933d3ea9c52024155&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Guinea coup leader Doumbouya wins presidential election, results show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/guinea-coup-leader-doumbouya-wins-presidential-election-provisional-results-show-2025-12-30/</link><description>CONAKRY, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Guinea coup leader Mamady Doumbouya has been elected president, according to provisional results announced on Tuesday, completing the return to civilian rule in the bauxite- and iron ore-rich West African nation.

The former special forces commander , thought to be in his early 40s, seized power in 2021, toppling then-President Alpha Conde, who had been in office since 2010. It was one in a series of nine coups that have reshaped politics in West and Central Africa since 2020.

The provisional results announced on Tuesday showed Doumbouya winning 86.72% of the December 28 vote, an absolute majority that allows him to avoid a runoff.

The Supreme Court has eight days to validate the results in the event of any challenge.

Doumbouya's victory, which gives him a seven-year mandate, was widely expected. Conde and Cellou Dalein Diallo, Guinea's longtime opposition leader, are in exile, which left Doumbouya to face a fragmented field of eight challengers .

The original post-coup charter in Guinea barred junta members from running in elections, but a constitution dropping those restrictions was passed in a September referendum.

Djenabou Toure, the country's top election official who announced the results on Tuesday night, said turnout was 80,95%. However voter participation appeared tepid in the capital Conakry, and opposition politicians rejected a similarly high turnout figure for the September referendum.

Guinea holds the world's largest bauxite reserves and the richest untapped iron ore deposit at Simandou, officially launched last month after years of delay.

Doumbouya has claimed credit for pushing the project forward and ensuring Guinea benefits from its output.

His government this year also revoked the licence of Emirates Global Aluminium's subsidiary Guinea Alumina Corporation following a refinery dispute, transferring the unit's assets to a state-owned firm.

The turn toward resource nationalism - echoed in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger - has boosted his popularity, as has his relative youth in a country where the median age is about 19.

Political debate has been muted under Doumbouya. Civil society groups accuse his government of banning protests, curbing press freedom and restricting opposition activity.

The campaign period was "severely restricted, marked by intimidation of opposition actors, apparently politically motivated enforced disappearances, and constraints on media freedom," U.N. rights chief Volker Turk said last week.

On Monday, opposition candidate Faya Lansana Millimono told a press conference the election was marred by "systematic fraudulent practices" and that observers were prevented from monitoring the voting and counting processes.

The government did not respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:40:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/73B43QSNTNJSTP3WAUASZ5YNYE.jpg?auth=b730cc1cbdef69831b2dc9802ba055fab4d732c7141c0b1fc4a5916571625b94&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria arrests suspects in Latakia after sectarian violence, curfew imposed</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251230-syria-arrests-latakia-sectarian-violence-curfew-imposed</link><description>Authorities in Syria ’s Latakia province arrested 21 people allegedly linked to former president Bashar al-Assad ’s rule on Tuesday, state media said, as a curfew blanketed the provincial capital following sectarian violence the previous night.

Monday’s attacks in predominantly Alawite neighbourhoods of Latakia city came after three people, including a member of the security forces, were killed a day earlier, as thousands protested in the minority community’s coastal heartland over a deadly mosque bombing .

State television said security forces in coastal Latakia province arrested 21 “former regime remnants who are involved in criminal acts , sectarian incitement and targeting internal security forces”.

The report followed the imposition of an overnight curfew until 6:00 am (0300 GMT) on Wednesday in Latakia, a mixed city in Syria’s Alawite coastal heartland that also includes several Sunni -majority neighbourhoods.

AFP correspondents saw residents cleaning up on Tuesday after the previous night’s attacks, during which cars were damaged and shops vandalised.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a young Alawite man was shot dead during the unrest “after being chased” by several men.

Syrian authorities said on Monday that security forces had reinforced their deployment in Latakia.

Interior ministry spokesman Noureddine al-Baba said on Tuesday that Syria rejected “any acts of sabotage or attacks that affect the dignity of citizens or their property”, adding that the necessary legal measures would be taken against those responsible.

Since the ousting of Assad, himself an Alawite, in December last year, the minority group has been the target of repeated attacks.

A bombing at a mosque in a predominantly Alawite area of the central Syrian city of Homs on Friday killed eight people.

The Saraya Ansar al-Sunna Islamist militant group, which analysts say acts as a front for Islamic State (IS) jihadists, claimed responsibility for the attack.

Hundreds of Alawites were killed in sectarian massacres in the community’s coastal heartland in March.

Despite assurances from Damascus that all of Syria’s communities will be protected, the country’s minorities remain wary about their future under the new authorities.</description><pubDate>Tue, 30 Dec 2025 23:41:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8cf8e87a-e5d0-11f0-b377-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25362549274415.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine drone attack damages port, gas pipeline in Tuapse, Russia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-drone-attack-damages-port-gas-pipeline-tuapse-russia-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian drone attack damaged port infrastructure and a gas pipeline in a residential area in Russia's Black Sea port of Tuapse, the regional administration said on Wednesday, adding no injuries were reported.

Emergency crews were dispatched to repair the damage, the operational headquarters of the Krasnodar region said on the Telegram messaging app. The port's berth had been damaged, it added.

SHOT, a Telegram news channel with sources in Russia's security services, said a series of explosions was heard over Tuapse late on Tuesday and that residents in one district reported a fire.

Several Ukrainian media, including the RBC-Ukraine media outlet, posted photos on Telegram appearing to show a large fire burning in the distance at night, with a communications mast silhouetted in the foreground.

There was no immediate official comment from Ukraine about the attack. Reuters could not independently verify the report or the extent of the damage.

Tuapse is one of Russia’s key Black Sea outlets for oil products, anchored by Rosneft’s (ROSN.MM) , opens new tab export-oriented Tuapse refinery, which has capacity to process about 240,000 barrels per day and supplies products such as naphtha, fuel oil and diesel.

The port and the refinery have been hit repeatedly by Ukrainian drone attacks during the war that Russia launched nearly four years ago, with past strikes reported to have sparked fires and at times disrupted operations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US government audits cases of Somali US citizens for potential denaturalization</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-government-audits-cases-somali-us-citizens-potential-denaturalization-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 30 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration said on Tuesday it was auditing immigration cases involving U.S. citizens of Somali origin to detect fraud that could lead to denaturalization, or revocation of citizenship.

"Under U.S. law, if an individual procures citizenship on a fraudulent basis, that is grounds for denaturalization," Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that was first reported by Fox News and reposted by the White House on social media.
Denaturalization cases are rare and can take years. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, about 11 cases were pursued per year between 1990 and 2017.

Since taking office in January, Trump, a Republican, has pursued a hardline immigration policy , opens new tab involving an aggressive deportation drive, revocations of visas and green cards , and screening of social media posts and past speeches of immigrants.

Human rights groups widely condemn Trump's policies, saying they curb rights like due process and free speech. Trump and his allies say the policies aim to improve domestic security.

Federal officials in recent weeks have portrayed Minnesota's Somali community as a hotspot for fraud involving millions of federal dollars intended for social services. Immigrant-rights advocates say the administration is using the fraud investigations as an excuse to target Somali immigrants more broadly.

FBI Director Kash Patel said on Sunday the bureau has "surged" investigative resources and personnel to Minnesota in the latest instance of the Trump administration's fraud investigations that have targeted the state's Somali immigrants.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services separately said on Tuesday it has frozen all child care payments to Minnesota. It said that going forward all payments from the department's Administration for Children and Families nationwide "will require a justification and a receipt or photo evidence before we send money to a state."

In response, Minnesota's Democratic Governor Tim Walz said his state government has "spent years cracking down on fraudsters" and that Trump was "politicizing the issue to defund programs that help Minnesotans."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JXQ3ZA2UJZPXVLYDCQFMO47H2Q.jpg?auth=c5d259f2c3df010d40e4f97e347ca2c14c49c235b67462124e598f28e8531a69&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Head-on train crash near Peru's Machu Picchu kills driver, injures dozens</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/head-on-train-crash-near-perus-machu-picchu-kills-driver-injures-dozens-2025-12-30/</link><description>LIMA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - A train driver was killed and 40 more people were injured on Tuesday after two trains collided head-on on the railway leading to the Inca citadel of Machu Picchu, the Andean nation's top tourist site that draws well over 1 million visitors each year.

Police are investigating the collision between trains operated by Inca Rail S.A. and PeruRail S.A., which mainly transport tourists to the iconic site. A health official said about 20 people were in relatively serious condition.

A police officer added that foreign tourists were among the injured.

"China's military exercises around Taiwan this week increase cross-strait tensions and the risk of escalation," a foreign office spokesperson said in a statement.

"We consider the Taiwan issue one to be settled peacefully by the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait through constructive dialogue, without the threat or use of force or coercion. We do not support any unilateral attempts to change the status quo or any activity that risks destabilising it."

"We continue to call for restraint and the avoidance of any further actions that risk undermining peace and stability."

Russia's air defence units destroyed a total of 27 Ukrainian drones in the three-hour period starting at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT), including three over the Moscow region, the Russian defence ministry said on the Telegram messaging app.

Andrei Vorobyov, governor of the Moscow region, said on Telegram that 21 Ukrainian drones were downed during the day over the region. One civilian person was injured as a result of the attack.

The reported attacks came a day after Russia accused Ukraine, without providing evidence, of trying to attack President Vladimir Putin’s residence .

Kyiv dismissed the allegations as baseless and aimed at derailing peace talks in the war that Russia launched against Ukraine nearly four years ago.

There were no immediate reports of damage from the strikes. Russia rarely discloses the full extent of damage from Ukrainian attacks unless civilians or civilian infrastructure are affected.

Separately, a power outage hit a town outside Moscow after a technical fault at a regional power facility, RIA reported, citing power authorities.

The SHOT Telegram news channel, which has sources among Russia's security services, said about 100,000 residents were affected.

There was no immediate evidence the outage was linked to Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine targets Moscow with drones, Russia says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-targets-moscow-with-drones-russia-says-2025-12-30/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:45:43 +0000</pubDate></item><item><title>Guinea coup leader Doumbouya elected president in provisional results</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20251231-guinea-coup-leader-doumbouya-elected-president</link><description>Guinea coup leader Mamady Doumbouya has been elected president, according to provisional results announced on Tuesday, completing the return to civilian rule in the bauxite- and iron ore-rich West African nation.

Sassou Nguesso led the small, oil-rich country under a one-party system from 1979 to 1992, before Pascal Lissouba defeated him in the country’s first democratic election . He returned to power in 1997 after a civil war that ousted Lissouba and has ruled ever since.

The Congolese Labour Party (PCT) said it had endorsed Sassou Nguesso as its candidate following a three-day congress, according to congress rapporteur Antoinette Kebi.

“The president is being elevated to the rank of the ‘very great comrade’ of the party,” Kebi said.

More than 3,000 people attended the PCT conference, although the president himself was not present.

The election is due to take place on March 22, 2026. Members of the military will vote five days earlier so that soldiers can maintain public order on polling day — a measure used in previous elections.

After winning elections in 2002 and 2009, Sassou Nguesso secured further terms in 2016 and 2021 following a constitutional change in 2015 that removed the original age limit of 70 and increased the number of five-year terms to three.

In April 2023, three opposition parties joined forces to form the “Alliance for Democratic Change in 2026”, aiming to overhaul the country’s electoral oversight bodies.

The alliance brings together the Rally for Democracy and Development (RDD), founded by former Marxist-Leninist president Jacques Joachim Yhombi-Opango, the Republicans’ Movement (MR) and the People’s Party (PAPE).</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:46:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/191997e0-e5d7-11f0-b64f-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25267812730611.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>MH370 search resumes in Indian Ocean nearly 12 years after plane's disappearance</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251230-mh370-search-resumes-in-indian-ocean-years-after-plane-disappearance</link><description>Nearly 12 years after Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 vanished with 239 people on board, the search for answers to one of aviation ’s most haunting riddles resumed on Tuesday in the remote southern Indian Ocean.

Armed with cutting-edge deep-sea robots and refined data analysis, US investigators are scouring the seabed for clues that have eluded governments, experts and grieving families for more than a decade.

MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur just after midnight on March 8, 2014, bound for Beijing on what should have been an uneventful six-hour flight.

Less than an hour later, its transponder went dark, wiping the Boeing 777 from civilian radar. Military screens later showed the aircraft veering sharply west, crossing back over Malaysia before heading south over the vast Indian Ocean .

What followed was the most ambitious and costly search in aviation history, as multinational teams combed more than 46,000 square miles (120,000 square kilometres) of seabed off Western Australia with ships, aircraft and sonar.

They found nothing.

The hunt was called off in 2017, leaving families with heartbreak and a mystery that spawned theories ranging from hijacking to deliberate pilot action.

Now, the Malaysian government has given the green light for a fresh attempt led by Texas-based marine robotics firm Ocean Infinity under a “no find, no fee” contract, according to a statement from Malaysia’s transport ministry.

“The latest development underscores the government of Malaysia’s commitment in providing closure to the families affected by this tragedy,” it said.

The company will pocket $70 million only if it locates the wreck, reports said.

This new phase, expected to last up to 55 days, targets a tighter search zone of about 5,800 square miles — far smaller than earlier efforts and pinpointed using updated satellite data, drift modelling and expert analysis.

Ocean Infinity is deploying autonomous underwater vehicles that can dive nearly 19,700 feet (6,000 metres) and remain submerged for days at a time.

The drones use high-resolution side-scan sonar, ultrasound imaging and magnetometers to map the seabed in 3D, detect buried debris and pick up traces of metal. If something promising appears, remotely operated vehicles can descend for close inspection.

Ocean Infinity, which also has a control centre in Britain, led an unsuccessful hunt in 2018 before agreeing to launch a new search this year. AFP contacted the company for comment, but there was no immediate response.

Only fragments of MH370 have ever been recovered. Since 2015, fewer than 30 pieces believed to be from the aircraft — including parts of the wing, landing gear and fuselage — have washed ashore thousands of kilometres apart, from Réunion to Mozambique .

No bodies have ever been found.

Malaysia’s official probe concluded in 2018 that the plane was likely deliberately diverted from its course, but stopped short of assigning responsibility.

Relatives from China, Australia, Europe and beyond have fought for years to keep the hunt alive, arguing that closure matters not only for the dead but for global aviation safety.

Governments in Beijing and Canberra have welcomed Malaysia’s decision, pledging support for any practical effort to crack the case.

Chinese national Jiang Hui, who lost his 72-year-old mother Jiang Cuiyun in the disaster, told AFP earlier this month that he remains determined to find answers, despite frustration with the authorities.

“Finding the plane, finding my loved one, and finding the truth — I believe this is something I must do in my life,” he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 01:46:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fa9c533e-e572-11f0-9695-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/capture-6077310146953b7e3bc5a47-37745953.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan stays on high alert as Chinese ships pull back after massive drills</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-stays-high-alert-chinese-ships-pull-back-after-massive-drills-2025-12-31/</link><description>TAIPEI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Taiwan stayed on high alert on Wednesday after China staged massive military drills around the island the previous day, keeping its emergency maritime response centre running, the head of the island's coast guard said.

The exercises named "Justice Mission 2025" saw China fire dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deploy a large number of warships and aircraft near the island, in a show of force that drew concern from Western allies including the European Commission and Britain .

Taipei condemned the drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation.

Chinese ships were moving away from Taiwan but Beijing had yet to formally declare the end of the exercises, according to Kuan Bi-ling, head of Taiwan's Ocean Affairs Council.

"The maritime situation has calmed down, with ships and vessels gradually departing. As China has not announced the conclusion of the military exercises, the emergency response centre remains operational," she said in a post on Facebook late on Tuesday.

A Taiwan coast guard official told Reuters all 11 Chinese coast guard ships had left waters near Taiwan and were continuing to move away. A Taiwan security official said emergency response centres for the military and coast guard stayed active.

Taiwan's defence ministry on Wednesday said 77 Chinese military aircraft and 25 navy and coast guard vessels had been operating around the island in the past 24 hours.

Among them, 35 military planes had crossed the Taiwan Strait median line that separates the two sides, it added.

The drills, China's most extensive war games by coverage area to date, forced Taiwan to cancel dozens of domestic flights and dispatch jets and warships to monitor. Soldiers were seen running rapid-response drills including putting up barricades at various locations.

China's state news agency Xinhua published an article summarising "three key takeaways" from the drills, which began 11 days after the United States announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan.

The simulated "encirclement" demonstrated the People's Liberation Army's ability to "press and contain separatist forces while denying access to external interference – an approach summarised as 'sealing internally and blocking externally'," the article said, citing Zhang Chi, a professor at the PLA National Defence University.

"A woman's IQ is zero when in love," it states on its second page. "As long as the emotions are in place, the client's money will naturally follow."

A second handbook, seized during another law enforcement operation in the country and reviewed by Reuters, gives tips in English and Chinese about how to conduct romance scams.

Together, they provide a window into the psychological techniques criminal gangs use to beguile a victim into believing they are in a romantic relationship, before duping them into fraudulent investments.

This kind of fraud is known as "pig-butchering" because the gangs say targets are led like hapless pigs to slaughter. It is among the most prevalent scams today, according to the FBI.

In a series of stories this year, Reuters documented how these "pig-butchering" scams are often carried out by victims of human trafficking , opens new tab , who are forced to work in industrial-scale scam compounds in Southeast Asia run by Chinese-led gangs. Such cyberfraud has been supercharged by artificial intelligence , opens new tab , which allows scammers to deploy sophisticated tools to make their fraudulent appeals for money more deceptive, the series revealed.

The two manuals, the contents of which Reuters is reporting exclusively, show that gangs have developed detailed guidance for creating fake personas to lure their targets, as well as strategies to handle a victim if they suspect a ruse.

The authenticity of both handbooks was confirmed by a spokesperson for the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission in the Philippines, who said they were recovered from two compounds raided last year in the north of the capital, Manila.

The Chinese manual outlines a seven-day plan to defraud women in China by convincing them to invest in crude oil via a fake platform. It refers to targets as "clients" and the theft as a "sale."

The bilingual handbook targets men. It does not explicitly say how money will be extracted from victims, but suggests the fraudster discuss cryptocurrency with the target.

The first handbook, which is nine pages long, was found in a compound built on land partially owned by a Chinese-born woman named Alice Guo, the PAOCC said.

Authorities also found mobile phones allegedly used for pig-butchering fraud, as well as several hundred people "involved in scams" at the compound. Many of them were trafficking victims, PAOCC said.

Guo is serving a life sentence after being convicted in November of human trafficking. Her lawyer did not respond to questions about the manual and the activities carried out in the compound.

Reuters could not establish if either manual was ever used in a scam. However, the methods they outline are consistent with those described to the news agency by two former workers in scamming compounds. One of the workers, who operated out of Myanmar, said he had used a similar manual to carry out a "pig-butchering" scam.

Such scripts were found in at least two other police raids conducted in 2023 and 2024 in the Philippines and Thailand, according to a 2024 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which shares expertise with national law enforcement agencies.

Two experts who reviewed the Chinese-language manual at Reuters' request said it demonstrated complex manipulation techniques. These include isolating and overwhelming with affection a prospective target, who then becomes hooked on the conversations.

The first step of a "pig-butchering" scam involves creating a fake identity.

An elaborate facade can open the door to an emotional connection with a prospective victim, the Chinese manual says on its first page.

Martina Dove, a U.S.-based psychologist who studies scams and reviewed that manual for Reuters, said her research found that romance scammers often impersonated authority figures when targeting female victims, and then used control against them.

That can translate into a scammer pretending to be a skilled professional like a doctor or lawyer, or a senior uniformed figure like a general, she said.

Britain's Barclays Bank has found that men are slightly more likely than women to fall victim to love scams, though women on average lose more than twice as much money. Its conclusion was based on a review of an unspecified number of scams perpetrated on its customers between January 2023 and May 2024.

The fake persona is grounded in foundational details that the Chinese manual recommends remain constant.

Birthday : Taurus Zodiac is recommended as it is considered most compatible with other signs.

Hometown : Match it to the regional accent of the scammer.

Family : Pretend to have been divorced for six years, with a daughter who lives with the ex-wife.

Job : Say you have a managerial position at Chinese state oil company Sinopec but are currently stationed outside the country.

Sinopec did not return a request for comment about whether it was aware of being identified in any scam manuals or if it had received any complaints.

The Chinese-language playbook suggests altering some details to create common ground with the prospective target.

Age: The scammer should pretend to be one or two years older than the victim.

His mother should live near the target, but not so close that they may have overlapping communities.

The final layer brings the fake persona to life. The Chinese manual prompts the scammer to go beyond basic biographical information. Specifics sell the story, it says.

Examples of suggested hobbies and interests in the handbook include swimming, climbing, cooking, reading and traveling.

Lifestyle details that should be memorized include owning a three-bedroom residence and an upmarket sedan.

Once all the details are in place, the scammer is ready to reach out to a target.

The first day's instructions contain a word-for-word script.

"Hello! My name is XXX, nice to meet you!"

The scammer asks questions to gauge whether the target has been previously defrauded and to assess their interest in investments.

Then it's time for the first phone call, which is an opportunity to start building the relationship by sharing "emotional experiences", the manual says.

The Chinese handbook instructs its reader to adapt their approach to the target's personality.

It states: "Middle‑aged women are, in fact, the group carrying the heaviest burden. Husbands often don't listen patiently, and children are too young to understand the intricacies and difficulties within. So, if you want to build a relationship with middle-aged women, chat with them about the trivial matters in life!"

It shows how scammers probe for circumstances – divorce, or an interest in making money quickly – that may make the target more approachable, said Dove.

"Everybody's vulnerable. You just need to meet the right scam at the right time."

There are many paths the scammer could take to grow the connection.

The handbook untangles the possible routes by sorting victims into distinct personalities.

The path forward with a victim who is:

Cold-hearted: The target has a personality that tends to keep others at a distance.

The scammer responds by teasing to push the victim to drop her aloof facade.

Undermine them slightly and then sweet-talk them afterward.

Career-oriented: Independent and satisfied with how far they've come.

Scammer aims to reflect a glowing attitude towards life. Radiates positivity and competence to appear reliable.

Conservative: The victim presents as having more traditional values.

Scammer pushes an alternative path of excitement. Gives the victim an escape from the daily norm.

The way forward can be plotted based on a victim’s upbringing:

Pampered: Spoiled by parents. Intermittent attention teases the victim into seeking out connection.

Rough: Insecure, lacks confidence. Scammer gives clear and structured directions. Scammer also provides daily encouragement and guidance that the victim may have lacked growing up.

Romantic experience

A lot: Mature and independent. Mirrors victim's actions to avoid seeming needy. Lets the victim come to them.

Very little: Fantasize about future relationship. Uses flirty language and compliments the victim daily to draw them in.

For every personality type, the end goal is the same.

Bring the victim closer to the scammer to grow the relationship, the Chinese manual says.

A key part of the con as described in both manuals involves mimicking the target's interests and language, while showering them with attention.

The script in the Chinese manual instructs its reader to send "daily greetings" to show care, and "make the client fall in love" with the persona.

Give the target small tasks to do, so that they begin to take instructions, the manual says.

The bilingual manual has similar prompts:

"How are you this afternoon?"

"Remember to eat on time when you are busy at work."

"I've always loved playing basketball. I’ve always been a Lakers fan but since Kobe left, I've been afraid to watch Lakers games."

Beth Hyland, who was targeted by a love scam in late 2023, said some of the techniques in the manuals, which were shared with her by a reporter, echoed the tactics she fell victim to.

Reuters couldn't independently ascertain if the individual she was scammed by was familiar with either handbook.

The then-52-year-old was online dating for the first time after a divorce when she met "Richard" on Tinder.

A Tinder spokesperson told Reuters it has a zero-tolerance policy for fraud and is "constantly monitoring our platform to detect and remove any suspicious profiles". The spokesperson added that the company uses AI tools to help warn users of potential scams.

Hyland said "Richard" described himself as a French construction project manager and drew her in with compliments and chats about spirituality.

"He knew how to move fast without suffocating me, without coming on too strong," said Hyland.

Within weeks, they were engaged.

Speed is key: the Chinese handbook is intended to enable a scam in as little as seven days. The two former workers in scam compounds told Reuters that they also worked off scripts for seven-day scams.

By the second day, the scammer should be talking about his interest in investments, that manual says. By Day 5, he should try to establish a romantic relationship. And by the seventh, he should have introduced a fake investment platform for the target to put money into.

The bilingual handbook similarly emphasizes that the scammer should quickly enmesh themselves in the target's life.

The reader should drop a target by the end of the third day if the victim is slow to respond, says the 13-page manual, whose title was partially obscured by a waterstain.

"... In short, don't chat awkwardly. Our mission is to share life and work happily with customers."

That manual, which instructs the scammer to pose as a woman, references contacting male targets at certain times of the day in Brazil.

Brazilian Federal Police declined to comment when asked if they were aware of an instruction manual being used to conduct scams on its citizens, citing ongoing investigations.

A lawyer for Cassandra Ong, the registered representative of the compound where the bilingual handbook was found, said he was not aware of the manual's existence. Ong, who is a fugitive from charges of human trafficking, denies the allegations, he said.

The Chinese manual features answers to common questions that may be raised by wary targets, including "why do you like me?"

The answer: “Because I feel good chatting with you, I really cherish this connection.”

Q: Why can't I withdraw the money?

A: Because the platform has a "detection mechanism," frequent withdrawals might attract the attention of customer service.

So, darling, you must listen to me and follow my lead. When the time comes, we'll withdraw the money together.

Q: Why is the account frozen?

A: Why don't you listen to me? Didn't I tell you whether to withdraw or not? Your random operations led to the account being frozen. Quickly contact customer service to see how to resolve it.

The schemes sometimes involve multiple scammers talking to the same target according to the bilingual manual and interviews with the two former scam workers.

That manual directs the scammer to hand over to a senior Chinese worker when the victim starts talking about their finances. The document does not state what role the Chinese national plays, but one of the scam workers said a team leader often took over when a victim was about to transfer funds. He did not specify why.

After about six weeks of conversation, "Richard" duped Hyland into sending him $26,000 via cryptocurrency to pay an emergency travel fee.

As she was on the verge of sending another $50,000 for what she was told was an activation fee to unlock millions of dollars in funds, her financial advisor warned her she was in the depths of a "classic romance fraud".

Once the fraudster moves to extract money, the facade they have built inevitably collapses.

Sometimes the wake-up call comes in the form of a fraud alert from the bank or a warning from a financial advisor.

Sometimes it does not come as a dramatic revelation but a slow and painful recognition, said Rebecca Cole, a social worker and academic specializing in online victimization and romance scams.

"I just remember my heart dropping," Hyland said. "I couldn't wrap my head around it."

Hyland never got her $26,000 back. And to date, she does not know what "Richard’s" real identity was.

Many victims find themselves trapped in a cycle of shame. Some are isolated by their families, said Monica Whitty, a professor at Monash University in Australia who researches cybercrime.

Meanwhile, the scammer moves on.

"Remember not to hang yourself on one tree," the Chinese manual advises its reader, urging them to constantly send messages and look for new targets.

Even as one victim reels from the theft, the scammer leaves a light on for new connections.

The pilot issued multiple radio challenges to the CRV Tan Suo Er Hao seeking to confirm whether it was conducting marine research without Manila's consent, which would violate Philippine and international law, but received no response, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said in a statement.

The 87.25‑metre deep‑sea research vessel, which left China's Hainan province earlier this month and entered the western part of the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone, was then monitored heading east about 55.8 nautical miles off Santa Ana, Cagayan, the PCG said.

Cagayan, the northernmost province of Luzon near Taiwan, hosts one of nine military bases accessible to U.S. forces under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA).

On Tuesday, China staged war games around Taiwan, firing rockets into surrounding waters and simulating strikes and blockades in drills dubbed “Justice Mission 2025,” launched days after Washington announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taipei.

The PCG said the Chinese research vessel was detected through Canada's satellite-based Dark Vessel Detection system.

The Chinese Embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 03:28:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Honduras AG warns of legal action over fraught election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-ag-warns-legal-action-over-fraught-election-2025-12-31/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Honduras' Attorney General Johel Zelaya said on Tuesday that legal action would soon be taken to clarify and expose the truth of the events that happened during the Central American nation's fraught electoral process.

She was shocked by what she found.

Her student debt had been double-counted, making it look as though she owed a quarter of a million dollars and putting home ownership out of reach. Jones disputed the items with Experian, one of the major credit reporting agencies, multiple times in writing and over the phone, but got nowhere.

"They kept saying it's been verified, it's been verified…They never investigated. They never tried to remove it," Jones said in an interview.

Eventually, Jones complained to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal watchdog created by Congress in 2010 to protect consumers in their financial dealings, helping her lawyers show a judge the lengths she'd gone to mitigate damage to her credit, according to her attorneys, legal papers and a copy of the complaint. That paper trail eventually helped Jones successfully sue Experian to correct her record.

Jones closed on a house purchase in the Memphis suburb of Millington for $300,000 in January.

"If I didn't have this agency to go to, I don't think I'd be in the house right now," said Jones. "It actually changed my life."

Experian and the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment on Jones' case.

In interviews, consumers who had fallen on hard times or known difficulty, lawyers who work with the poor and credit counselors told Reuters the CFPB had been a lifeline for people facing hardship and they feared that, without it, many consumers would be left unprotected from financial predators.

Conceived by Senator Elizabeth Warren to police the type of lending that fueled the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has long been a target of conservatives and industry. Congress created the agency as part of post-crash reforms in 2010 as the sole federal body primarily charged with protecting consumers' rights in the financial marketplace.

The CFPB now faces extinction under President Donald Trump's second administration, which says the agency is a political weapon for Democrats and a burden on free enterprise.

Speaking to reporters at the White House in February, Trump said it was "very important to get rid of the agency," claiming, without spelling out evidence, that Warren had "used that as her little personal agency to go around and destroy people."

In an interview, Warren dismissed the criticism as a sign the CFPB was doing its job. "This is not about vendettas. This is about enforcing the law as it is written, so that billionaires and billionaire corporations don't cheat American families. I think that's a pretty good thing," she said.

White House Budget Director Russell Vought, a staunch CFPB critic and the agency's acting head, told "The Charlie Kirk Show" podcast in October he plans to shutter the CFPB. The administration is fighting in court to fire up to 90% of its workers, while planning to move pending investigations and litigation to the Justice Department.

The agency says it is due to run out of money in early 2026 and Vought says he cannot legally seek more until the Federal Reserve returns to what the administration deems "profitability ," a position a federal judge flatly rejected on Tuesday , finding it without legal merit. Congressional Republicans also slashed the CFPB's maximum allowable funding in July.

Together, the administration, congressional Republicans and industry-backed lawsuits have undone a decade's worth of CFPB rules on matters ranging from medical debt and student loans to credit card late fees , overdraft charges and mortgage lending.

The agency has also dropped or paused its probes and enforcement actions , and stopped supervising the consumer finance industries, leading to a string of resignations .

The CFPB and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.

Warren said that as a law professor studying bankruptcy she saw that consumer protections were weak and fragmented, and that America needed a single federal agency dedicated to protecting consumers from unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.

"I was stunned by the number of people in financial trouble who had lost a job or got sick but who had also been cheated by one or more of their creditors," she told Reuters. "For no agency was consumer protection a first priority, it was somewhere between fifth and tenth, which meant there was just no cop on the beat. If the CFPB is not there, people have nowhere to turn when they get cheated."

Republicans said the agency was redundant, with federal bank watchdogs, like the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators already looking out for consumers, and that its funding and leadership structure were unconstitutional. Like other banking regulators, the CFPB's funding is not set annually by Congress and does not come directly from taxpayers. Rather, the agency draws on the Federal Reserve and its director was until recently protected from removal at will by the president.

Republicans accused the CFPB's first director Richard Cordray, a Democrat, of using those powers to crush small banks and businesses via overzealous enforcement and complex regulations, and of overstepping the agency's legal authority by trying to regulate companies Congress had exempted from its oversight, such as auto dealerships.

Conservative and industry groups tried several times to curb its powers or extinguish it altogether via the courts. In 2020 the Supreme Court handed the president the power to fire the director, which he has since used . Critics on the political right accused former director Rohit Chopra, a Democrat, of exceeding his authority, flouting the federal rule-making process, and harming consumers with an ill-conceived crackdown on financial firm fees.

Thomas Hoenig, who served as vice chair of the FDIC from 2012 to 2018, said he was skeptical of some of the CFPB's work under prior administrations, but that it still served an important purpose.

"If you take them out of the picture altogether, you're going to get more abuse, not less," he said. "I'm disappointed to see the CFPB just go away."

For some, though, the agency has been a lifeline. Millions of Americans like Jones who are struggling with credit reporting errors, predatory lenders, debt collectors, fraud, discrimination or other challenges, are now filing complaints every year with the agency, which prompts companies to fix the issues, sometimes by paying the complainants, or explain themselves.

When companies repeatedly break the rules, the CFPB punishes them and tries to make their customers whole. To date, it has returned $21 billion to consumers, according to CFPB data.

Morgan Smith, a 31-year-old single mother and social services worker in Issaquah, Washington, turned to those resources when she realized she had been a victim of identity theft.

After her wallet and ID were stolen from her car, she learned that someone had opened up a string of accounts in her name, she said: a rental car that ended up in a crash, an unpaid storage unit and a hotel room at an amusement park. Reuters was unable to confirm Smith's account independently.

"I went straight to the CFPB and I was navigated there to their consumer education tab where I was able to find out how to deal with fraud and scams. It gave me all the information I needed to know...my rights," she said.

"That was very important for me to have this resource."

Without the CFPB, borrowers would once again rely on a hodgepodge of federal, state and other local agencies which lack the CFPB's resources, expertise and legal powers , say consumer groups.

"Prior to the CFPB coming around, we'd have to say, 'write your attorney general, write to the FTC,' whoever it was, and it became this sort of letter-writing campaign," said Sam Hohman, who runs the Nebraska nonprofit Credit Advisors Foundation, which helps people get out of debt and offers consumer education services.

As a result, people like Virginia resident Michael Johnson, 49, may have fewer options in future when they fall into trouble.

After a kidney transplant and leg amputation several years ago left Johnson unable to work, he racked up credit card debt paying for basic expenses, he said. This summer he received court summonses from creditors seeking to collect on that old debt, according to court records.

"I got in over my head unintentionally," Johnson said in an interview.

Using a CFPB database of credit card , opens new tab terms and conditions, Johnson learned that his creditors were required to use arbitration rather than sue in court, which could cost more than the underlying debts. Johnson represented himself in court and says so far one creditor has dropped its complaint while the other is considering its options.

"It adds credibility to your defense that you understand your rights," Johnson said. "Life happens to everybody."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:23:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UDQ2E7LFF5OCJAWUBM76QUIU2M.jpg?auth=e91e7546fce2797bb96fc8767291be6e19a218814a09e4d2fbf491b256b78033&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thailand frees 18 Cambodian soldiers as ceasefire holds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thailand-frees-18-cambodian-soldiers-ceasefire-holds-2025-12-31/</link><description>BANGKOK/PHNOM PENH, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Thailand on Wednesday released 18 Cambodian soldiers it had detained since July under the renewed ceasefire the two countries agreed on the weekend to end a border conflict, Cambodian and Thai authorities said.

The Southeast Asian neighbours agreed on a ceasefire that took effect at noon (0500 GMT) on Saturday, halting 20 days of fighting that killed at least 101 people and displaced more than half a million on both sides, and included fighter-jet sorties, exchanges of rocket fire and artillery barrages.

The soldiers were due to be returned on Tuesday, but Thailand delayed the process over alleged breaches of the ceasefire deal, which Cambodia denied.

Cambodian Defence Ministry spokesperson Maly Socheata said the soldiers were handed over at a border checkpoint at 10 a.m. (0300 GMT) on Wednesday after 155 days in Thai custody.

Thailand's Foreign Ministry said the soldiers had been treated "in accordance with international humanitarian law and principles" during their time in detention.

The border clashes reignited early this month, following the breakdown in a ceasefire deal that U.S. President Donald Trump and Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim helped broker to halt a previous round of conflict in July.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:24:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZOLLUO4ZSNIW5CC2CGKUTVI5KE.jpg?auth=ceab230d5706c839677594d0f120dd855ac930907ccc06bff354728d0a4f322a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Four injured, including three children in Russian attack on Odesa, Ukraine says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/four-injured-including-three-children-russian-attack-odesa-ukraine-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russia launched an overnight drone attack on Ukraine’s Odesa region, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure and injuring four people, including three children, regional authorities said on Wednesday.

Odesa, a major Black Sea port, has been repeatedly targeted by Russian missiles and drones during nearly four years of war , with strikes frequently hitting energy, transport and port infrastructure as well as residential areas.

"Strike drones attacked residential, logistics and energy infrastructure in our region," Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, said on the Telegram messaging app.

In Odesa city, which is the administrative centre of the broader Odesa region, four people were injured, including a seven-month-old infant, two other children, and a 42-year-old man, Serhiy Lisak, the head of Odesa's military administration, said on Telegram.

He said that drone debris and direct hits damaged facades and windows of several high-rise apartment buildings.

Lisak posted images showing smoke billowing from a multi-storey apartment building at night, with flames visible in several windows and what appears to be a firefighter’s water jet aimed at the facade.

Reuters could not independently verify the reports.

Najib, 72, already serving a six-year jail sentence for graft in an earlier case linked to 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), was found guilty on December 26 of abuse of power and money laundering in the biggest trial he faced over the fund he co-founded while in office.

The High Court sentenced him to an additional 15 years in prison and a record fine of nearly $3 billion. Najib, who has been in prison since 2022, is appealing the ruling. He denies wrongdoing.

While civil society groups welcomed the verdict, many said it raised fresh questions over the independence of Malaysia's institutions and exposed deep structural problems that have not been addressed since the 1MDB scandal was exposed more than a decade ago.

Transparency International Malaysia President Raymon Ram said the verdict represented a chance for the government to implement long-promised institutional reforms.

These include plans to separate the attorney-general's role as the government's top legal adviser and function as public prosecutor, which has often led to conflicts of interest in politically sensitive cases, he said.

"If parliament and the government deliver on core reforms in 2026, Malaysians can begin to believe that integrity is no longer episodic, but embedded. If not, the risk is clear, accountability will remain selective, reforms will stagnate, and public trust will continue to erode," he said.

Malaysia scored 50 out of 100 in the Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) in 2024, ranking 57th out of 180 countries, with the score stagnating in the last decade.

The CPI results indicate that while reform language has improved, perceptions of accountability and integrity have not shifted decisively, Ram said.

The court verdict has stoked tensions within Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's ruling alliance over the treatment of Najib, who remains a popular figure within some factions in his party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). UMNO has long campaigned against Anwar, but joined his coalition to form a government after the 2022 elections resulted in a hung parliament.

Anwar, who came to power on an anti-graft platform, has also faced a backlash over the slow pace of reforms with some critics accusing him of betraying allies after prosecutors dropped some graft charges against Najib and key UMNO figures.

Anwar said on Tuesday the government was working hard to address governance issues and eliminate graft, though he acknowledged the challenge of stamping out systemic corruption.

"There are still remnants who are trapped in the framework and patterns of the old corrupt culture," he told a press conference, without going into detail.

He rejected accusations of biased prosecutions, highlighting recent anti-graft investigations into senior government officials, including his own political secretary and the country's army chief .

Malaysia's Centre to Combat Corruption and Cronyism (C4), however, said the case of 1MDB highlighted persistent risks, with the prime minister empowered to appoint key officials, including the attorney-general, its anti-corruption agency chief, and the heads of government-linked companies.

C4 founder Cynthia Gabriel urged the government to pass a proposed law regulating political financing, and raised concerns over Anwar's continued alliance with UMNO, ahead of regional polls due in coming months and a national election that must be held by early 2028.

"As the next general election looms... the government is hard-pressed to regain the confidence of its voters and the big question remains of UMNO's future with the current coalition," Gabriel said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 04:24:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YDEE56EZ2VNVDIA67FI4GSVZJE.jpg?auth=b88b85f20fe5a3c6de365bdd4f971aa25d97b8814f3deb004d6cae455c0f02dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Gerasimov says Putin ordered buffer zone expansion in Ukraine's Sumy, Kharkiv in 2026</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russias-gerasimov-says-putin-ordered-buffer-zone-expansion-ukraines-sumy-kharkiv-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian Chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov said Russian forces were advancing into Ukrainian defences and that President Vladimir Putin ordered expansion of a buffer zone in Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv in 2026, Russian news agencies reported on Wednesday.

The election is the first since a 2021 coup and is taking place during a civil war . Analysts expect the military-aligned Union Solidarity and Development Party, led by retired generals, to be returned to power.

The United Nations, some Western countries and human rights groups have said the vote is not free, fair or credible, given that anti-junta political parties are out of the running and it is illegal to criticise the polls.

Zaw Min Tun, a junta spokesperson, told state media that more than six million people, or 52.13% of enrolled voters, had voted on Sunday across 102 townships.

"Even in developed democratic nations, there are situations where voter turnout does not exceed 50%," Zaw Min Tun said, saying the turnout was a "source of pride".

Turnout was about 70% in Myanmar's 2020 and 2015 general elections, according to the U.S.-based nonprofit International Foundation for Electoral Systems.

Further rounds of voting will be held on January 11 and January 25 , covering 265 of Myanmar's 330 townships, although the junta does not have complete control of all those areas.

The junta's legal framework for the election has no minimum voter turnout requirement, said the Asian Network for Free Elections poll monitoring group.

This is likely to extend the final release of the documents to much later than expected after a December 19 deadline set by Congress, the document said.

The White House and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

The Trump administration ordered the Justice Department to release the files tied to criminal probes of Jeffrey Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender, who was friends with U.S. President Donald Trump in the 1990s, in compliance with a transparency law passed by Congress last month.

Collectively, the Criminal Division, the National Security Division, the FBI and the US Attorney's office in Manhattan are providing 400 attorneys to review the files, the document said, a more precise, and potentially much larger, figure than previous estimates from the department.

The review will occur between January 5-23, the document added.

Department leaders are offering telework options and time off awards as incentives for volunteers, the document said, adding that lawyers who assist will be expected to devote three to five hours a day to review about 1,000 documents a day.

The DOJ said last week it had uncovered more than a million additional documents potentially linked to Epstein.

So far, the disclosures have been heavily redacted, frustrating some Republicans and doing little to quell a scandal that threatens the party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.

The law, approved by Congress with broad bipartisan support, requires all Epstein-related files to be made public, despite Trump’s months-long effort to keep them sealed. Under the statute, all documents were to be released by December 19, with redactions to protect victims.

Trump knew Epstein socially in the 1990s and early 2000s. He has said their association ended in the mid-2000s and that he was never aware of the financier's sexual abuse.

Epstein was convicted in Florida in 2008 of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. The Justice Department charged him with sex trafficking in 2019. Epstein was found dead in 2019 in a New York jail and his death was ruled a suicide.

In a message shared on X last week, the Justice Department said , opens new tab , "We have lawyers working around the clock to review and make the legally required redactions to protect victims, and we will release the documents as soon as possible. Due to the mass volume of material, this process may take a few more weeks."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:34:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ADACEQV3SFPNRL2URHSUWZJZ3I.jpg?auth=4ce8ae2ea1edaaadc4e324e1369c5b6739a1c3331a5c798cad3c3172edf314b0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda detains prominent rights campaigner and government critic ahead of polls</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-detains-prominent-rights-campaigner-government-critic-ahead-polls-2025-12-31/</link><description>KAMPALA, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Police in Uganda said they have detained a prominent human rights activist as long-serving President Yoweri Museveni's government widens its crackdown on dissent and political opposition ahead of the January 15 general election.

The detention of Sarah Bireete, head of a rights organisation and a frequent anti-government commentator on local TV and radio, was confirmed by police in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday.

"She is in police custody. She will be arraigned before court in due course," the post said, without specifying when she would appear in court or what charges she faces.

Bireete, a lawyer and executive director of the Centre for Constitutional Governance (CCG), has been critical of a range of government actions including what the opposition says are illegal detentions and torture of its supporters.

The CCG could not be immediately reached for comment.

The January election pits incumbent Museveni, 81, who has been in power since 1986, against pop-star-turned-politician Bobi Wine.

Wine, 43, and his National Unity Platform party say hundreds of their members have been detained this year including during the campaigns in a move meant to intimidate his supporters and sap party morale.

Last month, U.N. Human Rights Chief Volker Türk also decried what he described as an "intensifying crackdown" on the opposition in Uganda and said at least 550 NUP supporters had been detained this year.

Another major opposition figure , Kizza Besigye, remains in prison more than a year after he was detained on treason charges.

Wine himself was beaten by security forces as he campaigned in the country's north and while police promised to probe the alleged beating, no report has been produced.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:36:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: At least four wounded in Russian drone strikes on Odesa, including three children</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251231-live-at-least-four-wounded-in-russian-drone-strikes-on-odesa-including-three-children</link><description>Russia’s ​top general said its forces were pressing forward in northeastern ⁠Ukraine and President Vladimir Putin had ordered expansion of territory Moscow calls a buffer zone there in 2026, Russian news agencies.

Chief of the General Staff Valery ‍Gerasimov said Putin ordered expansion in 2026 of the buffer zone in Ukraine’s regions ​of Sumy and Kharkiv near the Russian border, ​RIA said, adding that he inspected the “North” troop grouping.

The grouping, formed in early 2024, has operated in northeastern Ukraine, seeking to create a buffer along the border and trying to push back Ukrainian forces there for further advances.

Putin has repeatedly portrayed the buffer zone ‍as a way to push Ukrainian forces and weapons farther from Russia’s border, citing cross-border shelling and drone attacks on regions such as Belgorod and Kursk.

Kyiv has rejected Moscow’s buffer zone calling it an idea Russia is using to justify deeper incursions into ‍Ukrainian territory.

Russia launched an ⁠overnight drone attack on Ukraine’s Odesa region, damaging residential buildings and infrastructure and wounding four people, including three children, regional ​authorities said.

Odesa, a major ‍Black Sea port, has been repeatedly targeted by Russian missiles and ​drones during nearly four years of war, with strikes ​frequently hitting energy, transport and port infrastructure as well as residential areas.

"Strike drones attacked residential, logistics and energy infrastructure in our region," Oleh Kiper, governor of the Odesa region, said on the Telegram messaging app.

In Odesa city, which ‍is the administrative centre of the broader Odesa region, four people ​were injured, including a seven-month-old infant, two other children, and a 42-year-old man, Serhiy Lisak, the head of ‌Odesa's military administration, said on Telegram.

He said that drone debris and direct hits damaged ‍facades and windows of several high-rise apartment buildings.

A Ukrainian drone attack wounded two people and sparked a fire that ⁠was quickly extinguished at the Tuapse oil refinery, the operational headquarters of Russia's Krasnodar region said.

The strike damaged refinery equipment, one port berth ​and five homes – windows were broken in four apartment blocks and ‍a private house – the Krasnodar operational headquarters said on the Telegram messaging app.

Tuapse in the Krasnodar region ​lies in southwest Russia on the Black Sea and about 350km to the nearest parts of Ukraine’s mainland across the Sea of Azov.

The refinery blaze was put out after burning about 300 square metres, it said, but the authorities did not provide details on the extent of the damage to the oil refinery's equipment or whether operations were halted.

Tuapse is one of Russia's ‍key Black Sea outlets for oil products, anchored by Rosneft’s export-oriented Tuapse refinery, which has capacity to ​process about 240,000 barrels of crude oil per day and supplies products such as naphtha, fuel oil and diesel.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:38:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0daf5ff0-e5fc-11f0-9303-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25357373740395-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>From science to sport: These are the stories that lifted spirits in 2025</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20251231-from-science-to-sport-these-are-the-stories-that-lifted-spirits-in-2025</link><description>Welcome to 2026! As the new year begins, FRANCE 24 takes a final look back at the stories that lifted spirits in recent months. From scientific breakthroughs to signs of hope for the planet, there was enough to end 2025 on a high note.

Scientists had awaited the moment since the 1950s. In July, NASA released the closest images ever taken of the Sun, captured by the Parker Solar Probe.

In the black-and-white images, untrained eyes may see wisps resembling smoke. Experts, however, identify overlapping plasma eruptions and solar wind captured in unprecedented detail, providing valuable data to better understand space weather and the workings of the star.

There was also cause for optimism in the medical field. In January, a team of US researchers made a major breakthrough on multiple sclerosis, demonstrating a link between the autoimmune disease – which affects more than 2.8 million people worldwide – and the Epstein-Barr virus.

The discovery raised hope that vaccination against the virus could one day eliminate one of the disease’s triggers.

Another positive development concerned HIV prevention. Generic versions of injectable lenacapavir, a preventive treatment against the virus that causes AIDS , are expected to become available at a lower cost in around 100 countries from 2027.

The development is expected to greatly expand access to a treatment considered far more practical than a daily pill, particularly in low-income countries.

"Tobacco is taboo, we’ll beat it", said a French slogan that might just become reality. Last year, the number of smokers in the country declined , especially among young people, according to the French public health agency Santé publique France .

Specialists attributed the trend to anti-smoking policies implemented since 2014.

In 2025, the campaign intensified further , with smoking banned on beaches, in parks and in public gardens. The government’s stated aim is to achieve a tobacco-free generation by 2032.

It was a strong year for marine life. In June, world leaders met to reinforce the protection of the oceans.

Measures discussed included safeguarding the high seas, strengthening efforts against illegal fishing and expanding marine protected areas.

One commitment has already been fulfilled. After decades of negotiations, states (finally) ratified a treaty on protecting the high seas, providing tools to preserve ocean areas beyond national jurisdiction.

The Iberian lynx, recognisable by its pointed ears and spotted coat, recorded a significant recovery. After narrowly avoiding extinction, the species was removed this year from the "endangered" category on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species.

This year, there were 2,021 Iberian lynxes worldwide, a significant jump from just 94 recorded in 2001.

The green sea turtle also showed signs of recovery. Long hunted for its eggs and shell, it is no longer classified as endangered, highlighting the effectiveness of conservation measures when properly enforced.

Reproductive rights in Europe also advanced in 2025. On December 17, the European Parliament adopted a resolution urging EU institutions to facilitate access to safe abortions across the bloc.

The move followed a petition signed by more than one million EU citizens. It called for a mechanism enabling people living in countries without access to safe and legal abortion to travel at reduced cost to another EU member state where the procedure is permitted.

The European Commission said it would review the petition before March 2026.

After a century and the Paris Olympic Games , a long-held ambition became reality. This summer, thousands of people swam in specially designed areas of the River Seine in the heart of the French capital.

FRANCE 24's journalists also took part in the experience.

Few observers expected it. Curacao, a Caribbean island with 156,000 inhabitants and an autonomous state within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, qualified for the 2026 Football World Cup .

Another unexpected qualifier was Haiti . One of the world’s poorest countries and plagued by gang violence, Haiti also secured a place at the tournament, marking only the second international competition in its history.

Egypt inaugurated the Grand Egyptian Museum in November, marking a major moment for history enthusiasts.

The museum, dedicated to the Pharaonic civilisation, houses colossal statues, sarcophagi, tools and jewellery. Nearly 100,000 artefacts are displayed across more than 50,000 square metres of exhibition space.

It was the masterpiece no one saw coming. "Clair Obscur: Expedition 33", the debut title from French studio Sandfall Interactive, won multiple awards at the Game Awards ceremony.

It marked a first for a French game and a notable achievement for a fantasy universe inspired by Paris in the 1900s, developed by around 30 people on a modest budget.

The 345-page code was passed in 2022 and replaces a set of laws established during Dutch colonial rule. Its broad definitions drew condemnation from democracy activists concerned it might harm civil liberties and free speech, and put government critics at risk of arrest.

Law Minister Supratman Andi Agtas said the overhaul of the law was timely, but acknowledged there was a risk of the new powers being abused by authorities.

"There will be that," he said over the phone on Tuesday, referring to potential abuses of the code. "We're not blind. But what's important is public control. Anything that's new will not be immediately perfect."

Decades in the making, the revisions to the criminal code were passed in then-President Joko Widodo's final term. At the time, then-U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged Widodo to reconsider some of the provisions .

The code was updated to reflect Indonesia's current legal and cultural norms, citing new policies such as a restorative justice system, Agtas said. "It's our own legal system ... different from other countries," he added.

The law criminalises sex outside marriage with a punishment of up to one year in jail, but only if a spouse, parent, or child of the alleged offender makes a complaint. Currently, only adultery is a crime in Indonesia.

The reporting requirement has eased tourism industry concerns that foreigners could be caught by the law, said Hariyadi Sukamdani, chairman of the Confederation of Indonesia Tourism Association.

Insulting the president or state agencies may result in a prison term of as many as three years under the new law, while people disseminating communism or other ideologies "that are against" Indonesia's state ideology face up to four years in jail.

The new code's definition of "attacking honour or dignity", which it says is where a reputation or self-worth is damaged, includes actions such as libel or defamation.

Asfinawati, a legal expert who goes by one name, said this week that the definition of insults was among the broad provisions that raised concerns for free speech and activist groups.

"This is a new colonial set of laws, made by our own," she said, adding the expansive nature of the code did not guarantee that officials would properly apply it.

Agtas said law officers had been briefed about the new code, and along with a separate criminal procedure code set to take effect on Friday, there were guardrails intended to prevent power abuses.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 07:25:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HHERALX4URNEBEIVRNVKY6CNEA.jpg?auth=4cb754656afd1dd7e1cec7d2681d250d39cbe37d783ae4dc2e1503ebe57f548f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Insight: How Israel’s multi-ton truck bombs ripped through Gaza City</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-israels-multi-ton-truck-bombs-ripped-through-gaza-city-2025-12-31/</link><description>GAZA CITY, Dec 31 (Reuters) - In the weeks before the Gaza ceasefire on October 10, Israel widely deployed a new weapon: M113 Armoured Personnel Carriers repurposed to carry between 1 and 3 tons of explosives, Reuters found.

As Israeli troops pushed toward the centre of Gaza City, these powerful bombs, along with airstrikes and armour-plated bulldozers, leveled swathes of buildings, drone footage and satellite images show.

In most cases, but not all, the inhabitants fled ahead of demolitions after Israeli warnings, residents, Israeli security sources and Gaza authorities said.

Hesham Mohammad Badawi’s five-storey home on Dawla Street in the affluent Tel-al-Hawa suburb, damaged by an airstrike earlier in the war, was completely destroyed by an APC explosion on September 14, he and a relative said, leaving him and 41 family members homeless.

Badawi, who was a few hundred meters away, said he heard at least five APCs detonate in roughly five-minute intervals. He said he received no evacuation warning before the demolition and family members escaped “by a miracle” amid explosions and heavy gunfire.

Several buildings in the same block were demolished around that time, satellite images show.

The family is now staying with relatives in different parts of the city, Badawi said, while he lives in a tent by his former home. Israel’s military did not respond to Reuters questions about the incident. Reuters could not establish what Israel targeted in the attack or independently verify all the details of Badawi’s account of the events.

When Reuters visited in November, remains of at least one of the vehicles were strewn among large piles of rubble.

"We could not believe this was our neighbourhood, this was our street,” Badawi said.

To compile a detailed account of the role of APC-based bombs by the Israeli military in Tel-al-Hawa and the neighbouring Sabra district in the six weeks before the ceasefire, Reuters spoke to three Israeli security sources, a retired Israeli military brigadier, an Israeli reservist, Gazan authorities and three military experts.

Seven Gaza City residents said their homes or those of neighbours were levelled or severely damaged by the explosions, which several likened to an earthquake. Analysis of Reuters footage by two of the military experts confirmed wreckage of at least two exploded APCs among the rubble at sites in Gaza City.

Israel packed 1 to 3 tons of ordnance in APCs, three military experts estimated, based on cabin space and wreckage of vehicle armour. Some of the ordnance was likely non–military ammonium nitrate or emulsion, though without chemical testing that conclusion is not certain, they said.

Such a multi-ton explosion could approach an equivalent power to Israel’s largest airborne bombs, the 2,000-pound U.S.-made Mark 84, said two experts, who examined Reuters footage of the blast area and vehicle remains.

It could scatter vehicle fragments hundreds of meters, and break close-by exterior walls and building columns. The blast wave would be strong enough to potentially collapse a multi-storey building, they said.

APCs generally transport troops and equipment on the battlefield. The three military experts consulted by Reuters said use of the vehicles as bombs was highly unusual and risked excessive damage to civilian dwellings.

In response to detailed Reuters questions for this story, Israel’s military said it was committed to the rules of war. Regarding allegations of destruction of civilian infrastructure, it said it used what it called engineering equipment only for “essential operational purposes,” without disclosing further details.

Decisions are guided by military necessity, distinction, and proportionality, it said.

In an interview with Reuters in Gaza for this story, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said Israel’s demolitions with armoured vehicles were aimed at the large-scale displacement of the city's residents, which Israel has denied.

The reporting provides new evidence of the power of these low-tech weapons and how they came to be widely used.

Retired reservist Brigadier-General Amir Avivi, founder of the Israel Defense and Security Forum (IDSF), a think tank, called the weapon an “innovation of the Gaza War.” One of the security sources said its increasing use partly responded to U.S. restrictions on transfers of heavy Mark-84 airborne bombs and Caterpillar bulldozers.

Israel’s military and Prime Minister’s Office also did not respond to questions about the reasons for the shift in tactics. The U.S. State Department, White House and Department of War did not respond to Reuters questions for this story.

Before the war, Tel-al-Hawa and Sabra, a historic area of modest houses in south-central Gaza City, bustled with bakeries, shopping malls, mosques, banks and universities.

Now, large parts lie in ruins.

Satellite imagery analysis by Reuters showed that about 650 buildings in Sabra, Tel-al-Hawa and surrounding areas were destroyed in the six weeks between September 1 and October 11.

Two international law scholars, the U.N. human rights office and two of the military experts who reviewed Reuters findings said use of such large explosives in dense residential urban areas may have failed one or more principles of humanitarian law that prohibit attacking civilian infrastructure and using disproportionate force.

“The basis that some of it may be booby-trapped" or once used by Hamas snipers is not enough to justify mass destruction, Ajith Sunghay, head of the U.N. Human Rights Office in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, told Reuters, referring to Israel’s allegation that Hamas placed improvised explosive devices in houses, which Hamas denies.

In some circumstances, buildings could lose legal protection and become targets if Israel had evidence Hamas used them for military advantage, said Afonso Seixas Nunes, Associate Professor in the School of Law at Saint Louis University.

Israel’s military did not respond to Reuters requests to provide such evidence.

If not the result of military necessity, the demolition of civilian infrastructure could amount to wanton destruction of property, which is a war crime, Sunghay said.

The level of ruin reflects a broader trend: 81% of Gaza’s buildings suffered damage or destruction during the war, according to the U.N. Satellite Center. The area including Gaza City experienced most damage since July, with approximately 5,600 newly affected structures, it said in October.

In August, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters Israel was packing tons of explosives into APCs because Hamas had placed explosive devices in “just about every single building” in evacuated areas.

“We detonate them, and they set off all the booby traps. That's why you see the destruction," Netanyahu said.

In response to questions for this story, Qassem, the Hamas spokesman, denied booby trapping buildings, and said Hamas did not have the capacity to set devices at the scale Israel claimed.

Later in August, Israeli forces entered Gaza City with the declared aim of eliminating Hamas and freeing hostages held by militants since the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that triggered the war.

Israel ordered a full evacuation of the city in September.

As troops advanced, backed by tanks and airstrikes, they extensively damaged eastern suburbs before approaching central areas of the city, where most displaced people were sheltering.

Hundreds of thousands fled south. The U.N. estimated 600,000-700,000 people remained in the city.

Israel’s defense minister has said soldiers demolished 25 towers that Israel said had Hamas tunnels underneath or were used as lookout points. The U.N. human rights office says Israel has provided no evidence the buildings were military targets.

Among the destruction visible in Sabra, Tel-al-Hawa and South Rimal between September 1 and October 11, Reuters identified al-Roya tower, which housed the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights, a prominent human rights office that worked with charity Christian Aid, and al-Roya 2, a mixture of business and flats, brought down by airstrikes on September 7 and 8.

Two wings of the Islamic University of Gaza and a mosque on the campus were destroyed. In one six-block corner of Tel-al-Hawa almost every building was demolished - more than 60 in total.

Beyond the two cases of APC explosions analysed in detail for this story, and airstrikes on towers caught on video, Reuters could not establish what weapons Israel deployed to demolish buildings, or the total number of APCs detonated from August until the ceasefire.

Gaza’s Civil Defense spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said the army detonated hundreds of APCs in that period, as many as 20 daily. Israel’s military did not reply to a question on numbers.

Among the buildings destroyed was Badawi’s family home of four decades, along with more than 20 neighbouring buildings in the same period.

“We didn’t recognize this as our house," he said.

Two military experts said Reuters footage of the area showed remains of at least one detonated APC.

The explosion had torn one APC caterpillar track from its running gear and “physically thrown it onto the roof” of a multi-storey building, a retired senior British military bomb disposal officer said, noting that M113 tracks each weigh hundreds of kilograms.

A thick, ripped piece of metal and a wheel torn in half, both scattered at the property, were consistent with a detonation from within the APC, said Gareth Collett, a retired British Brigadier General and leading authority on explosives and bomb disposal. He said the large size of the fragments was indicative of a commercial low energy explosive.

Bought from the U.S. after the Yom Kippur War in the 1970s, thousands of M113s were deemed to insufficiently protect soldiers and were mothballed, military historian Yagil Henkin said.

FMC Corp, originally the M113’s primary manufacturer, did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment about its use as a weapon and potential associated human rights concerns.

BAE Systems, which currently provides maintenance for the vehicle globally, did not reply to Reuters questions about Israel's new use of the M113 other than to say it currently had no direct military sales to the country. It said equipment it sold to the U.S. government could reach other countries indirectly.

In May, Israel posted a public tender seeking to sell an unspecified number of M113s internationally, public documents show.

The tender was later cancelled, according to an undated posting on the Ministry of Defence website. The cancellation allowed Israel to scale up repurposing M113s, one of the security sources told Reuters. The military did not respond to Reuters’ questions about the tender.

The first media reports of an APC detonating in Gaza date to mid-2024.

Use accelerated this year when Israel rationed stocks after the U.S. paused deliveries of Mark-84 bombs over concerns about the bombs use in residential areas, the source said.

The increased role of APC-based bombs also coincided with shortages in Israel of U.S. company Caterpillar's giant D9 bulldozer, long used by Israel’s military for demolition, one of the security sources said.

Hamas heavily targeted D9s earlier in the war, killing or injuring soldiers and damaging the vehicles, the source said. Alarmed by their use to demolish homes, the U.S. paused D9 sales to Israel in November 2024, adding to the shortage. Under President Donald Trump, D9 transfers resumed.

Caterpillar did not respond to questions from Reuters about the military use of its machines in Gaza demolitions and has not publicly commented on the matter.

Amid the shortages, the military began using other methods of demolition, including APCs, another of the security sources said.

Danny Orbach, an Israeli military historian, told Reuters demolitions were normal in war, made necessary in Gaza due to tunnels and booby traps. He said Israel’s military was underprepared for the complex fighting, leading to the conclusion there was “no other way to fight such a war except destroying all buildings above ground.”

Israel's military told Reuters targets were reviewed prior to attack and the munition selected “to achieve the military objective while minimizing collateral damage” to civilians and civilian infrastructure.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 08:31:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OZTJPO6M5VM7TALMTY6XMXB4UQ.jpg?auth=760e740bb798aaaf397ee91568137db2f125aadeb07e6a82330e4e504f274a03&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mali and Burkina Faso announce reciprocal travel ban on US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/mali-burkina-faso-announce-reciprocal-travel-ban-us-2025-12-31/</link><description>BAMAKO, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Mali and Burkina Faso have said they are imposing a travel ban on U.S. citizens in response to an equivalent measure announced by the Trump administration earlier this month .

In separate statements issued by their foreign ministries late on Tuesday, the two West African countries said they were acting in the name of "reciprocity" after the White House announced on December 16 that U.S. President Donald Trump was adding them and five other countries to a list of those subject to a full travel ban.

The White House said the expanded ban, set to take effect on January 1, applied to "countries with demonstrated, persistent, and severe deficiencies in screening, vetting, and information-sharing to protect the Nation from national security and public safety threats".

Mali said on Tuesday that Washington's decision to add it to the travel ban list had been taken without prior consultation and that the stated rationale was not justified by "actual developments on the ground".

Mali and Burkina Faso are not the first countries to take such measures affecting U.S. citizens after being targeted by Trump's travel restrictions.

On December 25 neighbouring Niger announced it would stop issuing visas to U.S. citizens, the country's state media agency reported, citing a Nigerien diplomatic source.

In June, Chad announced it was suspending visa issuance to U.S. citizens after it was included on an earlier list of 12 countries affected by a travel ban.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 08:56:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bangladesh's Islamist party open to unity government after February vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bangladeshs-islamist-party-open-unity-government-after-february-vote-2025-12-31/</link><description /><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 09:46:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J72VEBLDTJOF5D5SZJDKKNPNKA.jpg?auth=82afdaa896f041b6209e1cd0d5382f2ba9dd0901d9cefef6ebbc17d0a893b5cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran to unleash 'decisive' response if economic protests destabilise country, prosecutor says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251231-iran-unleash-decisive-response-economic-protests-destabilise-country-prosecutor</link><description>Iran 's prosecutor general said on Wednesday that economic protests that had gripped the country were legitimate, but any attempt to create insecurity would be met with a "decisive response".

"Peaceful livelihood protests are part of social and understandable realities," Mohammad Movahedi-Azad told state media.

"Any attempt to turn economic protests into a tool of insecurity, destruction of public property, or implementation of externally designed scenarios will inevitably be met with a legal, proportionate and decisive response."

Protesters including shopkeepers and university students have been rallying against economic hardship in Iran since Sunday.

The Iranian rial has dropped against the dollar and other world currencies, forcing up import prices and hurting retail traders.

When the protests erupted on Sunday, the US dollar was trading at around 1.42 million rials, compared to 820,000 rials a year ago.

In December, inflation stood at 52 percent year-on-year, according to official statistics. But this figure still falls far short of many price increases, especially for basic necessities.

The country's economy, already battered by decades of severe Western sanctions, was further strained after the United Nations in late September reinstated international sanctions linked to the country's nuclear programme that were lifted 10 years ago.

President Masoud Pezeshkian – who has less authority under Iran's system of government than supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – met Tuesday with labour leaders and made proposals to tackle the economic crisis, according to press agency Mehr.

"I have asked the interior minister to listen to the legitimate demands of the protesters by engaging in dialogue with their representatives so that the government can do everything in its power to resolve the problems and act responsibly," he said in a social media post.

According to state television, parliamentary speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf, also called for "necessary measures focused on increasing people's purchasing power" but warned against foreign agents and government opponents attempting to exploit the protests.

On Monday, the government announced the replacement of the central bank governor with former economy and finance minister Abdolnasser Hemmati.

Israel 's Mossad spy agency on Wednesday issued a direct call urging Iranians to press on with protests, saying it was supporting them "on the ground" as demonstrations spread in capital Tehran and other Iranian cities.

"Go out into the streets together. The time has come. We are with you," Mossad wrote in a post on its Farsi-language X account, Israel's army radio reported on Wednesday.

"Not just from a distance or through words. We are also with you on the ground."</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 09:48:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4912dabe-e62d-11f0-8568-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25363525413736.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Heavy snow in Poland leaves drivers stranded in tailbacks of up to 20 km</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/heavy-snow-poland-leaves-drivers-stranded-tailbacks-up-20-km-2025-12-31/</link><description>WARSAW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Heavy snowfall in Poland caused tailbacks stretching as far as 20 km (12.43 miles) on a motorway between the capital Warsaw and the Baltic port city of Gdansk during the night, police said on Wednesday.

While the situation left hundreds of people trapped in their cars in freezing conditions, by the early hours of Wednesday morning traffic was moving again, according to police.

"The difficult situation began yesterday after 4 p.m., when the first trucks on the S7 route... began having trouble approaching the slopes," said Tomasz Markowski, a spokesperson for police in the northern city of Olsztyn.

"This led to a traffic jam stretching approximately 20 kilometres overnight."

Deputy Infrastructure Minister Stanislaw Bukowiec told a press conference that nobody had been hurt as a result of the difficult situation on the roads.

Anna Karczewska, a spokesperson for police in Ostroda, said officers had tried to help drivers who found themselves stuck. Ostroda lies on the highway about 40 km west of Olsztyn.

"We helped as much as we could, and we had coffee and hot tea for the drivers, which the Ostroda City Hall had prepared for us," she said.

State news agency PAP reported that there had also been some disruption to railways and airports, but that services were returning to normal.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Queen Camilla describes being assaulted by man as a teenager</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/queen-camilla-describes-being-assaulted-by-man-teenager-2025-12-31/</link><description>LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Britain's Queen Camilla has described for the first time fighting off an attack by a man on a train when she was a teenager, speaking in an interview with the BBC in which she recounted how furious the assault had left her.

"When I was a teenager, I was attacked on a train … I remember at the time being so angry," she said during a discussion broadcast on Wednesday about violence against women.

"I was reading my book and you know this boy - man - attacked me, and I did fight back."

She said she did not know the man who attacked her.

Camilla, 78, has for many years championed charities and causes that seek to end sexual and domestic violence and to support victims.

The assault was first reported in September when a book about the royal family was serialised in the Times newspaper, but had not previously been confirmed by Buckingham Palace.

"I remember getting off the train and my mother looking at me and saying 'Why is your hair standing on end and why is the button missing from your coat?'" she told the BBC.

"I was so furious about it and it's sort of lurked for many years."

The book said the incident happened on a train to Paddington Station in London when Camilla was about 16 or 17 years old, and she responded by taking off her shoe and using it to hit him in the genitals.

When she arrived at Paddington, she pointed the attacker out to an official and he was arrested, the book said.

Camilla did not confirm those details in the interview.

The queen is the second wife of King Charles, who ascended the throne in 2022.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:23:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YQPDCOJQKRNTJHO5MVQYRBKUOE.jpg?auth=34a16f94f187578549c71352a09f171be4b58896f03f5b5a83d4b6cc6fdeffcb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mamdani's inauguration: New York, new year, new mayor</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/mamdanis-inauguration-new-york-new-year-new-mayor-2025-12-31/</link><description>NEW YORK, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Zohran Mamdani was a trailblazing candidate whom many in his city of 8 million -- some with hope, some with trepidation -- expect to be a disruptive New York mayor.

The democratic socialist's plans for his first day in office on Thursday nod to his politics and priorities, without straying far from his predecessors with a sober official midnight oath-taking followed by a more celebratory ceremony in the afternoon.

New York law spells out that four-year mayoral terms start on the January 1 after elections. To avoid any ambiguity about who's in charge of America's most populous city, it has become a tradition to hold a small midnight swearing-in.

Mamdani has chosen as the site of his midnight oath the Old City Hall subway stop, which was decommissioned in the middle of the previous century and is accessible only a few times a year through guided tours.

The subway site, according to Mamdani’s transition team, reflects his "commitment to the working people who keep our city running every day."

Mamdani, a 34-year-old former state lawmaker, promised a freeze on rents and free buses and childcare, building a campaign around affordability issues that some have seen as a path forward for his Democratic Party around the country ahead of midterm elections.

Mamdani inspired a record-breaking turnout of more than 2 million voters and took 50 percent, nearly 10 points ahead of Andrew Cuomo running as an independent and well ahead of Republican Curtis Sliwa.

New York State Attorney General Letitia James, who was among Mamdani's earliest prominent backers, was to administer the midnight oath to Mamdani. During the first administration of President Donald Trump, James began investigating his business practices in New York, resulting in a judge finding in 2024 that Trump fraudulently overstated his net worth to dupe lenders. The Trump administration has targeted James during his second term, accusing her of mortgage fraud .

Grant Reeher, a Syracuse University political science professor, said the role James was to play in the inauguration sent a message to core supporters that Mamdani is "going to be independent of the president.”

INAUGURATION OF A NEW ERA

The Uganda-born Mamdani, who will be New York City's first Muslim mayor, has been a sharp critic of Trump on issues such as immigration and said his differences with the president were numerous after a warm White House meeting .

But being sworn in by the state attorney general may say more about Mamdani's political alliances than rivalries. In 2014 Bill de Blasio, whom Mamdani regards as the best New York City mayor of his lifetime, was sworn in privately by then-New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman at the start of the first of his two terms.

Senator Bernie Sanders, a progressive, Brooklyn-born Vermont senator whom Mamdani calls his inspiration, presided over de Blasio's public inauguration ceremony in 2018 and will play a similar role for Mamdani. Liberal Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is also on the inauguration ceremony agenda.

Plans for Mamdani's public inauguration include a ceremony on City Hall's steps and a program of music and speeches in front of 4,000 guests gathered in City Hall Plaza. In addition, tens of thousands of people will be able to watch a livestream of what Mamdani's team has dubbed the “Inauguration of a New Era” in free viewing areas set up along Broadway.

Mamdani raised $2.6 million for the transition and celebrations from nearly 30,000 contributors, more than other mayors on record in this century, both by the total and single donations, according to official campaign data that presents disclosures of inaugural expenses beginning with Michael Bloomberg's first term in 2001.

Sami Zaman, the owner of Astoria's low-key Afghan restaurant Sami's Kabab House, where Astoria resident Mamdani filmed a campaign video with Sanders, was on the inaugural committee alongside filmmakers, writers and activists.

After becoming mayor, Mamdani will move from his one-bedroom Astoria apartment, protected from sharp price hikes by the city rent-stabilization program, to Gracie Mansion, the official residence of New York City mayors on Manhattan's upscale Upper East Side.

Bankers and others in New York, the nation's financial capital , had expressed concern about Mamdani but since his election they have explored how to work with him. The city has had another mayor associated with democratic socialism, David Dinkins. Dinkins did not make much of his association with the Democratic Socialists of America. During his 1990-1993 term he overcame budget deficits and persuaded private businesses to remain in New York, according to city archivists.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 11:21:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3D5WPQ2ML5JLPLN7WA3UPGQHQI.jpg?auth=dada6cdeb348eb6fa5a8fa906bb7c38d32c6d780405c8a1f1c2cc5ff8b2b9ad9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy's Tajani calls for electoral reform with majority bonus before next national vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/italys-tajani-calls-electoral-reform-with-majority-bonus-before-next-national-2025-12-31/</link><description>ROME, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Wednesday the country's electoral law should be reformed to adopt a more proportional system as the ruling bloc seeks to safeguard its majority ahead of a general election due in 2027.

Tajani, who leads the conservative Forza Italia party and is a key ally in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition, said the reform should include a majority premium to guarantee governability.

"We will discuss it. No one wants to exclude the centre-left, but the reform must be done," Tajani was quoted as saying in an interview with the newspaper Il Messaggero.

Key wins for Italy's opposition in southern regional elections show cracks in the ruling conservative bloc's dominance, raising doubts over Meloni's ability to secure a second term in the next national vote.

Under the current system, 36% of lawmakers are elected in first-past-the-post constituencies.

Meloni and her allies swept to power in 2022 after the centre-left failed to form a pre-election alliance, splitting votes in key first-past-the-post races.

Italy has since enjoyed a rare period of political stability.

However, analysts say a centre-left alliance could threaten Meloni's grip on power.

Tajani said that proportional representation would better reflect local interests, especially after the recent cut in the number of lawmakers.

Italy reduced the size of its parliament in 2020, cutting the number of deputies from 630 to 400 and senators from 315 to 200.

The change has intensified debate over how to ensure fair representation under the current mixed electoral system, which combines proportional and first-past-the-post elements.

"With proportional representation, territories would be represented more," Tajani said.

Electoral law has long been a contentious issue in Italy, where frequent changes to voting rules have shaped political dynamics. The current system, introduced in 2017, was designed to balance stability with representation but has faced criticism for producing fragmented parliaments again.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 12:45:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SQED77NV6ZNR7C4CSUO42A3YHY.jpg?auth=72eadcf8cf069a45a749ddfa61cde2753feb5c81577dd222fa5787e211efb6f9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia releases video footage to challenge Kyiv over alleged attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russia-releases-video-footage-challenge-kyiv-over-alleged-attack-2025-12-31/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russia's defence ministry released video footage on Wednesday of what it said was a downed drone at a briefing intended to show Ukraine tried this week to attack a presidential residence and challenge Kyiv's denials that such an attack took place.

Kyiv says Moscow has produced no evidence to support its allegations and that Russia invented the alleged attack to block progress at talks on ending the war in Ukraine . Officials in several Western countries have cast doubt on Russia's version of events and questioned whether there was any attack.

Video footage released by Russia's defence ministry showed a senior officer, Major-General Alexander Romanenkov, setting out details of how Moscow says it believes Ukraine attacked one of President Vladimir Putin's residences in the Novgorod region.

Romanenkov said 91 drones had been launched from Ukraine's Sumy and Chernihiv regions in a "thoroughly planned" attack that he said was thwarted by Russian air defences, caused no damage and injured no one.

The video released by the ministry included footage of a Russian serviceman standing next to fragments of a device which he said was a downed Ukrainian Chaklun-V drone carrying a 6-kg explosive device which had not detonated.

The ministry did not explain how it knew what the device's target was.

Reuters could not confirm the location and the date of the footage showing fragments of a destroyed device. The model of the destroyed device could not be immediately verified.

Other footage featured a man, identified as Igor Bolshakov from a village in the Novgorod region, saying he had heard air defence rockets in action.

Ukraine did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the Russian defence ministry's footage.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:33:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T74NYN25NJNXTMFNKK4L7GJGCE.jpg?auth=302ee1d252e142b5655f3386c56ad9284a25dd1be2803d420361e592552df2d5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sydney brings in New Year with nod to victims of Bondi attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/sydney-brings-new-year-with-nod-victims-bondi-attack-2025-12-31/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Australia's Sydney began 2026 with a fireworks display held under an enhanced police presence, weeks after gunmen killed 15 people at a Jewish event in the city.

Sydney's annual New Year's Eve celebrations are known globally for their spectacular fireworks, with 40,000 pyrotechnic effects stretching seven km (four miles) across buildings and barges along its harbour, including the city's iconic Harbour Bridge and Opera House.

Organisers held a minute's silence for the victims of the attack at 11:00 p.m. local time (1200 GMT), with the Harbour Bridge lit up in white and a menorah - a symbol long used to symbolise Judaism - projected onto its pylons.

"After a tragic end to the year for our city, we hope that New Year’s Eve will provide an opportunity to come together and look with hope for a peaceful and happy 2026," Sydney's Lord Mayor Clover Moore said ahead of the event.

The father and son gunmen are alleged to have killed 15 people at a Hanukkah event on December 14, Australia's worst mass shooting in almost three decades that shocked the nation and stoked fears of rising antisemitism in the country.

Traditional Christmas celebrations at Bondi were muted this year, and several New Year events planned there were cancelled.

Around 3,000 police, some carrying long arms, were deployed in the city during the main New Year celebrations, that typically attract over a million revellers.

"We have to show defiance in the face of this terrible crime and say that we're not going to be cowed by this kind of terrorism, and we're not going to change the way we live our life in our beautiful city," New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said on Wednesday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 13:33:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CIR2NTWLWFNKNOGATC3XJKY2SI.jpg?auth=1ce812b2222b6a84b8f76c964194c0667877f0a07b06adfef17eab9b05c777f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>From battleships to buildings: Trump's name is everywhere</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/battleships-buildings-trumps-name-is-everywhere-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - As a New York businessman, President Donald Trump put his name on real estate, golf courses, vodka, steaks, bottled water and his own university.

As president in his second term, he is merging his personal brand with national institutions and government programs, an unusual assertion of power by a sitting U.S. president.

Since returning to office in January, the Republican president has affixed his name to prominent Washington buildings, a planned class of Navy warships, a visa program for wealthy foreigners, a government-run prescription drug website, and federal savings accounts for children.

Some historians see it as a superficial legacy-building effort by the president that may not stand the test of time. A backlash has already begun against the renaming of Washington's premier performance venue as the Donald J. Trump and John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts, with several acts canceling in protest.

"I don't think the naming or renaming guarantees that Trump's name will be affixed to those things until time immemorial," said Austin Sarat, a professor of jurisprudence and political science at Amherst College, who questioned whether Trump's name would remain if Democrats regain power.

Elizabeth Huston, a White House spokeswoman, said the administration was not focused on "smart branding, but delivering on President Trump’s goal of Making America Great Again.”

"Drug pricing agreements, overdue upgrades of national landmarks, lasting peace deals, and wealth-creation accounts for children are historic initiatives that would not have been possible without President Trump’s bold leadership," she said in an emailed statement.

The first year of Trump's second White House term has seen a shock-and-awe policy blitz that expanded presidential power, remade some parts of the federal bureaucracy and economy, and reshaped America's relations with the world.

But one of the most striking features of the past 11 months has been the energy and attention Trump has given to placing his name on buildings and government programs.

Trump's populist moves have alarmed Democrats and civil society watchdogs who worry they create the impression that Trump, rather than the state, is the provider of essential services. Defenders say what Trump is doing is simply an extension of his decades as a savvy marketer.

The biggest outcry came this December when his name was added to the Kennedy Center, named for the late Democratic president in 1964 by an act of Congress to honor him after his assassination.

The center was renamed by its board of trustees, a majority of whom were appointed by Trump.

Just up the Potomac River sits the U.S. Institute of Peace, a government-funded think tank established by Congress and focused on conflict avoidance.

On December 3 the U.S. State Department renamed it the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace, based on Trump's assertion he has ended eight wars, a claim widely disputed given ongoing conflicts in several of those hotspots. Trump's name has been affixed to the building's exterior.

Washington has many buildings and monuments named after presidents, but that has traditionally occurred well after they have left office and are normally national tributes to them, often established by Congress.

Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton University, said while previous presidents were not shy in reminding voters they were responsible for popular policies, including stimulus money or infrastructure programs, "that's very different to what you're seeing today."

"It's a lot easier to get your name on a building or a ship than to pass legislation that's enduring," Zelizer said. In terms of a lasting legacy, however, "it's very thin."

Trump has announced a plan for a new generation of U.S. Navy warships, which he called "Trump-class" battleships and said he will be personally involved in the designs.

If Trump's name appears on any of the ships, or "Trump-class" becomes an official Navy designation for the new battleships, a later name change would be a first, Zelizer said.

But Trump's announcement does not guarantee the ships will be built. The Navy has canceled shipbuilding programs in the past, and the Trump-class ships are still in the design phase of a process that typically takes many years.

The meeting came a day after a Saudi-led strike on Yemen's southern port of Mukalla, which raised tensions between Riyadh and the United Arab Emirates.

In recent weeks, a Saudi-led coalition has clashed with UAE-backed southern separatists in Yemen. The UAE has said it is ending its remaining military mission there, highlighting a widening rift between the Gulf allies.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:21:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MV34WNWASVMNDEWA67HVXPBYVM.jpg?auth=8ed5abcfea348477cb1ddb08ca46de85cd60c102d93e8c9a4b7fd6ec0fbdc768&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UAE foreign policy in spotlight after Yemen escalation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uae-foreign-policy-spotlight-after-yemen-escalation-2025-12-31/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 31 - The United Arab Emirates has pursued an assertive foreign policy and carved its own sphere of influence across the Middle East and Africa, a strategy in the spotlight after a rare military escalation with Saudi Arabia in Yemen this week.

Abu Dhabi has used alliances with states or proxies, military intervention and financial support mainly to counter what it views as the destabilising threat of political Islam, specifically from groups linked to the Muslim Brotherhood.

Senior Emirati officials have described the strategy as strengthening nation-states against extremists, though U.N. experts and Western officials have asserted that the approach has at times fuelled conflict, a charge the UAE denies, and critics say it bolsters authoritarian leaders.

Here are details of the UAE's involvement in key countries:

The UAE announced a withdrawal of its troops from Yemen in 2019, but has maintained influence through the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group it trained and equipped.

It views the STC as a bulwark against the Islah party, a key faction in the Saudi-backed government of Yemen that the UAE regards as a Muslim Brotherhood offshoot, and as a partner in securing maritime access.

Abu Dhabi has been Cairo's most important financial backer since Egypt's President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi led the military overthrow of the Muslim Brotherhood government in 2013, viewing a secular Egypt as a firewall against an Islamist resurgence.

In 2024, Emirati sovereign wealth fund ADQ signed a $35 billion deal to develop a prime stretch of Egypt's Mediterranean coast - a vital injection of hard currency while Cairo was strapped for cash.

Their shared distrust of the Muslim Brotherhood anchors their political alliance, which has seen them coordinate the 2017 boycott of Qatar and oppose Turkey's influence in Libya.

Turkey's ruling AK Party has close ties to the Brotherhood.

U.N. sanctions monitors have described what they deemed credible allegations that the UAE provided military support to Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, in the civil war against the Sudanese army.

Analysts have said the UAE distrusts the Sudanese Armed Forces chief, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, due to the presence within his ranks of Islamists from the regime of longtime former Sudanese strongman Omar al-Bashir, viewing Hemedti - a former partner in Yemen - as a counterweight.

The RSF has been accused, including by the U.S. and rights groups, of committing crimes against humanity and ethnically motivated mass killings in Darfur.

The UAE has strongly denied supplying arms to the RSF, stating in letters to the U.N. that the allegations lack evidence, and emphasizing that its role is strictly humanitarian.

The UAE has strengthened security and economic ties with Chad's transitional President Mahamat Idriss Deby, signing a military cooperation agreement in 2023 and supplying armoured vehicles to the Sahelian state, which it views as a buffer against Islamist insurgents.

Attention has focused on the remote Amdjarass airport near the Sudanese border, where Reuters reported a surge in cargo flights .

While the UAE says it operates a field hospital and delivers aid for Sudanese refugees there, U.N. sanctions monitors and Western officials have alleged that the airstrip serves as a key logistics hub for supplying weapons to the RSF.

The UAE denies the charges, maintaining its operations are purely humanitarian.

The UAE was the primary foreign backer of the east Libya-based commander Khalifa Haftar, providing air support and equipment to his self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) during a 2019 offensive on Tripoli, according to U.N. experts.

The intervention aimed to topple the Tripoli-based, internationally recognised Government of National Accord, which included Muslim Brotherhood-affiliated factions and was supported militarily by Turkey.

While the civil war has been in a fragile stalemate, the UAE remains a key power broker , maintaining close ties to eastern factions and the Haftar family while engaging in diplomatic efforts to shape a government free of what it terms "extremist militias." However, Haftar’s own coalition includes hardline Salafist factions.

In 2020, the UAE broke with decades of Arab consensus by normalising relations with Israel under the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, a move Saudi Arabia has declined to follow without a path to Palestinian statehood.

The pact formalised a strategic alignment against shared adversaries, specifically Iran and Islamist groups like Hamas.

While the Gaza war has cooled public engagement, with Emirati officials frequently criticising Israeli military conduct, Abu Dhabi has maintained its diplomatic ties, viewing the relationship as a critical lever for regional influence and a unique channel to Washington.

The UAE has cultivated deep economic and security ties with the self-declared republic of Somaliland, as Abu Dhabi has frequently viewed the federal Somali government in Mogadishu as being too close to Qatar and Turkey.

The centrepiece of this strategy is DP World's $442 million investment to develop and operate the Port of Berbera, creating a strategic alternative to Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden.

In 2017, Somaliland's parliament voted to allow the UAE to build a military base in Berbera. While the base was later designated for civilian use, the UAE continues to train Somaliland's security forces while maintaining a consulate-level presence in Hargeisa.

Last week, Israel became the first nation to officially recognise Somaliland's independence , a diplomatic breakthrough that was facilitated by Abu Dhabi, according to an Axios report that cited Israeli officials.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:44:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/37CKWWVHZBOFPF5VX7GUF4SIEM.jpg?auth=f7889bd00b17bf6a03761c06ea2a974f89edb5add0113916b36c965b8dda8677&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranians try to access local government building on fourth day of protests, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranians-try-access-local-government-building-fourth-day-protests-state-media-2025-12-31/</link><description>DUBAI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Iranian protesters tried to break into a local government building in the southern Fars Province on Wednesday, state media said, on a fourth day of demonstrations over the cost of living that have prompted an unusual government offer of dialogue .

Protests over high inflation and a slump in the value of the local rial currency began among shopkeepers in Tehran on Sunday and by Tuesday had spread to several universities in Tehran, with the reported break-in attempt on Wednesday.

"A few hours ago an organised group tried to get into the governorate building in the city of Fasa, their attack failed with the intervention of security forces," state media said. "The leader of these rioters, a 28-year-old woman, was arrested".

Iran's Tasnim news agency cited a local official as saying four "attackers" were detained and three members of the security forces had been wounded during the incident.

A video carried by state media showed a group of people trying to break open the gate of the building. Reuters verified the location of the footage but was not able to independently verify the timing.

The governor of Fasa told state media that "the protests were caused by inflation and economic conditions. Individuals influenced by hostile channels and media participated in them... the situation is back to normal".

Iranian authorities have responded to previous protests over issues ranging from prices, drought, women's rights and political freedoms with forceful security measures and extensive arrests.

This time the government said it would set up a "dialogue mechanism" with leaders of the demonstrations, the first major protests since Israeli and U.S. strikes on Iran in June, which prompted widespread expressions of patriotic solidarity. It has not said how the mechanism would work.

Iran's economy has faced significant challenges for years following the reimposition of U.S. sanctions in 2018, when President Donald Trump withdrew from an international agreement concerning Iran's nuclear program during his first term.

Iran's rial currency has lost nearly half its value against the dollar in 2025, with inflation reaching 42.5% in December in a country where unrest has repeatedly flared in recent years.

In September, United Nations sanctions were reinstated, and Reuters reported in October that Iranian authorities held multiple high-level meetings to address economic instability, find ways to bypass sanctions, and handle public discontent.

In 2022, Iran faced protests across the country over price hikes, including for bread, a major staple.

Over the same period and into 2023, the country's clerical rulers faced the boldest unrest in years triggered by the death of a young Iranian Kurdish woman, Mahsa Amini, in the custody of the morality police, who enforce a strict female dress code.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 14:46:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In pictures: Sydney helps kick off celebrations as world ushers in 2026</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20251231-in-pictures-spectacular-fireworks-light-up-skies-as-world-ushers-in-2026</link><description>The world is welcoming 2026 with a bang as revellers enjoy fireworks and parties to bring in the New Year .

It suggests prohibiting online platforms from providing any "social networking service to a minor under fifteen years of age" from September 1, 2026.

It also seeks to extend an existing ban on mobile phones from preschool through middle school (which France introduced in 2018) to high schools as well.

The draft legislation says "numerous studies and reports now attest to the various risks associated with excessive use of digital screens by teenagers", and lists particular risks as "exposure to inappropriate content", "cyberbullying" and "sleep disturbances".

MPs, mostly from President Emmanuel Macron’s Ensemble pour la République (EPR) party, put forward the bill on November 18.

Macron, who has voiced support for a ban on social media for under-15s, previously said that the bill could be debated by parliament "as early as January".

A French mother whose 15-year-old son died by suicide launched a legal fight in December against some of the world’s biggest social media platforms, alleging their algorithms were flooded with content that drove him into a “downward spiral”.

Clement had only just started his second year of secondary school when he jumped off a bridge in the northwestern region of Brittany in 2024. His family are now seeking to reopen the investigation into his death and hold social media platforms to account.

They filed a complaint against TikTok and Meta , among other social media companies, in September on charges including incitement to suicide .

The vast majority of the videos on his TikTok "For You" page – where the platform's algorithm recommends content – were "inciting him to death, telling him he didn't matter to anyone", Clement's mother told AFP.

A social media ban for teens took effect earlier this month in Australia , making it the first country to institute such a law.

Children under 16 years old are now banned from using social media platforms, including X, TikTok, Facebook, Threads, Instagram, YouTube and Snapchat.

New accounts for this age group are prohibited and profiles that existed before the ban are being deactivated.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the new law aimed to support young Australians and ease the mental health pressures that can come from endless scrolling.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:34:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d874de3c-e65f-11f0-9809-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-10T065319Z-170299555-RC2HDIAFJUCF-RTRMADP-3-AUSTRALIA-SOCIALMEDIA-TEENMORE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Aid to Gaza under threat: Dozens of NGOs to be barred under new Israeli rules</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20251231-access-to-gaza-under-threat-msf-among-dozens-of-ngos-to-be-barred-under-new-israeli-rules</link><description>Medical charity Doctors Without Borders ( Médecins ⁠Sans Frontières or MSF ) urged Israel to allow it to operate in Gaza and the occupied West Bank in 2026 amid fears that it – and dozens of other NGOS – could be barred from operating in the Palestinian territories because of new Israeli rules set to come into force on January 1.

The organisation has provided care to nearly half a million people in more than two years of war in Gaza , where it currently supports around 20 percent of the hospital beds and a third of births.

"If MSF is prevented from working in Gaza, it will deprive hundreds of thousands of people from accessing medical care," the group said, highlighting the life and death stakes for civilians already struggling to access health services.

Israel’s said that 37 aid organisations – about 15 percent of the organisations operating in Gaza – have failed to comply with its new framework by a deadline that expires at midnight on Wednesday.

The new rules, announced in March, require aid organisations to “submit a list of their Palestinian employees in order to rule out any links to terrorism” and provide details about funding and operations to continue working in Gaza.

Organisations that refused to comply received notice on Tuesday that their licences would be revoked on January 1, with an obligation to cease all activities by March 1, 2026.

Along with MSF, organisations that will have their licenses revoked include the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), World Vision International, CARE and Oxfam, according to a list provided by Israel’s Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism.

The EU warned on Wednesday that Israel 's threat to suspend the aid groups would block "life-saving" assistance from reaching Gaza's population.

"The NGO registration law cannot be implemented in its current form," EU humanitarian chief Hadja Lahbib wrote on social media. "IHL (international humanitarian law) leaves no room for doubt: aid must reach those in need."

The United Nations rights chief on Wednesday said Israel's proposed ban was "outrageous", calling on states to urgently insist Israel shift course.

"Such arbitrary suspensions make an already intolerable situation even worse for the people of Gaza," Volker Turk said in a statement.

Israel said the ban would have a limited impact on the ground in Gaza, but the affected organisations say the timing – less than three months into a fragile ceasefire – is devastating.

NGOs currently ensure a large proportion of essential services in Gaza, such as the provision of healthcare, water , food and waste collection.

“There are almost no public systems working,” Claire Nicolet, emergency coordinator for MSF in Gaza, told FRANCE 24. “The majority of basic needs are covered by international organisations.”

The NRC said that being deregulated would mean it would likely be forced to shutter its East Jerusalem office and would not be able to bring foreign aid workers into the Palestinian enclave.

It has around 200 local staff as well as 35 international ‍staff across Gaza and the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem.

“The needs in Gaza are enormous and yet we and dozens of other organisations are and will continue to be blocked from bringing in essential life-saving assistance,” said Shaina Low, the NRC's communications adviser.

“Not being able to send staff into Gaza means all of the workload falls on our exhausted local staff,” she added.

Israel said its new framework for aid organisations would prevent "hostile actors or supporters of terrorism" operating in the Palestinian territories, specifically Hamas which it has accused of using aid organisations as a cover for militant activities.

In January, Israel banned the UN Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA , from operating on its territory after repeatedly accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas, using the militant group’s facilities and taking aid – accusations UNRWA denied.

Israel this week accused MSF of employing two individuals with links to Hamas and Islamic Jihad .

"They refuse to provide lists of their Palestinian employees because they know, just as we know, that some of them are involved in terrorism or linked to Hamas," spokesman for the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Gilad Zwick, told AFP.

MSF denied the claim. “MSF would never knowingly employ people engaging in military activity,” it said.

Some aid groups said they didn’t submit the list of Palestinian staff for fear they’d be targeted by Israel, and because of data protection laws in Europe.

“It comes from a legal and safety perspective. In Gaza, we saw hundreds of aid workers get killed,” added Low.

Since October 2023, more than 500 aid workers have been killed in the Palestinian enclave.

“Agreeing for a party to the conflict to vet our staff, especially under the conditions of occupation, is a violation of humanitarian principles, specifically neutrality and independence,” added Athena Rayburn, the executive director of AIDA, an umbrella organisation representing over 100 organisations that operate in the Palestinian territories.

Rayburn said offered alternatives to submitting staff lists, such as third-party vetting, but that Israel refused to engage in any dialogue and did not confirm that the data collected from the new regulations wouldn't be used for military or intelligence purposes.

The Israeli framework also includes ideological requirements, including disqualifying organisations that have called for boycotts against Israel, denied the October 7 attack or expressed support for any of the international court cases against Israeli soldiers or leaders.

The ban on major aid providers comes as Gaza’s war-torn population is living through harsh winter conditions and bracing for rains and flooding that peak in January and February.

“We are entering the third winter in a row that is really complicated for the population in Gaza. Most of the population is living inside tents, makeshift shelters and destroyed buildings,” Nicolet said, noting that some shelters were so unstable that they had been lost in strong winds.

At the same time, NGOs and the UN say that the amount of aid entering Gaza is already inadequate , with only 100 to 300 trucks allowed in per day.

The October 10 ceasefire agreement stipulated that 600 aid trucks should be allowed into the Palestinian territory every day.

But provision is “not at scale”, and humanitarian organisations are already “not able to respond to the needs” on the ground, said Nicolet.

While MSF continues to provide health services, “we are not able to do what we could do with better materials or better quantities … we are really not able to provide for the population,” she added.

“And maybe now we will do even less in the coming weeks and months.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:34:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4b015840-e65b-11f0-9cce-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25115623438822.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France aims to ban under-15s from social media from September 2026, Le Monde reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/france-aims-ban-under-15s-social-media-september-2026-le-monde-reports-2025-12-31/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - France plans to ban children under 15 from social media sites and to prohibit mobile phones in high schools from September 2026, local media reported on Wednesday, moves that underscore rising public angst over the impact of online harms on minors.

President Emmanuel Macron has often pointed to social media as one of the factors to blame for violence among young people and has signalled he wants France to follow Australia, whose world-first ban for under-16s on social media platforms including Facebook (META.O) , opens new tab , Snapchat, TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab came into force in December.

Le Monde newspaper said Macron could announce the measures in his New Year's Eve national address, due to be broadcast at 1900 GMT. His government will submit draft legislation for legal checks in early January, Le Monde and France Info reported.

The Elysee and the prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports.

Mobile phones have been banned in French primary and middle schools since 2018 and the reported new changes would extend that ban to high schools. Pupils aged 11 to 15 attend middle schools in the French educational system.

France also passed a law in 2023 requiring social platforms to obtain parental consent for under-15s to create accounts, though technical challenges have impeded its enforcement.

Macron said in June he would push for regulation at the level of the European Union to ban access to social media for all under-15s after a fatal stabbing at a school in eastern France shocked the nation.

The European Parliament in November urged the EU to set minimum ages for children to access social media to combat a rise in mental health problems among adolescents from excessive exposure, although it is member states which impose age limits.

Various other countries have also taken steps to regulate children's access to social media.

Macron heads into the New Year with his domestic legacy in tatters after his gamble on parliamentary elections in 2024 led to a hung parliament, triggering France's worst political crisis in decades that has seen a succession of weak governments.

However, cracking down further on minors' access to social media could prove popular, according to opinion polls. A Harris Interactive survey in 2024 showed 73% of those canvassed supporting a ban on social media access for under-15s.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LD7CYDK2YFNI5JAHSBKT3DGF2U.jpg?auth=e8e4f4cdea1fd9b8de3fef932a8e378cf83cdd8d109a53a7ee919920e43c02d5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland seizes ship sailing from Russia after suspected undersea cable sabotage</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20251231-finland-seizes-ship-sailing-from-russia-after-suspected-undersea-cable-sabotage</link><description>Finnish police seized on Wednesday a ship sailing from Russia suspected of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland , an area hit by a string of similar incidents in recent years.

The seized cargo vessel "Fitburg" was en route ​from the Russian port of St Petersburg to Israel at the time of the incident, Finland's Border Guard authority told a press conference ‍in Helsinki.

"At the moment we suspect aggravated disruption of telecommunications and also aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage," Helsinki Chief of Police Jari Liukku told reporters.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as ​an increase in hybrid threats from Russia since it launched its war in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

Earlier this month, NATO 's ​top military commander said the alliance must be ready to respond to these types of threats to defend its territory.

Hybrid threats refer to both military and non-military tactics designed to undermine an adversary's security. They can include cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, sabotage of key infrastructure and use of drones or irregular armed groups.

The Fitburg's 14 crew members were from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and were all held by Finnish police, investigators said. The ship sailed under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.

According to LSEG data, the owner of the vessel is Fitburg Shipping Company Ltd and the manager is Albros Shipping and Trading Ltd. Reuters was ‍not able to reach either of those companies via telephone.

Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, ​telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years.

"We remain in contact with the Finnish authorities, through exchange of information, via the NATO ‌shipping centre located at our Allied Maritime Command in Northwood, UK," an official at the military alliance said.

The Fitburg was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard said. The cable ‍belongs to Finnish telecoms group Elisa.

Estonia's justice ministry said a second telecoms cable connecting the country to Finland had also suffered an outage on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the cable, belonging to Sweden's Arelion, was running parallel to Elisa's.

An Arelion spokesperson confirmed that the company had suffered an outage.

"I'm concerned about the reported damage ... Hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify," Estonia's President Alar Karis said on X.

The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen wrote on X.

Finland in December 2024 boarded the Russian-linked oil tanker Eagle S which investigators said had damaged a ‍power cable and several telecoms links in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.

A Finnish court in October dismissed a criminal case against the Eagle S captain and other crew members, ‌ruling prosecutors failed to prove intent ​and that any alleged negligence must be pursued by the ship's flag state or the crew's home countries.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 16:51:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1e7a5fb0-e660-11f0-9e36-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-89CT2Q3.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia's Putin, in New Year address, voices confidence in victory in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russias-putin-new-year-address-voices-confidence-victory-ukraine-2025-12-31/</link><description>MOSCOW, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin used his annual televised New Year's address to rally his troops fighting in Ukraine, saying he believed in them and in victory in a war that he has framed as part of an existential struggle with the West.

U.S. President Donald Trump is trying to broker an end to the nearly four-year-old conflict, Europe's bloodiest conflagration since World War Two, with both sides' negotiating stances still far apart.

Dressed in a black coat, Putin - whose forces are advancing slowly but steadily in Ukraine - spoke about Russia's destiny and the unity of its people, which he said guaranteed the sovereignty and security of the "Fatherland".

He paid tribute in particular to his forces fighting in Ukraine, calling them heroes.

"Millions of people across Russia — I assure you — are with you on this New Year's Eve," said Putin.

"They are thinking of you, empathising with you, hoping for you. I wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy coming New Year! We believe in you and our Victory!"

His speech, which was first broadcast in Russia's far east, came as Russia released video footage of what it said was a downed drone, presenting it as evidence that Ukraine had tried this week to attack a presidential residence. Kyiv has dismissed Russia's allegation as a lie designed to derail peace talks.

In another video released on Wednesday, Russia's top general told troops to keep carving out buffer zones in Ukraine's Sumy and Kharkiv regions and said Moscow's forces had advanced faster in December than in any other month in 2025.

The Saudi-led military coalition that carried out the strike claimed the bombardment targeted “weapons and combat vehicles” unloaded from two ships arriving from the port of Fujairah in the United Arab Emirates . According to the coalition, these arms were intended “to support the Southern Transitional Council (STC) forces”, a separatist group that has been waging an offensive for several weeks against the forces of Yemen’s internationally recognised government.

Saudi Arabia backs the government, which also faces opposition from Houthi rebels , a Shia Islamist movement that controls Yemen’s capital, Sanaa . While officially backing the internationally recognised government, the UAE has faced accusations from both Saudi Arabia and the Yemeni government of supporting STC separatists.

According to the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), the bombardment of the Mukalla port resulted in no casualties, a claim that available footage can neither confirm nor deny.

Regarding physical damage, however, a video released by AFP shows one of the targeted areas within the port. The footage clearly depicts dozens of white and beige vehicles parked near an industrial terminal. While some have been burned and completely destroyed, others appear untouched. Firefighters can be seen working among the charred remains of the vehicles to extinguish the blaze.

The scene can be geolocated to the port of Mukalla. It is one of the primary coastal cities in Hadramaut, the region currently targeted by the STC separatist offensive.

The vehicles appearing in this video are also identifiable as troop carriers manufactured by the UAE-based Streit Group. Specifically, the Spartan and Cougar models from their vehicle lineup can be recognised.

In a statement , the United Arab Emirates denied that the vehicles were bound for STC separatists, asserting that “they were not intended for any Yemeni party, but were shipped for use by UAE forces operating in Yemen ”.

This would not be the first time Streit Group vehicles have been identified in the hands of STC fighters. Several journalists and analysts documented their presence on the ground during the group's recent offensive in Hadramaut.

While the Saudi-led coalition’s statement claimed that cargo from "two ships" was targeted, the footage provided by the coalition to the media only shows one vessel in detail.

The letters "SAMC" are visible on a vessel's hull. According to the caption, the ship is the Greenland, which reportedly departed from the port of Fujairah in the UAE.

Data from maritime traffic-tracking sites confirm that the vessel departed from the United Arab Emirates. The ship called at the ports of Jebel Ali in Dubai and Fujairah. Its last known position was recorded off the coast of Yemen on December 26. Since then, the vessel appears to have disabled its tracking system – a common practice for vessels engaged in illicit economic activities or navigating high-risk waters.

According to MarineTraffic, which utilises a wider range of data sources, the vessel arrived at the port of Mukalla on December 28. It reportedly departed on December 30 for the Emirati port of Fujairah, suggesting the ship was not destroyed in the attack.

The "SAMC" logo on the hull refers to the vessel's owner: the Emirati-based Salem Al-Makrani Cargo Company. The Greenland is listed as part of the fleet on the company’s official website .

A second vessel from the same company followed the same path as the Greenland: the Socotra 3. It also transited through the ports of Jebel Ali and Fujairah before arriving at Mukalla on December 26, a few days before the bombing. This may be the second ship from Fujairah that the coalition mentioned.

As evidenced by footage captured following the attack, it appears that not all vehicles delivered by the two Emirati vessels were destroyed. Video released by the coalition shows several of the vehicles travelling in convoys away from the port.

Additional footage released throughout the day on December 30 shows a convoy of Streit Group-manufactured vehicles. Their models and colours match those delivered by Emirati vessels, with the white Cougar variants being identifiable.

These images were captured in the town of Buwaysh, east of Mukalla, where a local bank branch is visible in the background. While the filming date remains unverified, we could not find any record of the video prior to December 30. This suggests that the delivery of these vehicles to Mukalla was, at least in part, successful.

Following the bombardment of the port of Mukalla, Yemen’s internationally recognised government has cancelled a defence pact with the UAE, ordering its forces to leave the country within 24 hours. This demand, backed by Saudi Arabia, has prompted the UAE to announce the withdrawal of its troops from Yemen.

Some 63 percent of French people did not intend to watch the annual New Year 's address, according to the latest Toluna/Harris Interactive poll for LCI news channel, while the president's approval rating is at its lowest since 2017 at 25 percent.

Macron will attempt to regain some momentum and launch the final projects of his second five-year term during his New Year's address.

Macron "will be keen to show that he will do everything to ensure that 2026 is a year of action, a year of purpose", those close to him said ahead of his speech.

The framework of his address is already in place, with the challenges posed by the war in Ukraine – which will enter its fifth year in February – to figure prominently.

Other topics that will be addressed include social media regulation, the return of a voluntary conscription service in France and legislation on end-of-life care.

Macron wants to ensure that 2026 will be characterised by action and progress on a number of fronts, his entourage said.

Without "falling into blind optimism", Macron will also seek to combat the trend of " French bashing " – denigrating France – which is so often pushed by the "self-proclaimed patriots" on the far right .</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 17:43:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/12b9f8da-e5f6-11f0-965b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/b0074072e43547de4ba9d58ce152e4051df35bfe.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US held talks with Ukraine, European countries on next steps in ending Ukraine war, Witkoff says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-held-talks-with-ukraine-european-countries-next-steps-ending-ukraine-war-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's advisers held talks on Wednesday with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany to discuss the next steps in ending Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff said.

"We focused on how to move the discussions forward in a practical way on behalf of @POTUS' peace process, including strengthening security guarantees and developing effective deconfliction mechanisms to help end the war and ensure it does not restart," Witkoff said in a social media post.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and Ukraine's top negotiator Rustem Umerov also participated.

Zelenskiy said on Tuesday that national security advisers from Kyiv's "Coalition of the Willing" backers would meet in Ukraine on Saturday, and then country leaders would gather in France on January 6.

The Coalition grouping led by Britain and France includes more than 30 nations, though it was not immediately clear which would be taking part in the meetings.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 18:31:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GKPFOWTLX5LJ3FVAODKEEGMQYE.jpg?auth=f315347f4e9a676528d58b9eb282a8b5d04fb77977eaffec4a8a37edfe62eb9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge blocks Trump move to end protected status for thousands from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-blocks-trump-move-end-protected-status-thousands-honduras-nepal-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Wednesday blocked the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua after opponents argued the terminations were motivated by racial hostility.

The administration's decisions to end Temporary Protected Status for some 89,000 migrants failed to adequately consider conditions in the three countries that would prevent them from returning, San Francisco-based District Judge Trina Thompson wrote.

Thompson cited statements by Republican President Donald Trump and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem portraying immigrants as criminals and a drain on U.S. society.

"These statements reflect a stereotyping of the immigrants protected under the TPS program as criminal invaders and perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population," wrote Thompson, an appointee of Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden.

TPS provides deportation relief and work permits to people already in the U.S. if their home countries experience a natural disaster, armed conflict or other extraordinary event. Under the program, Noem has the authority to grant, extend or terminate TPS designations for specific countries.

Trump has sought to end most TPS enrollment as part of a broader effort to restrict both legal and illegal immigration. In TPS termination notices, the administration has said that allowing the migrants to remain in the U.S. is contrary to the country's interests.

The Supreme Court in October allowed the Trump administration to proceed with ending TPS for some 300,000 Venezuelans, but lower courts have continued to rule against other terminations. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Boston blocked a move to end protections for hundreds of migrants from South Sudan.

In her ruling, Thompson found that the National TPS Alliance, a group representing the TPS enrollees, had plausibly alleged the terminations were motivated by racial animus.

The program covers some 72,000 Hondurans, 13,000 Nepalese and 4,000 Nicaraguans, according to U.S. Department of Homeland Security estimates.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:17:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PCQU2YOBCRMC7L5CQCSPNEMGRE.jpg?auth=99ca905ba7bf78f96a8aff1e3b3986bbe5af1837910ab40c664bef63636bfb02&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US targets crude oil tankers, firms in new Venezuela-related sanctions, Treasury website shows</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-targets-crude-oil-tankers-firms-new-venezuela-related-sanctions-treasury-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on four companies it said were operating in Venezuela’s oil sector as well as associated oil tankers, as President Donald Trump's administration increases pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.

The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said it imposed sanctions on oil traders engaged in sanctions evasion for Maduro's government. Among the targets were four vessels, some of which the Treasury accused of being part of the so-called "shadow fleet".

"Today’s action further signals that those involved in the Venezuelan oil trade continue to face significant sanctions risks," the Treasury said in the statement.

The sanctions mark the latest action in Trump's pressure campaign on Maduro, which has included a ramped-up military presence in the region and more than two dozen military strikes on vessels allegedly trafficking drugs in the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea near the South American nation.

This month, Trump announced a blockade of all sanctioned vessels going in or out of Venezuelan waters as part of a strategy to pressure Maduro. The U.S. move has cut oil exports this month to about half of their November level.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 19:37:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AJ54ICZPQFJCTDXBXK2WCMZRIY.jpg?auth=46b83184753bbcca3f47722594826764d364341a43b7a2651a3629bebd246afa&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Macron: allies will make commitments on protecting Ukraine at Jan 6 meeting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-allies-will-make-commitments-protecting-ukraine-jan-6-meeting-2025-12-31/</link><description>PARIS, Dec 31 (Reuters) - European leaders meeting in Paris on January 6 will make firm commitments towards protecting Ukraine after any peace deal with Russia is brokered, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday during his New Year Eve's speech.

Macron has convened a meeting of the so-called 'Coalition of the Willing' next Tuesday. The Coalition grouping led by Britain and France includes more than 30 nations.

"On January 6 in Paris, many European states and allies will make concrete commitments to protect Ukraine and ensure a just and lasting peace on our European continent," Macron said.

U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff earlier said that ways to strength security guarantees for Ukraine were discussed during Wednesday talks between U.S. officials, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and national security advisers from the UK, France and Germany.

In mid December, the leaders of several European countries including Germany, France and Britain, said there had been "strong convergence" with the U.S. after talks in Berlin and stated a list of goals for both sides to work towards.

These included commitments to supporting Ukraine's armed forces, a European-led peacekeeping force and guarantees to use force if Ukraine came under attack again.

Kyiv has come under intense pressure from the Trump administration to make concessions to Russia to enable a deal. Ukraine's European allies say any peace accord must ensure robust security guarantees backed by U.S. support.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 20:23:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WLJLF76EJVNJ3JAQXFGZYHG52M.jpg?auth=28e69e052636da73b8808b159bd856aca94ab02f420ef3b4a09028b98c57049e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One killed, several security forces wounded in Syria's Aleppo after suicide attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/explosion-heard-syrias-aleppo-ekhbariya-tv-reports-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - A suicide bomber targeted a police patrol in Aleppo in Syria, killing one person and wounding several members of the security forces, Syria's state news agency said on Wednesday.

On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov alleged that Ukraine had tried to attack Putin's residence in the northern Novgorod region with dozens of drones, adding that Moscow would review its negotiating position as a result.

U.S. national security officials have found Ukraine did not target Putin or one of his residences in a drone strike, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.

The paper reported the conclusion was supported by a CIA assessment that found no attempt to target Putin or one of his residences. A CIA spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment.

U.S. President Donald Trump initially expressed sympathy for the Russian charge, telling reporters on Monday that Putin had informed him of the alleged incident and that he was "very angry" about it.

By Wednesday, he appeared more skeptical, sharing on social media a New York Post editorial accusing Russia of blocking peace in Ukraine.

Ukraine has denied it carried out such an attack, describing the allegation as a Russian disinformation campaign meant to drive a wedge between Kyiv and Washington after a meeting between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that both sides described as cordial and productive.

In a detailed briefing paper that Ukraine distributed to European Union delegations on Tuesday and seen by Reuters, Kyiv alleged the Russian allegations were designed to "sabotage" agreements made during the South Florida meeting between Trump and Zelenskiy.

On Wednesday, Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, called Russia's claims "a deliberate distraction."

"No one should accept unfounded claims from the aggressor who has indiscriminately targeted Ukraine's infrastructure and civilians since the start of the war," she wrote on X.

As of Wednesday, there was no independent confirmation of the attack. But Russia's charges - and the European and Ukrainian reaction - underscored how both sides have sought to shape Trump's view of the war in Ukraine, now nearly four years old.

“There is no evidence” that Putin seeks peace and wants Ukraine to be successful, as Trump asserted last weekend after speaking to the Russian leader, said Kurt Volker, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO who served as special representative for Ukraine negotiations during Trump’s first term.

"All evidence is to the contrary,” he added.

The Russian and Ukrainian embassies in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The White House also did not immediately respond.

On Wednesday, Russia's defense ministry released video footage showing a senior officer, Major General Alexander Romanenkov, setting out details of how Moscow says it believes Ukraine attacked Putin's Novgorod residence.

The video included footage of a Russian serviceman standing next to fragments of a device that he said was a downed Ukrainian Chaklun-V drone carrying a 6-kg explosive device, which had not detonated.

Ukraine's foreign ministry dismissed the footage, saying it was "absolutely confident" no attack took place.

Before Lavrov made his accusation on Monday, Novgorod Governor Alexander Dronov said air defense and fighter jets were shooting down Ukrainian drones.

While Trump said on Monday the attack could have been a Russian false flag operation, he has at times appeared willing to accept controversial statements by Putin at face value.

Earlier this year, Trump repeated Putin’s assertions that Russian forces had encircled Ukrainian forces in Russia’s Kursk region, even as U.S. intelligence indicated that was not true.

The debate over the alleged Ukrainian attack also comes as some Western intelligence officials have quietly argued Russia has sought to delay additional punitive moves by Washington designed to force Moscow into a peace deal.

Reuters was unable to determine if the U.S. intelligence community has already made an assessment of the alleged attack or presented any relevant findings to Congress.

In the Ukrainian briefing paper seen by Reuters, Kyiv noted that in the hours after the alleged attack, various Russian officials made extremely similar comments in public that - in Ukraine's view - suggested pre-coordination among officials in Moscow.

The paper also noted that residents of a town near Putin's Novgorod residence told local media they heard no sounds of air defenses on the night of the alleged attack.

The Russian defense ministry published inconsistent accounts of the alleged Ukrainian drone attacks.

In a statement posted late on Sunday on its channel on the Telegram messaging platform, the ministry said 89 long-range Ukrainian attack drones were intercepted around the country between 7 a.m. the day before and 11 p.m. that evening.

They included 18 that were hit over the Novgorod region, it said, without alleging that any were involved in an attack on Putin’s residence there.

On Monday afternoon, the ministry issued a second statement that its air defenses had intercepted 91 drones, all of them bound for Putin’s residence, including 41 that were hit over Novgorod, between Saturday and Sunday.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:20:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NIDEVIWJZJJLTLIUNUX663GJOA.jpg?auth=283b3ae32e71d18ebb64467e7ad56a44ba0f6171242922cd75fa7198da1cedc5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says he won’t sign weak deal that will only prolong war</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-he-wont-sign-weak-deal-that-will-only-prolong-war-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, in his New Year address to the nation, said late on Wednesday that Ukraine wanted the war to end, but not at any cost, adding he would not sign a "weak" peace agreement that would only prolong the war.

"What does Ukraine want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to the war but not the end of Ukraine," Zelenskiy said in the address from his office, issued just before midnight. "Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken."

Zelenskiy said any signature "placed on weak agreements only fuel the war. My signature will be placed on a strong agreement.

The Trump administration has carried out more than 30 strikes against suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific since September in a campaign that has killed at least 110 people.

In a statement, the U.S. military's Southern Command said the military had carried out a strike against three vessels.

"Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels," Southern Command wrote on X.

A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said eight people had abandoned their vessels and were being searched for.

The Coast Guard told Reuters it had deployed a C-130 aircraft to look for survivors and was working with vessels in the area.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:21:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU warns Yemen developments risk Gulf stability</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-warns-yemen-developments-risk-gulf-stability-2025-12-31/</link><description>Dec 31 (Reuters) - The European Union said on Wednesday that recent developments in the Yemeni provinces of Hadramout and Al Mahra threaten to bring new risks to the Gulf region.

Trump said in a social media post on Wednesday that he was removing the Guard troops for the time being. “We will come back, perhaps in a much different and stronger form, when crime begins to soar again — only a question of time!” he wrote.

Troops had already left Los Angeles after the president deployed them earlier this year as part of a broader crackdown on crime and immigration. They had been sent to Chicago and Portland but were never on the streets as legal challenges played out.

The president has made a crackdown on crime in cities a centrepiece of his second term and has floated invoking the Insurrection Act to prevent opponents from using the courts to block his plans.

He has said he sees his tough-on-crime approach as a winning political issue ahead of next year’s midterm elections .

In November, US Northern Command said it was “shifting and/or rightsizing” operations in Portland, Chicago and Los Angeles, but that there would be a “constant, enduring and long-term presence in each city”.

Trump’s push to deploy troops in Democrat -led cities has been met with legal challenges at nearly every turn.

The Supreme Court in December refused to allow the Trump administration to deploy National Guard troops in the Chicago area as part of its crackdown on immigration. The order was not a final ruling, but it marked a significant and rare setback from the high court for the president’s efforts.

In the nation’s capital, District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued to halt the deployment of more than 2,000 guardsmen.

Hundreds of troops from California and Oregon were deployed to Portland, but a federal judge barred them from going on the streets. A judge permanently blocked the deployment of National Guard troops there in November after a three-day trial.

California National Guard troops were removed from the streets of Los Angeles by December 15 after a court ruling. An appeals court had paused a separate part of the order that required control of the Guard to return to Governor Gavin Newsom .

In a court filing on Tuesday, the Trump administration said it was no longer seeking a pause in that part of the order, paving the way for the California National Guard to fully return to state control after Trump federalised the force in June.

California Attorney General Rob Bonta called the development a “major litigation victory” in a press release on Wednesday.

“For six months, California National Guard troops have been used as political pawns by a president desperate to be king,” Bonta said. “There is a reason our founders decided military and civilian affairs must be kept separate; a reason that our military is, by design, apolitical.”

Trump also ordered the deployment of the Tennessee National Guard to Memphis in September to combat crime, a move supported by the state’s Republican Governor Bill Lee and senators. A Tennessee judge blocked the use of the Guard, siding with Democratic state and local officials who sued.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 22:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/684d59d2-e0f5-11f0-9372-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-23T210932Z-1726505758-RC2D8HA495UL-RTRMADP-3-USA-COURT-TRUMP-ILLINOIS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim Jong Un attends New Year's celebrations, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-jong-un-attends-new-years-celebrations-kcna-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attended New Year's celebrations in Pyongyang including fireworks, patriotic songs and dances and a taekwondo demonstration, state media KCNA said on Thursday.

In a speech, Kim lauded the North Korean people's efforts which led to "successes and phenomenal changes" in 2025, and called for their unity as a key party congress expected to be held in early 2026 will lay out the future direction for the country.

North Korea is expected to hold the 9th Congress of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea soon, which will lay out the country's plans for the next five years in various fields such as nuclear and weapons development, as well as the economy.

Kim also sent a New Year's message to North Korean troops fighting on Russia's side in the war in Ukraine, calling them the "greatest strength and pride and a strong pillar" of the country and saying he looks forward to their reunion back home.

"Be brave. Behind you are Pyongyang and Moscow," Kim said in the message, according to KCNA.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:20:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/X6UQPVRDUZPRLNHB2ZMT32RGF4.jpg?auth=0c0f0b4ddc0bf522471b6fd32b61801b249cb68c8eb6678f409885f4e8a8c98a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pentagon says Lockheed Martin gets $328.5 million Taiwan military sale contract</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/pentagon-says-lockheed-martin-gets-3285-million-taiwan-military-sale-contract-2025-12-31/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Wednesday that Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab was given a contract involving foreign military sales to Taiwan to meet what Washington calls "an urgent operational need" of the Taiwan Air Force.

The contract has a ceiling value of $328.5 million, with $157.3 million in foreign military sales funds obligated at the time of award, the Pentagon said in a statement , opens new tab .

Washington has formal diplomatic ties with China , but maintains unofficial ties with Taiwan and is the island's most important arms supplier . The U.S. is bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself, though such arms sales are a persistent source of friction with China.

Taiwan remained on high alert on Wednesday after China staged massive military drills around the island the previous day, keeping its emergency maritime response centre running as it monitored Chinese naval maneuvers, the coast guard said.

"This contract provides for the procurement and delivery of fifty-five Infrared Search and Track Legion Enhanced Sensor pods, processors, pod containers, and processor containers required to meet the urgent operational need of the Taiwan Air Force," the Pentagon said.

It added that the contract's work will be performed in Orlando, Florida, and is expected to be completed by June 2031.

In mid-December, the administration of President Donald Trump announced $11.1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, the largest ever U.S. weapons package for the island which is under increasing military pressure from China.

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, and it has not ruled out using force to take it under Chinese control. Taiwan, which rejects China's claims, condemned the latest drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:20:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/B5GS2RJH3JLONEW5ZFI4CHONVU.jpg?auth=223593a14afc23271413a041dd22d190379cb24bac6af393d712a2df3f0c64d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says three killed in strikes on alleged drug boats</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20251231-us-military-says-three-killed-in-strikes-on-alleged-drug-boats</link><description>The US military announced on Wednesday that three people were killed in strikes on three alleged drug boats in international waters, bringing the death toll in Washington’s campaign against what it says are narcotics traffickers to at least 110.

US Southern Command, which is responsible for American forces operating in Central and South America, said the strikes targeted “three narco-trafficking vessels travelling as a convoy”. All three people killed were on one boat.

The exact location of the strikes was not immediately made clear. Previous strikes have taken place in the Caribbean or the eastern Pacific.

The military said that the targeted vessels were operated by “designated terrorist organisations” that it did not identify.

Accompanying the statement, posted on X, was a video showing three boats travelling together at sea and then hit by a series of explosions.

“Three narco-terrorists aboard the first vessel were killed in the first engagement. The remaining narco-terrorists abandoned the other two vessels, jumping overboard and distancing themselves before follow-on engagements sank their respective vessels,” it said.

The military said it had notified the Coast Guard to “activate the search and rescue system”, without offering more details about the fate of those aboard the other boats.

Since September, the US military has carried out more than 30 such strikes on what it says are boats used to smuggle drugs to the United States, without providing any concrete evidence that the targeted boats are involved in trafficking.

International law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States.

In recent months, US President Donald Trump has waged a pressure campaign against Venezuela ’s leftist President Nicolas Maduro , accusing him of running a drug cartel.

Maduro denies the allegation and has accused Washington of seeking regime change to gain access to the Latin American country’s massive oil reserves.</description><pubDate>Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:42:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/800dbe28-c20e-11f0-9bdd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-74UP2KE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan vows to defend sovereignty after China's military drill</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-vows-defend-sovereignty-after-chinas-military-drill-2026-01-01/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday the island is determined to defend its sovereignty and boost defence in the face of China's rising ambition for expansion, after Beijing fired rockets towards the island in a military drill.

Palestinian refugee agency, a U.N. spokesperson said.

The spokesperson said the move would "further impede" the agency's ability to operate and carry out activities.

"The Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations remains applicable to UNRWA ( United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ), its property and assets, and to its officials and other personnel. Property used by UNRWA is inviolable," Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for the secretary-general, said while adding that UNRWA is an "integral" part of the world body.

UNRWA Commissioner General Phillipe Lazzarini also condemned the move, saying that it was part of an ongoing " systematic campaign to discredit  UNRWA and thereby obstruct" the role it plays in providing assistance to Palestinian refugees.

In 2024, the Israeli parliament passed a law banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with the agency.

As a result, UNRWA operates in East Jerusalem, which the U.N. considers territory occupied by Israel. Israel considers all Jerusalem to be part of the country.

The agency provides education, health and aid to millions of Palestinians in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. It has long had tense relations with Israel but ties have deteriorated sharply since the start of the war in Gaza and Israel has called repeatedly for UNRWA to be disbanded, with its responsibilities transferred to other U.N. agencies.

The prohibition of basic utilities to the U.N. agency came as Israel also suspended of dozens of international non-governmental organizations working in Gaza due to a failure to meet new rules to vet those groups.

In a joint statement, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom said on Tuesday such a move would have a severe impact on the access of essential services, including healthcare. They said one in three healthcare facilities in Gaza would close if international NGO operations stopped.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 01:55:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CGHA6UP6LVNR5BHSCXNXV45BR4.jpg?auth=cd29fc083ea6cf5343277ed24d44c51f9ff06d68713b8d2e62ede9fafe00ad2c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan vows to defend sovereignty amid Chinese military drills</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260101-taiwan-vows-to-defend-sovereignty-amid-chinese-military-drills</link><description>Taiwan President Lai Ching-te said on Thursday that the island is determined to defend its sovereignty and bolster its defence in the face of China’s growing assertiveness, after Beijing fired rockets towards Taiwan during military drills .

“The international community is watching to see whether the Taiwanese people possess the resolve to defend themselves,” Lai said in a New Year’s speech broadcast live from the presidential office in Taipei.

He urged opposition parties to support his proposal to increase Taiwan’s defence spending by $40 billion, a plan currently stalled amid a political deadlock in the opposition-controlled parliament.

“Whether China can achieve its goals on schedule is one thing,” Lai said when asked about a US report suggesting China could have the capability to win a conflict over Taiwan by 2027.

“The coming year, 2026, will be a crucial one for Taiwan,” he added, saying the island must “make plans for the worst, but hope for the best.”

“We are willing to engage in exchanges and cooperation with China on an equal and dignified basis, promoting a peaceful and shared environment across the strait,” Lai said. “As long as China acknowledges the existence of the Republic of China and respects the Taiwanese people’s desire for a democratic and free way of life.”

China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and has not ruled out the use of force to bring it under Chinese control. Taiwan rejects these claims.

Lai’s speech came just two days after Chinese exercises named “Justice Mission 2025”. China fired dozens of rockets towards Taiwan and deployed a large number of warships and aircraft near the island, a show of force that drew concern from Western allies including the European Commission and the United Kingdom.

Taipei condemned the drills as a threat to regional security and a blatant provocation. Beijing announced late on Wednesday that it had completed the exercises, stating its military would continue to strengthen combat readiness.

China’s President Xi Jinping struck a familiar tone on Taiwan in his New Year’s address on Wednesday, repeating last year’s warning to what Beijing considers separatist forces that China’s “reunification” with Taiwan cannot be stopped.

The drills, China’s largest by area and the closest yet to Taiwan, forced the island to cancel dozens of domestic commercial flights and dispatch military jets and warships to monitor the exercises.

The Chinese manoeuvres began 11 days after the United States announced a record $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan. China’s military said for the first time that the drills were aimed at deterring outside intervention.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 03:52:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4a647a80-e510-11f0-b7a1-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25336133707524.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland seizes ship sailing from Russia after suspected cable sabotage in Baltic Sea</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/finland-suspects-ship-causing-undersea-cable-damage-president-says-2025-12-31/</link><description>HELSINKI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Finnish police on Wednesday seized a ship sailing from Russia on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable running from Helsinki to Estonia across the Gulf of Finland, an area hit by a string of similar incidents in recent years.

The seized cargo vessel "Fitburg" was en route from the Russian port of St Petersburg to Israel at the time of the incident, Finland's Border Guard authority told a press conference in Helsinki.

"At the moment we suspect aggravated disruption of telecommunications and also aggravated sabotage and attempted aggravated sabotage," Helsinki Chief of Police Jari Liukku told reporters.

Concern is growing in Europe at what officials see as an increase in hybrid threats from Russia since it launched its war in Ukraine, which Moscow denies.

Earlier this month, NATO's top military commander said the alliance must be ready to respond to these type of threats to defend its territory.

Hybrid threats refer to both military and non-military tactics designed to undermine an adversary's security. They can include cyberattacks, disinformation campaigns, sabotage of key infrastructure and use of drones or irregular armed groups.

The Fitburg's 14 crew members were from Russia, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan, and were all held by Finnish police, investigators said. The ship sailed under the flag of St Vincent and Grenadines.

According to LSEG data, the owner of the vessel is Fitburg Shipping Company Ltd and the manager is Albros Shipping and Trading Ltd. Reuters was not able to reach either of those companies via telephone.

Eight NATO states border the Baltic Sea, which also borders Russia. They have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecoms links and gas pipelines that run along the relatively shallow seabed since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

NATO has boosted its presence in the Baltic with frigates, aircraft and naval drones in recent years.

"We remain in contact with the Finnish authorities, through exchange of information, via the NATO shipping centre located at our Allied Maritime Command in Northwood, UK," an official at the military alliance said.

The Fitburg was dragging its anchor in the sea, and was directed to Finnish territorial waters, the police and Finland's Border Guard said. The cable belongs to Finnish telecoms group Elisa.

Estonia's justice ministry said a second telecoms cable connecting the country to Finland had also suffered an outage on Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if the cable, belonging to Sweden's Arelion, was running parallel to Elisa's.

An Arelion spokesperson confirmed that the company had suffered an outage.

"I'm concerned about the reported damage... Hopefully it was not a deliberate act, but the investigation will clarify," Estonia's President Alar Karis said on X.

The European Commission was closely monitoring the incident, EU technology commissioner Henna Virkkunen wrote on X.

Finland in December 2024 boarded the Russian-linked oil tanker Eagle S which investigators said had damaged a power cable and several telecoms links in the Baltic Sea by dragging its anchor.

A Finnish court in October dismissed a criminal case against the Eagle S captain and other crew members, ruling prosecutors failed to prove intent and that any alleged negligence must be pursued by the ship's flag state or the crew's home countries.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 05:51:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Z3F6EU7ZYROO5LXWRMIMRGVTHQ.jpg?auth=574d16f439f8dc019ef7217a81e10fb3809e39c926c6a361be0da9bf916e8165&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Several killed after explosion in Swiss ski resort bar, BBC reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/several-killed-after-explosion-swiss-ski-resort-bar-bbc-reports-2026-01-01/</link><description>Jan 1 (Reuters) - Several people were killed and others injured after an explosion in a bar in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, BBC reported on Thursday, citing police.

Pyongyang has sent thousands of troops to support Russia's nearly four-year invasion of Ukraine, according to South Korean and Western intelligence agencies.

At least 600 have died and thousands more have sustained injuries, according to South Korean estimates that could not be independently confirmed.

On Thursday Kim praised his men fighting in an "alien land", congratulating their "heroic" defence of the nation's honour and instructing them to "be brave", the state-run Korean Central News Agency said.

"As the whole country is enveloped in a festive atmosphere of greeting the new year, I all the more miss you, who are fighting bravely on the battlefields in the alien land even at this moment," he said.

Kim hinted that more overseas action could take place this year, highlighting "remarkable feats you will perform on the overseas battlefields".

Russian air defence units downed five Ukrainian drones headed ​for Moscow ‍on New Year's Eve, Mayor Sergei ​Sobyanin said.

Sobyanin, in a ​series of posts on Telegram over a little more than three hours into early on Thursday morning, said specialist ‍crews were examining fragments from ​the drones at the sites where they had hit the ‌ground.

Sobyanin made no mention of ‍casualties or damage.

Restrictions were placed on Moscow's Domodedovo airport for a time. Other airports in southern and ‍central Russia were also subject to ‌temporary ​restrictions.

Speaking in his New Year address to the nation, President Volodymyr Zelensky said that Ukraine ⁠wanted the war to end, but not at any cost. He added that he would not sign a "weak" peace agreement that would only prolong the war.

Zelensky said Ukrainians were exhausted from nearly four years of war.

"What does Ukraine ​want? Peace? Yes. At any cost? No. We want an end to ​the war but not the end of Ukraine," Zelensky, wearing a dark green embroidered Ukrainian shirt, said in the 21-minute address issued just before midnight.

"Are we tired? Very. Does this mean we are ready to surrender? Anyone who thinks so is deeply mistaken."

Zelensky said any signature "placed on weak agreements only fuel the war".

"My signature will be placed on a strong agreement. And that is exactly what every meeting, every phone call, ‍every decision is about now," he said. "To secure a strong peace for everyone, not for a day, a week or two months, ​but peace for years."

Zelensky said weeks of US-led diplomacy, including his talks last weekend with US President Donald Trump in Florida, had produced a peace deal that was nearly ready.

"A ‌peace agreement is 90 percent ready, 10 percent remains," he said. "That 10 percent contains everything, it is the 10 percent that will determine the fate of peace, the ‍fate of Ukraine and Europe and how people will live."

Mamdani, a Democrat , was sworn in as the first Muslim leader of America’s biggest city, placing his hand on a Quran as he took his oath.

“This is truly the honour and the privilege of a lifetime,” Mamdani said in a brief speech.

The ceremony, administered by New York Attorney General Letitia James, a political ally, took place at the old City Hall station, one of the city’s original subway stops, known for its stunning arched ceilings.

In his first speech as mayor, Mamdani said the old subway station was a “testament to the importance of public transport to the vitality, the health and the legacy of our city”, as he announced the appointment of his new Department of Transportation commissioner, Mike Flynn.

The new mayor then closed with a smile. “Thank you all so much, now I will see you later,” he said, before heading up a flight of stairs.

Mamdani will be sworn in again, in grander style, at a public ceremony at City Hall at 1 p.m., to be administered by US Senator Bernie Sanders , one of the mayor’s political heroes. That will be followed by what the new administration is billing as a public block party on a stretch of Broadway known as the “Canyon of Heroes”, famous for its ticker-tape parades.

Mamdani now begins one of the most unrelenting jobs in American politics as one of the country’s most closely watched politicians.

In addition to being the city’s first Muslim mayor, Mamdani is also its first leader of South Asian descent and the first to be born in Africa. At 34, he is also the youngest mayor New York City has had in generations.

In a campaign that helped make “affordability” a buzzword across the political spectrum, the democratic socialist promised transformative change, with policies intended to lower the cost of living in one of the world’s most expensive cities. His platform included free childcare, free buses, a rent freeze for about one million households, and a pilot programme of city-run grocery stores.

But he will also have to contend with the less glamorous responsibilities of City Hall: dealing with rubbish, snow and rats, while being blamed for subway delays and potholes.

Mamdani was born in Kampala, Uganda, the son of filmmaker Mira Nair and academic and author Mahmood Mamdani. His family moved to New York City when he was seven, and he grew up in a post-9/11 city where Muslims did not always feel welcome. He became an American citizen in 2018.

He worked on political campaigns for Democratic candidates in the city before seeking public office himself, winning a state Assembly seat in 2020 to represent part of Queens.

Mamdani and his wife, Rama Duwaji, will leave their one-bedroom, rent-stabilised apartment in the outer boroughs to take up residence in the stately mayoral home in Manhattan.

He inherits a city on the upswing after years of slow recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Violent crime has fallen back to pre-pandemic lows, tourists have returned, and unemployment, which surged during the pandemic years, has also dropped to pre-COVID levels.

Yet deep concerns remain about high prices and rising rents.

Mamdani will also have to deal with Republican President Donald Trump .

During the mayoral race, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from the city if Mamdani won and mused about sending National Guard troops to New York.

But Trump later surprised supporters and critics alike by inviting the Democrat to the White House for what turned out to be a cordial meeting in November.

“I want him to do a great job and will help him do a great job,” Trump said.

Still, tensions between the two leaders are almost certain to resurface, given their deep policy disagreements, particularly over immigration.

Mamdani also faces scepticism and opposition from some members of the city’s Jewish community over his criticisms of Israel’s government.

Since his election victory, the new mayor and his team have spent weeks preparing for the transition, surrounding Mamdani with seasoned figures who have worked inside or alongside city government.

That included persuading the city’s police commissioner, Jessica Tisch, to remain in her post — a move that helped calm fears in the business community that the new administration might pursue radical changes to policing strategy.</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2026 06:38:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b4ec0958-bc8a-11f0-bb0d-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25309163715647.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Swiss police say several people have died in fire at bar in ski resort</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/swiss-police-say-several-people-have-died-fire-bar-ski-resort-2026-01-01/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Swiss police said on Thursday that several people had died and others were injured due to a fire of unknown causes at a bar called "Le Constellation" in the ski resort of Crans-Montana in southwestern Switzerland.
