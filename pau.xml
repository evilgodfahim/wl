Hurley, 60, is one of seven claimants, including Prince Harry and singer Elton John, suing the Mail's publisher Associated Newspapers for alleged privacy violations dating from the early 1990s to the 2010s.

Associated, which also publishes the Mail on Sunday, has called the allegations against it "preposterous smears".

Hurley, the claimants' second witness, is suing over 15 stories which she says featured information obtained unlawfully, including medical details about her pregnancy with son Damian and arguments with his late father, Steve Bing.

While she gave forceful responses to some questions, at times she clutched a tissue to her face and wiped away tears during cross-examination from Associated lawyer Antony White.

Watching on in court was Harry, who appeared in the witness box himself on Wednesday and was sitting next to her son Damian, supportively patting his back when she became emotional.

Hurley rejected suggestions that her friends, including Elton John's husband David Furnish, had passed on information to the press.

She said her phones had been bugged and microphones attached to windows in her house "listening to all my conversations".

"It was deeply hurtful," she said. In her written witness statement, she said her discovery in 2020 about this "brutal invasion of privacy" had left her crushed.

Much of White's questioning centred on whether Hurley could have known about her claims against the Mail sooner, with the publisher arguing that the lawsuits had been filed too late.

She said she first learned about phone hacking from her ex-boyfriend, the actor Hugh Grant, in 2015 when he told her that she could launch a claim against another newspaper group, Mirror Group Newspapers.

She told the court she gave all the damages she won from MGN, 350,000 pounds ($469,770), to 'Hacked Off', a press reform campaign group Grant supports, but said she never really had any "grown-up conversations" with him about the issue.

"Sometimes he tried to tell me but I'm afraid I didn't really listen," she said. "We are just silly together ... maybe I'm not a very good friend."

The investigation was launched after the Spanish government disclosed in 2022 that NSO's spyware had been used to spy on members of the Spanish cabinet, sparking a political crisis that led to the resignation of the country's spy chief.

Officials did not clarify whether domestic or foreign entities were linked to the espionage, whose targets included Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and several ministers.

Investigating judge Jose Luis Calama said he was unable to advance the probe into the alleged spying on politicians because a lack of response to requests for information from Israel meant there was no identifiable suspect.

NSO has always denied wrongdoing, saying the software, which it licences to governments after Israeli government approval, is intended to fight crime and protect national security and that it cannot monitor how it is used. Israel says its role is limited to export licences rather than day-to-day operations. The Israeli government and NSO did not immediately reply to requests for comment.

Calama had previously closed the investigation in 2023, also citing a lack of cooperation from Israeli authorities. He reopened it in 2024 following details provided by France regarding its own probe into Pegasus' use in 2021 to target reporters, lawyers, public figures, and French government and political officials.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2VOCC74WJRPQXCYHH4RO3F5QPQ.jpg?auth=434b9e99d99d5487a4ac9dc26441677c86ecf5b87e07c36549f2947619c1b1c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Mozambique counts 13 dead in floods so far but toll expected to rise</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/mozambique-counts-13-dead-floods-so-far-toll-expected-rise-2026-01-22/</link><description>MAPUTO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Mozambique authorities on Thursday reported 13 deaths from severe floods over the past two weeks, though the figure is expected to rise sharply, with aid workers saying they expect more bodies to be found as waters recede.

The country has been hit with heavy rains that caused rivers and dams to overflow, submerging towns and affecting more than half a million people . Parts of neighbouring South Africa were also flooded .

Rain had subsided in some areas by Thursday. Some buildings in the capital Maputo were submerged to their rooftops, and the city was cut off from the rest of the country due to flooding on a major national highway, making areas inaccessible.

"I won't give up," shopkeeper Justino Zita said, wading through the brown water that had flooded his shop and destroyed his livelihood in Maputo. "We won't give up but we will have difficulty."

Mary Louise Eagleton, representative of the United Nations children's agency (UNICEF) in Mozambique, said she expected the toll of dead and wounded to rise.

"We expect that a large proportion of those who have been swept away or killed by the floods are children," she told Reuters.

Officials describe the flooding as the worst since at least 2000, when around 700 people were killed in Mozambique.

Early-warning systems and mandatory evacuations could mean fewer people may have been killed this time, said Paulo Tomas, spokesperson for the National Institute for Disaster Risk Management.

"Many people complied by voluntarily leaving the most affected areas," he said. But he said the lower death toll counted so far may also be partly a result of "limited access to some areas and the fact that several zones remain submerged".</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZCUEXB4KHNP3PANIFKPDN3PHNA.jpg?auth=2c003796414fdd8464be8cdabc2332a99c626e0847cee0b54fc09e706a5ee5a3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French navy intercepts sanctioned Russian tanker in Mediterranean, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/french-navy-intercepts-sanctioned-russian-tanker-mediterranean-macron-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The French navy intercepted a sanctioned Russian tanker in the Mediterranean on Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron said on X.

"This operation was carried out ... with the support of several of our allies. It was conducted in full compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea," he said.

The vessel was subject to international sanctions and suspected of operating under a false flag, he said.

"The activities of the shadow fleet contribute to financing (Russia's) war of aggression against Ukraine," Macron added on X.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D6S3JCRHAZKO3B65DNCSXPC77A.jpg?auth=96623408f157a6dc7a4a5a25d970e15e3bd71dbdab36eebd1c1adbd6cc80e199&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Colombia halts electricity sales to Ecuador and imposes tariffs in trade, drug trafficking spat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/colombia-suspends-electricity-sales-imposes-30-tariff-ecuador-escalating-trade-2026-01-22/</link><description>BOGOTA/QUITO, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Colombia will suspend electricity sales to Ecuador and impose a 30% tariff on 20 products from its neighbor, it said on Thursday, in an escalating dispute over trade and the fight against drug trafficking.

The move came a day after Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa said his government would impose a 30% "security charge" on goods from Colombia, starting on February 1, citing a trade deficit and a lack of cooperation on fighting drug trafficking.

Colombia, which has repeatedly denied accusations it is not doing enough to tackle drug smuggling, is an important exporter of power to its South American neighbor. Noboa's government later said the measure included exceptions for the sale of electricity and oil logistics services.

In response to Bogota's tariff announcement on Thursday, Ecuador's energy minister said Colombian crude being transported on the OCP pipeline - Ecuador's second-largest - would have "the reciprocity given in the case of electricity". She gave no further details on what that would mean in practice.

Ecuador's trade deficit with Colombia totaled $838 million in the first 10 months of last year, according to Ecuador's central bank.

Colombia shipped $1.67 billion worth of goods to its neighbor in the first 11 months of last year, according to statistics agency DANE, representing 3.6% of total exports.

"The collaboration with the armed forces of Ecuador is tight," Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote on X Wednesday, adding that Colombia had seized 200 metric tons of cocaine on the two countries' shared border.

"I hope Ecuador has been grateful, when they have needed us, that we have acted energetically in solidarity."

His government was willing to expand joint efforts with Ecuador to fight fentanyl trafficking, he said.

Posting on X overnight, Colombia's commerce and industry ministry said the 30% tariff was "proportional, transitory and revisable" and is meant to restore balance in trade relations following Ecuador's "security charge" decision. It added that Colombia remained open to dialogue.

In its announcement, it did not say what products were covered under the tariff. Colombia's leading imports from Ecuador are fish, vegetable oil and auto parts.

Colombia's energy ministry later said it had issued a resolution suspending "international transactions of electricity with Ecuador".

It did not link the decision to Ecuador's trade measures, instead calling it "a preventative measure to guarantee internal supply in the face of climate variability."

"When adequate technical, energy and commercial conditions exist, exports will be reactivated," the ministry added.

Colombia Energy Minister Edwin Palma had previously criticized Ecuador's actions and on Wednesday cancelled a recent initiative to allow private firms to take part in energy sales between the countries.

Noboa, a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has made the fight against criminal gangs a cornerstone of his administration, aligning Ecuador with one of the White House's main policy priorities in South America.

He has declared several states of emergency and recently mobilized over 10,000 soldiers to tackle organized crime. The government has said turf wars between splintered gangs caused murder rates to soar 30% last year.

Trump has, meanwhile, pressured Colombia, as well as Mexico, over drug trafficking, both before and after U.S. forces captured Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, whom the White House called a "narco-dictator", earlier this month.

Accused of failing to stop the flow of cocaine to the U.S., which he denied, Colombia's Petro was sanctioned by the U.S. last year. But tensions eased in January, following a cordial phone call between Petro and Trump.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QAFQH3B3C5PNHFBSEKGICWGTVA.jpg?auth=9467d85a85d5141ce5acf0d0e791cc6cfec81adbd495e0c851c9e0df5b626a37&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'We will let nothing pass': France intercepts Russia-linked oil tanker in Mediterranean</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260122-we-will-let-nothing-pass-france-intercepts-russia-linked-oil-tanker-in-mediterranean</link><description>France 's navy, with the help of allies, on Thursday boarded a tanker alleged to be from Russia 's sanction-busting "shadow fleet" in the Mediterranean, President Emmanuel Macron said.

"This morning, the French Navy boarded and searched an oil tanker from Russia, subject to international sanctions and suspected of flying a false flag," he said on X.

"The operation was carried out on the high seas in the Mediterranean, with the support of several of our allies," he added, saying the vessel had been "diverted".

"We will let nothing pass," said Macron.

"The activities of the shadow fleet help finance the war of aggression against Ukraine ," he added.

Local maritime authorities said the navy seized an oil tanker called "Grinch" between Spain and Morocco .

"After the team boarded, an examination of documents confirmed the doubts as to the regularity of the flag," the Mediterranean Maritime Prefecture said.

The ship "is currently being escorted by the national navy to a point of anchorage for further verifications", it added.

“We are determined to uphold international law and to ensure the effective enforcement of sanctions," Macron said in a post about the interception, with a photo showing a French helicopter hovering over a ship.

Western countries have slapped sanctions on a number of oil tankers accused of transporting Russian oil in defiance of sanctions imposed by the US, EU and UK following Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/255104b0-f7a4-11f0-b33c-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/G-ReuMSXcAAKVfj.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Key US allies keep their distance as Trump launches 'Board of Peace' initiative for Gaza</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260122-donald-trump-launches-board-of-peace-initiative-for-gaza-as-key-us-allies-stay-away</link><description>US President Donald Trump on Thursday inaugurated his Board of Peace to lead efforts at maintaining a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas , insisting that “everyone wants to be a part” of the body that could eventually rival the United Nations – despite many US allies opting not to participate.

In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump sought to create momentum for a project to map out a future of the war-torn Gaza Strip that has been overshadowed this week, first by his threats to seize Greenland , then by a dramatic retreat from that push.

“This isn’t the United States, this is for the world,” he said, adding, “I think we can spread it out to other things as we succeed in Gaza.”

The event featured Ali Shaath, the head of a future "technocratic" government in Gaza, announcing that the Rafah border crossing will open in both directions next week. That's after Israel said in early December it would open the crossing, which runs between Gaza and Egypt , but has yet to do so.

Shaath, an engineer and former Palestinian Authority official from Gaza, is overseeing the Palestinian committee set to govern the territory under US supervision.

The new peace board was initially envisioned as a small group of world leaders overseeing the ceasefire, but it has morphed into something far more ambitious – and scepticism about its membership and mandate has led some countries usually closest to Washington to take a pass.

Trump tried not to let those not participating ruin his unveiling party, saying 59 countries had signed onto the board – even though heads of state, top diplomats and other officials from only 19 countries plus the US actually attended. He told the group, ranging from Azerbaijan to Paraguay to Hungary , “You’re the most powerful people in the world."

Trump has spoken about the board replacing some UN functions and perhaps even making that entire body obsolete one day. But he was more conciliatory in his remarks on the sidelines of the forum in the Swiss alps.

“We’ll do it in conjunction with the United Nations,” Trump said, even as he denigrated the UN for doing what he said wasn't enough to calm some conflicts around the globe.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that some countries’ leaders have indicated they plan to join but still require approval from their parliaments, and the Trump administration says it has also gotten queries about membership from countries that hadn’t been invited to participate yet.

Big questions remain, however, about what the eventual board will look like.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said his country is still consulting with Moscow’s “strategic partners” before deciding to commit. The Russian president on Thursday is due to host Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas for talks in Moscow .

Others are asking why Putin and other authoritarian leaders had even been invited to join. Britain’s foreign secretary, Yvette Cooper, said her country wasn't signing on “because this is about a legal treaty that raises much broader issues”.

“And we do also have concerns about President Putin being part of something which is talking about peace, when we have still not seen any signs from Putin that there will be a commitment to peace in Ukraine ,” she told the BBC.

Norway and Sweden have indicated they won’t participate, after France also said no. French officials stressed that while they support the Gaza peace plan, they were concerned the board could seek to replace the UN as the main venue for resolving conflicts.

Canada, Ukraine, China and the executive arm of the European Union also haven't committed. Trump calling off the steep tariffs he threatened over Greenland could ease some allies' reluctance, but the issue is still far from settled.

The Kremlin said Thursday that Putin plans to discuss his proposal to send $1 billion to the Board of Peace and use it for humanitarian purposes during his talks with Abbas. But it noted that the use of those assets will require the US action to unblock them.

The idea for the Board of Peace was first laid out in Trump's 20-point Gaza ceasefire plan and even was endorsed by the UN Security Council .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he’s agreed to join, after his office has earlier criticised the makeup of the board’s committee tasked with overseeing Gaza.

Months into the ceasefire, Gaza’s more than 2 million Palestinians continue to suffer the humanitarian crisis unleashed by more than two years of war. And violence in Gaza, while not at the same level as before the October ceasefire and hostage deal was agreed on, continues.

Key to the truce continuing to hold is the disarming of Hamas, something that the militant group that has controlled the Palestinian territory since 2007 has refused to do and that Israel sees as non-negotiable. Trump on Thursday repeated his frequently mentioned warnings that the group will have to do so or face dire consequences.

He also said the war in Gaza “is really coming to an end” while conceding, “We have little fires that we'll put out. But they're little,” and they had been “giant, giant, massive fires.”

Trump's push for peace also comes after he threatened military action this month against Iran as it carried out a violent crackdown against some of the largest street protests in years, killing thousands of people.

Trump, for the time being, has signalled he won't carry out any new strikes on Iran after he said he received assurances that the Islamic government would not carry out the planned hangings of more than 800 protesters.

But Trump also made the case that his tough approach to Tehran – including strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities in June last year – was critical to the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal coalescing.

Iran was Hamas's most important patron, providing the group hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid, weapons, training and financial support over the years.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 15:32:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d448bb3e-f79a-11f0-9260-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26022400748847.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoy calls for Syria truce to be upheld</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-envoy-calls-syria-truce-be-upheld-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAMASCUS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. envoy called for a truce between the Syrian government and Kurdish-led forces to be upheld, urging steps to build trust after Damascus captured swathes of the northeast in a push to reassert central authority.

Tensions between President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) spilled into conflict this month as the SDF resisted government demands for its fighters and enclaves to be integrated into the state.

Under a ceasefire announced on Tuesday, the government gave the SDF four days to come up with a plan for its remaining enclaves to merge, and said government troops would not enter two remaining SDF-held cities if an agreement could be reached.

U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said he met SDF commander Mazloum Abdi and leading Syrian Kurdish politician Ilham Ahmed on Thursday, and reaffirmed U.S. support for an integration process set out in a January 18 agreement.

"All parties agreed that the essential first step is the full upholding of the current ceasefire, as we collectively identify and implement confidence-building measures on all sides to foster trust and lasting stability," he wrote on X.

The SDF, dominated by the Kurdish YPG militia, and the government have accused each other of violating the ceasefire since Tuesday.

The SDF was once Washington's closest ally in Syria but its position has been weakened as President Donald Trump has deepened ties with Sharaa. Barrack said on Tuesday the original purpose of the SDF had largely expired.

The SDF has now fallen back to Kurdish-majority areas.

Abdi also met Nechirvan Barzani, president of Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region, on Thursday. Iraqi Kurdish politician Wafa Mohammed of Barzani's Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) said the meeting had been convened at the request of the Iraqi Kurdish leadership to discuss the SDF's deal with Sharaa.

"There is strong U.S. and international pressure on the Syrian Democratic Forces to end the disputes and implement the agreement, but that does not necessarily mean the U.S. pressure will lead to a positive outcome. The problem is that the SDF does not trust the promises made by (Sharaa)," Wafa Mohammed told Reuters.

A second Iraqi Kurdish source close to the meeting said talks would also focus on a proposal for both sides to withdraw forces by around 10 km (6 miles) from the outskirts of Hasakah city, which is ethnically mixed and still in SDF hands.

The territories seized by the Syrian government from SDF control in recent days have included Syria's biggest oil fields, agricultural land, and jails holding Islamic State prisoners.

The SDF, which once held a quarter or more of Syria, has sought to preserve a high degree of autonomy for areas under its control, expressing concern that the Islamist-led government in Damascus aims to dominate the country, despite Sharaa's promises to protect the rights of all Syrians.

A Syrian foreign ministry official said the government had preferred a political solution from the outset, and continued to, adding the rights of Kurds were guaranteed and they would not be marginalized as they had been under the ousted President Bashar al-Assad.

All "options were on the table", the official told Reuters, speaking on the condition of anonymity, urging the YPG to "heed the voice of reason and come to the negotiating table".</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:38:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J47EGMADIBL6BJJO6M6XMV5DGY.jpg?auth=00b0155cca9e6444dba600862edc04b83acbbf241fecbd9911634cc3a353a25e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finnish president aims to ready plan for Arctic security by NATO July summit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/finnish-president-aims-ready-plan-arctic-security-by-nato-july-summit-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Thursday he wants a plan to bolster Arctic security to be ready by a NATO summit in Turkey in July after the United States announced a framework deal to de-escalate a row over Greenland's future.

Earlier, President Donald Trump said he had secured total and permanent U.S. access to Greenland in a deal with NATO, whose head said allies would have to step up their commitment to Arctic security to ward off threats from Russia and China.

The deal came as Trump dropped threats to impose tariffs on eight European allies over their stance on Greenland and ruled out taking the vast, mineral-rich island by force.

Stubb said he wanted a package of measures to be put together to boost Arctic security that would be "not dissimilar" to a deal agreed in The Hague last June, when NATO leaders backed a big rise in defence spending, as demanded by Trump.

"In an ideal world, we would have something ready by the NATO summit in Ankara," Stubb told Reuters on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Stubb said that a more robust Arctic security architecture should draw on closer cooperation between NATO's Scandinavian members - Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland - plus the United States and Canada.

Trump's threat last weekend to impose tariffs on European countries that opposed his ambition to acquire Greenland has rattled European capitals, and EU leaders are meeting in Brussels later on Thursday for emergency talks on the issue.

Stubb said he was confident that the EU leaders would maintain a united front on Greenland, and he underlined that it was especially important for the views of Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to be heard.

Greenland is an autonomous region of the kingdom of Denmark.

Trump has argued that only the U.S. can ensure the security of Greenland in the face of what he says are Chinese and Russian ambitions in the Arctic. But his bellicose approach has threatened to blow apart the NATO alliance and reignite a trade war with Europe.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:38:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GLIE3QHO7ZJJXBJSAMUH7VEB6M.jpg?auth=542ed964f5f6025ab30e6ec1276923d27a6046986771e5ccf9d3689a18690464&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Transatlantic relationship is not about 'harming each other,' German finmin says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/transatlantic-relationship-is-not-about-harming-each-other-german-finmin-says-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil, speaking on Thursday in Davos, opposed an escalation of tensions between the United States and Europe amid new tariffs threats .

"The transatlantic relationship is not about harming each other," Klingbeil said.

The minister pushed back against calls for financial retaliation after reports that a Danish pension fund had sold U.S. government bonds.

"This is absolutely not about breaking with the Americans or dissolving the relationship," the minister said in Davos.

Europe was strong and had options, he said, but its aim was not escalation.

Speaking to reporters at the World Economic Forum after meetings with investors, the minister said the world was in upheaval and long-standing alliances were being tested, but added that many countries and regions were seeking closer cooperation with Germany and Europe.

Regarding the Greenland dispute, the minister said it was "good that people are talking" but cautioned against drawing conclusions before any arrangement was available "in black and white."

He said threats of military force and any attempt to make Greenland part of the United States were unacceptable to Europe, while signalling willingness to discuss legitimate security interests within NATO.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:39:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y2LUGX36NNJZ7EUZ4XZXSX5WSM.jpg?auth=a946b199223da57553649773f6bce27fb3da9b923655154028c44ad14333d353&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ryan Coogler's Jim Crow-era vampire film 'Sinners' makes Hollywood history with 16 Oscar nominations</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/culture/20260122-coogler-sinners-makes-hollywood-history-with-16-oscar-nominations</link><description>Ryan Coogler’s blues-steeped vampire epic “Sinners” led all films with 16 nominations to the 98th Academy Awards on Thursday, setting a record for the most in Oscar history.

Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters showered “Sinners” with more nominations than they had ever bestowed before, breaking the 14-nomination mark set by “All About Eve”, “Titanic” and “La La Land”. Along with best picture, Coogler was nominated for best director and best screenplay, and double-duty star Michael B. Jordan – who plays a pair of twins – was rewarded with his first Oscar nomination, for best actor.

Paul Thomas Anderson’s father-daughter revolutionary saga “One Battle After Another,” the favourite coming into nominations, trailed in second with 13 of its own. Four of its actors – Leonardo DiCaprio , Teyana Taylor, Benicio del Toro and Sean Penn – were nominated, though newcomer Chase Infiniti was left out in best actress.

In those two top nominees, the film academy put its full force behind a pair of visceral and bracingly original American epics that each connected with a fraught national moment. Coogler’s Jim Crow-era film – the rare horror movie to win the academy’s favour – conjures a mythical allegory of Black life. In “One Battle After Another,” a dormant spirit of rebellion is revived in an out-of-control police state.

Both are also Warner Bros. titles. In the midst of a contentious sale to Netflix, the 102-year-old studio had one of its best Oscar nominations mornings ever.

As the fate of Warner Bros., which Netflix is buying for $72 billion, hangs in the balance amid a challenge from Paramount Skydance, Hollywood is bracing for potentially the largest realignment in the film industry’s history.

The 10 films nominated for best picture are “Bugonia”, “F1”, “Frankenstein”, “Hamnet”, “Marty Supreme”, “One Battle After Another”, “The Secret Agent”, “Sentimental Value”, “Sinners” and “Train Dreams”.

Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein”, Josh Safdie’s “Marty Supreme” and Joachim Trier’s “Sentimental Value” all scored nine nominations.

The nine for “Marty Supreme” included a third best actor nod for 30-year-old Timothée Chalamet, the favourite in the category he narrowly missed winning last year for his portrayal of Bob Dylan in “A Complete Unknown”. With Jordan and Chalamet, the nominees are Leonardo DiCaprio for “One Battle After Another”, Ethan Hawke for “Blue Moon” and Wagner Moura for “The Secret Agent”.

Nominated for best actress was the category favourite, Jessie Buckley (“Hamnet”), along with Rose Byrne (“If I Had Legs I’d Kick You”), Kate Hudson (“Song Sung Blue”), Renate Reinsve (“Sentimental Value”) and two-time winner Emma Stone, who landed her sixth nomination, for “Bugonia.”

The year’s most-watched movie, with more than half a billion views on Netflix , “KPop Demon Hunters,” scored nominations for both best song (“Golden”) and best animated feature. Sony Pictures developed and produced the film, but, after selling it to Netflix, watched it become a worldwide sensation.

Blockbusters otherwise had a difficult morning. Universal Pictures’ “Wicked: For Good” was shut out entirely. While “Avatar: Fire and Ash” notched nominations for costume design and visual effects, it became the first “Avatar” film not nominated for best picture.

The biggest box-office hit nominated for Hollywood's top award instead was “F1”, an Apple production that landed four nominations. The streamer partnered with Warner Bros. to distribute the racing drama.

This year, the Oscars are introducing a new category for casting. That new honour helped “Sinners” and “One Battle After Another” pad their already impressive stats. Along with those two films, the nominees are “Hamnet”, “Marty Supreme” and “The Secret Agent”.

The academy, which has expanded its overseas membership in recent years, also continued its tilt toward international films. Every category included one international nominee. For the eighth year in the row, a non-English-language film was nominated for best picture. More non-English performances were nominated than ever before.

The top nominee of them all was Joachim Trier's Norwegian family drama “Sentimental Value”. The film cleaned up in the supporting actor categories, with nods for Stellan Skarsgard, Inga Ibsdotter LilIeaas and Elle Fanning. Also nominated for best supporting actress, in addition to Taylor: Amy Madigan for “Weapons” and Wunmi Mosaku for “Sinners”. In supporting actor, the nominees included Jacob Elordi for “Frankenstein” and, in a surprise that likely dislodged Paul Mescal of “Hamnet”, Delroy Lindo for “Sinners.”

A competitive best international feature category mirrored the turbulent state of the world. That included the Iranian revenge drama and Palme d'Or winner “It Was Just an Accident”, by the often-imprisoned filmmaker Jafar Panahi . He's spoken passionately against the ongoing crackdown of demonstrators in his home country. France nominated the film.

Also nominated: the Tunisian entry “The Voice of Hind Rajab”, about volunteers at the Palestine Red Crescent Society; the Brazilian political thriller “The Secret Agent”; the apocalyptic Spanish road movie “Sirat” and “Sentimental Value.”

The 98th Academy Awards will take place on March 15 at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles and will be televised live on ABC and Hulu. YouTube 's new deal to exclusively air won't take effect until 2029. This year, Conan O’Brien will return as host.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 16:40:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/da6ba600-f7a6-11f0-b495-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26022480008831.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelensky says US 'security guarantees' for Ukraine ready after meeting with Trump</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260122-zelensky-says-us-security-guarantees-ready-after-meeting-with-trump</link><description>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday blasted the EU's lack of "political will" in countering Russian leader Vladimir Putin , during a fiery address criticising some of Kyiv 's top allies at the World Economic Forum .

The speech to the Davos elite came minutes after Zelensky had met with US President Donald Trump , a conversation which he said brought agreement about what post-war US security guarantees for Ukraine would look like.

Zelensky did not say what the security guarantees included, only that they were "done" and were ready to be signed by the leaders and ratified by the Ukrainian parliament and US Congress .

But in a marked departure from his usual warm rhetoric towards the EU, Kyiv's main political and financial backers, Zelensky slammed what he cast as inaction, drawing parallels with the cult film "Groundhog Day" to describe the slow progress on key areas of support for Kyiv.

"What's missing: time or political will?" he said at one point, referencing delays over the establishment of a European war crimes tribunal on the Russian invasion.

He also said Europe , without mentioning any single country, was failing to agree on how to address global problems.

"There are endless internal arguments and things left unsaid that stop Europe from uniting and speaking honestly enough to find real solutions," Zelensky told the forum.

"Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers," he added.

He said Europe looked "lost" over how to deal with the challenge presented by Trump.

"Europe looks lost trying to convince the US president to change. But he will not change. President Trump loves who he is, and he says he loves Europe, but he will not listen to this kind of Europe," he said.

Trump had hailed a "good" meeting with Zelensky in the Swiss ski resort, hours before his envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner were due in Moscow for talks with Putin.

"This war has to end," Trump told reporters when asked what message he was sending to the Russian leader.

Zelensky said the question of territory was the one outstanding issue in the talks to find an end to the war.

"It's all about the eastern part of our country. It's all about the land. This is the issue which we (have) not solved yet."

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country's eastern Donbas region as part of a deal – but Kyiv has warned ceding ground will embolden Moscow.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:29:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0c4a55c8-f7b0-11f0-aa71-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/7e206cc8399b1bbe325aabfd4506becf1ebb7cbd.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy tells Europe: have courage to finally 'act now'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/zelenskiy-tells-europe-have-courage-finally-act-now-2026-01-22/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 22 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy criticised Europe on Thursday as a "fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers" lacking courage to act decisively and facing a dark future unless it stood up to U.S. and Russian power.

In some of his toughest remarks to key allies of Kyiv, Zelenskiy urged Europe not to "degrade" itself by failing to stand up to Russian aggression and U.S. President Donald Trump's aspiration to control Greenland.

"Europe can and must be a global force," he told global leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos as Russia's war in Ukraine neared its four-year mark.

"Not one that reacts late, but one that defines the future."

Zelenskiy, who for years has rallied often reluctant European allies against Russia, repeated calls for Europe to create its own united armed forces and to use frozen Russian financial assets to support Ukraine.

He spoke after meeting Trump in Davos for talks on ending the war which both leaders described as positive. But he urged European leaders to be more robust in defending democratic values in their region, as U.S. attention turns away.

"Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost trying to convince the U.S. president to change," Zelenskiy said in his fiery speech.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:56:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HQ2QJHWYVFIHDMRQYSOVRCNEAI.jpg?auth=3c6761955ffc600e803d52d5982099909a46bbc56d22d0090f5915abbfec5e0d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Half of all Sudanese children not in education due to civil war, says aid group</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/half-all-sudanese-children-not-education-due-civil-war-says-aid-group-2026-01-22/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Around half of all school-age children in Sudan, or more than eight million, are no longer in education because of the country's civil war, in one of the world's worst education crises, Save The Children said in a report on Thursday.

"Right now the international community is failing the children of Sudan," Inger Ashing, the CEO of Save the Children International, one of the largest charities operating in the country, told reporters in a video-link briefing from Stockholm.

The report said more than eight million Sudanese children had missed about 500 days of education since the civil war began in April 2023.

"That is more than any child missed during the COVID pandemic," Ashing said, adding that many schools had closed or been damaged during the conflict, while others were being used as shelters for displaced families.

In recent days, drone strikes have intensified in and around the city of al-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state in central Sudan, causing significant civilian deaths in at least two cases, residents say.

Aid groups have called for urgent assistance to provide aid to the Darfur city of al-Fashir, taken by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in October, as well as to Kadugli, another besieged city in Sudan's south. Both cities are facing famine.

More than 100,000 people are estimated to have fled al-Fashir since the RSF took control there after an 18-month siege.

Only 3% of schools are open in North Darfur, where conflict is ongoing, with areas in West Kordofan, South Darfur and West Darfur also gravely impacted, Save The Children's report said.

Some teachers have left their jobs after not being paid for months, it added.

"Without immediate funding to pay and train teachers, restore learning spaces, and provide essential learning supplies, the education system risks total breakdown," Save the Children said.

Education is a lifeline to protect children from exploitation and recruitment into armed groups, Ashing said following her visit this month to schools in Port Sudan, River Nile and Khartoum.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:56:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7QIBIKE5TFM6FOWMSITSKFWG2E.jpg?auth=d6fb207ff7886f6c3d3a151c862f0cb5a0d32c866780f0b0c0a8c35e37d8f48d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU must show unity on Greenland, Ukraine, Board of Peace, preserve U.S. ties</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-must-show-unity-greenland-ukraine-board-peace-preserve-us-ties-2026-01-22/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The European Union must show unity in dealing with Greenland, the Board of Peace and return to discussions on helping Ukraine, which is the main security problem for Europe, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday.

Speaking to reporters before an emergency summit on EU relations with the United States, Tusk said Europe should be careful to preserve its ties with the U.S. but that Washington should also understand it should not try to dominate Europe.

"It is important for ...our partners in Washington to understand the difference between domination and leadership. Leadership is OK," Tusk said. "Coercion is not a good method in relation with our transatlantic partners," he said.

"I would like us to clearly confirm today that we can act as a political community on various issues, be it Greenland or the Board of Peace and primarily Ukraine, because ...it cannot be that ...the topic of Ukraine has been sidelined -- it is a key issue for the security of Europe," Tusk said

He added that Poland had expected progress on Ukraine peace talks this week at the World Economic Forum in Davos and the fact that Greenland became the key issue was bad news.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:56:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LLDAD5OC35LMXO3LERP3TPOROY.jpg?auth=516ab3465ab2c6cfae67c4ec10f8e3132c8dc9240280939ec425463c5510b817&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Albania, Bulgaria to join Trump's 'Board of Peace'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/albania-bulgaria-join-trumps-board-peace-2026-01-22/</link><description>TIRANA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Albanian lawmakers on Thursday approved a government decision to join the "Board of Peace" initiative launched by U.S. President Donald Trump to resolve global conflicts.

Prime Minister Edi Rama called the move “an act of goodwill” and "a special honour", saying it would strengthen Albania’s role on the international stage.

The legislation passed with support from 110 of the 140 deputies, and Rama argued that joining the initiative ensures Albania remains "at the table" in global diplomacy, referring to the statement by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney in Davos.

Neighbouring Kosovo, a close ally with the U.S. which supported its independence from Serbia in 2008, also joined the Board of Peace.

Bulgaria's outgoing government has joined the treaty, a decision the parliament is expected to ratify next week. Diplomat Nikolay Mladenov, a former UN envoy, has been elected as the High Representative for Gaza at the board.

Bulgaria and Hungary are the only EU members that have joined the Board of Peace so far.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:56:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TI4AQSRZ6ZMDPIMZVRFZGH55L4.jpg?auth=0b2955e38416e03764b6a784d8a7a67a4082432fc3e5e15e554ef5837d198446&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Davos-Quotes from Zelenskiy speech criticising Europe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/davos-quotes-zelenskiy-speech-criticising-europe-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy delivered an address to world leaders in Davos on Thursday in which he chided Europe for failing to act more forcefully on the global stage and demanded more courage from Kyiv's partners.

Here are some quotes from his speech:

"We should not accept that Europe is just a salad of small and middle powers, seasoned with enemies of Europe. When united, we are truly invincible."

"Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers. Instead of taking the lead in defending freedom worldwide, especially when America's focus shifts elsewhere, Europe looks lost, trying to convince the U.S. president to change."

"Europe needs strength. For that, we must act together - and act in time. And most of all, we must have the courage to act."

"Without action now, there is no tomorrow. Let's end this 'Groundhog Day'."

"Because if Europe is not seen as a global force, if its actions don't scare bad actors, then Europe will always be reacting – catching up with new dangers and attacks."

"But when you refuse to help people fighting for freedom, the consequences return – and they're always negative."

"Why can (U.S.) President (Donald) Trump stop tankers from the 'shadow fleet' and seize oil – but Europe doesn't?"

"Russian oil is being transported right along European shores. That oil funds the war against Ukraine. That oil helps destabilize Europe. So Russian oil must be stopped and confiscated and sold for Europe's benefit. Why not?"

"There were different opinions, but the fact remains: (Venezuela's former President Nicolas) Maduro is on trial in New York. Sorry, but (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is not on trial."

"Everyone turned attention to Greenland. And it's clear – most leaders simply are not sure what to do about it."

"And if you send 30 or 40 soldiers to Greenland – what is that for? What message does it send? What's the message to Putin? To China? And even more importantly, what message does it send to Denmark – the most important – your close ally?"

"If Russian warships are sailing freely around Greenland, Ukraine can help – we have the expertise and weapons to ensure not one of those ships remains. They can sink near Greenland just as they do near Crimea."

"Europe still remains in 'Greenland mode'. Maybe … Someday … Someone will do something."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:57:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GTOEFTIDVZL7VEMLMJBNZN5AFE.jpg?auth=4cde3e5f98f42e06571b50021f512bf039e0b60f86fa8bbbc0651e6695754333&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Austrian ex-intelligence accused of spying for Russia goes on trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/austrian-ex-intelligence-accused-spying-russia-goes-trial-2026-01-22/</link><description>VIENNA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Austrian former intelligence officer Egisto Ott went on trial on Thursday, accused of helping Russia hunt down opponents and selling it government phones and secure laptops at the behest of fugitive former Wirecard executive Jan Marsalek .

Ott's is the biggest spying case in Austria since a retired army colonel was convicted in 2020 of having spied for Moscow for decades. Ott, 63, denies the charges, which include supporting a foreign intelligence agency to the detriment of Austria, and pleaded not guilty.

The trial could shed light on Russian intelligence-gathering in Europe, and provide more details on Marsalek's alleged spying operations across the continent after a London court convicted three Bulgarians last year of being part of a Russian spy ring run by the Austrian fugitive.

Prosecutors accuse Ott of making unauthorised searches in police and other databases and asking counterparts in other countries to do the same in an attempt to locate people Moscow wanted to hunt down, such as Dmitry Senin, a former Russian intelligence agent who has now claimed asylum in Montenegro.

Ott, who ran undercover agents, has acknowledged saving the results of his searches in his private Gmail account or in unrelated case files of the agency he worked for, the now-defunct Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counterterrorism (BVT).

Ott's lawyer Anna Mair said Ott had in fact been operating under the orders of a superior who had been contacted by an allied intelligence agency that had hoped to recruit Senin.

"He carried out or ordered these searches, but not for Russia," she told the court, adding that one witness would confirm the secret operation's existence.

Ott was "highly intelligent" and would have better covered his tracks if he had been acting illegally, she said. He later echoed that message.

"Do you really think I would do that? That I am that dumb?" Ott told the court.

Not all those Ott looked up were former Russian operatives.

One was Bulgarian journalist Christo Grozev, who worked for investigative outlet Bellingcat and led its reporting on the 2018 poisoning in Britain of Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, which Britain blames on Russia.

Moscow denies all involvement in that case and has regularly accused Western powers of trying to enflame anti-Russian hysteria.

Prosecutors said Ott provided Grozev's address in Vienna to Marsalek, who then arranged a break-in at the apartment. Grozev later moved away from Austria for security reasons when he found out he was a target.

Ott told the court he had looked up Grozev because he wanted to discuss the findings of Bellingcat's investigations with him.

Marsalek, the former chief operating officer of Wirecard, the collapsed German payments firm, is on the run and believed to be in Russia. As such, he could not be reached for comment.

The trial continues on Friday and is likely to last for months.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 17:57:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TQPVKGF6DJJCDCY5UM6AVOSCCE.jpg?auth=f31133af973c43210f539e89bdb9fb50646dd67b649ce278419ebf1234e58294&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil finance minister wants deputy Durigan as successor, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazil-finance-minister-wants-deputy-durigan-successor-sources-say-2026-01-22/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Brazil's Finance Minister Fernando Haddad would like President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to appoint his executive secretary, Dario Durigan, to succeed him once he leaves the post in coming weeks, two sources said.

For the No. 2 position that Durigan would vacate, Haddad is considering naming the current Treasury secretary, Rogerio Ceron, the sources added, in a configuration that would signal continuity in the ministry's current management.

According to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans are private and still require Lula's approval, Haddad is also discussing who would lead the Treasury if that scenario is confirmed.

The finance ministry declined to comment.

Haddad said last week he intends to step down before the end of January, though no departure date has been announced.

One factor that could delay his exit is a possible trip to India with Lula from February 19–21, but the ministry has not yet received a request from the presidential palace for Haddad to join the delegation, according to a third source.

Durigan, responsible for coordinating work across the ministry's different areas, has played a key role in negotiations with Congress on economic measures and has also strengthened his relationship with Lula.

Haddad has said that after leaving the ministry he hopes to help with Lula's reelection campaign this year, though allies in the president's Workers Party (PT) also tout him as a potential candidate for the Senate or for governing the state of Sao Paulo.

He said this week he has begun discussing with Lula what role he will play in this year's general elections, but the two have yet to reach an agreement.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:39:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FPAPEUJFANIYZJ46AMH7WOLBOY.jpg?auth=0a2abe9f3b1f559ee6269d77531a1a0e11dcdb1aee2c66fce2b42632a186cdc4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>India's Modi speaks to Brazil's Lula on strategic partnership</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/indias-modi-speaks-brazils-lula-strategic-partnership-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday he had spoken to Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and was looking forward to welcoming him to India soon.

The losses are the latest setback for the Kurds, an ethnic group that was left stateless a century ago when the borders of the modern Middle East emerged from the collapsing Ottoman Empire.

Kurdish nationalism stirred in the 1890s when the Ottoman Empire was on its last legs. The 1920 Treaty of Sevres, which imposed a colonial carve-up of Turkey after World War One, promised them independence.

Three years later, Turkish leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk rendered that accord obsolete by winning the Turkish War of Independence. The Treaty of Lausanne, ratified in 1924, divided the Kurds among the new nations of the Middle East.

They speak a language related to Farsi and are concentrated in a mountainous region straddling the borders of Armenia, Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey. Kurds are mostly Sunni Muslims.

Kurds form about 10% of the Syrian population.

Under deposed President Bashar al-Assad, the Baathist state deprived thousands of them citizenship rights, banned their language and clamped down on Kurdish political activity.

As Syria descended into civil war in 2011, with Assad focused on trying to crush Sunni Arab rebels in western Syria, the Syrian Kurdish PYD group and an affiliated militia, the YPG, established self-rule in Kurdish-majority areas of the north.

The area under Kurdish control expanded as the YPG, under the umbrella of the Syrian Democratic Forces, partnered with the United States in the campaign against Islamic State.

Following Assad's ouster by Islamist rebels led by Sharaa in 2024, the Kurdish groups have aimed to preserve their autonomy, concerned that the new rulers in Damascus aim to dominate the new order.

But their hand has been weakened as Washington has built close ties to Sharaa, echoing his calls for the Kurds to integrate with Damascus.

Sharaa, who has vowed to protect the rights of all Syrian groups, issued a decree on January 16 formally recognizing Kurdish as a national language alongside Arabic, and permitting it to be taught in schools, among other steps.

Since then, government advances have forced the SDF to retreat to Kurdish-majority areas.

The PYD is heavily influenced by the ideology of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), long active in neighbouring Turkey.

Kurds form about 20% of the population of Turkey, mainly living in the southeast.

The PKK took up arms against the state in 1984, waging an insurgency, initially seeking a separate state but later moderating its goal to autonomy and greater rights for Kurds.

More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

Turkey has held PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan in prison since capturing him in 1999.

In early 2025, Turkey launched a peace process with the PKK, and Ocalan called on the PKK to lay down arms. The process has, however, somewhat stalled since then.

President Tayyip Erdogan removed restrictions on using the Kurdish language during the 2000s and early 2010s.

The United States, the European Union and Turkey classify the PKK as a terrorist organization.

Turkey's military has often struck targets in Iraq's Kurdish region near the PKK's stronghold in the Qandil mountains.

Turkey has also sent troops into northern Syria several times to counter the YPG, which Ankara deems an extension of the PKK.

Turkish officials have said recent events in Syria could kick-start the peace process in Turkey.

Kurds form 15-20% of the population, mainly inhabiting three mountainous northern provinces that make up Iraqi Kurdistan.

In the late 1980s, Iraq's authoritarian ruler Saddam Hussein targeted Iraqi Kurds with chemical gas, razed Kurdish villages and forced thousands of Kurds into camps.

After Saddam's forces were driven out of the north in the first Gulf War in 1991, Kurdish political parties gained control of Iraqi Kurdistan.

Since the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam in 2003, Iraq's central government has recognised autonomy for Kurdistan, which is led by a regional government with a budget apportioned from Baghdad under a formula for dividing oil income.

When Islamic State militants swept through much of northern Iraq in 2014, Kurdish fighters exploited the collapse of central authority to expand their territory, including taking control of Kirkuk, an oil city they view as their ancient capital.

In September 2017, Iraq's Kurds held a referendum on independence, which backfired, eliciting fierce opposition from Baghdad and regional powers. The vote prompted military and economic retaliation from Baghdad, which retook Kirkuk and other disputed areas. Ties between the centre and the Kurdish regional government have since improved, though tensions remain over oil exports and revenue-sharing.

Kurds form about 10% of the population.

Rights groups say Kurds, along with other religious and ethnic minorities, face discrimination under the ruling clerical establishment. The Islamic Republic denies persecuting Kurds.

There are three main Iranian Kurdish separatist factions, all based in Iraqi Kurdistan. Iran has demanded authorities in Iraq hand over separatist Kurdish dissidents stationed there and close their bases.

Iran's Kurdish regions have been a focal point of unrest following anti-government protests that began in late December 2025 and led to thousands of people being killed in January 2026. During the unrest Reuters reported that armed Kurdish separatist groups had sought to cross the border into Iran from Iraq.

Kurdish areas were also a major flashpoint during the previous major wave of domestic unrest in 2022, when nationwide protests were triggered by the death in custody of an Iranian-Kurdish woman.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 18:45:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5BW622DSWRMQNCLOI5G7FTRTGM.jpg?auth=4e4425a6b93e90a6b008ef2480ea3aa8126ca384a163deacee93c267761c298c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN-backed force in Haiti to deploy fully by summer amid political turmoil</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/un-backed-force-haiti-deploy-fully-by-summer-amid-political-turmoil-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.N.-backed security force deployed to Haiti to help local police fight off armed gangs that have taken over much of the country should reach its new full-strength , opens new tab by summer, the U.N.'s special envoy for Haiti said on Thursday.

The announcement comes amid political uncertainty in the Caribbean nation ahead of February 7, when the current transition government's mandate ends. No official succession plan has been put forward.

U.N. envoy Carlos Ruiz said more troops should arrive by April and that the force should reach its full strength - envisioned at 5,500 troops - by the this summer, or autumn at latest.

Around 1,000 mostly Kenyan police are currently in Haiti as part of the force, whose deployment has been marked by delays and severe lack of funding. Since the first deployment in June 2024, gangs have expanded to much of central and rural Haiti.

By comparison, Haiti's police and the numbers of armed group members in the country are estimated at around 12,000 each, with large amounts of guns and ammunition trafficked to criminal groups largely from the U.S.

Ruiz spoke after reports of a majority of members of Haiti's transitional presidential council, the CPT - effectively its top executive - moved to oust the prime minister days before their mandate ends next month.

If successful, this would be the CPT's second ouster of a prime minister since appointed in April 2024. Their term has been marked by political infighting and corruption accusations, while worsening insecurity has repeatedly pushed back the likelihood of holding the country's first election in a decade .

"The country cannot spare more internal fighting," Ruiz said. "The current authorities should still make use of the couple weeks they have to do whatever they can to benefit the country."

If stakeholders do not agree on a plan for after February 7, Ruiz said, "we know the constitution provides for the prime minister to continue if that's the case, and we need an authority and a government that is stable enough."

None of Haiti's CPT members have publicly commented on the reported attempt to oust Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime.

U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on Thursday warned against taking that step, saying such a measure by non-elected CPT members so close to the end of their tenure would undermine U.S. goals of security in Haiti.

"The U.S. would consider anyone supporting such a disruptive step favoring the gangs to be acting contrary to the interests of the United States, the region, and the Haitian people and will act accordingly," Landau said on X.

Haitian gangs have killed thousands and taken control of most of the capital Port-au-Prince, expanded to central Haiti and its agricultural heartlands, carried out multiple massacres, mass rapes, ransom kidnappings and arson. Some 1.4 million people have been internally displaced by the conflict.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:25:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DDC5AZ7PBFO5RG3Q4ZT77QE3UA.jpg?auth=1e32d88fd13453816a9cb7a64edfa1a533b5f435e3d69132e3d4540ebe40e37a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Trump whisperer' Rutte steers NATO around Greenland crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/trump-whisperer-rutte-steers-nato-around-greenland-crisis-2026-01-22/</link><description>AMSTERDAM/BRUSSELS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - As tensions over Greenland between Donald Trump and Europe neared boiling point this week, NATO boss Mark Rutte cemented his reputation as a "Trump whisperer" after the U.S. president dropped his tariff threats following a meeting in Davos.

Trump said he and Rutte agreed on a "framework of a future deal" on the entire Arctic Region, which would be "a great one for the United States of America, and all NATO Nations".

While details were scant, the outcome was a diplomatic win for Rutte that steered the fraying transatlantic alliance back from the precipice, diplomats and political analysts said.

Rutte, who served as Dutch prime minister for 14 years, was already known as "the Trump whisperer" in European newspapers when he took up the NATO job a month before Trump's re-election in 2024, based on their rapport during Trump's first term.

His strategy is not subtle - it is built on lavishing praise on the U.S. president, even as other European leaders are increasingly critical of Trump.

"The work of the Secretary General of NATO is always important. And when it's manifested in the personality of Mark Rutte, who's cool, calm, and collected, and is able to talk with the president of the United States, we should just be thankful that he's our secretary general right now," Finnish President Alexander Stubb told Reuters in Davos.

Trump had previously said the U.S. needed to own Greenland. Quite how much of his backtracking was down to Rutte was unclear. He had already taken military force off the table before his meeting with the NATO chief.

But many diplomats give Rutte credit for holding NATO together and managing turbulent transatlantic ties with Trump in the first year of the U.S. president's second term.

"He is not perfect. Allies may have different opinions about him and his managing style. But he is very good at keeping this alliance together in difficult times," a European diplomat said.

"President Trump was already prepared for concessions and Rutte was the perfect interlocutor."

While a frenzy of diplomacy in global capitals laid the groundwork, and Europe's strong backing for Denmark's refusal to cede Greenland played a part, Rutte's personal intervention was seen as crucial.

A senior NATO diplomat said the agreement showed why Rutte "does what he does to stay on speed dial" with Trump.

The latest NATO compromise came on the back of a similar intervention by Rutte in The Hague in June, when he poured on the charm, likening Trump to a "daddy" in global conflicts.

He successfully negotiated a deal that saw allies agree to Trump's call for an increase in military and related spending to 5% of GDP.

Trump, clearly delighted, brought up the "daddy" comment in his speech on Wednesday in Davos.

Now Rutte has proposed a framework agreement that would see the alliance beef up security for Greenland and the broader Arctic, addressing what Trump says are concerns about threats posed by China and Russia.

While French President Emmanuel Macron called Trump a bully in his own speech at Davos, Rutte has always lauded Trump. In a text that Trump posted on social media this week, Rutte praised his "incredible" work in Syria and commended his work on Gaza and Ukraine.

Rutte, who honed his consensus-building skills keeping together coalition governments in the politically fractious Netherlands, often refuses requests from journalists to discuss sensitive matters on camera. He changes topics, saying diplomatic problems should not be splashed across newspaper headlines.

Tim Sweijs, director of research at The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies, said Rutte's ability to keep parties together for such a long stint as prime minister made him "a somewhat rare political figure" in the Netherlands.

"Instead of withdrawing — as many leaders do — and limiting discussions to a small inner circle, he would always pick up his old Nokia phone and call both his coalition partners and members of the opposition," Sweijs said.

That has left Rutte open to criticism that he is willing to set aside ideals to reach an agreement, said Simon Otjes, associate professor of Dutch politics at Leiden University.

"He's famous for saying, 'If you want vision, then you should go to an eye doctor.' He's the guy who gets to the compromise, who brings people together, who makes people feel valued in order to move further," Otjes said.

"He really tries to understand not just what Trump needs in terms of policy to move, but also what Trump needs psychologically."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:26:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SZHBCHBRWJJYFJYBNYM73UJS5Q.jpg?auth=68513142984be78754099ba5f8e36a1e8b65536813ccb7469af69d3466ad1094&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finnish president Stubb says Trump is putting pressure on Russia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/finnish-president-stubb-says-trump-is-putting-pressure-russia-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Thursday U.S. President Donald Trump is putting pressure on Russia over the war in Ukraine and argued that conditions are evolving favourably from the perspective of western powers.

Speaking after the United States and Europe stepped back from a row over Greenland, Stubb said efforts to craft a peace deal had gained strength since Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner began complementing U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff's own endeavours.

Stubb said he was optimistic about the peace process from the point of view of Ukraine, the United States, and Europe, highlighting a 20-point peace plan encompassing security guarantees for Ukraine and the reconstruction of the country.

"I think President Trump is putting a lot of pressure on Russia, and I hope he continues to do that," Stubb told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos.

However, Stubb said he was not convinced Russia would accept the plan out of domestic political considerations.

Trump said a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in Davos was "very good" and that his message to Russian President Vladimir Putin is that the war must end.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:26:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OE3MQRBJ45OOBGFGWT3NRIAOBA.jpg?auth=7ea16356970e6a6c5a50123ee5f2fcc72be0e585c62c985b5c79aeb2ca8778ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US allows China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at 'undercut' prices of Maduro days, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-allows-china-purchase-venezuelan-oil-not-undercut-prices-maduro-days-official-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is allowing China to purchase Venezuelan oil but not at "unfair, undercut" prices at which Caracas sold the crude before the U.S. removed President Nicolas Maduro, a U.S. official said on Thursday.

While the oil will be sold in the global marketplace, the administration has required that the majority be sold to the United States, the administration official said on condition of anonymity. The U.S. says it will control Venezuela's oil sales indefinitely after seizing Maduro on January 3.

"Thanks to President (Donald) Trump’s decisive and successful law enforcement operation, the people of Venezuela will collect a fair price for their oil from China and other nations rather than a corrupt, cheap price," the official said.

China has been Venezuela's top oil buyer for years, and the sales helped Caracas repay massive loans to Beijing in debt-for-oil deals.

The administration is allowing China to buy the oil at "fair market prices - not the unfair, undercut prices" at which Maduro sold oil to China to pay debts, the official said.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright said last week that the U.S. was receiving about $45 per barrel for Venezuelan oil compared with the roughly $31 Venezuela was getting before Maduro's capture.

Trading houses Trafigura and Vitol have sold some 11 million barrels of oil in an initial supply deal between Venezuela and the U.S. of stranded crude, representing about a quarter of the $2 billion agreement.

Trafigura completed its first crude sale to a customer in a deal with Spanish company Repsol (REP.MC) , opens new tab while Vitol has negotiated cargoes to U.S. refiners including Valero (VLO.N) , opens new tab and Phillips 66 (PSX.N) , opens new tab and to its refinery in Italy, sources said.

China's oil imports from Venezuela are expected to slump starting in February as fewer tankers have managed to leave after the U.S. claimed control of the OPEC producer's sales, traders and analysts said last week.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:45:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GDUXMN6GBFN33FMCXIBI4GS3XI.jpg?auth=12edd5902d400f68efd8ce357cee43551f73cb56dbb4872b039276a1963c6bef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Tunisia sentences two prominent journalists to three and a half years in prison, state news says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/tunisia-sentences-two-prominent-journalists-three-half-years-prison-state-news-2026-01-22/</link><description>TUNIS, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A Tunisian court sentenced two prominent journalists, Bohran Bssaies and Mourad Zghidi, to three and a half years in prison on Thursday, TAP state news quoted a judicial official as saying.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:45:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Can Donald Trump buy Greenland?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/can-donald-trump-buy-greenland-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has said repeatedly that he wants to acquire Greenland, possibly by purchasing it from Denmark, despite the U.S. ally's repeated insistence that it is not for sale.

On Wednesday, Trump appeared to rule out military force as a means of taking the Arctic island, saying that he had secured a deal with NATO to guarantee U.S. access to Greenland. The details remained unclear, however.

Here is what we know about the likely cost of a purchase and the constitutional limits on the president's ability to add a new territory to the United States:

With no market for buying and selling countries, it is of course impossible to put any meaningful price tag on Greenland.

But Otto Svendsen, an expert on the Arctic at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said it was not unreasonable to expect that the total cost of acquiring Greenland would approach $1 trillion.

That would include the cost of acquiring the world's largest island, as well as potential lump-sum payments to the Greenlanders, budget transfers to maintain the island's welfare state, infrastructure and defense investments, he said in an emailed statement.

Investors have questioned the wisdom of such a purchase when the U.S. has a $38 trillion deficit. Political rivals have also criticized Trump for spending abroad instead of helping American citizens. "How about instead of giving the American people Greenland, we give them healthcare?" Democratic Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania asked on Wednesday.

Congressional approval is required to expand the size of the U.S. Past purchases, such as the 1917 acquisition of the U.S. Virgin Islands - also from Denmark - have been carried out by treaty.

Two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 senators, must approve any treaty, according to the Constitution. That would mean Trump currently would have to convince at least 14 members of the Democratic caucus to approve a deal, even if he had the support of every Republican.

And some Senate Republicans have joined Democrats in saying that Washington should not force a sale. "Respect for the sovereignty of the people of Greenland should be non-negotiable," Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the co-chair of the Senate Arctic Caucus, said in a statement.

It was not expected that Greenland, now a self-governing territory within Denmark, would become a U.S. state. With just 57,000 residents, the island's population is far smaller than any state's.

Other possibilities include forming a "compact of free association" with the U.S., which would include financial assistance in exchange for a security presence, or making Greenland a territory, like Guam or Puerto Rico. Territories are under federal control but residents lack rights such as voting representation in Congress.

The U.S. Constitution also gives Congress, not the president, control of federal lands.

The U.S. Constitution grants Congress, not the president, control of spending.

Trump's Republicans, who have slim majorities in both the House of Representatives and Senate, have backed Trump as he has pushed the boundaries of the president's spending authority, including by downsizing and closing agencies funded by Congress and spending millions on efforts like changing the name of the Department of Defense without congressional approval.

But it would be difficult to find and spend an amount comparable to the entire U.S. military budget without obtaining Congress' buy-in.

Trump and his backers have insisted the U.S. needs Greenland to fend off threats from Russian and Chinese interests in the Arctic and that Denmark cannot ensure its security. But the United States already has a base on the island and the ability to expand its presence there.

Trump also wants more access to Greenland's rich but largely untapped rare-earth and critical mineral resources . Extracting oil and natural gas is banned in Greenland for environmental reasons, while the development of mining has been snarled in red tape and opposition from indigenous people.

In a recent Senate speech, Republican Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky cited the importance of the NATO alliance, and U.S.-Danish military ties.

"There is no ambiguity here. Close ties with our northernmost allies are what make America’s extensive reach in the Arctic possible. And I have yet to hear from this administration a single thing we need from Greenland that this sovereign people is not already willing to grant us," he said.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 19:46:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WXCD6MYBJZP27N2OHPEC5RWZWU.jpg?auth=f694d2bc38c1d5d437745a57809eb698e3537f77a4ef55f4c6005df84abdf0c8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US names new top envoy for Venezuela after Maduro capture</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-names-new-top-envoy-venezuela-after-maduro-capture-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The United States has named a two-time U.S. ambassador as its top envoy for Venezuela , according to the U.S. embassy in Caracas website.

Laura Dogu, who previously served as ambassador to Honduras and Nicaragua, will serve as charge d'affaires to the Venezuela Affairs Unit based out of the embassy in Bogota, according to the website.

Dogu takes up the role after the United States captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro in a raid earlier this month and whisked him to New York to face drug-trafficking charges.

“The Trump Administration continues to work with the interim authorities to stabilize Venezuela as part of the three-phase plan Secretary Rubio laid out for Congress and the American people," a senior State Department official said.

"This plan requires a full-time Chargé d'Affaires at the Venezuela Affairs Unit, located at the United States Embassy in Bogota. Ambassador Dogu is ... well-positioned to lead the team during this transition period.”

The United States earlier this month began preparations in case President Donald Trump decides to reopen the U.S. embassy in Venezuela's capital Caracas.

U.S. diplomatic and security personnel traveled to Caracas on January 9 for an assessment of a "potential phased resumption" of embassy operations there, a State Department spokesperson said at the time.

The U.S. in 2019 withdrew all diplomatic personnel from Venezuela, citing the deteriorating situation in the country after months of political unrest.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E6B5CQ524VM2BP5ALFTEAXGOZQ.jpg?auth=c5e970b0f8adff726918f6c35afb98834772efa1074c699ef71dcf97bcbfb258&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military assets heading to Middle East even as Trump backs off toughest Iran rhetoric</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-military-assets-heading-middle-east-even-trump-backs-off-toughest-iran-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - A U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets will arrive in the Middle East region in the coming days, two U.S. officials said on Thursday, even as U.S. President Donald Trump voices hopes of avoiding new military action against Iran.

U.S. warships including the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, several destroyers and fighter aircraft started moving from the Asia-Pacific last week as tensions between Iran and the United States soared following a severe crackdown on protests across Iran in recent months.

One of the officials said additional air defense systems were also being eyed for the Middle East. The United States often increases U.S. troop levels in the Middle East at moments of heightened regional tensions, something that experts note can be entirely defensive in nature.

However, the U.S. military staged a major buildup last summer ahead of its June strikes against Iran's nuclear program, and later boasted about how it kept its intention to strike a secret.

Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene against Iran over the recent killings of protesters there but protests dwindled last week and Trump's rhetoric regarding Iran has eased. He has turned his gaze on other geopolitical issues, including his pursuit of Greenland .

On Wednesday, Trump said he hoped there would not be further U.S. military action in Iran, but said the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear program.

"They can't do the nuclear," Trump told CNBC in an interview in Davos, Switzerland, noting major U.S. air strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities in June 2025. "If they do it, it's going to happen again."

It is now at least seven months since the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, last verified Iran's stock of highly enriched uranium. Its own guidance is that it should be done monthly.

Iran must file a report to the IAEA on what happened to those sites that were struck by the United States and nuclear material thought to be there, including an estimated 440.9 kg of uranium enriched to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% weapons-grade level. That is enough material, if enriched further, for 10 nuclear bombs, according to an IAEA yardstick.

It is unclear whether protests in Iran could also surge again. The protests began on December 28 as modest demonstrations in Tehran’s Grand Bazaar over economic hardship and quickly spread nationwide.

The U.S.-based HRANA rights group said it has so far verified 4,519 unrest-linked deaths, including 4,251 protesters, 197 security personnel, 35 people aged under 18 and 38 bystanders who it says were neither protesters nor security personnel.

HRANA has 9,049 additional deaths under review. An Iranian official told Reuters the confirmed death toll until Sunday was more than 5,000, including 500 members of the security forces.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:31:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VYA52T2ULZIZRC4Q3UZY5EFPIU.jpg?auth=0d320fc17ffed991c1612774020fcbf75b2a186c2d328f9d64e59e52a1a4b310&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to expand anti-abortion aid rule to cover 'gender ideology,' diversity</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-expand-anti-abortion-aid-rule-cover-gender-ideology-diversity-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is set to expand the Mexico City Policy that blocks U.S. assistance to organizations that provide or promote abortions to cover groups involved in what the administration calls "gender ideology" and diversity, equity and inclusion, an administration official said on Thursday.

The policy, which opponents call the "global gag rule" because they say it silences abortion rights advocates, will be expanded on Friday to include international organizations and U.S. nongovernmental organizations, the official said.

The change will cover $30 billion of U.S. foreign assistance. The move was first reported by Fox News.

Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, the Mexico City Policy, which previously only applied to foreign NGOs, has been rescinded by each Democratic president since and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. It was most recently restored by Trump in January 2025.

"The State Department will release three final rules on Friday expanding the Mexico City Policy to protect foreign assistance from subsidizing not only abortion as a method of family planning, but also gender ideology (and) discriminatory equity ideology/DEI," said the official, who confirmed the plans on condition of anonymity.

The Trump administration has aggressively closed government programs that relate to acceptance of transgender people or gender-affirming care, including as part of an overhaul of foreign aid that saw the U.S. Agency for International Development shuttered.

It has also shut down offices and fired staff working on diversity initiatives , which Trump and his supporters say unfairly discriminate against white people and men.

The State Department in November announced plans to classify actions under pro-diversity policies and state subsidies for abortion as human rights abuses in its reports.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 20:55:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y5I3BLOUTNMC3G6D6XSL5VMT5A.jpg?auth=632ba7031097c6c46508a162d44dd357b2023175c672a64b8068429ecec35f9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela moves to open up oil sector to private investors as US ties thaw</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260122-venezuela-moves-to-open-up-oil-sector-to-private-investors-as-us-ties-thaw</link><description>Venezuelan lawmakers on Thursday gave their initial backing to plans to throw open the oil sector to private investors, paving the way for the return of US energy majors – a key demand of President Donald Trump .

Less than three weeks after the US ouster of Nicolas Maduro , MPs endorsed on first reading a bill allowing private companies to independently engage in oil exploration and extraction.

If adopted on a second reading, the bill would roll back decades of state controls over Venezuela's oil sector, which were tightened by Maduro's late mentor, socialist firebrand Hugo Chavez , in the mid-2000s.

The bill has been promoted by Maduro's former deputy, acting president Delcy Rodriguez , who has overseen a lightning-fast thaw in ties with Washington since taking the helm.

In another sign of the speed of the changes unfolding in Caracas, the United States confirmed Thursday it had named a new head for its mission in Venezuela.

The US embassy page listed Laura F. Dogu – a former ambassador to Nicaragua and Honduras – as the new charge d'affaires to Venezuela, in what was seen as another step towards the restoration of full diplomatic ties.

Caracas and Washington severed relations after Maduro's widely disputed claim to reelection in 2019.

The US embassy has been mostly deserted since then.

Within days of Maduro's January 3 capture in Caracas, US diplomats travelled to the Venezuelan capital to discuss reopening the embassy.

Dogu will work from Bogota in neighboring Colombia until the mission is operational.

Trump has boasted that he is working "really well" with Rodriguez, who was vice president in Maduro's rabidly anti-US government.

On Wednesday a senior US official said Rodriguez would soon visit the United States, despite still being under US sanctions.

Maduro was toppled after a months-long US pressure campaign and flown to New York with his wife to face trial on drug trafficking charges.

Trump claims Washington now effectively runs Venezuela and controls its oil industry.

Rodriguez has appeared ready to comply so far.

This week she ploughed $300 million from a US-brokered oil sale into propping up the ailing national currency, the bolivar.

The mere anticipation of the injection drove down the price of dollars, the currency in which many Venezuelans conduct their business.

But economists warned that true relief from spiralling prices would require a sustained influx of dollars -- which in turns requires foreign investment.

Venezuela has the world's largest proven reserves of oil.

The energy reform bill before parliament ends a Chavez-era requirement for private companies to form joint ventures with state-owned oil firm PDVSA, which insisted on holding a majority.

The law also makes the royalties regime more flexible, based on the success of the oil exploration project.

Rodriguez was petroleum minister under Maduro, a position she still holds.

To win the support of both Venezuelans and Washington, she needs to quickly show improvements in the economy and signal an end to a decade of worsening repression under Maduro.

In the past two weeks, her government has slowly freed dozens of political prisoners from the hundreds behind bars.

On Thursday, authorities released the son-in-law of opposition figure Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia , who was serving a 30-year sentence on terrorism charges.

Gonzalez Urrutia, in exile in Spain , is widely considered the rightful winner of Venezuela's 2024 presidential election, which Maduro professed to win.

His son-in-law Rafael Tudares was arrested by masked men in January 2025 while on his way to school with his two children.

Since Maduro's ouster Trump has ramped up pressure on another Latin American arch-foe, communist Cuba , a longtime Venezuela ally.

Trump has vowed to cut off all oil supplies to Cuba, which has relied for years on heavily-subsidized Venezuelan oil and cash to remain afloat.

Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said Thursday he spoke by telephone with Rodriguez to express his "support and solidarity."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:24:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a61c6c42-f7d6-11f0-9217-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-22T191336Z-1355770464-RC26FCAS6DK8-RTRMADP-3-VENEZUELA-ASSEMBLY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US urges nations to repatriate their citizens from Iraqi facilities with ISIS members</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-urges-nations-repatriate-their-citizens-iraqi-facilities-with-isis-members-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Thursday that Washington welcomed Iraq's initiative to detain Islamic State members in secure facilities in Iraq while also urging nations to repatriate their citizens in these facilities "to face justice."

"The United States welcomes the Government of Iraq's initiative to detain ISIS terrorists in secure facilities in Iraq, following recent instability in northeast Syria," Rubio said in a statement.

"Non-Iraqi terrorists will be in Iraq temporarily; the United States urges countries to take responsibility and repatriate their citizens in these facilities to face justice."

Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council said on Thursday it would begin legal proceedings against Islamic State detainees transferred from Syria, a day after the U.S. military announced its forces had transferred 150 of the suspected militants from Syria to Iraq.

The U.S. military has said its operation could eventually see 7,000 detainees moved out of Syria.

The United Nations said it was taking management responsibility for vast camps in Syria housing tens of thousands of women and children associated with the Islamic State, after the rapid collapse of Kurdish-led forces who guarded them for years.

Iraq has begun taking in detainees transferred from prisons in Syria as the Kurds retreat, and has called on other countries to help take them in.

"This is a critical part of a long-term framework to prevent an ISIS resurgence, in line with proper burden sharing among Coalition members," Rubio said on Thursday.

More than 10,000 members of the Islamic State, and tens of thousands of women and children associated with them, have been held for years in about a dozen prisons and detention camps guarded by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Syria's northeast.

The SDF has rapidly retreated this week after clashes with Syrian government forces, raising concern about security at prisons and humanitarian conditions at the camps.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:47:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CDHPFLQYWBO2DBV4IPRB4GUSOE.jpg?auth=91c03884d99748a8ba6b0f609aab201337a2235757c43126d0f14b4b01703afe&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Putin meets three US envoys for late-night talks on Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-meets-us-envoys-late-night-talks-ukraine-2026-01-22/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin began a meeting with three U.S. envoys late on Thursday to discuss a plan to end the war in Ukraine, the Kremlin said.

Americans Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were accompanied by Josh Gruenbaum, newly appointed by President Donald Trump as a senior adviser to his Board of Peace, which is tasked with ending international conflicts.

Putin greeted the Americans shortly before midnight in Moscow after Trump said a deal was "reasonably close" and Witkoff said negotiations had come down to one last issue.

Minutes after the talks began, Russia said it had carried out a patrol of strategic bomber planes - something it regularly does as a show of strength and deterrence.

The defence ministry said the Tu-22M3 bombers - part of a long-range fleet that Russia has used throughout the war to fire missiles at Ukrainian cities, military targets and energy infrastructure - flew for more than five hours over the Baltic Sea, escorted by Russian fighter jets.

The Kremlin said Putin was joined, as at previous meetings with the U.S. side, by his foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov and special envoy Kirill Dmitriev.

A brief video clip showed Putin shaking hands with the three Americans and inviting them to take their seats at a long oval table.

Trump has pressed hard over the past year for an end to the nearly four-year conflict, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two. He said on Wednesday that Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would be "stupid" if they failed to come together and get a deal done.

Witkoff did not name the main outstanding problem, but all sides have previously highlighted the issue of territory.

In particular, Putin has demanded that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of the eastern region of Donetsk . Zelenskiy has refused to give up land that Ukraine has successfully defended at great cost through years of grinding, attritional warfare.

Russia also demands that Ukraine renounce its ambition to join NATO, and rejects any presence of NATO troops on Ukrainian soil following a peace deal.

Witkoff and Kushner flew in from Davos, Switzerland, where they met Ukrainian officials this week, and Trump met Zelenskiy on Thursday.

Zelenskiy said after the meeting that the terms of security guarantees for Ukraine had been finalised , but that the issue of territory remained unsolved.

Ukraine is enduring its harshest winter of the war as Russia mounts heavy missile and drone strikes on its energy infrastructure. With temperatures way below freezing, hundreds of thousands of people in Kyiv and other cities have suffered long power cuts and been left without heating.

In what he called a positive sign, Zelenskiy said negotiators from Russia, Ukraine and the U.S. would hold trilateral meetings for the first time in Abu Dhabi on Friday and Saturday.

He also said a deal was almost ready on economic recovery after the war with Russia, a key element of Ukrainian-backed proposals to push back on an earlier U.S. peace plan seen as heavily favouring Moscow.

Trump, when asked what message he had for Putin, replied: "The war has to end."</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 21:47:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NUU5GV7C4FKQTPZXQ5577BN4TE.jpg?auth=4a43002e507a321df62a7698b58c6efb56e4c644a6e1221cc7f9500f1bc68666&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to complete transfer of Islamic State detainees from Syria to Iraq in coming days, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-complete-transfer-islamic-state-detainees-syria-iraq-coming-days-official-2026-01-22/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The U.S. military expects to complete the transfer of up to 7,000 Islamic State detainees from Syrian prisons to Iraq in the coming days, a U.S. official told Reuters on Thursday, saying hundreds would be moving across the border daily.

The U.S. military's Central Command said on Wednesday its forces had transferred 150 Islamic State detainees from a detention facility in Syria's Hasaka province to Iraq, citing the need to guard against any prison breakout.

The transfers are taking place after the rapid collapse of Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria triggered concerns over prison security following Tuesday's escape of roughly 200 low-level Islamic State fighters from Syria's Shaddadi prison. Syrian government forces recaptured many of them.

The U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. transfers prioritized "the most dangerous" Islamic State fighters and noted that they were citizens of many different countries, including in Europe.

Iraqi legal sources said the IS detainees sent from Syria so far include a mix of nationalities, with Iraqis making up the largest group, alongside Arab fighters from other countries and nationals of Britain, Belgium, France, Germany and Sweden.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday applauded Iraq for taking the prisoners.

"Non-Iraqi terrorists will be in Iraq temporarily; the United States urges countries to take responsibility and repatriate their citizens in these facilities to face justice," Rubio said in a statement.

Islamic State emerged in Iraq and Syria, and at the height of its power from 2014-2017 held swathes of the two countries, ruling over millions of people. Its "caliphate" eventually collapsed after military campaigns by regional governments and a U.S.-led coalition.

The prisons that the Islamic State members are being transferred from are located in northeast Syria's Hasaka province, where the Syrian Democratic Forces had been working closely with the United States for years to secure them.

The U.S. had been a backer of the SDF since 2015, when the force was conceived to expel the Islamic State group from Syria's northeast. The SDF later used that territory to establish an autonomous enclave, with separate civilian and military institutions.

But in late 2024, President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rebel forces ousted longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad and pledged to bring all of Syria under the new government's control, including SDF-run areas.

The Syrian government has recently seized swathes of northern and eastern Syria from Kurdish forces, consolidating Sharaa's rule, in a rapid turn of events that has brought almost all of Syria back under the authority of the Damascus-based state.

The United States has about 1,000 troops in Syria but has long mulled exiting.

With Assad toppled, U.S. President Donald Trump has developed close ties to Sharaa, lifting sanctions and welcoming Syria into an international anti-Islamic State coalition.

U.S. envoy Tom Barrack said on Tuesday the original purpose of the SDF had largely expired, and that the U.S. had no long-term interest in retaining its presence in Syria.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:23:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In Davos, African president pitches business deals to Trump’s son Eric</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/davos-african-president-pitches-business-deals-trumps-son-eric-2026-01-22/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 22 (Reuters) - The president of Somaliland was at the World Economic Forum this week to win international recognition for his country and pitch investment opportunities in the East African nation.

One of his main meetings, according to an aide, was with Eric Trump, son of the U.S. president Donald Trump and a leading executive of the Trump family’s sprawling business spanning from real estate to crypto .

On Wednesday, while Donald Trump was delivering a speech to an international audience of chief executives at the Davos forum, the Somaliland president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, met with Eric Trump in a nearby hotel conference room.

Also attending the meeting was Israel’s president, Isaac Herzog, whose country recognized Somaliland last month —a first by any United Nations member.

During the closed-door meeting, Abdullahi outlined investment opportunities in Somaliland, notably the country’s strategic deep-sea port of Berbera, which sits along one of the world’s busiest shipping routes, according to two people present.

“The meeting went well, it went very well,” the Somaliland president told Reuters on Thursday, confirming his meeting with both Eric Trump and Herzog.

A spokeswoman for Eric Trump did not respond to a message seeking comment.

In a post on X that did not mention Eric Trump, Herzog said he had been pleased to meet with his Somaliland counterpart in the Swiss resort.

During Trump's first term, the family’s self-imposed ethical guidelines prohibited them from seeking new business outside the U.S. Yet, days before his second inauguration, the Trump Organization, as the family business is known, released revised guidelines that jettisoned that constraint.

The White House did not respond to a message seeking comment.

The House voted 215 to 215, a tie that defeated the resolution which "directs the President to remove United States Armed Forces from Venezuela, unless explicitly authorized by a declaration of war or specific statutory authorization for use of military force."

The close vote reflected concern in Congress, including from a handful of Republicans, over Trump's foreign policy. There is growing support for the argument that Congress, not the president, should have the power to send U.S. troops to war, as spelled out in the U.S. Constitution.

Opponents of the resolution had argued that it was unnecessary because the U.S. does not currently have troops on the ground in Venezuela.

"We do not have anybody there in Venezuela fighting," Republican Representative Brian Mast of Florida said in debate before the vote.

Trump's Republicans also accused Democrats of introducing the legislation only as an attack on Trump. "It's about spite," Mast, the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said. "You will condemn him no matter what he does."

Backers disagreed, saying they wanted to keep Trump from pulling the U.S. into another "forever war," after decades fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.

"The American people want us to lower their cost of living, not enable war," said Representative Gregory Meeks of New York, the top Democrat on the foreign affairs panel.

U.S. forces swept into Caracas on January 3 and captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro . A large flotilla of U.S. ships is blockading Venezuela, and has spent months firing on boats in the southern Caribbean and Pacific.

Trump recently has said the U.S. will run Venezuela for years, told Iranians protesting against their government that "help is on the way" and threatened military action to take Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.

Some Democrats also denounced Trump for leaving most of Maduro's government in place in Caracas and failing to present a plan for Venezuela after his removal.

"The machinery of repression was left in place and the Democratic hopes of Venezuelans are being left behind," said Democrat Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida.

Recent votes on war powers have been very close, with the measure failing in the Senate last week only because Vice President JD Vance came to the Capitol to break a tie.

"If the president is contemplating further military action, then he has a moral and constitutional obligation to come here and get our approval," said Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, a lead sponsor of the House resolution.

The Trump administration argues that Maduro's capture was a very limited judicial operation to bring him to trial in the U.S. on drug charges, not a military operation.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:51:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UX3QAAAHGJJBZHCSK7PWZMRO64.jpg?auth=626eb0a3befe921d18e9629305b004cdb954642b2a5fb5e2414c26910c3232dc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand continues hunt for victims at campground hit by landslide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/new-zealand-continues-hunt-victims-campground-hit-by-landslide-2026-01-22/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - New Zealand emergency crews continued to search on Friday for victims of a landslide that ripped through a busy campground on the country's North Island the day before due to heavy rains.

The landslide hit Mount Maunganui on the island's east coast at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday (2030 GMT Wednesday), bringing soil and rubble down on the busy campsite.

Police reported that as many as nine people may be missing including children. Families enjoying the summer school holiday were among the campers. Recreational vehicles and at least one structure were crushed, images showed.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon was due to visit areas hit by recent flooding on Friday.

Local Mayor Mahe Drysdale told Radio New Zealand that while search-and-rescue teams had continued at the campground through the night, there had been no progress in finding missing people.

“That's really hard, and we're here with the families and as you can imagine, just that uncertainty of where they are and when we might have a result is pretty hard,” Drysdale said.

He said the area remained unstable. Emergency Management and Recovery Minister Mark Mitchell told Radio New Zealand it was a challenging and difficult environment.

He said police were checking if some campers may have left without informing authorities.

The landslide happened after heavy rains soaked much of the North Island’s east coast earlier this week and caused widespread damage. A landslide in the neighbouring town of Papamoa killed two on Thursday, and a man was washed away with his vehicle north of Auckland on Wednesday.

Roads remained closed in some of the worst-hit areas, making some North Island towns inaccessible by land. The civil defence organization in Tairawhiti District said in a social media post that people were walking over landslides to collect water and food from welfare hubs and warned against this due to fears of further landslides.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 22:51:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y4PN2KWE7FOH7G54CKYVGU5DZU.jpg?auth=b75cff5301401b2a86e6db67fb81dad203ba41ac1a71c1bc11aee7c1ee89ce08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian forces hit two localities in southeast Ukraine, killing one</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-forces-hit-two-localities-southeast-ukraine-killing-one-2026-01-22/</link><description>Jan 22 (Reuters) - Russian forces launched attacks on two localities in southeastern Ukraine on Thursday, killing one person and injuring more than 20, local officials said.

The governor of Zaporizhzhia region said in a Telegram post that Russian forces launched four strikes on the town of Komyshuvakha, killing one person and injuring 10. Several private homes were damaged in the attack on the town, east of the region's main city, also called Zaporizhzhia.

In the industrial city of Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's home town in Dnipropetrovsk region, a combined drone and missile attack injured 13 people, including four children, Oleksandr Vilkul, head of the city's military administration, said on Telegram.

The attacks hit apartment buildings, schools and critical infrastructure.

"The main thing is everyone is alive," Vilkul wrote. "Six people are in hospital, including three children."

Reuters could not independently confirm the attacks had taken place and Russian officials made no comment.</description><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jan 2026 23:24:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump eases Greenland tensions as Europe braces for what's next</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260123-trump-greenland-europe</link><description>One crisis defused, how long until the next one? European leaders huddled for summit talks Thursday exuding relief at Donald Trump's climbdown on Greenland -- but already steeling themselves for the next jolt from the mercurial US leader.

Trump's threats over the vast Arctic island -- an autonomous territory of NATO member Denmark -- plunged relations between Europe and its key ally Washington to a historic low.

While the immediate danger appeared to recede after Trump struck a "framework" agreement with NATO chief Mark Rutte, the bloc maintained a meeting called to address the crisis -- and how to handle the US leader going forward.

It was still unclear what exactly prompted Trump's U-turn, but French President Emmanuel Macron insisted a push to unleash the European Union's trade arsenal against the United States played a part -- and said Europe remains "extremely vigilant".

Addressing a news conference after the summit, European Council chief Antonio Costa vowed the bloc "will continue to stand up for its interests" and defend itself "against any form of coercion."

"It has the power and the tools to do so, and will do so if and when necessary."

Trump backed down Wednesday night both on threatening to seize Greenland by force and on imposing tariffs against European allies, touting a "framework" agreement that would give Washington "everything we wanted".

Costa described the about-turn on tariffs as "positive" and called for the trade deal agreed with Washington last summer -- which senior European lawmakers had vowed to block in response to US threats -- to be fully rolled out.

"The goal remains the effective stabilisation of the trade relations between the European Union and the US," Costa said, summing up what EU leaders concluded during the evening talks.

NATO's Rutte appeared to have pulled off a diplomatic coup by talking Trump down from his demands -- but swirling questions remained about their purported deal, and what might follow.

Details remain scant, with Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen saying he did not know what had been agreed.

But a source familiar with the talks told AFP the United States and Denmark would renegotiate a 1951 defence pact on Greenland.

In Brussels, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen told reporters the matter of Denmark's sovereignty was off the table, but that Copenhagen was open to discussing the pact with the United States.

She also said NATO states backed having a "permanent presence" in the Arctic, including around Greenland.

The Danish leader -- who has maintained close contact with Rutte -- was to meet the NATO chief for a debrief Friday morning in Brussels.

Europe has struggled to set red lines as its once-close American ally has turned hostile under Trump -- to the point of threatening its sovereignty.

"You know we're only a tweet away from the next crisis," summed up one EU diplomat.

Greenland is only part of the picture, as Trump wages a broader attack on the EU's laws, politics and values, zig-zags on the Ukraine conflict, or pushes a self-styled "Board of Peace" after a year of tearing down global norms.

EU leaders had "serious doubts about a number of elements" of the latter initiative, including its scope, governance and compatibility with the UN Charter, Costa said.

Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said the importance of preserving transatlantic ties was "absolutely obvious" for all Europeans.

"But what we need today in our politics is trust and respect among all partners, not domination, and for sure, not coercion," he said.

The continent is ramping up defence spending to break its security reliance on the United States -- but for now, it still needs US help to end the Ukraine war, and deter the looming Russian threat to its east.

With a transatlantic clash over Greenland at least temporarily defused, the EU's top diplomat Kaja Kallas said it was "important to focus back on where the problems really lie -- and this is the war in Ukraine."

But as leaders met in Brussels, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky aimed a brutal warning at the bloc, saying Trump "will not listen to this kind of Europe" unless it steps up to become "a truly global power."</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 01:49:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/247c6f48-f704-11f0-a5c0-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021671953132.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain train crash death toll rises to 45 after two more bodies found</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260123-spain-train-collision-death-toll-45</link><description>Spanish investigators on Thursday found two more bodies in the wreckage of a high-speed train involved in a devastating collision last weekend, taking the death toll to 45.

Deadly back-to-back rail accidents just days apart have raised doubts about the safety of train travel in the European Union' s fourth-largest economy, a top tourist destination boasting the world's second-largest high-speed network.

Spain observed three days of national mourning after Sunday's collision involving two high-speed trains in the southern region of Andalusia -- the country's deadliest rail accident in more than a decade.

An Andalusia emergency services spokesman told AFP two bodies had been recovered from the train operated by state company Renfe, which smashed into another service by private firm Iryo that had derailed and crossed onto its track.

"In theory, they are the two people" yet to be recovered from a total of 45 reported as missing following the disaster, which also injured more than 120, the spokesman said.

Rescuers found the two bodies after conducting a "more thorough" search of two carriages that "were in a severely deteriorated condition", the head of the Civil Guard's investigative unit, Fernando Dominguez, told a news conference.

Of those 45 people, all are Spanish apart from three women from Morocco, Russia and Germany, according to the latest update from a body set up to coordinate the identification work.

Spain is searching for answers to what the transport minister has called an "extremely strange" disaster, which happened on a recently renovated stretch of straight, flat track and involved a modern Iryo train.

On Tuesday, a train driver died and 37 people were injured when a commuter service hit a retaining wall that fell onto the tracks near Barcelona in the northeastern region of Catalonia.

The second accident, believed to have been a consequence of recent heavy rainfall, prompted the suspension on Wednesday of all of the wealthy region's main Rodalies commuter network, used by hundreds of thousands of people, while safety checks were carried out.

Rodalies services were expected to resume on Thursday but remained suspended as only six of 140 drivers reported for work, said Catalan regional government spokeswoman Silvia Paneque.

Service will resume after inspections involving the drivers, she said, with no date set.

The secretary general of the Semaf train driver union, Diego Martin Fernandez, told RAC 1 radio that a thorough review of infrastructure had been agreed but that "the procedure had not been respected".

"To restore confidence that the infrastructure meets safety conditions, we need guarantees," he said, denouncing fresh landslips on the lines.

Semaf has called a national strike for February 9 to 11, denouncing repeated safety failings.

Transport Minister Oscar Puente vowed to negotiate to have the strike called off and said the two tragedies were unrelated, defending the public transport system.

The list of incidents grew on Thursday after a commuter train in the southeastern region of Murcia hit a crane mounted on a truck, causing six light injuries.

Murcia emergency services said the victims were taken to hospital after the accident in the municipality of Alumbres, where the train did not derail.

The mayor of the nearby city of Cartagena, Noelia Arroyo, wrote on social media that the electricity company truck was working on cables belonging to a building next to the track.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 01:49:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/10e807e8-f6ce-11f0-8b48-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26020429259995-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan offers talks with Ukraine on weapons sanctions-busting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-offers-talks-with-ukraine-weapons-sanctions-busting-2026-01-23/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Taiwan President Lai Ching-te on Friday offered talks with Ukraine to crack down on sanctions-busting after Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskiy name-checked the island as a source of illicit missile components.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, semiconductor powerhouse Taiwan has successively updated export controls to stop high-tech goods being used for military purposes, and has joined in wide-ranging Western-led sanctions against Moscow.

Speaking in Davos on Thursday, Zelenskiy said Russia would not be able to produce missiles without "critical components sourced from China, Europe, the United States, and Taiwan", showed excerpts published on the Ukraine president's website.

Responding on his X account in English, Lai said Taiwan has long worked with global partners to "staunchly support Ukraine through humanitarian aid &amp; coordinated sanctions".

"We welcome further exchanges of information with President @ZelenskyyUa to further clamp down on illegal 3rd country transshipment &amp; concealed end-use," he said, posting a picture of orchids in the colour of Ukraine's flag.

Lai said "there have been young Taiwanese who have sacrificed their lives to defend freedom in Ukraine," referring to volunteer soldiers who have died fighting against Russia.

"We remain clear: any assistance to the aggressor or violations of int'l embargoes &amp; export control regulations are unacceptable. We pray for peace to be restored to Ukraine soon."

Speaking to reporters in Taipei later on Friday, Lai said he welcomed Zelenskiy to pass on any information to Taiwan about sanctions busting.

"We are willing to strengthen controls on goods that are routed through third countries while concealing their final destination, to prevent them from entering Russia and to protect Ukraine," Lai added.

Reuters could not reach the Ukraine presidential office for comment outside of office hours.

In November, Taiwan said it was revising export controls to comply with the Wassenaar Arrangement, an international agreement aimed at preventing weapons proliferation, though diplomatically isolated Taiwan is not a signatory.

While senior Taiwan officials have spoken directly with some Ukrainian city mayors, there has been no publicly acknowledged direct contact between the two governments.

Taiwan and Ukraine do not have de facto embassies in each other's capitals, and Taiwanese humanitarian aid to Ukraine has mostly been coordinated by Taiwan's diplomatic offices in central and eastern Europe.

Taiwan has compared the Russian invasion of Ukraine to China's military threat against an island it claims as its own. Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims.

Late last year, a senior Taiwanese military officer told a forum in Poland that if Russia defeats Ukraine it would embolden China in its behaviour towards Taiwan and that Taipei hoped Kyiv emerged victorious.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 03:44:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5425YUFTENKQBG7WGKZHER7FHQ.jpg?auth=c15a44c62d88d53bd890cb9879fd098f316a34141e21e616c95f22c8abab0046&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump revokes Canada's invitation to join Board of Peace</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-he-is-withdrawing-canadas-invitation-board-peace-2026-01-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON/OTTAWA, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew on Thursday an invitation for Canada to join his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving global conflicts.

Trump's aboutface follows Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he openly decried powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.

"Please let this Letter serve to represent that the Board of Peace is withdrawing its invitation to you regarding Canada’s joining, what will be, the most prestigious Board of Leaders ever assembled, at any time," Trump wrote in a Truth Social post directed at Carney.

Neither Carney's office nor the White House immediately responded to Reuters requests for comment on Thursday evening.

Last week, Carney's office said he had been invited to serve on the board and planned to accept.

Carney received a rare standing ovation in Davos after the speech, in which he urged nations to accept the end of a rules-based global order.

Canada, which recently signed a trade deal with China, can show how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimized by American hegemony, he added.

Trump retorted that Canada "lives because of the United States," and told listeners in Davos that Carney should be grateful for the United States’ previous largesse.

"Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," he added, addressing Carney directly.

The withdrawal of Canada's invitation came hours after Trump officially launched the board, which was initially meant to cement a Gaza ceasefire .

Permanent members must help fund the board with a payment of $1 billion each, according to Trump.

"Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do," Trump said in Switzerland on Thursday. "And we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations.

The board's establishment was endorsed by a United Nations Security Council resolution as part of Trump's Gaza peace plan, and U.N. spokesperson Rolando Gomez said on Thursday that U.N. engagement with the board would only be in that context.

Member nations include Argentina, Bahrain, Morocco, Pakistan and Turkey. Other U.S. allies, such as Britain, France and Italy, have indicated they will not join for now.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 03:44:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QTNMFNVLLVKIHKK5REGZSMJ3NY.jpg?auth=999c9747fcbacd3fe8e10151f5339f7f7cb729ebfcc7c1c48d7ac293c3a496e1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China coast guard says it rescued Philippine crew near Scarborough Shoal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-coast-guard-says-it-rescued-philippine-crew-near-scarborough-shoal-2026-01-23/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The Chinese Coast Guard said on Friday it dispatched two vessels to rescue 21 Philippine crew members in a foreign cargo ship that capsized in waters near the Scarborough Shoal.

Trump has repeatedly left open the option of new military action against Iran after Washington backed and joined Israel's 12-day war in June aimed at degrading Iranian nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.

Trump said Thursday a US naval "armada" was heading toward the Gulf, adding: "We're watching Iran."

A fortnight of protests starting in late December shook Iran's clerical leadership under supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but the movement has petered out in the face of a crackdown that activists say killed thousands, accompanied by an unprecedented internet blackout.

The prospect of immediate American action against Tehran appears to have receded, with both sides insisting on giving diplomacy a chance.

On his way back from the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump told reporters on Air Force One the United States was sending a "massive fleet" toward Iran "just in case."

"I'd rather not see anything happen but we're watching them very closely," he added.

In a standoff marked by seesawing rhetoric, Trump had on Tuesday warned Iran's leaders the United States would "wipe them off the face of this Earth" if there was any attack on his life in response to a strike targeting Khamenei.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian in a speech Thursday accused the United States and Israel of stoking the protests as a "cowardly revenge... for the defeat in the 12-Day War".

Guards commander General Mohammad Pakpour warned Israel and the United States "to avoid any miscalculations, by learning from historical experiences and what they learned in the 12-day imposed war, so that they do not face a more painful and regrettable fate".

"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and dear Iran have their finger on the trigger, more prepared than ever, ready to carry out the orders and measures of the supreme commander-in-chief," he said.

Pakpour's comments came in a written statement quoted by state television marking the national day in Iran to celebrate the Guards, whose mission is to protect the 1979 Islamic revolution from internal and external threats.

Activists accuse the Guards of playing a frontline role in the deadly crackdown on protests.

The group is sanctioned as a terrorist entity by countries including Australia, Canada and the United States, and campaigners have long urged similar moves from the EU and UK.

Another senior military figure, General Ali Abdollahi Aliabadi who leads the Iranian joint command headquarters, meanwhile warned that if America attacked, "all US interests, bases and centres of influence" would be "legitimate targets" for Iran's armed forces.

Giving their first official toll from the protests, Iranian authorities on Wednesday said 3,117 people were killed.

The statement from Iran's foundation for martyrs and veterans sought to draw a distinction between "martyrs", members of security forces or innocent bystanders, and what it called US-backed "rioters".

Of its toll of 3,117, it said 2,427 people were "martyrs".

Pezeshkian said Thursday that protest "is the natural right of citizens", but a distinction had to be drawn between protesters "whose hands are stained with the blood of innocent people".

However, rights groups say the heavy toll was caused by security forces firing directly on protesters and that the actual number of dead could be far higher, even more than 20,000.

Efforts to confirm the scale of the toll have been hampered by the national internet shutdown, with monitor Netblocks saying Thursday the blackout had surpassed "two full weeks".

"All the evidence gradually emerging from inside Iran shows that the real number of people killed in the protests is far higher than the official figure," said the director of the Iran Human Rights NGO Mahmood Amiry-Moghaddam, saying the authorities' toll has "no credibility whatsoever".

Warning that their own current tolls do not reflect the true number of fatalities, IHR says it has verified at least 3,428 killings. Another NGO, US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), has documented 4,902 deaths.

According to HRANA, at least 26,541 people have been arrested.

The alleged perpetrator did not have a gun licence and was on bail for domestic violence offences when the attack happened, New South Wales police western region Commander Andrew Holland told reporters.

"We don't know how the weapon came into the possession of the gunman ... that will form part of the investigation," Holland said.

A 19-year-old man was also injured in the attack on Thursday in the town of Lake Cargelligo, around 610 km (380 miles) west of Sydney, and he was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition, police said.

Australian media reported one of the victims was a 25-year-old woman, who was about seven months pregnant.

An extensive search was underway in Lake Cargelligo, with a population of just over 1,000, with specialist personnel joining the search, police said.

The shooting comes a month after two gunmen opened fire at an event on Bondi Beach celebrating the Jewish festival of Hanukkah, killing 15 people in Australia's worst mass shooting in nearly three decades.

In response to that attack, Australia's parliament passed new laws on Tuesday enabling a national gun buyback scheme and tougher background checks for firearm licences.

New South Wales, which has the highest number of firearms of any Australian state, has also introduced laws limiting individuals to owning no more than four guns and requiring licence holders to be members of a gun club.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 04:44:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea repatriates 73 scam suspects from Cambodia in $33 mln online fraud probe</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-repatriates-73-online-scam-suspects-cambodia-yonhap-news-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>INCHEON, South Korea, Jan 23 (Reuters) - South Korea has repatriated 73 people suspected of involvement in online scam operations in Cambodia and will question them over allegations they had defrauded more than 800 South Koreans of about $33 million, officials said.

The plane carrying the suspects, the largest such group to be returned so far, landed at Incheon International Airport on Friday.

Footage from South Korean broadcasters showed the suspected scammers, wearing masks and mostly clad in shorts and sandals, being escorted by police from the plane to a waiting bus.

"It's a big mistake if you think you can evade punishment if you commit a crime outside the country," a South Korean police official told a briefing at the airport.

"We will pursue crimes that harm our citizens to the end and demand that they take responsibility."

A foreign ministry official told the briefing that South Korea would continue to cooperate with Cambodia "until transnational scam crimes were eradicated".

The return of the group follows a joint investigation by both nations, a spokesperson for the Korean presidential office, Kang Yu-jung, told a separate briefing on Thursday.

Investigators uncovered seven scam centres, where the suspects are accused of defrauding 869 South Koreans of 49 billion won ($33 million) online, Kang said.

Among the suspects are a couple accused of extorting about 12 billion won from 104 South Koreans using deepfake technology to disguise their identities in romance scams, she said.

The couple are believed to have undertaken plastic surgery in a bid to avoid being traced by police, she added.

Another suspect is accused of being involved in extorting 19.4 billion won from retirees and entry-level employees by pretending to be a professional investor, according to the presidential office.

Cambodian authorities could not immediately be reached for comment.

In October, a group of 64 South Koreans was returned home over suspected scams, following the alleged murder of a South Korean college student tortured in Cambodia in August in a case linked to an employment scam.

The ATR 42-500 turboprop owned by aviation group Indonesia Air Transport (IAT) lost contact with air traffic control on Saturday at about 1:30 p.m. local time (0530 GMT) around the Maros region in South Sulawesi.

There were seven crew members and three passengers on board the plane, which was chartered by Indonesia's Marine Affairs and Fisheries Ministry to conduct air surveillance on its fisheries. The passengers were ministry staff members.

Andi Sultan, an official at South Sulawesi's rescue agency, said through tears during a video statement that authorities found the ninth and tenth bodies early on Friday, adding that the evacuation process was still ongoing.

The agency said separately on its Instagram account that 10 victims have been found.

Local rescuers previously discovered the wreckage of the plane in different locations around Mount Bulusaraung in the Maros region, about 1,500 km (930 miles) northeast of the sprawling island nation's capital, Jakarta.

Indonesia's National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT), which probes transport accidents, is currently investigating the contents of the recently-found black box, its chief told local media this week.

Diplomatic efforts to end Europe's deadliest conflict since World War II have gained pace in recent months, though Moscow and Kyiv remain at odds over the key issue of territory in a post-war settlement.

US negotiators, led by envoy Steve Witkoff, talked with the Russian leader in Moscow into the early hours of Friday, according to a Kremlin statement.

Kremlin diplomatic adviser Yuri Ushakov told reporters their discussions had been "useful in every respect".

Witkoff and the US team are next flying to Abu Dhabi, where talks are expected to continue.

A Russian delegation, headed by General Igor Kostyukov, director of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, will also head there "in the coming hours", according to Ushakov.

"It was agreed that the first meeting of a trilateral working group on security issues will take place today in Abu Dhabi," Ushakov added.

"We are genuinely interested in resolving (the conflict) through political and diplomatic means," he said, but added: "Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives... on the battlefield."

Witkoff previously said he believed the two sides were "down to one issue", without elaborating.

Video published by the Kremlin showed a smiling Putin shaking hands with Witkoff, US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House advisor Josh Gruenbaum.

The high-stakes meeting came just hours after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a draft deal was "nearly, nearly ready" and that he and Trump had agreed on the issue of post-war security guarantees.

He also said the UK and France had already committed to forces on the ground.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country's eastern Donbas region as part of a deal.

But Kyiv has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and says it will not sign a peace deal that fails to deter Russia from launching a renewed assault.

The full details of the upcoming talks in the United Arab Emirates have not been released, and it is not clear whether the Russian and Ukrainian officials will meet face-to-face.

Zelensky said these talks would last two days.

Trump repeated on Wednesday his oft-stated belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.

"I believe they're at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don't, they're stupid -- that goes for both of them," he said after delivering a speech at Davos.

Zelensky, at his address in Davos, blasted the EU's lack of "political will" in countering Putin in a fiery address.

"Instead of becoming a truly global power, Europe remains a beautiful but fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers," he said.

Trump's dramatic foreign policy pivots including a recent bid to take over Greenland -- an autonomous Danish territory -- have stirred worries in Europe about whether Washington can be trusted as a reliable security partner.

In his speech, Zelensky criticised Europe for pinning hopes on the United States defending them in case of aggression.

"Europe looks lost trying to convince the US President to change," Zelensky said.

Russian strikes this week have left most of Kyiv without electricity, with residents of 4,000 buildings without heat in sub-zero temperatures.

Russia, which launched its Ukraine offensive in February 2022, says its strikes are aimed at energy infrastructure fuelling Ukraine's "military-industrial complex".

Kyiv says the strikes are a war crime designed to wear down its civilian population into submission.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 04:46:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4edaf2be-f80d-11f0-bf95-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26022757953996.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran warns 'finger on trigger' as Donald Trump says talks still possible</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260123-iran-warns-finger-on-trigger-as-donald-trump-says-talks-still-possible</link><description>The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards warned Washington Thursday that the force had its "finger on the trigger" in the wake of mass protests, as US President Donald Trump said Tehran still appeared interested in talks.

In a telephone call with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Xi stressed that both countries are constructive forces in safeguarding world peace and improving global governance, the agency added.

"China is willing to remain a good friend and partner to Latin American and Caribbean countries," Xi told Lula, reiterating a long-time stance on regional ties .

It looked to advance the building of a China-Latin America community with a shared future, he added.

A 2024 strategic partnership to align China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) with Brazil's plans to boost farming, infrastructure, and the energy transition exemplifies solidarity and cooperation among Global South countries, Xi said.

At a Group of 20 meeting that year Xi unveiled measures related to the BRI as well as science and technology, aimed at support for the Global South.

Friday's talks came weeks after the Trump administration seized Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to be prosecuted in the United States on narcotics charges.

That threw Caracas into political uncertainty, and set its Latin America and Caribbean neighbours worrying about similar interventions by force on their turf.

How much does Venezuela owe China, and how and why was the country getting debt payments after Venezuela's default?

Data on Venezuela's debt is sketchy, particularly since 2017 when U.S. sanctions triggered a sovereign default .

AidData, ‌a research lab at the U.S. university William &amp; Mary which tracks lending, estimated that official sector Chinese creditors extended loan commitments worth $106 billion to Venezuela between 2000 and 2018. Separately, they calculated that there was $44 billion outstanding in 2017.

Current estimates vary. Societe Generale puts the value of Venezuela's outstanding debt to China at roughly $10 billion - a figure AidData's Brad Parks said was consistent with their understanding. JP Morgan estimates ‌total obligations of $13 billion to $15 billion.

Parks said it was unclear whether Venezuela had repaid any of the ​principal of the outstanding loans since the 2017 default or had only been making interest payments.

Sources at state oil firm PDVSA said China granted Venezuela a grace period for the capital payments in 2019, allowing debt service payments to be compensated for by crude ‍cargoes.

Internal PDVSA documents put crude oil and fuel oil exports to China at 642,000 barrels per day, with a small fraction of that going to debt servicing.

Venezuela has not produced comprehensive, reliable debt statistics for decades. The last figures of any sort were released by the ⁠central bank in 2019, making it tough to determine what debts are outstanding and whether the country has taken on more.

The ‍International Monetary Fund, which tracks economies, debt and development, has not produced a comprehensive "Article IV" report on Venezuela since 2004.

This has left outside observers ‌to patch ‌together information based on sourcing, public comments by Venezuelan officials and movements of crude oil exports, the country's main revenue earner.

After U.S. sanctions were imposed, Venezuela's primary allies were Russia and China.

AidData's Parks said most of Venezuela's public debts to China were contracted with China Development Bank via oil-backed lending arrangements.

Cash proceeds from some of the oil sent to ⁠China, Parks said, went into a ⁠Beijing-controlled account and on ​to service the debts - even as sanctions and default kept many other creditors from getting paid.

The United States has said it will funnel proceeds of Venezuelan oil sales into a Qatar-based account it controls , from which Washington would have to send funds to China in ‍order to keep servicing the debt.

Comments from the Trump administration have made clear this is unlikely.

China's largest state-owned oil major, CNPC, also has producing assets in Venezuela. Sinovensa - its most significant joint venture with PDVSA - pumps roughly 110,000 barrels per day. How the U.S. will handle those cargoes is unclear.

Other creditors, ​including bondholders, are pushing their case in the auction of Venezuela's most valuable foreign ‍asset - the U.S. refining company Citgo. However, its location inside the United States means China is unlikely to join the fray.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 06:38:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RX3O3RMDTFOTXO7LHX74GLH7PQ.jpg?auth=8537e31ea99efb62e64ed534318dc58e317af56a6ff1f01314852ae1c604f477&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Senior US defence official Colby to visit South Korea and Japan next week, Yonhap says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/senior-us-defence-official-colby-visit-south-korea-japan-next-week-yonhap-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for policy Elbridge Colby will visit South Korea from Sunday to Tuesday and discuss military alliance issues before travelling on to Japan, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported on Friday.

His talks with South Korean officials will likely touch on Seoul's proposed increase in defence spending and the modernisation of the two countries' military alliance, Yonhap said, citing an unnamed source.

South Korea's Defence Ministry declined to confirm the report, saying questions should be directed to the U.S. side.

Colby, the Pentagon's top defence and foreign policymaker, leads the implementation of U.S. defence strategy.

The two countries have been discussing President Donald Trump's push for U.S. allies to shoulder a greater share of their defence cost and Washington's realignment of its military footprint to ready its troops stationed around the world for wider missions.

South Korea hosts about 28,500 U.S. troops in combined defence against North Korea's military threat. Seoul raised its defence budget by 7.5% for this year.

South Korea is pursuing the construction if its own nuclear-powered submarines, a plan Trump has backed.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 07:28:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OK6H26UDTVI5JPRCWMPSJXWCFM.jpg?auth=4974853dadcc4e266d73267c16701ee20530ce2982640f15825111bbe2e86c71&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: US, Ukraine and Russia to meet in Abu Dhabi for first trilateral talks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260123-live-us-ukraine-russia-meet-abu-dhabi-first-trilateral-talks</link><description>A fire ​broke out at ⁠an oil depot in Russia’s central Penza region as ​a result ‍of debris falling from a ​downed drone, the regional governor ​said.

Klitschko added on ‍the Telegram ​messaging app that the buildings were being ‌re-connected for the ‍second time after an earlier Russian attack on January ‍9.

Russia, which occupies around 20 percent of Ukraine, is pushing for full control of the country’s eastern Donbas region as part of a deal. Kyiv, meanwhile, has warned that ceding ground will embolden Moscow and says it will not sign a peace deal that fails to deter Russia from launching a renewed assault later on.

Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators are meeting in Abu Dhabi today to hold security talks on the war in Ukraine. It is the first time the three countries hold a trilateral meeting since Russia launched its full-scale invasion nearly four years ago.

The high-stakes meeting comes just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said a draft deal was “nearly, nearly ready” and that he and US President Donald Trump had agreed on the issue of post-war security guarantees.

The US negotiating team will be headed by envoy Steve Witkoff, and the Russian side by General Igor Kostyukov, the director of Russia’s GRU military intelligence agency.

Ukraine’s delegation will be led by Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council, Rustem Umerov, and include Lieutenant General Andriy Gnatov, the chief of staff of the Ukrainian armed forces.

"We appreciate the invitation, but we decline," Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters late on Thursday after an EU summit in Brussels.

Washington says the body will help broker and monitor ceasefires, organise security arrangements and coordinate rebuilding in places emerging from war. The concept stems from Trump's Gaza peace plan.

Missing from the board's launch ceremony held at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland's Davos on Thursday were traditional U.S. allies such as Canada, Britain and all European Union members except Hungary and Bulgaria.

Sanchez cited consistency with Madrid's commitment to international law, the U.N. and multilateralism as the main reasons it was declining to participate.

Sanchez also said the Board of Peace did not include the Palestinian Authority.

Israel has joined the board, along with Middle Eastern countries such as Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 08:31:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SWXIG3RI55OPTB52ZTSVJTYDLA.jpg?auth=1045abf201d9de52b58622e1a26f94de34ede83d35ff1ac63c13f1ab793b1522&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven miners shot dead in Nigeria's restive Plateau, youth group, official say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/seven-miners-shot-dead-nigerias-restive-plateau-youth-group-official-say-2026-01-23/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Seven people were shot dead in an overnight attack at a mining site in Nigeria's central Plateau state, a local youth group and a state official said on Friday.

Plateau is one of several ethnically and religiously diverse hinterland states known as the Middle Belt, where communal conflict has claimed hundreds of lives in recent years.

The violence is often cast as ethno-religious conflict between nomadic Muslim herders and largely Christian farmers.

The Berom Youth Moulders-Association (BYM) said the victims, aged 15 to 28, had been killed late Wednesday in what it described as part of a pattern of coordinated attacks on Berom communities. Reuters could not independently confirm who was behind the assault.

Emmanuel Solomon, a senior aide to the Plateau governor, confirmed seven people had been killed in the attack.

Plateau police did not immediately comment, but a spokesperson for Operation Safe Haven, the military task force in the state, said troops had found seven bodies and spent cartridges at the scene, adding that the victims were miners who had remained at the site despite a ban on night-time mining.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said Nigerian Christians are being persecuted and killed in record numbers, and launched an airstrike a month ago against alleged perpetrators.

The Nigerian government denies that there is systematic persecution of Christians but says it is tackling Islamists and other violent groups that have attacked both Muslim and Christian civilians, often for ransom.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:31:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda detains 2,000 opposition supporters, kills 30 after disputed election, army chief says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-detains-2000-opposition-supporters-kills-30-after-disputed-election-army-2026-01-23/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Uganda's military chief said on Friday that authorities had detained 2,000 opposition supporters, killed 30 and were hunting for more following a disputed presidential election in which his father Yoweri Museveni, won a seventh term.

Museveni, 81, who has led the East African nation for nearly four decades, was declared to have resoundingly defeated Bobi Wine, leader of the opposition National Unity Platform (NUP) party in the January 15 vote, held during an internet blackout.

Wine, a former musician whose legal name is Robert Kyagulanyi, rejected the election result, alleging widespread irregularities including ballot stuffing, and went into hiding.

In a series of overnight social media posts, military chief Muhoozi Kainerugaba, Museveni's son, gave the first details of the arrests and killings of NUP supporters, describing them as hooligans and terrorists.

"So far we have killed 30 NUP terrorists," Kainerugaba said on X, without explaining the circumstances of the deaths. "Most NUP terrorist leaders are in hiding. We shall get them all," he said in another post.

The government has accused Wine's supporters of violence during the election while the opposition says its members were attacked by security forces. Reuters has not been able to authenticate the allegations.

A police spokesperson declined to give any further comment on the situation. Military spokesperson Chris Magezi could not be reached for comment.

Reacting to the situation in Uganda after the election, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern over the arrests and violent incidents involving opposition figures and supporters, spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said late on Thursday.

"He (the Secretary General) notes the importance of restraint by all actors and respect for the rule of law and Uganda's international human rights obligations," Dujarric said.

Wine has alleged that hundreds of his supporters have been illegally detained in recent months, targeted for their political affiliation and said this was aimed at instilling fear and intimidating his supporters.

Uganda's opposition parties and rights activists say some of those arrested are held in unofficial detention centres where some are tortured .

The crackdown has intensified with the recent detention of Muwanga Kivumbu , a lawmaker and Wine's deputy in the NUP, on Thursday. Two other senior NUP figures have been reported missing for days.

Wine, 43, has said he fled his residence after a raid by security personnel shortly after the election.

Museveni is widely believed to be grooming Kainerugaba as his successor, and the military chief has previously expressed presidential ambitions .</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:32:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQOZD5OQ3JMOTK2ZYJF7IFNKNA.jpg?auth=9db6215136a992a88e484d149629544bc02fd43820f7bd3ff366b5e741cac1f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China rejects UN experts' concerns for alleged forced labour in Xinjiang</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-rejects-un-experts-concerns-alleged-forced-labour-xinjiang-2026-01-23/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 23 (Reuters) - China defended its human rights record on Friday after UN experts said alleged forced labour , opens new tab involving Uyghurs and Tibetans in the Xinjiang region and other parts of China might amount to "enslavement".

The experts said there was "a persistent pattern" of alleged forced labour affecting Uyghur, Kazakh and Kyrgyz minority groups as well as Tibetans in Xinjiang and across multiple provinces.

Such forced labour is enabled through a government-mandated poverty alleviation programme which coerces Uyghurs and members of other minority groups into jobs in Xinjiang and other regions, they said in a statement released on Thursday.

"In many cases, the coercive elements are so severe that they may amount to forcible transfer and/or enslavement as a crime against humanity," they said.

The experts' concerns are "completely fabricated" and groundless, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, said in a press briefing on Friday.

The Chinese government has always been committed to promoting and protecting human rights, Guo said, urging the experts to "perform their duties impartially and objectively and not become tools and accomplices of anti-China forces".

Human rights organisations and Western governments including the United States and Canada have repeatedly raised concerns about human rights violations against Uyghurs and other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang, allegations which Beijing denies .</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:33:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WKX5XDYIZ5MKPCGQAHOKPI7OYE.jpg?auth=885bd5f6fa559710f7dc0e1ad560aa560b0ab558eb324e55f499f892d5be3741&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights body holds emergency session on Iran's protest crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-rights-body-holds-emergency-session-irans-protest-crackdown-2026-01-23/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.N. Human Rights Council will hold an emergency session on Friday to discuss the "alarming violence" used in Iran against protesters, while a group of states will call on United Nations' investigators to document alleged abuses for future trials.

Rights groups say thousands, including bystanders , were killed during the unrest , which represented the biggest challenge to Iran's clerical government since 2022.

At least 50 countries backed the call for a special session of the U.N. Human Rights Council to address credible reports of violence, crackdowns on protesters and violations of international human rights law across the country, according to a letter drafted by Iceland.

"The scale of the crimes is unprecedented," Payam Akhavan, a former U.N. prosecutor with Iranian-Canadian nationality, told Reuters ahead of the session, where he is set to speak.

"We are trying to set the stage for transitional justice in Iran, for the country’s Nuremberg moment, should that come to pass," he said, referring to the international criminal trials of Nazi leaders following World War Two.

Iran's diplomatic mission did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Authorities have blamed the unrest and deaths on "terrorists and rioters" backed by exiled opponents and foreign adversaries, the United States and Israel.

The proposal before the Geneva body seeks to extend by two years the mandate of a U.N. investigation set up in 2022 after the previous wave of protests. It would also launch an urgent investigation into violations and crimes linked to the latest unrest that began on December 28 "for potential future legal proceedings".

It was not clear who would cover the costs amid a U.N. funding crisis that has stalled other probes .

Human rights advocates hope that the emergency session will pressure Iran's government.

"The session sends a strong message to Iranian authorities that the international community is closely monitoring their actions and will not tolerate the suppression of dissenting voices," said Azadeh Pourzand, the spokesperson for Impact Iran, which is a coalition of 19 non-governmental organizations campaigning for human rights in Iran.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:33:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AOB4NKE7G5OX7GPK6SAJCBQ55E.jpg?auth=049c6c73aeff7e2a19748afbc8c658afc98d5fc32ec6df5049cc455478380877&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Orban rebukes Zelenskiy as Hungarian election looms</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/orban-rebukes-zelenskiy-hungarian-election-looms-2026-01-23/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Hungary's Viktor Orban criticised Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, describing him as "a man in a desperate position" whose "war efforts" he would not support, intensifying his anti-Ukrainian campaign ahead of pivotal April elections.

As Hungary's economy stagnates and Orban's Fidesz party trails the opposition Tisza party in most polls, the prime minister has framed the parliamentary election due on April 12 as a choice between war and peace, portraying Ukraine as undeserving of financial support.

In a Facebook post directly addressed to Zelenskiy, late on Thursday Orban said:

"You are a man in a desperate position who, for the fourth year now, has been unable or unwilling to bring a war to an end - despite the fact that the President of the United States has provided every possible assistance to do so."

"Therefore, no matter how much you flatter me, we cannot support your war efforts," the nationalist leader added, again rejecting financial aid for Ukraine.

Zelenskiy on Thursday criticised Europe for being a "fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers" lacking the courage to act decisively and facing a dark future unless it stood up to U.S. and Russian power.

Orban, who has maintained close ties with Moscow and with Russian President Vladimir Putin, has sought to associate Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar with Brussels and Ukraine, and accused Ukraine of wanting a change in government.

"The Ukrainians will be active participants in the Hungarian campaign, because they have a vested interest in a change of government in Hungary," Orban told a briefing early on Friday in Brussels.

Ukraine's government could not immediately be reached for comment.

Orban said his government would launch a "national petition" that Hungarians can sign to "tell Brussels that Hungarians won't pay to Ukraine."

This primarily targets rural voters and echoes Orban's past anti-migrant campaigns.

Magyar has said Tisza supports peace in Ukraine, rejects the idea of conscription, and will not support any escalation in the war.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:33:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N2NJKMYI7NPN7FUUCTCYN7USM4.jpg?auth=eb1a1cb0e3832026870a22a3433444745aa0848cb51414eb2bc917d3515a1476&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>TikTok sets up joint venture to avert threat of US ban</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-tiktok-sets-up-joint-venture-to-avert-threat-of-us-ban</link><description>TikTok announced Thursday it has established a majority American-owned joint venture to operate its US business, allowing the company to avoid a ban over its Chinese ownership .

The video-sharing app is a global digital entertainment powerhouse but its mass appeal and links to China have raised concerns over privacy and national security.

The TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC will serve more than 200 million users and 7.5 million businesses while implementing strict safeguards for data protection and content moderation, the company said.

The new structure responds to a law passed under US President Donald Trump 's predecessor Joe Biden that forced Chinese-owned ByteDance to sell TikTok's US operations or face a ban in its biggest market.

Trump welcomed and claimed credit for the deal, but also thanked Chinese President Xi Jinping for approving it.

"I am so happy to have helped in saving TikTok!" Trump said in a post on Truth Social late Thursday.

"It will now be owned by a group of Great American Patriots and Investors, the Biggest in the World, and will be an important Voice."

"I would also like to thank President Xi, of China, for working with us and, ultimately, approving the Deal," he added.

ByteDance retains a 19.9 percent stake in the joint venture – keeping its ownership below the 20 percent threshold stipulated by the law.

Three investors – Silver Lake, Oracle and Abu Dhabi-based AI investment fund MGX – each hold 15 percent stakes. Oracle's executive chairman Larry Ellison is a longtime Trump ally.

Other investors include Dell Family Office, affiliates of Susquehanna International Group and General Atlantic.

The joint venture will retain decision-making authority over trust and safety policies and content moderation for US users.

But TikTok's global entities will manage international product integration and commercial activities including e-commerce and advertising.

Under the arrangement, US user data will be stored in Oracle's secure cloud environment, with cybersecurity audited by third-party experts and adhering to federal standards, TikTok said.

Jasmine Enberg, co-CEO of Scalable, a media company focused on the creator economy, said TikTok users would be relieved by the deal but that there were "still big questions about how this will all play out."

"Behind the scenes, TikTok is likely working hard to assure advertisers it will remain business as normal," she said.

"While the need for users to download a new app seems unlikely, brand partners will want to know that their TikTok strategies won't be disrupted."

The joint venture will be governed by a seven-member, majority-American board including TikTok CEO Shou Chew and executives from investment firms.

TikTok executive Adam Presser was appointed CEO of the new entity, with Will Farrell serving as chief security officer.

The 2024 law came as US policymakers, including Trump in his first presidency, warned that China could use TikTok to mine Americans' data or exert influence through its algorithm.

But Trump, crediting the app for his appeal with young voters, delayed enforcement through successive executive orders, most recently extending the deadline to January 22.

The deal largely confirms an outline announced to staff by Chew last month.

In September, one-time venture capitalist and Vice President JD Vance said the US entity would be valued at about $14 billion but it would ultimately be up to investors to determine pricing.

That month, Trump said a new venture had been agreed with China and would meet the law's requirements.

Trump specifically named Ellison, one of the world's richest men, as a major player in the arrangement.

Ellison has returned to the spotlight through his dealings with Trump, who has brought his old friend into major AI partnerships with OpenAI.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 09:34:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/eb507380-f80d-11f0-820c-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/f2dae84f7d10c591d8495f13feb5f0f0e5385770.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: How attacks on Ukraine's nuclear power substations could cause a total blackout</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/how-attacks-ukraines-nuclear-power-substations-could-cause-total-blackout-2026-01-23/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 23 (Reuters) - In the midst of extreme cold weather, Russia has intensified its attacks on Ukraine's energy system, which relies almost entirely on electricity produced by nuclear power plants and has already lost half of its generating capacity.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said that Russia intends to deprive Ukraine of this energy by planning to hit substations that supply nuclear power to consumers, plunging the country into a complete blackout.

Ukraine currently operates three nuclear power plants with a total capacity of 7.7 gigawatts. The fourth plant, Europe's largest, Zaporizhzhia NPP, is occupied by Russia and not operating.

The current generation deficit is about 10 gigawatts, which is only partially compensated for by imports, meaning authorities must implement large-scale rolling blackouts during which entire regions are left without power for hours.

One industry source, who asked not to be identified due to the sensitivity of the subject, said nuclear generation was now providing up to 80% of the power consumed in Ukraine, which has virtually no other generating capacity left intact.

With most of Ukraine's thermal power generation knocked out by Russian air strikes, the removal of the nuclear power stations would cause cities' infrastructure to collapse, the industry source said.

Zelenskiy previously said that domestic generation and imports cover only about 60% of demand.

Economy Minister Oleksiy Sobolev said at this week's World Economic Forum in Davos that Russian shelling since October 2025 has damaged 8.5 gigawatts of generating capacity in Ukraine, including thermal and hydroelectric power plants.

Nuclear power units are useless without powerful substations that can deliver the generated electricity to high-voltage grids and then, through smaller substations, to consumers.

Oleksandr Kharchenko, director of the influential independent Energy Research Centre in Kyiv, said that 10 key substations transported more than half the electricity consumed by Ukraine from nuclear power plants.

Some of the substations are located directly next to the nuclear power plants, while others are dozens or even hundreds of kilometres (miles) away.

Rafael Grossi, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, said this week that key Ukrainian power substations had already been "affected" by the latest Russian missile salvoes.

Kharchenko said that so far there had been no strikes on substations at nuclear power plants, but during the almost four years of war , opens new tab , Russia has attacked substations located far from power units at least 60 times.

The attacks target rare powerful transformers but protective measures have been put in place around them, and as a result of the strikes, only auxiliary equipment has been damaged.

Usually, such damage takes only a couple of days to repair and to return the substation to operation, Kharchenko said.

Still, the industry source said that nuclear power plants have been forced to reduce the output from nuclear reactors many times due to such attacks.

Analysts and energy experts say the consequences of a missile strike on substations located near nuclear reactors are unpredictable as an explosion - even if it did not damage a reactor itself - could damage the system of piping that contains radioactive water, as well as other nuclear equipment.

Some substations are located just a few hundred metres (yards) from reactors, and hitting them could have unpredictable consequences.

An industry source noted that the reactor buildings were constructed of thick concrete and would not be easily penetrated by a drone's warhead, although a fire could damage other vulnerable objects of the power station. And they would not withstand a hit by a ballistic missile, the source said.

Ukraine already experienced a nuclear disaster when, in 1986, a power unit at the Chornobyl nuclear power plant exploded, rendering tens of thousands of hectares of land uninhabitable just 80 kilometres (50 miles) from Kyiv.

Kharchenko said that Russian missiles aimed at substations could simply hit the reactor or damage other key equipment - mainly kilometres of pipelines carrying radioactive water, turbine equipment or control systems at the nuclear power plant.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:26:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C6Q2F6OW4FIJXFC7ONCRST6EPQ.jpg?auth=cbed8cffadccd6905fcf29b360fc951f7500fc4b0cc8bc7cf1c3958293e4f3c7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says territorial issue to be discussed at trilateral talks in UAE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/zelenskiy-says-territorial-issue-be-discussed-trilateral-talks-uae-2026-01-23/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 23 (Reuters) - President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Friday that the vital question of territory in Ukraine's war with Russia would be discussed at U.S.-brokered trilateral talks in Abu Dhabi on Friday and Saturday.

Kyiv is under mounting U.S. pressure to secure a peace deal in the nearly four-year-old war with Moscow, which has demanded Ukraine give up its entire eastern area of Donbas before it stops fighting.

Responding to questions in a WhatsApp media chat a day after meeting U.S. President Donald Trump for talks both leaders described as positive, Zelenskiy said the issue would be a top priority of talks.

"The question of Donbas is key. It will be discussed how the three sides...see this in Abu Dhabi today and tomorrow."

The talks will begin on Friday evening, Zelenskiy's aide said.

Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of the eastern Donetsk region have proven a key stumbling block. Zelenskiy has refused to give up land that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare.

The Ukrainian leader added that a deal on U.S. security guarantees for Kyiv was ready, and that he was only waiting on Trump for a specific date and place to sign it.

Ukraine has sought strong security guarantees from allies in the event of a peace deal to prevent Russia, which has shown little interest in ending the war, from invading again.

Asked about using Moscow's frozen assets to fund reconstruction on Russian territory, Zelenskiy dismissed as "nonsense" the idea of using the money to rebuild "their parts".

Russia had previously floated the idea of using frozen assets to pay for the recovery of Russian-occupied territory inside Ukraine.

"Of course, we will fight (to use the assets for Ukraine), and it is absolutely fair regarding the use of all frozen assets (by Ukraine)," Zelenskiy said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:26:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OCFAICI7BVKYJDAC3JEX3JPFE4.jpg?auth=d87e87c401aecf9dba143e438b26b2405793b678283ff539d4a003d82c1f4a9d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark, NATO seek to boost Arctic security amid Greenland crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-nato-seek-boost-arctic-security-amid-greenland-crisis-2026-01-23/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Friday she had agreed with NATO chief Mark Rutte that the alliance needs to boost security in the Arctic following weeks of turmoil over U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to annex Greenland.

The governments of Denmark and Greenland, a Danish autonomous territory, insist that sovereignty over the island is not up for discussion, but have said they are open to talks on a wide range of other topics.

Trump said on Thursday he had secured total and permanent U.S. access to Greenland after talks with Rutte, while the NATO chief said allies would have to step up efforts to ward off threats from Russia and China in the high north.

"We agree that NATO must increase its engagement in the Arctic. Defense and security in the Arctic is a matter for the entire alliance," Frederiksen said in a social media post on Friday, along with a photo of herself and Rutte in Brussels.

Rutte said he was working with the Danish leader to enhance deterrence and defence.

Frederiksen will travel to Greenland's capital Nuuk later on Friday to meet with the island's prime minister.

Denmark's foreign minister said on Friday that diplomats from Denmark and the United States had met in Washington on Thursday, establishing a plan for how to proceed.

"We will not communicate when those (future) meetings are, because what is needed now is to take the drama out of this... we need a calm process," Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said.

A source familiar with the matter said on Thursday that Rutte and Trump had agreed in Davos on further talks between the U.S., Denmark and Greenland on updating a 1951 agreement that governs U.S. military access and presence on the Arctic island.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:26:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SOB6QXIMQZNXHJ7T2TQHNF4DHY.jpg?auth=a94fde3b8689313912fac9f75a8d72f0d7f16963a10c3be405a4a73bf8cdec7c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France to hold call with G7, Nordics on urgent Ukraine energy support</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/france-hold-call-with-g7-nordics-urgent-ukraine-energy-support-2026-01-23/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - France will hold a call on Friday with G7 countries as well as Nordic and Baltic states to coordinate support for Ukraine’s energy grid after Russian bombings left hundreds of thousands of people without power and heating , its foreign minister said.

Electrical engineers have been working around the clock in hazardous conditions for weeks after Russia escalated attacks on Ukraine's grid during an extreme cold snap.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has declared an energy emergency after sustained Russian strikes over winter knocked out power generation and distribution facilities.

"He continues to shell Ukrainian cities and energy infrastructure. We will continue to support Ukraine," French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told BFM television.

He said France would supply Ukraine with the equivalent of 13 extra megawatts of electricity and around 100 generators to replace destroyed infrastructure.

Other countries would also pledge assistance during the meeting later on Friday, he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:27:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6DOXEVBFTZOMVMIMVZP5D3KTSU.jpg?auth=5d864601da2117bee73d83f56d47d6e27418de502ba747dec89a2ce79f832424&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran: IAEA must clarify stance on June attacks before inspecting bombed sites</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-iaea-must-clarify-stance-june-attacks-before-inspecting-bombed-sites-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.N. nuclear watchdog must clarify its stance on U.S. and Israeli attacks on Iran's nuclear sites last June before inspectors are allowed to visit those facilities, Iranian media on Friday quoted the country's atomic chief as saying.

Mohammad Eslami said the inspections so far had been limited to undamaged sites and he criticised the watchdog for letting Israeli and U.S. pressure influence its actions.

Eslami made his comments in response to the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, who said on Tuesday that the standoff over inspections "cannot go on forever".

Grossi has not explicitly condemned or criticised the attacks nor has he formally outlined a protocol for inspecting the damaged facilities.

Access to sites that were attacked needs "a specific protocol", Eslami said, adding: "When a military strike occurs and there are environmental risks, it must be defined and a guideline must be designed."

"The agency has to clarify its position regarding the military attacks on the nuclear facilities that have been registered by the agency and are under its supervision so we can understand what role they play," state TV quoted Eslami as having told reporters in Tehran on Thursday.

He said Tehran had submitted a statement at the IAEA's General Conference last September demanding that attacks on nuclear sites be prohibited. But it was not placed on the agenda and was ignored, he said.

"It is unrealistic, unprofessional and unfair that, because of pressure from Israel and the U.S., he [Grossi] is putting pressure on us," Eslami said.

Grossi told Reuters on Tuesday that the IAEA had inspected all 13 declared nuclear facilities in Iran that were not targeted last June but had been unable to inspect any of the three key sites that were bombed - Natanz, Fordow and Isfahan.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:27:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K7G3EN374JIF5INVO5RESVQREA.jpg?auth=5a34deb191fbf93789a70fe5e29af973ad1d70af8a869c382d180b70205aabc8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian government says it controls prison in Raqqa with Islamic State-linked detainees</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrian-government-says-it-controls-prison-raqqa-with-islamic-state-linked-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Syria's Interior Ministry said on Friday it had taken over al-Aktan prison in the city of Raqqa in northeastern Syria, a facility that was formerly under the control of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

The prison has been holding detainees linked to the militant group Islamic State, and witnessed clashes in its vicinity this week between advancing Syrian government forces and the SDF.

It was not immediately clear how many IS detainees remain in al-Aktan prison as the U.S. military has started transferring up to 7,000 prisoners linked to the militant Islamist group from Syrian jails to neighbouring Iraq. U.S. officials say the detainees are citizens of many countries, including in Europe.

"Specialized teams were formed from the counter-terrorism department and other relevant authorities to take over the tasks of guarding and securing the prison and controlling the security situation inside it", the Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Under a sweeping integration deal agreed on Sunday, responsibility for prisons housing IS detainees was meant to be transferred to the Syrian government.

The SDF said on Monday it was battling Syrian government forces near al-Aktan and that the seizure of the prison by the government forces "could have serious security repercussions that threaten stability and pave the way for a return to chaos and terrorism".

The U.S. transfer of IS prisoners follows the rapid collapse of Kurdish-led forces in northeast Syria. Concerns over prison security intensifed after the escape on Tuesday of roughly 200 low-level Islamic State fighters from Syria's Shaddadi prison. Syrian government forces later recaptured many of them.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:27:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/N24QWVGDQVOJFCSVW5HTFPEFBY.jpg?auth=0a4c7f9e810c283b5462907ea14e0a9b58ec778b328257e31282543fdac5506e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Who is leading Russia's delegation at the Ukraine talks in Abu Dhabi?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/who-is-leading-russias-delegation-ukraine-talks-abu-dhabi-2026-01-23/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Russian Admiral Igor Kostyukov is set to head Moscow's team at trilateral security talks with the U.S. and Ukraine on Friday in Abu Dhabi, as part of efforts to reach a deal to end the war in Ukraine.

What do we know about Kostyukov?

Kostyukov is the director of Russia's military intelligence organisation, known as the GRU. Born in 1961, he received a naval education and went on to serve as a military diplomat, which included a posting as a military attache to the Russian embassy in Greece in 2004.

After he was transferred to the GRU, Kostyukov participated in operations in Syria, according to the RBC newspaper. In 2018, he became acting head of the GRU upon the illness of his boss, Igor Korobov, and full-time head following Korobov's death. He was the GRU's first head with a naval background and became an admiral in 2019.

President Vladimir Putin has previously sent Kostyukov to participate in talks on Ukraine. He was a member of a Russian delegation that met with Ukrainian counterparts in May 2025 in Istanbul, the first face-to-face talks between the warring sides in three years.

Kostyukov has played a role in other high-profile foreign policy discussions. Last June, he joined Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and Kremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov at a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi in the Kremlin shortly after the United States conducted attacks on Iran's nuclear sites , opens new tab .

The GRU has been thrust into the international spotlight several times during Kostyukov's tenure there.

In March 2018, when Kostyukov was serving as the GRU's first deputy head, Russian double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned by a nerve agent in the English city of Salisbury.

A UK inquiry found last year that a team of GRU military intelligence officers had attempted to murder Skripal. Russia has always denied any involvement in the attack, casting the accusations as anti-Russian propaganda.

Kostyukov was put under sanctions by the United States in 2016. In 2019, the European Union sanctioned him and several GRU colleagues over the Salisbury poisoning. He is also under sanctions by Britain and several other Western countries.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:27:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P74XBQ4WLFNABNGCKGJYGER3OA.jpg?auth=2f74e3092a041abf779f345f1aa51690457923fa6e6b492b0dec2aa454d6b7d9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE detains 5-year-old in Minnesota, school official says he was used as ‘bait’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-ice-detains-5-year-old-minnesota-school-official-says-he-was-used-as-bait</link><description>A 5-year-old boy arriving home from preschool in Minnesota was taken by federal agents along with his father to a detention facility in Texas, school officials and the family’s lawyer said, making him the fourth student from his Minneapolis suburb to be detained by immigration officers in recent weeks.

Federal agents took Liam Conejo Ramos from a running car in the family’s driveway Tuesday afternoon, Columbia Heights Public Schools Superintendent Zena Stenvik told reporters Wednesday. The officers told him to knock on the door to his home to see if other people were inside, “essentially using a 5-year-old as bait”, she said.

The father told the child’s mother, who was inside the home and has not been named, not to open the door, Stenvik told reporters Thursday.

School officials said the agents would not leave Liam with another adult who lives at the home or an official from the school district. But on Thursday, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in an online post that the father asked for the child to stay with him and that they are together at an immigration lockup in Dilley, Texas.

The family, who came to the US in 2024, has an active asylum case and had not been ordered to leave the country, Stenvik said.

“Why detain a 5-year-old?” she asked. “You cannot tell me that this child is going to be classified as a violent criminal.”

McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday that “ICE did NOT target a child.” She said Immigration and Customs Enforcement was arresting the child’s father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, who McLaughlin said is from Ecuador and in the US illegally. He fled on foot, “abandoning his child”, she said.

“For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” McLaughlin said, adding that parents are given the choice to be removed with their children or have them placed with a person of their choosing.

Minnesota has become a major focus of federal immigration sweeps. Greg Bovino, a US Customs and Border Protection official who has been the face of the crackdowns, said immigration officers have made about 3,000 arrests in Minnesota in the last six weeks.

Stenvik suggested that the father did not run. She said another adult who lives at the home was outside when the father and son were taken, but agents would not leave Liam with that person.

Mary Granlund, school board chair for Columbia Heights Public Schools, told reporters Thursday that she had told agents she would take the child before they left with him.

Rachel James, a Columbia Heights city council member who lives nearby the family, said she saw another neighbour from across the street tell the agents they had papers authorising them to take care of Liam on behalf of the parents. The agents ignored them, James said.

The family’s lawyer, Marc Prokosch, said Thursday that he assumes Liam and his father are in a family holding cell but that they have not been able to have “direct contact” with them.

“We’re looking at our legal options to see if we can free them either through some legal mechanisms or through moral pressure,” he said at a news conference.

Vice President JD Vance met with Minneapolis leaders Thursday and said he heard the “terrible story” but later learned the boy was only detained, not arrested.

“Well, what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?” said Vance, noting that he is the parent of a 5-year-old.

Vance was not asked about why immigration officers allegedly would not leave the boy with the other adult who lives at the home and offered to take him.

Families are reporting that children are malnourished, extremely ill and suffering profoundly from prolonged detention at the Dilley lockup, where conditions are worse than ever, said Leecia Welch, chief legal counselor at Children’s Rights. Welch visited the facility last week as part of a lawsuit over the welfare of immigrant children in federal custody.

“The number of children had skyrocketed and significant numbers of children had been detained for over 100 days,” Welch said. The administration in December acknowledged that about 400 children had faced extended detention.

“Nearly every child we spoke to was sick,” Welch said.

Columbia Heights Public Schools has five schools and about 3,400 students from pre-K to 12th grade, according to its website. Most come from immigrant families, Stenvik said.

Before Liam, a 17-year-old was taken Tuesday while heading to school, and a 10-year-old and a 17-year-old have also been taken, Stenvik said. Attendance has dropped over the past two weeks, including one day where about one-third of the students were out from school, she said.

“Over the last few weeks, ICE agents have been roaming our neighbourhoods, circling our schools, following our buses, coming into our parking lot multiple times and taking our kids,” said Stenvik, adding that this is causing “trauma”.

Ella Sullivan, Liam’s teacher, described him as “kind and loving.”

“His classmates miss him,” she said. “And all I want is for him to be safe and back here.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/26265f32-f837-11f0-a48a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-22T214535Z-511562760-RC225JALNI4I-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA-CHILD.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump's NATO front line comments 'deeply disappointing', UK minister says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trumps-nato-front-line-comments-deeply-disappointing-uk-minister-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's comments that NATO troops stayed off the front line in Afghanistan were "deeply disappointing", a British minister said on Friday, noting that many European soldiers had died supporting American-led operations.

Criticising NATO in a Fox News interview on Thursday, Trump said the United States had "never needed" the alliance and that its allies stayed "a little off the front lines" in Afghanistan.

"Many, many British soldiers and many soldiers from other European NATO allies gave their lives in support of American-led missions in places like Afghanistan and Iraq," junior minister Stephen Kinnock told Sky News.

"I think anybody who seeks to criticise what [our armed forces] have done and the sacrifices that they make is plainly wrong," he added.

Britain lost 457 military personnel during its 20-year deployment in Afghanistan.

More than 150 Canadians were killed along with 90 French service personnel, while Denmark - which has been under heavy pressure from Trump to sell its semi-autonomous region of Greenland to the U.S. - lost 44 troops, one of NATO's highest per-capita death rates.

Kinnock also recalled that the U.S. was the only NATO member ever to invoke the alliance's collective-defence clause, Article 5, which treats an attack on one as an attack on all, prompting allies to rally in support of Washington after the September 11, 2001 attacks.

He added that the NATO alliance was the most successful international security pact in "the history of the world", and that the U.S. and its European partners, including Britain, played a vital role.

Other British politicians noted that Trump had avoided the draft for the Vietnam War, citing bone spurs in his feet.

"Trump avoided military service 5 times," Ed Davey, leader of Britain's centrist Liberal Democrats, wrote on X. "How dare he question their sacrifice."</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:52:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W2CNGGHRIBKYNJ53Z4LDWPMDJI.jpg?auth=83b12f3fa3232ad55571891633647df5be2477f8ce0404df1de91944b5474c61&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French government survives no-confidence vote over budget process</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-government-survives-first-no-confidence-vote-2026-budget-2026-01-23/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The French government survived on Friday the first of two votes of no-confidence in parliament called over its decision to ram through the income part of the 2026 budget without giving the National Assembly the final say.

269 lawmakers voted in favor of the no-confidence motion presented by the hard-left France Unbowed together with the Greens and Communists. 288 votes were required to bring down the government.

A second vote will follow shortly. If that vote fails too, Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu will again invoke article 49.3 of the constitution to force the expenditure part of the budget through the National Assembly - a move that will almost certainly trigger further votes of no confidence.

President Emmanuel Macron's government is having to circumvent parliament after months of negotiations failed to deliver a deficit-taming finance bill that would pass in a lower house where no party has a working majority.

In the hunt for a budget, Macron lost two governments and saw France plunged into turmoil rarely seen since the 1958 creation of the Fifth Republic, the current system of government.

With France depending on an emergency rollover budget from last year to keep afloat, Lecornu made last-minute concessions earlier this month to secure the agreement of Socialists to not topple the government if it resorted to using the special constitutional powers.

Le Pen said government opponents who supported Lecornu in the confidence vote would pay the price in future elections, including local elections in March and presidential elections in 2027.

"Don't think that no one is watching you. The French people see you, and they will make you pay for it at the ballot box," Le Pen told lawmakers ahead of the vote. "Not only for the (budgetary) bloodletting you are inflicting on them, but also for the humiliating process you are using."

Lecornu says the budget deficit will not exceed 5% of GDP, below the 5.4% hit in 2025 but still well above the European Union's 3% cap.

The second motion, filed by the far-right National Rally (RN), stands even less chance of succeeding as left-wing lawmakers have historically refused to back RN motions.

The government expects the entire budget to be definitively adopted in the first half of February, one government official said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:53:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AUPLSMVC5RO5VEDBZL3547VNOM.jpg?auth=dab5ee4761b040469ed459ae0567d2d95a5893e2b51fcf597537136309bcba1e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Royal Navy tracks Russian vessels sailing through English Channel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uks-royal-navy-tracks-russian-vessels-sailing-through-english-channel-2026-01-23/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Royal Navy shadowed Russian vessels sailing through the English Channel in a two-day operation coordinated with NATO allies, the navy said on Friday, as the military alliance steps up monitoring of Russian shipping.

The navy said two patrol ships, supported by a Wildcat helicopter, were dispatched to intercept the Russian warship Boikiy and accompanying oil tanker MT General Skobelev as they headed north, before handing the monitoring over to a NATO ally.

The operation comes a day after Britain said it provided support to a French operation to board a sanctioned Russian oil tanker as it passed through the Straits of Gibraltar, in a bid to choke off the funds that fuel Russian's invasion of Ukraine.

Russia's onslaught on Ukraine's energy system has led to power and water outages in Kyiv that typically last three to four times longer than in previous winters. Temperatures in the capital at night have plunged as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius.

Russia says its attacks on Ukraine are designed to degrade its ability to fight. Ukraine says the aim is to harm civilians and break the national will . Poland has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine throughout the war.

"Given the dire situation in Ukraine... Prime Minister Donald Tusk has ordered equipment to protect civilians from the effects of freezing temperatures," the Interior Ministry said in a statement.

Members of the public in Poland have so far donated over 5.8 million zlotys ($1.62 million) to a fundraising campaign to buy generators for Kyiv.

"For us, it is a gesture of support - for them, a real chance to survive the winter," fundraisers said on their website.

The Interior Ministry said that 379 power generators and 18 heaters will be delivered to Ukraine from the Government Agency for Strategic Reserves, with another 447 power generators provided using European Union funds.

The Polish capital, Warsaw, is also donating 90 generators to Kyiv.

"We are all observing what is happening in Ukraine right now, these brutal Russian attacks on critical infrastructure, on Ukrainian cities, which are, of course, causing civilian casualties, but have also led to a large part of Kyiv being cut off from energy and electricity supplies," Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski told a news conference.

France has been unable to pass a budget for 2026, prompting French Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu to invoke a controversial constitutional Article 49.3 – known as the “nuclear option” – on Tuesday to end the impasse.

"When debate no longer allows for a conclusion, someone must take responsibility," he said of the controversial decision ahead of the vote on Friday, calling Article 49.3 “an instrument of last resort”.

Lecornu invoked the article to push the budget through the lower house, where it had ​become deadlocked after three months of discussions.

In response, opposition parties LFI and far-right National Rally (RN) filed no-confidence motions against his government.

Lecornu, however, appears to have won enough political backing, notably from the centre-left Socialists, to survive the no-confidence votes.

Lecornu has sought to make concessions in the spending bill to please the Socialists, a key swing group in the hung parliament, in order to survive any vote to oust him. Among the concessions was Lecornu’s agreement that a controversial pension reform would not be implemented until after the 2027 presidential elections.

President Emmanuel Macron has hailed the proposed budget, saying it "guarantees stability" and "allows the country to move forward", a government spokesperson said.

Macron also emphasised that the budget "required compromises and concessions from everyone".

Lecornu has vowed to keep the public deficit at 5 percent of gross domestic product ( GDP ).

No-confidence votes triggered after Article 49.3 was invoked to force through a budget also toppled Lecornu’s immediate predecessors, François Bayrou and Michel Barnier.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 10:56:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5e904388-f846-11f0-b8ac-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93RC2A2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Supporters gather as South African politician Malema awaits sentence in firearm case</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/supporters-gather-south-african-politician-malema-awaits-sentence-firearm-case-2026-01-23/</link><description>EAST LONDON, South Africa, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Thousands of supporters of South African opposition politician Julius Malema gathered outside a court on Friday as the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party leader awaited his sentence for firing a rifle in the air at a rally in 2018.

Malema was convicted in October of charges including unlawful possession of a firearm, discharging a weapon in a public place and reckless endangerment of people or property.

He had pleaded not guilty, arguing the gun was a toy.

Malema faces a possible prison sentence of 15 years. However, the sentence could also be more lenient, like a suspended sentence or community service, if the court thinks there are mitigating factors.

One of South Africa's most prominent politicians, Malema commands a strong following among the youth and those who argue governments have not done enough to address racial inequalities in the three decades after the end of white minority rule.

EFF supporters outside the East London Magistrate's Court held aloft placards reading "We stand with Julius Malema" and "Hands off CiC (Commander-in-Chief) Julius Malema."

Many wore party regalia including the EFF's trademark red berets.

It was not immediately clear whether Malema would be told his sentence on Friday during what is termed a pre-sentencing hearing or the sentencing would be deferred to a later date, but EFF officials said his followers wanted to turn out in numbers to support Malema in case.

The far-left EFF is the fourth biggest party in South Africa's parliament with roughly 10% of seats in the lower house.

It advocates nationalising mines and seizing land from white farmers, which critics fear would threaten Africa's most industrialised economy.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:23:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DS7GKZWFWBLYJBNELJTXNTY5ZQ.jpg?auth=c865f52972d669931d03eac22e74d2b65504f528f70373b42f3b797d919c2883&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>West Bank education centre could close in days due to Israeli seizure threat, says UNRWA</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/west-bank-education-centre-could-close-days-due-israeli-seizure-threat-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A training centre for hundreds of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank could be closed within days by Israeli authorities, jeopardising the education of students, the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency said on Friday.

The Kalandia Training Centre, which teaches 350 young male students from across the West Bank skills such as plumbing and vehicle maintenance, could be shut, as the land it sits on is at risk of expropriation by Israeli authorities, UNRWA said.

"If the centre were to be forcibly closed - and we do fear that this could happen within days - there is no educational alternative for these students. So you're depriving a large cohort of Palestine Refugees of economic opportunities," Jonathan Fowler, UNRWA's spokesperson, told reporters in Geneva speaking via video link from Amman, Jordan.

"The right to education would be under attack there...The international community needs to wake up," he added.

The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.

UNRWA has functioned for decades as the main international agency providing for the welfare of millions of Palestinian descendants of those who fled or were driven from homes during the war around Israel's founding.

Israel accuses UNRWA of bias, and Israel's parliament passed a law in October 2024 banning the agency from operating in the country and prohibiting officials from having contact with it.

Israel demolished structures inside the agency's East Jerusalem compound on Tuesday, a site it seized last year.

The agency's chief Philippe Lazzarini said the demolition was the latest in a series of Israeli actions against UNRWA, including a raid on a medical clinic this month and a plan to cut power and water to UNRWA facilities in the coming weeks.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:23:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2VJ374WMG5OS7OBG45J5ZXRWPY.jpg?auth=e05511042fb7f99ca78c9cb0313bd30607ec30cb454ae9b0d23fa0bd39accfe7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rail fracture likely occurred before train crash in southern Spain, investigators say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rail-fracture-likely-occurred-before-train-crash-southern-spain-investigators-2026-01-23/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A fracture in the rail appeared to have occurred before a high-speed train derailed in southern Spain last Sunday, rail accident investigating body CIAF said in a preliminary report published on Friday.

Sunday's deadly collision in Adamuz, Cordoba province, killed 45 in one of Europe's worst train accidents. A first train belonging to private consortium Iryo derailed and smashed into another oncoming high-speed train from state-owned rail company Renfe.

"Based on the information available at this time, it can be hypothesised that the rail fracture occurred prior to the passage of the Iryo train involved in the accident and, therefore, prior to the derailment," read the CIAF report, posted on the body's website.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 11:45:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LPSTZL76VFKBHC2BI6UBQWSAUQ.jpg?auth=3cd24f5eff914f9aff629856e5ac35bcf4263d2544912cdf9f83f6ef68c39d9e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland galvanizes Europe to confront new US reality</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/davos/greenland-galvanizes-europe-confront-new-us-reality-2026-01-23/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Europe may have rallied to see off President Donald Trump over Greenland, but its leaders recognise the confrontation is unlikely to be the last in dealings with his increasingly strident version of the United States.

The stakes could hardly be higher, given the $2 trillion trading relationship between the European Union and the U.S. and the dominant role Washington continues to play in the NATO alliance ​and in support of Ukraine against Russia.

This week, in the space of a few hours at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Trump first ruled out taking Greenland ‌by force and then removed the threat of new tariffs on eight European states standing in his way - hailing instead a vague deal for the Arctic island with NATO chief Mark Rutte.

European leaders believe Trump backed down in part because - in contrast to their more accommodating stance in last year's tariff negotiations - this time they made it clear he was crossing a red line by asserting that Greenland's status as an autonomous territory of Denmark was non-negotiable.

"All this shows that you cannot let the Americans trample all over the Europeans," said a European Union official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly about U.S. ties.

"We did the right thing to push back, to be firm in what we said, but it is ‌not over. My sense is that we will be tested constantly on issues like this," the official told Reuters.

While Europe may have learned the value of standing up ​to Trump, the challenge is ensuring it is less exposed next time.

"It's a hard route, and it's going to take time," said Rosa Balfour, director at Carnegie Europe, adding that Europe had "far more leverage than it has dared to use".

An emergency summit of Europe's leaders on Thursday called for last year's EU-U.S. trade deal to be put back on track after lawmakers suspended its ratification in protest over Greenland.

"Despite all the ‍frustration and anger of recent months, let us not be too quick to write off the transatlantic partnership," German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said in Davos beforehand.

While seeking to stabilise the partnership, Europe is also taking steps aimed at "de-risking" it given the open antipathy from Trump, whose new national security strategy accuses the continent of freeloading on defence and demands it open its markets to U.S. companies.

Europe is only too aware of how long it can take to get agreement among 27 nations with different histories, politics ⁠and economies, which was highlighted in taunts this week by U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.

Two EU officials said the Greenland row has accelerated discussions on how the approach taken on Ukraine - in which countries offer security guarantees on ‍a voluntary basis and no one has a right of veto - can be extended.

"We should do more with coalitions of the willing and leave it open for others to follow if they want," said one, adding that joint efforts to ‌boost Europe's development ‌of artificial intelligence technology could be one example.

Coalitions such as the "E3" group comprising France, Germany and Britain focusing on security matters also allow non-EU states to take part, which speaks to others on the rough end of Trump policies.

"The middle powers must act together, because if we're not at the table, we're on the menu," Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said in a Davos speech to warm applause.

Another route is using the leeway afforded by EU law.

In December, EU states used an emergency provision to indefinitely immobilise hundreds of billions of dollars of Russian assets. That removed the risk of a pro-Moscow country like Hungary blocking the roll-over of the measure at some point ⁠and forcing the EU to return the money.

Europe also plans to toughen up on economic policy.

Next ​month it will kickstart legislation that will include "Made in Europe" requirements on strategic sectors and strengthening conditionality clauses for any foreign direct investment in the EU.

"Some provisions were originally conceived to reduce reliance on China but in reality they will help us to de-risk from other markets," European Commissioner for Prosperity and Industrial Strategy Stephane Sejourne told Reuters.

"This will totally change the European doctrine on those sectors," Sejourne added.

Unlike Canada , there is no plan in Europe to pivot more towards China to compensate ‍for transatlantic strains. But the bloc is actively pursuing others in a diversification drive.

While the impact of higher U.S. tariffs on European goods is not clear - in fact Europe's trade surplus with the U.S. initially rose over the course of 2025 as companies front-loaded exports ahead of the new levies - recent data shows that German companies nearly halved investments there last year.

After the signing of the EU-Mercosur pact this month - the largest in EU history - European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it is now "on the cusp" of ​a deal with India .

However, nobody is saying Europe can redress the imbalance with the U.S. overnight, particularly on security.

Despite European commitments to a ‍defence spending surge and even calls for an EU army , analysts say it will be years before its military might is up to tasks which now include bolstering Arctic security.

The question is whether the past few weeks provide a catalyst for Europe to start reducing its U.S. ​dependencies.

"All this is not surprising," Swedish deputy Prime Minister Ebba Busch said of Trump's showing in Davos.

"The EU needs to toughen up," she told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:49:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HKHIJLXAU5JXJCZUCZVUPNKA34.jpg?auth=cdc7d83dc2720141f1eed623a01e45432b9ab9665763bf321ded2a693186712e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN human rights chief urges US to uphold international law in immigration crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/un-human-rights-chief-urges-us-uphold-international-law-immigration-crackdown-2026-01-23/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.N. human rights chief urged the Trump administration on Friday to ensure that its migration policies respect individual rights and international law, citing concerns over arbitrary and unlawful arrests and detentions.

"Individuals are being surveilled and detained, sometimes violently including at hospitals, churches, mosques, courthouses, markets, schools, and even within their own homes, often solely on mere suspicion of being undocumented migrants," the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, said in a statement.

U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown has seen some 3,000 heavily armed masked federal officers deployed to the city of Minneapolis, rounding up suspects they say are dangerous criminal immigration violators, while sometimes ensnaring law-abiding U.S. citizens and immigrants.

The city is on edge after an immigration officer shot and killed Renee Good, 37, a U.S. citizen and mother of three on January 7. Vice President JD Vance delivered a broad defense on Thursday, saying that "far-left agitators" and uncooperative local officials were to blame for chaos on the streets.

U.S. immigration enforcement operations have used what appears to be unnecessary or disproportionate force, Turk said. Such measures should only be used as a last resort if an individual posed an immediate threat to life, he added.

Turk said the U.S. must comply with international law and that migration enforcement must respect due process, voicing concern that, in some cases, people arrested or detained had not been granted timely access to legal advice.

He called for an independent investigation into the rising number of deaths in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody. He cited 30 deaths reported in 2025 and six recorded so far this year.

Turk condemned what he called the routine denigration of migrants and refugees in the United States that portrays them as criminals or a burden on society, saying it increased their "exposure to xenophobic hostility and abuse".</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:49:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y3BBUOCHYFMEVNHF6AOHUMIPLM.jpg?auth=f4d3d944ab927a868173e67838502e4f91f082208b1bf491c877d5a89b72957c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World order changing, not rupturing, finance chiefs say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/world-order-changing-not-rupturing-finance-chiefs-say-2026-01-23/</link><description>DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The world order is changing but not enduring a rupture, finance leaders said on Friday, pushing back on Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's narrative that a new order, driven by major power coercion, was taking shape.

In his speech at Davos , Carney called on nations to accept that a rules-based global order was over and great powers were abandoning even the pretence of following international agreements.

Quoting ancient Greek historian Thucydides, Carney said the world was entering a period in which "the strong can do what they can and the weak must suffer what they must".

"I'm not exactly on the same page as Mark," European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde told the World Economic Forum in Davos, just days after Carney's appearance. "I'm not sure that we should be talking about rupture."

"I think we should be talking about alternatives. We should be identifying, much more so than we have probably in the past, the weaknesses, the sore points, the dependencies, the autonomy," she said.

World Trade Organization chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said that uncertainty was unlikely to remain as high as this month, when U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to take over Greenland from NATO ally Denmark.

But the old order was also not going to return, uncertainty would linger and countries must invest in their own resilience, she said.

"I don't think we'll go back to where we were. But they will not be as bad and maybe we'll have a slightly better, steady state for the future," Okonjo-Iweala said.

If I was running a country, I'd be trying to strengthen myself and my region, and I'd be looking at my region and then building resilience."

Kristalina Georgieva, the International Monetary Fund's director, argued that change was natural and has been happening for years, and it was time to embrace this because shocks would keep happening.

"We are not in Kansas, anymore," she said, referencing a line in the Wizard of Oz, meaning that the comforts of familiar surroundings were gone for good.

Lagarde, who walked out of a Davos dinner during a speech critical of Europe by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, was in a more forgiving mood on Friday.

"We have heard quite a lot of European-bashing in the last few days, but if anything, it has been good, and we should say 'thank you' to the bashers, because I think it has given us a complete realisation of the fact that we have to be more focused; we have to work on those plans B."</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:49:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C75D2BKNG5JDVAEVWGVRUXYWQM.jpg?auth=cf251dd6e3cb5a73dda50462c019f70e81b8194c605e72817953484a4b67d0c5&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Bulgarian court approves President Radev's resignation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/bulgarian-court-approves-president-radevs-resignation-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Bulgaria's constitutional court said on Friday it had approved the resignation of President Rumen Radev, opening the way for him to step down from the post.

Radev resigned this week , fuelling speculation that he will form his own political party to run in upcoming parliamentary elections. He was due to hold the largely ceremonial post until January 2027.

The Constitutional Court said Radev's powers have now been removed.

Radev, whose resignation came after the previous government quit last month, will be replaced by Vice President Iliana Iotova, who is expected to appoint a caretaker government and set a date for parliamentary elections, the eighth in four years.

Radev has long raised the prospect of forming his own party to bring stability and fight graft in one of the European Union's poorest and most corrupt countries, which joined the euro on January 1.

It was unclear if he would make a move ahead of the upcoming elections.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:50:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RGA7DVJZ3ZOCVLLSA2K55Q6PMY.jpg?auth=bcd66f55567894f7222c8b73157f6c92275bce0b449dcc9aba797c92ecc64a14&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Power cuts and freezing temperatures test Kyiv's resilience after Russian attacks</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260123-power-cuts-freezing-temperatures-test-kyiv-resilience-after-russian-attacks</link><description>Nadia, a 31-year-old Kyiv resident, is working from home in thermals, two jumpers and fingerless gloves. Outside, it’s -4 degrees Celsius, and her apartment has no heating, electricity or water .

On days when the temperature has dropped even lower, she has added a coat and hat to her work outfit. “But the fingerless gloves are my best investment,” she says. “When you need to type on your laptop, it saves your life because it's really freezing.”

Nadia is one of hundreds of thousands of people in the Ukrainian capital who have been struggling with lengthy interruptions to heat, electricity and water supplies in recent weeks due to a surge in Russian attacks on energy infrastructure .

At the same time, Kyiv is in the grip of the harshest winter since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly four years ago. Temperatures have not risen above freezing so far this year and have frequently dipped as low as -10 degrees Celsius.

Ukraine’s government last week declared a state of emergency related to the energy crisis, for the first time since the war began.

“It’s horrible,” says Sofia, who lives in central Kyiv. Her electricity has been out for more than 48 hours, and she had almost no water supply the previous day.

“In these conditions, you have no thoughts in your mind except how not to die from being cold, how to cook yourself something, how to take a shower and how to flush the toilet,” she says.

“It is uncomfortable and quite exhausting”, agrees Olga, who lives with her 11-year-old daughter in an apartment on Kyiv’s right bank. Their power has been down for more than 30 hours.

Without electricity, there is no heating, so the pair have been wearing plenty of layers and “often wrap ourselves in duvets as well”, she says. They still have water, but she adds, “that’s a matter of luck”.

After a Russian ballistic missile strike on January 9 caused major outages in Kyiv, a second massive attack on January 20 left more than half of the capital’s homes without power and the city’s entire left bank without water.

Repairing Ukraine’s battered energy infrastructure in freezing temperatures is dangerous and difficult work .

But local authorities say water has been restored, although not for residents on the upper floors of high-rise buildings that require electric booster pumps to access their supply.

Power is also slowly returning , but Kyiv’s Mayor Vitali Klitschko said on Friday that 1,940 apartment buildings were still ​without heating.

Across the city, thousands of people are still gathering in schools and at around 90 “heating points” run by Ukraine’s Emergency Service and the Red Cross , where generators allow them to warm up, charge their phones and connect to the internet.

The hum of generators has become a constant backdrop to city life, says Daria, 36, who lives in the west of the city with her 6-year-old son, and has been going to her generator-powered gym to wash her hair.

“Whenever the sound of generators stops, it means the electricity is back on,” she says.

Daria is not surprised that recent attacks on energy systems have ramped up in intensity. “It is one of the coldest winters for ten years. Of course, the Russians are using this against us,” she says.

While scheduled power outages have long been a part of daily life in Kyiv, the unpredictable and lengthy emergency outages caused by recent attacks have brought endless small challenges that disrupt the rhythms of daily life and zap morale.

Meals are often basic fare cooked on gas camping stoves that smell and are dangerous to use indoors. Everyone keeps a bucket in the bathroom and bottles of water in case they can no longer flush the toilet.

“Some days are manageable, others are much heavier, but I’m trying to keep going,” says Olga.

She and Daria are grateful that their children’s schools have heating and are still open – most have been closed until February . Across the city, streetlights have been dimmed, and roughly half a million residents have left.

Those who remain are in survival mode. Sofia’s neighbours have taken to lighting fires and barbecues outside in a bid to stay warm. Many feel “angry, tired and sad,” she says.

Sofia finds the combination of extreme cold and continued nighttime bombings makes it difficult to sleep, and fears she will have to move away from the city. “Which I don’t want. Kyiv is my home. But it simply breaks your will,” she adds.

Nadia is worried a surprise power cut could leave her trapped inside the lift in her building. “It already happened to me once,” she says. She now walks up stairs to her 12th-floor apartment.

Among her friends and family in Kyiv, she experienced the longest stretch without any power – for 50 hours straight after Tuesday night’s attacks. In that time, “there have been lots of highs and lows”, she says.

This morning, a high: When she woke up the power was – briefly – back. “There was electricity, there was light, and I could make myself a coffee.” She says, “I was so happy.”

Daria has been cold at her office, where the central heating no longer works, but mostly warm enough at home as she has invested in backup options, including a power station worth thousands of euros that she can link to the electricity supply in her apartment.

It is, she acknowledges, a “very expensive option” – and is still not always enough.

In the past 24 hours, the power in her building has only been on for 50 minutes, and she has not been able to charge the power station. “It makes me slightly panic”, Daria says.

She hopes that the power will return for a few hours overnight and she will wake up with a full charge in the morning, but there is no guarantee this will happen. If it doesn’t, she faces another day without heat or electricity.

“It’s Russian roulette,” she says.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 12:50:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/55f6f31a-f83d-11f0-b412-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014476390336.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Israel aims to ensure more Palestinians are let out of Gaza than back in</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-aims-ensure-more-palestinians-are-let-out-gaza-than-back-2026-01-23/</link><description>TEL AVIV, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Israel wants to restrict the number of Palestinians entering Gaza through the border crossing with Egypt to ensure that more are allowed out than in, three sources briefed on the matter said ahead of the border's expected opening next week.

The head of a transitional Palestinian committee backed by the U.S. to temporarily administer Gaza, Ali Shaath, announced on Thursday that the Rafah Border Crossing - effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there - would open next week.

The border was supposed to have opened during the initial phase of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war , under a ceasefire reached in October between Israel and Hamas.

Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory's administration. The Gaza side of the crossing has been under Israeli military control since 2024.

The three sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said it was still not clear how Israel planned to enforce limits on the number of Palestinians entering Gaza from Egypt, or what ratio of exits to entries it aimed to achieve.

Israeli officials have spoken in the past about encouraging Palestinians to emigrate from Gaza, although they deny intending to transfer the population out by force. Palestinians are highly sensitive to any suggestion that Gazans could be expelled, or that those who leave temporarily could be barred from returning.

The Rafah Crossing is expected to be staffed by Palestinians affiliated with the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority and monitored by EU personnel, as took place during an earlier, weeks-long ceasefire between Israel and Hamas early last year.

The Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. The military referred questions to the government, declining to comment.

The three sources said that Israel also wants to establish a military checkpoint inside Gaza near the border, through which all Palestinians entering or leaving would be required to pass and be subjected to Israeli security checks.

Two other sources also said that Israeli officials had insisted on setting up a military checkpoint in Gaza to screen Palestinians moving in and out.

The U.S. Embassy in Israel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Washington supported Israel in limiting the number of Palestinians entering Gaza or setting up a checkpoint to screen those entering and leaving.

Under the initial phase of Trump's plan, the Israeli military partially pulled back its forces within Gaza but retained control of 53% of the territory including the entire land border with Egypt. Nearly all of the territory's population lives in the rest of Gaza, under Hamas control and mostly in makeshift tents or damaged buildings.

The sources said that it was not clear how individuals would be dealt with if they were blocked by Israel's military from passing through its checkpoint, particularly those entering from Egypt.

The Israeli government has repeatedly objected to the opening of the border, with some officials saying Hamas must first return the body of an Israeli police officer held in Gaza, the final human remains of a hostage due to be transferred under the ceasefire's first phase.

U.S. officials in private say that Washington, not Israel, is driving the rollout of the president's plan to end the war.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:43:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BF47YIEF2ZNIPF7RJ76EPYDEW4.jpg?auth=69e739be1e0801092eae4b612c7a2946121cb42abeaaec50fe361dc4dad97ddd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: UK finance and business ministers to accompany PM Starmer on China visit</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-finance-business-ministers-accompany-pm-starmer-china-visit-2026-01-23/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - British finance minister Rachel Reeves will accompany Prime Minister Keir Starmer on his trip to China next week, underscoring UK efforts to strengthen ties with the world's second-largest economy at a time of strained transatlantic relations.

Among the goods Britain hopes to sell to China are financial services products such as pensions, insurance and wealth management services, luxury cars and clothing, and whisky.
While China has been prevented from investing in certain parts of the British economy, such as nuclear plants and core mobile networks, it has invested in renewable energy systems, infrastructure and real estate.

Reeves will join Starmer and business leaders on the trip next week, the first by a British prime minister to China since 2018, three sources familiar with the visit told Reuters.

Along with business secretary Peter Kyle, who will also be on the trip, Reeves will have separate itineraries from the prime minister, one of the sources said. Their presence on the visit has not previously been reported.

The Treasury and the Department for Business and Trade declined to comment.

CHINA VISIT COMES AT A TIME OF TENSION WITH U.S.

Starmer's trip comes after Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney visited Beijing last week and hailed improving ties with China as well as the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.

The decision to send the two most senior figures in the government, and the business secretary, shows the importance the British government is placing on the visit, which takes place amid tensions between Britain and its traditional closest ally, the United States, over President Donald Trump's unpredictable approach to trade and defence.

Britain wants closer economic and trade ties with China to help boost its economy after Starmer pledged to improve living standards through investment in public services and the economy. But the strategy has drawn fierce criticism from some British and U.S. politicians.

Starmer's government recently approved China's contested plans to build a mega-embassy in the heart of London, rejecting objections from some politicians who said the new building would make it easier for China to conduct spying operations.

Some UK and Chinese officials had told Reuters that the visit to China was conditional on the embassy being approved

China was Britain's fourth-largest trading partner with trade totalling around 100 billion pounds in the 12 months to the end of the second quarter in 2025, according to government data.

Among those travelling with Starmer to China as part of the business delegation will be Brendan Nelson, the chairman of HSBC, Europe's biggest bank, another source familiar with the plans told Reuters. HSBC declined to comment.

A revamped UK-China CEO Council is also set to be unveiled next week, with representatives from companies including AstraZeneca, HSBC and Jaguar Land Rover expected to participate, Reuters reported this week.

But the visit comes at a sensitive moment for relations between European leaders and the United States because of Trump's claims that the United States needs to take control of Greenland because China poses a threat in the Arctic.

In a speech at Davos, Trump made clear his disdain for European leaders , their immigration policies, regulations and their unwillingness to give him Greenland, which he insists America must own for its security.

Starmer laid the foundations for his trip last month when he said Britain needed to take a "more sophisticated" approach to its relationship with China, saying bilateral ties had "blown hot and cold" for years.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:43:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EF2M46YV3BJUXNKIFYH5QRBX3Q.jpg?auth=acf4eb392d3b57418f80b42ddf56316fb040609430c36c3a3f0e9c17df985ca7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iranian cleric says Iran may target US investments in region if attacked</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iranian-cleric-says-iran-may-target-us-investments-region-if-attacked-2026-01-23/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 23 (Reuters) - An influential Iranian cleric warned on Friday that Iran may target U.S.-linked investments in the region in retaliation for any U.S. attack on the Islamic Republic, Iranian news agencies reported.

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an "armada" heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

"The one trillion dollars you have invested in the region is under the watch of our missiles," said Mohammad Javad Haj Ali Akbari, a leader of prayers that are held on Fridays in Tehran before a large gathering. He did not specify which investments he was referring to.

Separately, Iran's top prosecutor Mohammad Movahedi denied that Iran had called off 800 executions of people arrested in recent nationwide protests, as Trump has said .

"This claim is completely false, No such number exists, nor has the judiciary made any such decision," Movahedi was quoted as saying by the judiciary's news agency Mizan.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Fox News last week "There is no plan for hanging at all" by Iran, when asked about the anti-government protests.

The U.N. Human Rights Council is to hold an emergency session on Friday to discuss the "alarming violence" used in Iran against protesters, while a group of states will call on United Nations' investigators to document alleged abuses for future trials.

Rights groups say thousands, including bystanders , were killed during the unrest, which represented the biggest challenge to Iran's clerical government since 2022.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:44:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NLFKOCTGABPFXDQSQYE6DJ337Q.jpg?auth=3a0fc89766425565e6e6f6e7bcad415f91fe485beaf69efc53cbfeade12c1df9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Stars of fashion and film bid farewell to haute couture 'emperor' Valentino</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/stars-fashion-film-bid-farewell-haute-couture-emperor-valentino-2026-01-23/</link><description>ROME, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Valentino , Italy's haute couture "emperor", was laid to rest in Rome on Friday, with the distinctive red he championed in his collections echoed in splashes of crimson among the black-clad mourners.

The biggest names in fashion - including Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Maria Grazia Chiuri - gathered in the Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli, a church designed by Michelangelo and built on the ruins of ancient Roman baths.

Valentino's co-founder Giancarlo Giammetti, dressed in a sharply tailored black satin suit, and the designer's last partner, Bruce Hoeksema, accompanied the plain wooden coffin as it entered the church, drawing applause from the crowds outside.

"Through him, I discovered beauty, a beauty that followed us throughout our lives, that has kept us busy. We met when we were kids, we dreamed the same dreams, we managed to realise some of them, I would even say many of them," Giammetti said in his eulogy.

In an improvised speech, Hoeksema said: "Valentino, you were the person I spoke to, not the person I spoke about. You were beside me when words were not needed. Life was not always perfect, but it was real. One day at a time, for more than 40 years."

Mourners included Vogue's Global Editorial director Anna Wintour, actors Anne Hathaway and Elizabeth Hurley, American socialite Olivia Palermo and Valentino's current creative director Alessandro Michele and his predecessor Pierpaolo Piccioli.

Valentino's Chief Executive Riccardo Bellini, French billionaire Francois-Henri Pinault, Antoine Arnault, the eldest son of LVMH (LVMH.PA) , opens new tab chairman Bernard Arnault, and Rachid Mohamed Rachid, CEO of Mayhoola, also attended.

The couturier who built one of Italy's most celebrated fashion houses died on Monday at his home in Rome, aged 93.

Hundreds gathered outside and inside the basilica, famed for the red of its marbled walls and columns - darker than Valentino red.

White flowers framed the altar and a black-and-white photo of Valentino stood next to his coffin.

There were flashes of red among the pews - hats, scarves, bright carmine coats and a woollen shawl.

More than 10,000 people paid their respects to Valentino on Wednesday and Thursday as he lay in state in Rome's Piazza Mignanelli, next to his fashion house's historical headquarters and a stone's throw from the city's iconic Spanish Steps.

There will be a private burial after the service.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:44:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QWULQLPRKFI27O27P4PFFJTYCI.jpg?auth=007f29e216d2ad1338cc6cdfd0501b575c2220f8accc64f568931ed41f146a2d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Museveni's fiery son tightens grip on Uganda's future​</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/musevenis-fiery-son-tightens-grip-ugandas-future-2026-01-23/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - As Uganda's 81-year-old President Yoweri Museveni starts a seventh term , his tough-talking son and head of the military Muhoozi Kainerugaba is favourite to succeed him after consolidating his power base and sidelining critics.

Kainerugaba, best-known to many Ugandans for his fiery social media posts, helped his father to election victory last week by ordering a crackdown on opponents and cutting the internet , said sources familiar with the matter.

Having repeatedly threatened to kill opposition leader Bobi Wine , who says the vote was rigged and is in hiding, Kainerugaba boasted on Friday that 30 "terrorists" from Wine's party had been killed and 2,000 "hooligans" arrested. There was no immediate response from the party.

In the run-up to the vote , security forces disrupted opposition rallies, detaining supporters and sometimes opening fire.

Adding to accounts from a business source and a security official, Andrew Mwenda, a close adviser to Kainerugaba, told Reuters he had played a critical role in the four-day internet blackout, saying it was to prevent any sabotage.

Kainerugaba personally mobilised the police and army to target "roughnecks and ruffians" supporting the opposition National Unity Platform party led by popstar-turned-politician Wine, Mwenda added.

"He's number one in security in this country," Mwenda said.

Kainerugaba could not be reached and spokespeople for the government, military and presidency did not respond to requests for comment on the internet blackout, crackdown or succession plans.

Kainerugaba, who attended Britain's prestigious Sandhurst military academy and is an admirer of Mao Zedong and Fidel Castro, first announced in 2023 that he wanted to be president after his father, saying he was "tired of waiting forever".

Since then, he has sidelined critics within the ruling party and military, retiring rival officers and boosting pay to secure soldiers' loyalty.

Museveni has never commented in public about who will follow him, beyond saying his party will make the decision.

Though Kainerugaba's presidential ambitions have previously sparked concern in Museveni's inner circle, his role in securing the election victory has strengthened his position, the security official and business source said.

A handover from father to son would not be without risks of a backlash in the East African country, which has a $65 billion economy and enjoyed decades of stability under Museveni.

Kainerugaba does not speak to journalists and has a reputation for late-night social media posts – including threats to behead Wine and castrate another opposition leader in 2025 and invade Kenya in October 2022.

Both he and his father apologised for the threat to a neighbouring nation, and Kainerugaba has said some of his posts are meant to be ironic.

His erratic style has displeased some in the older generation of Uganda's political and military elite.

But his position as security czar and prospective future leader looks stronger than ever, according to five people with close knowledge of the matter, two of whom are involved in talks about the transition.

"At this point, it's hard to think of anyone outside the family who could challenge him," said Kristof Titeca, a Uganda expert and professor at the University of Antwerp.

Kainerugaba grew up in exile in Tanzania, Kenya and Sweden before his father took office in 1986. He returned home to lead the Special Forces Command, an elite unit often described as an army within the army.

His swift rise and frequent interjections in politics have drawn some criticism but seldom serious sanction.

"There (are) people who are in the military who are not happy with General Muhoozi's behaviour ... either expressing interest in the presidency for himself or praising his father or insulting his father's rivals," said Frederick Golooba-Mutebi, a Ugandan researcher and analyst.

"It would seem as if there are laws that apply to other military officers, but those laws don't apply to the president's son."

In 2022, Museveni and his younger brother Salim Saleh, who serves as a special presidential adviser, did warn Kainerugaba about his posts, two business sources told Reuters, citing family members. Saleh did not reply to a request for comment.

Despite his intimidating public profile, three sources who have met Kainerugaba say he is thoughtful and strategic in person. "When you talk to him outside the confines of Twitter, he is a different person," said political commentator Charles Onyango-Obbo.

Mwenda said most of Kainerugaba's incendiary posts were in fact jokes. Kainerugaba enjoyed "a glass or two of whisky" but did not abuse alcohol, he added.

If Museveni dies in office, the vice president is meant to take over temporarily and hold an election. Saleh is expected to play a kingmaker role on behalf of the family, several sources told Reuters.

"Nobody is safe in Uganda ... in a country where a military general will consume their whisky and wish somebody death," Wine told Reuters this week from an unknown location, in a clear allusion to Museveni's son.

Veteran ruling party politicians have made no secret of their disquiet over the prospect of a Kainerugaba takeover, but their influence is waning.

All but two members of the ruling National Resistance Movement's 14-member central executive committee were replaced last year, and current members are more broadly supportive of Kainerugaba, said academic Titeca.

Kainerugaba has overseen increases in salaries of rank-and-file soldiers, in some cases by over 300%, while also personally announcing promotions and retirements and launching an anti-corruption drive.

Kainerugaba's strong relationship with Rwanda's President Paul Kagame, whom he refers to as "Uncle Paul", has fuelled speculation that he might ask Kagame for help should he be challenged, according to sources.

Mwenda said the friendship went back decades and was clearly an advantage. "If I was asked for an ally, he (Kagame) is the first person I would go to." A spokesperson for Rwanda's government did not respond to requests for comment.

On the streets of Uganda, where the average national age is just 16, many condemn the idea of a family handover.

"Uganda is not a kingdom, we won't allow it. If they think they can put the son in place of the father they are wrong," 23-year-old Fahad said in the capital Kampala.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:45:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LBSCKMZVJ5N7RFQOOVL4CT7REI.jpg?auth=9ed989e7cc15dad9599a0478487d784ee97c48863d62212cc386ae1878ba43f7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘Secret’ ICE memo allows agents to forcibly enter homes without a judge’s warrant</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-secret-ice-memo-allows-agents-forcibly-enter-homes-without-judge-warrant</link><description>Over the decades, it has become common knowledge in immigrant communities across the country to not open the door for federal immigration officers unless they show a warrant signed by a judge. The Supreme Court has long held that the Constitution’s Fourth Amendment against unreasonable search and seizure prohibits the government’s forced entry into someone’s home.

As a result, immigration officers have been forced to adapt by making arrests in public, which often requires long hours of surveillance outside homes as they wait to nab someone walking to the street.

But an internal Immigration and Customs Enforcement memo obtained by The Associated Press states immigration officers can forcibly enter people’s homes without a judge’s warrant, marking a dramatic shift that could upend the legal advice given to immigrants for decades.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy,” Democratic US Senator Richard Blumenthal warned.

The shift comes as President Donald Trump’s administration dramatically expands immigration arrests nationwide under a mass deportation campaign that is already reshaping enforcement tactics in cities such as Minneapolis.

Since coming to the United States 30 years ago from Mexico, Fernando Perez said US immigration officers have stopped by his home numerous times, but he has never once answered the door.

“There are rules and I know them,” said Perez, speaking in a mix of English and Spanish in a Home Depot parking lot where he has routinely sought work as a day labourer from contractors and people renovating their homes.

Perez said officers in the past would knock, wait and then move on.

“But if they are going to start coming into my home, where I am paying the rent — they are not paying the rent — that’s the last straw,” he said.

Most immigration arrests have been carried out under administrative warrants, documents issued by immigration authorities that authorise an arrest. Traditionally they do not permit officers to enter private spaces without consent. Only warrants signed by independent judges have carried that authority.

It is unclear how broadly the memo’s directive has been applied in immigration enforcement operations. AP witnessed ICE officers ramming through the front door of a Liberian man’s home in Minneapolis on January 11 with only an administrative warrant, wearing heavy tactical gear and with their rifles drawn.

Democratic US Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is demanding congressional hearings on the ICE memo and calling on Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem for an explanation.

“Every American should be terrified by this secret ICE policy authorising its agents to kick down your door and storm into your home,” Blumenthal said in a news release.

Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the court in 1980 that the “physical entry of the home is the chief evil against which the wording of the Fourth Amendment is directed”.

For years, people have managed to evade arrest by skipping work and outings for days until agents move on. A senior ICE official once likened the surveillance experience to watching paint dry.

In July, the AP observed as immigration officers saw a Russian man enter his home in Irvine, California. They gave up when he did not leave after three hours. They waited longer for a Mexican man who never emerged from his house in nearby El Monte, though they caught up with him two days later at a convenience store.

ICE has tried what the agency called “knock and talks” to get people to answer the door by casually asking residents to step outside to answer a few questions, according to a 2020 lawsuit in which a federal judge found the practice illegal. In one case, they told a woman they were probation officers looking for her brother.

More often, immigration officers simply play the waiting game — a pace that is not conducive to Trump fulfilling his promise of mass deportations .

Since shortly after ICE was created in 2003, advocacy groups and immigrant-friendly state and local governments have diligently spread the word that people should not open their doors for immigration officers unless they can show a warrant signed by a judge.

They have held know-your-rights trainings for communities, passed out flyers and posted videos on social media to teach immigrants how to protect themselves.

Ahilan Arulanantham, co-faculty director of the UCLA Law School’s Center for Immigration Law and Policy who has held such trainings, called the memo “quite disturbing”,

“Know-your-rights trainings have included that information for decades and even people who are only minimally aware of their rights learn that because it’s sort of the first and foundational elements of Fourth Amendment law,” he said. “They know to ask officers to slide the warrant under the door so they can see if it was signed by a judge or is an administrative warrant.”

In the predominantly Latino city of Santa Ana, where ICE agents were seen roaming the streets in recent days, several residents who did not want to give their names said they were well aware of that right. Jesus Delgado, a father of three, said the local elementary school sent out information to parents about what to do if ICE comes to your door.

“They send us bulletins, to not answer the door, to not answer any questions,” he said.

Another man said he learned that from TikTok.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan has been highly critical of groups providing the information.

“They call it ‘know-your-rights,’” he said last year on CNN. “I call it ‘how to escape arrest.’”

The memo says immigration officers can forcibly enter homes and arrest immigrants using solely a warrant signed by an immigration official if they have a final order of removal.

Officers must first knock on the door and share who they are and why they are at the residence, and they can only go into the home after 6am and before 10pm. The people inside must be given a “reasonable chance to act lawfully”. But if that does not work, the memo says, they can use force to go in.

Law enforcement and legal experts warn if more immigration officers barge into homes, everyone could be put at greater risk.

With stand-your-ground laws, people in many states have the right to shoot intruders, which could lead to officers being shot, or agents opening fire on someone coming at them with a baseball bat or other item they grab in the heat of a moment, Arulanantham said. ICE records often contain wrong addresses, which could further lead to confrontations and agents busting into homes of US citizens.

Arulanantham said agents’ aggressive tactics have been building since the Supreme Court lifted a lower court’s order in September that barred federal agents in the Los Angeles area from indiscriminately stopping people because of their race, language, job or location.

“This would just be another step down that path,” he said. “Obviously it will be more significant because it suggests you’re not safe even in your own house.”</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:46:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/9b424b8e-f858-11f0-bd13-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26021767982109.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK hits back after Trump claims NATO troops avoided front lines in Afghanistan</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-britain-hits-back-after-trump-claims-nato-troops-avoided-afghan-front-line</link><description>Britain said US President Donald Trump was "wrong to diminish" the role of NATO troops in Afghanistan , as a claim by the US president that they did not fight on the front line sparked outrage.

In an interview with Fox News aired on Thursday, Trump appeared unaware that 457 British soldiers died during the conflict in the South Asian country following the September 11 attacks on the United States.

"They'll say they sent some troops to Afghanistan," Trump told the US outlet, referring to NATO allies.

"And they did, they stayed a little back, a little off the front lines," he added.

Trump also repeated his suggestion that NATO would not come to the aid of the United States if asked to do so.

In fact, following the 9/11 attacks, the UK and a number of other allies joined the US from 2001 in Afghanistan after it invoked NATO's collective security clause.

As well as British forces, troops from other NATO ally countries, including Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Denmark and others also died.

"Their sacrifice and that of other NATO forces was made in the service of collective security and in response to an attack on our ally," Prime Minister Keir Starmer 's official spokesman said.

"We are incredibly proud of our armed forces and their service and sacrifice will never be forgotten," he added.

Care Minister Stephen Kinnock earlier said he expected Starmer would bring the issue up with Trump.

"I think he will, I'm sure, be raising this issue with the president ... He's incredibly proud of our armed forces, and he will make that clear to the president," he told LBC Radio.

"It just doesn't really add up what he said, because the fact of the matter is the only time that Article 5 has been invoked was to go to the aid of the United States after 9/11," he added in an interview with Sky News.

Defence Minister John Healey said NATO's Article 5 has only been triggered once.

"The UK and NATO allies answered the US call. And more than 450 British personnel lost their lives in Afghanistan," he said.

The troops who died were "heroes who gave their lives in service of our nation", he added.

Lucy Aldridge, whose son William died at the age of 18 in Afghanistan, told The Mirror newspaper that Trump's remarks were "extremely upsetting".

Emily Thornberry, chair of parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, denounced them as "so much more than a mistake".

"It's an absolute insult. It's an insult to 457 families who lost someone in Afghanistan. How dare he say we weren't on the front line?" the Labour Party politician said on the BBC's Question Time programme on Thursday evening.

According to official UK figures, 405 of the 457 British casualties who died in Afghanistan were killed in hostile military action.

The US reportedly lost more than 2,400 soldiers.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 13:46:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e7057d56-f85e-11f0-9bb8-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93T77KF.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kyiv zoo battles to keep animals warm as city shivers through power crisis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/kyiv-zoo-battles-keep-animals-warm-city-shivers-through-power-crisis-2026-01-23/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Staff at Kyiv's zoo are toiling around the clock to keep Tony the gorilla and other animals warm as Russian air strikes target Ukraine's energy infrastructure amid freezing winter temperatures.

Kyiv's Mayor Vitali Klitschko repeated his appeal on Friday to citizens to seek temporary shelter outside the city amid fears of further strikes. That is not an option for 51-year-old Tony, however, or the zoo's other long-suffering residents.

"You can tell people to go to the countryside but I can't say that to Tony," said zoo chief Kyrylo Trantin of Ukraine's oldest gorilla.

"He doesn't have a grandmother in the countryside... where he could stay."

Five times a day, staff deliver firewood to a constantly burning stove to keep the primate's cage at a comfortable 20 degrees Celsius.

Repeated Russian air attacks on Ukraine's energy system in recent weeks have thrown millions of people in Kyiv and other cities into sometimes lengthy periods of darkness and cold.

Emergency outages, worsened by temperatures as low as -18 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees Fahrenheit), have also disrupted water supplies.

At the zoo, generators rumble day and night to provide warmth to the animals, which include horses, bison and an elephant.

Staffer Viktoriia Sluzhenko said the zoo keeps enough water reserves to cover the elephant's need of 150 litres per day.

"We constantly fill the tanks so that we can survive in autonomous mode for three days," she said.

The responsibility of keeping other living creatures alive takes a heavy toll on staff also preoccupied with their own survival, said Trantin, as Russia's war nears its four-year mark with no signs of abating.

"Every day is a battle for warmth and power," Trantin added.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:26:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TCP7OLEVSVLN5EXUH2AZMVYAWQ.jpg?auth=0dcddacb4ca4a107aec93b4a6ca53daf9bfb7e2981c6c64c9705b508c71d8525&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France probes link between two baby deaths and milk formula</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/france-probes-link-between-two-baby-deaths-milk-formula-2026-01-23/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - French investigators are examining the deaths of two infants who had consumed baby formula products that were subject to a precautionary recall earlier this month, the French health ministry said on Friday.

One of the babies, who died in the town Pessac in southwestern France, had been fed with Guigoz powder milk made by Swiss group Nestle (NESN.S) , opens new tab and an investigation was ongoing into the possible cause of the death, the Bordeaux prosecutor said.

The ministry said there was no evidence so far that the deaths were linked to the baby formula products.

Nestle and the privately owned French group Lactalis this month recalled batches of infant milk sold in France due to possible contamination with cereulide, a toxin that can cause nausea and vomiting.

Reuters could not immediately establish what infant formula the second baby had consumed.

Nestle said it was taking note of the ongoing investigations.

"As stated by the authorities, at this stage nothing indicates any link between these tragic events and the consumption of our products," it said in an email to Reuters.

Lactalis said it had not received any reports from the health authorities.

"Two reports of infant deaths have been brought to the attention of the health authorities, involving children who were reported to have consumed the infant formula affected by the recalls. To date, no causal link has been scientifically established," the health ministry said in a statement.

"Further analyses are underway and these cases are being investigated by the relevant public prosecutors," it added.

The launch of an inquiry is a standard procedure after the suspicious death of a baby.

The offices of the public prosecutor in Angers, western France, where the other death occurred did not respond to Reuters' request for comment.

Lactalis, the world's largest dairy group, recalled baby milk products in 18 countries and Nestle in dozens. Another French group, Danone (DANO.PA) , opens new tab , blocked a batch of infant formula specifically manufactured for the Singaporean market.

All three companies said the steps were precautionary.

The French farm ministry said on Wednesday the results of a first judicial inquiry were expected in the coming 10 days. It said its investigations had identified an oil rich in arachidonic acid, or ARA, that was produced by a Chinese supplier as the source of the contamination.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:26:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JKGZDBXQX5KWLGQP7ETMQYOYC4.jpg?auth=cc46ad92ffcb2a1dc780e4e12d60f835d28462f86f245272f327fe01079c23c2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>U.S., in control of oil dollars, heaps pressure on Iraq over Iranian influence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-control-oil-dollars-heaps-pressure-iraq-over-iranian-influence-2026-01-23/</link><description>DUBAI/WASHINGTON, Jan 23 - Washington has threatened senior Iraqi politicians with sanctions targeting the Iraqi state — including potentially its critical supply of oil revenue sourced via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — should Iran-backed armed groups be included in the next government, four sources told Reuters.

The warning is the starkest example yet of U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign to curb Iran-linked groups' influence in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

The U.S. warning was delivered repeatedly over the past two months by the U.S. Charges d'Affaires in Baghdad, Joshua Harris, in conversations with Iraqi officials and influential Shi'ite leaders, including some heads of Iran-linked groups via intermediaries, according to three Iraqi officials and one source familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters for this story.

Harris and the embassy did not respond to requests for comment. The sources requested anonymity to discuss private discussions.

Since taking office a year ago, Trump has acted to weaken the Iranian government, including via its neighbor Iraq.

Iran views Iraq as vital for keeping its economy afloat amidst sanctions, and has long using Baghdad’s banking system to skirt the restrictions, U.S. and Iraqi officials have said . Successive U.S. administrations have sought to choke that dollar stream, placing sanctions on more than a dozen Iraqi banks over the past years in an effort to do so. It has never curtailed the dollar flows from the New York Fed to the Central Bank of Iraq.

"The United States supports Iraqi sovereignty, and the sovereignty of every country in the region. That leaves absolutely no role for Iran-backed militias that pursue malign interests, cause sectarian division, and spread terrorism across the region," a U.S. State Department spokesperson told Reuters, in response to a request for comment.

The dire assessment followed a remark by Energy Minister Denys Shmyhal on Thursday that the country's energy system had endured its most difficult day since a widespread blackout in November 2022, when Russia began attacking the power grid.

Moscow has stepped up strikes in recent weeks, further damaging already battered infrastructure and leaving large swathes of the population without power and heating during a cold snap.

Several power generation facilities are undergoing emergency repairs as a result of the combined attacks, Ukrenergo said on the Telegram messaging app.

"The equipment is operating at the limits of its capabilities," it said, adding that power blocks were carrying a "tremendous" overload due to earlier damage from Russian strikes.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy declared an energy emergency last week.

Ukrenergo said it hoped repairs would be completed in "the near future", which would enable a return to planned outages.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 14:54:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LVLLLK7WSVL3NKS7UKBGJN7O54.jpg?auth=49b18a4f57b3383fcf97de82a1ab1f8820ff595dce05d5d072132eb48efa3eb4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian ex-Olympic snowboarder turned alleged drug kingpin arrested, NBC News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/canadian-ex-olympic-snowboarder-turned-alleged-drug-kingpin-arrested-nbc-news-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ryan Wedding, a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder suspected of becoming a cocaine smuggling kingpin, has been arrested, NBC News reported on Friday, citing two law enforcement officials familiar with the U.S. investigation.

Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, said Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine almost four years ago - had been waging an "energy terror" campaign since October 2025, hitting power stations and overwhelming air‑defence systems.

The capital Kyiv and surrounding regions are among the most affected, authorities say, and Kyiv's mayor urged residents to leave temporarily if they have somewhere else to go.

"We need an energy ceasefire. A ceasefire on the energy assets,” Timchenko said. “How can you talk about peace and (keep) attacking people, and knowing that people are freezing? How can these things go in parallel?”

Ukraine has endured two weeks of temperatures between minus 15 and minus 20 degrees Celsius, he said, with Russia striking gas transportation, storage and production facilities.

Russia says it is targeting military and energy infrastructure used in the interests of Ukraine's armed forces.

"We are close to a humanitarian catastrophe," Timchenko said. "People get power for 3-4 hours, then a 10- to 15-hour break. We have apartment blocks without heat for weeks already."

He said Ukraine was holding on thanks to gas imports, including from the United States, as attacks had forced gas, coal and hydropower plants to run below capacity.

DTEK has lost 60–70% of its generating capacity and suffered damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars, he said.

Timchenko said rebuilding the energy sector would cost $65–70 billion, citing World Bank estimates, and in many cases would require entirely new assets.

"We are talking rather about building a new energy system in Ukraine rather than just reconstruction," he said.

U.S. asset manager BlackRock has emerged in recent days as the main force behind a U.S.-Ukrainian plan to help design a reconstruction plan for the country.

Ukraine must accelerate construction of decentralised generation, said Timchenko, including new solar projects, green parks and storage. Decentralisation means the assets will be more difficult to hit by drones and missiles, he said.

"We cannot count on a peace deal being signed. We need to start preparing today," he said, adding that Ukraine must stock critical equipment and strengthen air defences.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:27:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/T6MIOKF3KFIMTPZA3PEYMYEFRE.jpg?auth=205acc87ea1b112bac205107f1a1957c5ee57154bc733a8766c3f2d6fae5aa96&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain's deadly rail accidents prompt maintenance investment debate</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spains-deadly-rail-accidents-prompt-maintenance-investment-debate-2026-01-23/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A series of accidents in one week on Spain's railways, including one of the deadliest in Europe , has left the country reeling and put the spotlight on whether investment to maintain the network is keeping pace with surging passenger demand.

Nearly 40 million passengers used a high-speed train in Spain in 2024, almost double the 2019 number and pushing the overall use of Spain's railway system to a record 549 million, according to data from the competition authority.

However, the high usage on Europe's largest high-speed rail network means more wear and tear, and data, reports and experts point to a focus on expanding the system, rather than on investment in maintenance, which is lower than in other large European countries.

"Spain's high-speed rail is dying from its own success. It's under greater strain, and it's starting to break down," said Salvador Garcia-Ayllon, a professor at Universidad Politecnica de Cartagena.

A high-speed collision in the southern Andalusia region last Sunday killed 45 people, while two days later a driver was killed and four passengers seriously injured after a containment wall fell on the track after heavy rains near Barcelona derailing a commuter train.

A second train also derailed near Barcelona due to a rock on the line, while a fourth collided with a crane arm in southeastern Spain, causing minor injuries to six passengers.

Preliminary findings from the accident in Andalusia showed a fracture in the rail appeared to have occurred before the train derailed, rail accident investigating body CIAF said on Friday.

"I accept and acknowledge that there should be a debate on whether it is necessary to increase the amount allocated to maintenance," Transport Minister Oscar Puente said in his first press conference after the accident.

"What I do ask is that it be separated from the accident," which occurred on a stretch of track that was renovated last May and inspected on January 7.

European Commission data shows Spain's maintenance investment in its roughly 4,000 km (2,485 miles) of high-speed lines has lagged large European peers, despite an unmatched drive to expand the network.

Spain spent an average of about 1.5 billion euros ($1.76 billion) a year from 2018 to 2022 on its high-speed network, more than any other country.

However, the vast majority went to new infrastructure with only some 16% earmarked for maintenance, renewal and upgrades.

That compares with between 34% to 39% spent by France, Germany and Italy, whose networks are far less extensive, according to the Commission data.

Maintenance spending on Spain's high-speed network needs to increase to 150,000 euros per km from the current 110,000 euros, according to estimates by Jose Trigueros, president of the Association of Roads and Civil Engineers, who said the maintenance budget also needs to be higher for conventional lines.

The main Spanish train drivers' union SEMAF called a three-day nationwide strike to protest against what it said is "the constant deterioration of the railway system" and to demand guarantees of safety and maintenance.

In an August letter to state rail infrastructure operator Adif, which was seen by Reuters, SEMAF had warned of severe wear and tear on several lines, including the stretch where the two trains crashed on Sunday.

"It is a vicious circle. If there are defects in the track, they are transmitted to the train, and defects in the train are also transmitted to the track," Diego Martin, the union's general secretary, told Reuters.

Problems such as deterioration and breaks in the rails increased from 440 in 2015 to 716 in 2024, according to official data. Accidents, including derailments, also rose in the same period to 57 from 42.

The government said that infrastructure issues and accidents on the Spanish network are proportionally below the EU's average and in line with countries such as Germany and France.

The government also pointed to a significant increase in investment. Spending on railway infrastructure has tripled and maintenance per km has increased by 58% to 71,000 euros last year since 2018, when the government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez took office.

But a 2024 annual report into Spanish infrastructure by Fundacion BBVA and Ivie showed that the investment was still well below levels before Spain's financial crisis that began in 2008, when adjusted for inflation.

Gross investment in rail infrastructure in 2024 was less than a third of the roughly 11 billion euros at its 2009 peak, the report said.

The decline since 2009 was so steep that starting in 2012 it was not enough to cover depreciation, namely keeping existing facilities in adequate condition, said Matilde Mas, an Ivie researcher who worked on the report.

Investment only returned to a steady rate of increase in 2021.

Like a Ferrari, Spain's world-class rail system needs regular upkeep, said Garcia-Ayllon.

"The expensive thing about a Ferrari is not just buying it, it's maintaining it," he said.

Mangione, 27, is accused of fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare (UNH.N) , opens new tab CEO Brian Thompson on a sidewalk in midtown Manhattan. Public officials condemned the shocking assassination, but Mangione became a folk hero of sorts to some Americans who decry steep healthcare costs and insurance practices.

He has pleaded not guilty to murder, stalking and weapons charges and will appear in custody at Friday’s hearing before U.S. District Judge Margaret Garnett in Manhattan.

Mangione’s lawyers argue prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York should be barred from using evidence found in Mangione’s backpack -- including a 9-millimeter pistol, silencer, and journal entries -- because police illegally searched it without a warrant.

Prosecutors have argued that police officers in Altoona, Pennsylvania did not need a warrant because they had lawfully arrested Mangione for providing fake identification and were legally permitted to search the bag for dangerous items before transporting it.

Garnett has ordered an Altoona Police Department officer to testify at Friday’s hearing about the department’s standard procedures for securing, safeguarding and inventorying a person’s property when they are arrested in a public place.

Mangione’s lawyers are separately asking Garnett to throw out an indictment against Mangione over purported legal deficiencies, or block prosecutors from seeking the death penalty over alleged violations of Mangione’s constitutional rights.

Garnett has scheduled jury selection for early September.

Mangione has pleaded not guilty to murder and other charges in a separate case brought by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.

The judge overseeing that case is also weighing a request by Mangione’s lawyers to suppress evidence from the backpack. A trial date has not been set.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:52:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O7JR67IXNZP25ENCPZPFSNBAYM.jpg?auth=ff328ee48bcb1c28bf14c7d547a679a60a6953f8d5f5542dbcf0d9ba2a8376be&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US targets Iran's 'shadow fleet' over crackdown on protesters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-targets-irans-shadow-fleet-over-crackdown-protesters-2026-01-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The United States on Friday imposed sanctions on nine vessels of what is known as the shadow fleet and eight related firms, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement, as Washington sought to escalate pressure on Iran over the recent killing of protesters.

The Treasury said the vessels and their respective owners or management firms, which include entities based in India, Oman and the United Arab Emirates, have collectively transported hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of Iranian oil and petroleum products to foreign markets.

"Today’s sanctions target a critical component of how Iran generates the funds used to repress its own people. As previously outlined, Treasury will continue to track the tens of millions of dollars that the regime has stolen and is desperately attempting to wire to banks outside of Iran," Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in the statement.

Rights groups say thousands of people, including bystanders, were killed during the unrest in Iran, which they describe as the biggest crackdown since Shi'ite Muslim clerics took power in the 1979 revolution.

Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene against Iran over the recent killings of protesters there, but protests dwindled last week and President Donald Trump's rhetoric regarding Iran has eased.

The shadow fleet refers to ships that carry oil that is under sanctions. They are typically old, their ownership opaque and they sail without the top-tier insurance cover needed to meet international standards for oil majors and many ports.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 15:52:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NYUKZY7QWNJU7M6KYFUN2GRGWQ.jpg?auth=104e1826870dbdc45f1d854b011aa0a793bf2c7cedcd320dc89fe0ee14c6d93c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy's willingness to cooperate with the US remains firm, PM says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italys-willingness-cooperate-with-us-remains-firm-pm-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>ROME, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Friday Rome's willingness to cooperate with the United States remains firm.

"ICE OUT!" was the message of fliers posted on businesses' doors, referring to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency on Friday, a frigid day in snowy Minneapolis with temperatures well below freezing. "NO WORK. NO SCHOOL. NO SHOPPING."

More than 300 bars, restaurants, museums, shops and other local businesses were shuttering for the day, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune. No school districts were shutting down, but schools in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul offered remote-learning options, the Star Tribune reported.

A march in downtown Minneapolis on Friday afternoon was intended by organizers to be the largest show of opposition yet to the federal government's surge, which Mayor Jacob Frey and other Democrats have likened to an invasion.

Trump, a Republican, launched the Minnesota crackdown in response to fraud allegations against some members of the state's large Somali American community. He has called Somali immigrants "garbage" and said they are to be removed from the country as part of his effort to expel more immigrants, including some admitted into the country to seek asylum and other lawful residents, than any of his predecessors.

Minnesota residents have responded with anger, making noise in the streets day and night with whistles and musical instruments. Some agents and protesters have yelled obscenities at each other, and agents have deployed tear gas and flash-bang grenades to scatter crowds. The Trump administration says some protesters have harassed agents and obstructed their work.

The numerous Fortune 500 companies that call Minnesota home - mostly based in the Minneapolis area - have refrained from public statements about the immigration raids. Minneapolis-based Target (TGT.N) , opens new tab , which has come under fire in the last year for retreating from its public commitment to diversity policies, has faced more criticism for not speaking out about activity at its stores.

Backed by the US, the Kurds have long spearheaded efforts by the West to fight against the Islamic State (IS) group .

The Kurdish-led armed group, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), in 2012-2013 established its governance over swathes of territory in the north and northeast of the country that became known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, or Rojava (meaning “west” in Kurdish).

But since the fall of dictator Bashar al-Assad , Syria’s new leadership has formed its own alliance with Washington and pushed the Kurds to give up their aspirations of autonomy.

Violent clashes with government forces in January saw the Kurds driven out from the city of Aleppo . They later evacuated Raqqa and Deir Ezzor .

The SDF, which previously controlled around 30 percent of Syria’s territory, has been pushed back to strongholds along the Turkish border in al-Hasakah, Qamishli and Kobane and handed over governance of prisons holding thousands of IS group members.

“The original purpose of the SDF as the primary anti-ISIS force on the ground has largely expired, as Damascus is now both willing and positioned to take over security responsibilities, including control of ISIS detention facilities and camps,” US ambassador to Syria Tom Barrack wrote on X , using an alternative acronym for the IS group.

Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa has now given the Kurds until January 24 to propose a plan for the peaceful integration of Rojava into the Syrian state.

Are the Kurds' gains in autonomy and sovereignty over the last few years now disintegrating?

Adel Bakawan, director of the European Institute for Studies on the Middle East and North Africa (EISMENA) and author of " La Décomposition du Moyen-Orient. Trois ruptures qui ont fait basculer l'Histoire ” (“The Decomposition of the Middle East: Three Breakdowns that Changed History”) explains.

FRANCE 24: Why have Syria’s Kurds been cornered so successfully by Sharaa?

During the Syrian civil war from 2011-2014, around 105 different groups were fighting, sometimes against each other.

This is when Daesh [also known as the Islamic State group] emerged from a split with al Qaeda . The United States and Europe chose to train and support the Kurds so that they could lead the fight against Daesh.

In doing so, the SDF advanced as far as Raqqa and Deir Ezzor – zones controlled by Arab tribes.

When Sharaa took power on December 8, 2024, it was thanks to his network in the Gulf: Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Turkey .

When he visited Riyadh, [Saudi leader] Mohammed bin Salman convinced [US President] Donald Trump to normalise relations with Syria, lifting sanctions and integrating it into the international coalition against Daesh.

The SDF no longer held the card of fighting against Daesh, and when the new Syrian state was integrated into the international coalition, the Kurds also had to hand over control of prisons holding thousands of Daesh leaders and militants.

Next, the Americans asked the Arab tribes that were integrated in the Kurd’s autonomous administration in north-east Syria to cut their ties with the SDF and to join Sharaa’s new army. The Kurds could not wage war against their former allies and the Syrian army, so the cities they were holding fell very quickly.

Finally, the Kurds lost control of the oil and gas fields that had financed their economy, and dams that were very important for geostrategy and geopolitics.

What room for manoeuvre do the Kurds have now?

They don’t have much leverage, except through Iraqi Kurdistan, with whom they have had disagreements throughout the 13 years of Rojava’s governance.

Thanks to strong international lobbying, Donald Trump picked up the telephone to tell Sharaa not to enter Rojava, the historic Kurdish territory.

Kurdish fighters have now left Aleppo and Raqqa. Clashes there did not spark a war – although the Kurds do still have a very powerful army. It’s a trained and armed ideological organisation, which will not surrender. And that is a means of exerting pressure.

What does the future hold for Rojava? Is it the end of the Kurds' dream of their own state?

We are entering into a grey area. It was predictable that the US would drop the Kurds, and we foresaw that. The Kurds in Rojava have also been abandoned by Israel – even though Israel has helped the Druze .

Israel will not intervene to defend the Kurds against the Syrian army now that Israel and Syria are normalising their relations.

It’s an existential question. In 2017, as they were coming out of a war with Daesh, the Iraqi Kurds played a major role in toppling the caliphate in Mosul and organised a referendum on independence for Iraqi Kurdistan.

Iraq’s Kurds voted 93 percent in favour, but the international community was fiercely opposed, and all the territories were recovered.

In 2019, when the Syrian Kurds were at the height of their powers in Afrin, a very strategic location for them, the Americans gave the green light for pro-Turkish militia organisations to occupy the city. It was a tragic blow for the Kurds.

Is it the end of the dream of independence? There are 50-60 million Kurds, making them the largest people in the Middle East without their own state. How can you stabilise and secure the Middle East when you have 60 million people that have been betrayed and abandoned?

If the international community wants to secure and stabilise the region there must be a Palestinian state and a Kurdish state.

And as the dream of independence has become fragile in Rojava, it has become much more plausible in Iraqi Kurdistan.

What impact will this have on Turkey and its peace process with the Kurdistan Workers’ Party ( PKK )?

[PKK leader] Abdullah Ocalan sent a letter to the group from prison asking it to disband, put down its weapons and stop demanding Kurdish independence, federalism, autonomy and even decentralisation.

Its goal is now to fight for a democratic society in Turkey.

The Turks believe this applies to not only the PKK in Turkey but also its branches in Iraq , Syria and Iran – but Abdullah Ocalan has not clearly stated a position on this.

Turkey has strongly encouraged and supported Sharaa’s offensive into territory controlled by the Kurds, while asking that he integrates the Kurds into the new Syria.

But for Turkey to implement its grand strategy across the Middle East, it needs to foster a relationship of “ eternal brotherhood ” with the Kurds.

Turkey, 20 years ago, did all it could to undermine the regional government in Kurdistan. Today its greatest ally in the region is the Kurdistan regional government in Iraq.

The West has for years relied on the Kurds to fight Daesh. Can the Syrian army really take over this fight?

Sharaa has renounced his former radical beliefs. He is pragmatic and knows how the international arena works. A Qatari communication firm has been helping him with everything from the choice of his suits to trimming his beard.

What interests me is his militant base that must now wage war against Daesh, the Kurds, the Alawites and the Druze.

Sharaa abandoned al Qaeda for Daesh and created its Syrian branch with authorisation from the caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi . And his militant base has absolutely not changed.

When I analyse videos, accounts and speeches on the ground I don’t really see a big difference between the Daesh of 2014 and 2019. Their entire lives are shaped by radical ideology.

For example, they still associate the Kurds with pigs and heretics who must be killed. It’s exactly the same ideology as before.

Personally, I think that the international community will regret transferring the fight against Daesh from the SDF to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham [HTS, the Islamist rebel group directed by Sharaa during the war]. How can he control his militant base?

Beyond this, the new Syrian army, which has been entrusted with the fight against Daesh, is not homogenous.

There were around 500 armed groups fighting against Bashar al-Assad. Their loyalty ranges from the Syrian state, to Turkey, to Saudi Arabia. So, it’s a very, very risky gamble.

While many people at the event told Reuters they thought some of Trump's positions on global issues, such as demands that Europe spend more on its own security, had merit, they were deeply offended by the way he and his team presented them.

"It was kind of overwhelming. It was the full Trump show we got here," said Conradin Cramer, head of the cantonal government of the Swiss city of Basel following Trump's address on Wednesday to the World Economic Forum's annual meeting.

"He was very outspoken against Europe, against European values, and that was frightening for me," Cramer told Reuters.

Business leaders were also nervous, with two U.S.-based bankers admitting at the start they were worried about a full-blown trade war developing that would hit business sentiment.

Several participants said that by some measures, this was one of the most eventful meetings in five decades of the WEF, which had labelled this year's event "A Spirit of Dialogue".

Trump struck a Greenland deal on the sidelines with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and oversaw the signing of his new Board of Peace , drawing several world leaders to Davos.

The president and other U.S. officials also said they were close to a peace deal in Ukraine, which came into focus on Thursday when President Volodymyr Zelenskiy travelled to Davos.

President Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev also held talks with U.S. officials on the sidelines, the first Russian official to come to Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

Several participants told Reuters that the annual meeting -- the first since WEF founder Klaus Schwab's departure last year -- had been a win for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink.

A spokesperson said Schwab was not available for comment.

Fink, who is also WEF co-chair, used his influence to attract big names including billionaire Elon Musk, who made his Davos debut as a last-minute addition to the agenda.

Trump said Fink turned everything he touched to gold.

Moderators in some sessions appeared to avoid tough questions and the agenda largely skirted issues that the Trump administration has opposed. The programme featured four sessions that referenced climate change, whereas in 2022 there were 16.

Trump spoke for more than an hour, well over his allotted time on the agenda, and by the time he sat down for a moderated question-and-answer session a small but steady trickle of delegates were already leaving the room.

Several participants said that while Trump loomed large, business did get done at Davos, with executives meeting clients and customers and discussing issues ranging from geopolitics and trade to stablecoins and artificial intelligence.

Francesco Ceccato, CEO of Barclays in Europe, said the meeting had a "mixture of geopolitics that can't be ignored".

But there had also been "a lot of really interesting dialogue" around AI and related issues such as investment risk and energy needs, Ceccato told Reuters.

The Trump agenda permeated many of the discussions.

U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick drew sharp reactions when he slammed Europe at a Fink-hosted dinner, which European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde walked out of .

The next night at a Bank of America soiree, Lutnick held court with CEO Brian Moynihan, said a source familiar with the event at 'Goals House', where British finance minister Rachel Reeves played chess and Marcus Mumford performed live, including an acoustic version of Bruce Springsteen's 'I'm on Fire'.

As usual at the parties and meetings around Davos, attendees gossiped and traded rumours, although some triggered anxiety.

Early on in the week, one circulated that mobile and internet networks would be shut down when Trump arrived in town.

As it turned out, both phones and internet worked fine.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:26:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZWGW5WZQEFOWFCC5QJVVGYWDHE.jpg?auth=dbffd4941dff070c188d85cc3566dae5ef2c8ebc73e4f323f5d8adb50f9a16f0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU concerned about Trump 'concentration of powers' over 'Board of Peace', document says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eu-concerned-about-trump-concentration-powers-over-board-peace-document-says-2026-01-23/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The European Union’s foreign policy arm has raised questions about U.S. President Donald Trump’s broad powers over his new Board of Peace, according to an internal document seen by Reuters.

Trump has urged world leaders to join his Board of Peace initiative aimed at resolving conflicts globally, but many Western heads of government have been reluctant to take part .

In a confidential analysis dated January 19 and shared with the EU’s member countries, the European External Action Service expressed worries about a concentration of power in Trump’s hands.

The Board of Peace's charter “raises a concern under the EU’s constitutional principles” and “the autonomy of the EU legal order also militates against a concentration of powers in the hands of the chairman,” the bloc’s diplomatic service wrote.

The document also says the new Board of Peace “departs significantly” from the mandate that was authorized by the United Nations Security Council in November and solely focused on the Gaza conflict .

The new board, which the U.S. president launched on Thursday , is chaired for life by Trump and is set to start by addressing the Gaza conflict and then be expanded to deal with other conflicts. Member states are limited to three-year terms unless they pay $1 billion each to fund the board's activities and earn permanent membership.

"Once this board is completely formed, we can do pretty much whatever we want to do. And we'll do it in conjunction with the United Nations," Trump said, adding that the U.N. had great potential that had not been fully utilised.

After European leaders met to discuss the transatlantic relationship on Thursday evening, European Council President Antonio Costa told reporters: "We have serious doubts about a number of elements in the charter of the Board of Peace, related to its scope, its governance and its compatibility with the United Nations charter.”

Costa said that the EU was “ready to work together with the United States on the implementation of the comprehensive Peace Plan for Gaza, with a Board of Peace carrying out its mission as a transitional administration, in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolution 2803”.

Several EU countries, including France and Spain , have already said they would not be joining the board.

In its analysis, the EU’s diplomatic service said that “the provision that a Member State’s choice about the level of its participation needs the approval of the chairman constitutes an undue interference with the organisational autonomy of each member”.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:26:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EDTAIJS6XFP6JJDKHQTC22YG4Y.jpg?auth=978b586a078995fa8775ac7a3b86386209d53e30fbbc2e3aab243d039078d91d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French Navy diverts suspected Russian shadow fleet tanker 'GRINCH' to Marseille-Fos port</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-navy-diverts-suspected-russian-shadow-fleet-tanker-grinch-marseille-fos-2026-01-23/</link><description>MARSEILLE, France, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The French navy has diverted the Grinch oil tanker it detained on Thursday towards the port of Marseille-Fos for further investigation, a source close to the investigation told Reuters on Friday.

The navy had intercepted the tanker, which had left the Russian port of Murmansk in early January, on suspicion of operating under a false flag and belonging to the "shadow fleet" that enables Russia to export oil despite sanctions.

The ship was sailing under a Comoros flag.

The interception was on high seas in the western Mediterranean, between the southern coast of Spain and the northern coast of Morocco, the French maritime police said in a statement on Thursday. It added that navies of other countries, including Britain, supported the operation.

The office of the prosecutor of Marseille, which handles matters related to maritime law and is investigating the case, said on Friday that the ship had been diverted, but did not specify where to.

The EU has imposed 19 packages of sanctions against Russia, but Moscow has adapted to most measures and continues to sell millions of barrels of oil to countries such as India and China, typically at discounted prices.

Much of the oil is carried by what is known as a shadow fleet of vessels operating outside of the Western maritime industry.

In October, France detained another sanctioned tanker, the Boracay, off its west coast and released it after a few days.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:28:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DIVQV4GHBZN35BPI5AS7JCFNJA.jpg?auth=97202f4a642e5f53762490730102879e250368a1ccd4c0d37b9ae4b533bd9d60&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spanish prosecutors drop abuse case against Julio Iglesias</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spanish-prosecutors-drop-abuse-case-against-julio-iglesias-2026-01-23/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Prosecutors at Spain's High Court have shelved a preliminary investigation into singer Julio Iglesias, saying on Friday that the court lacked jurisdiction as the alleged crimes were abroad and the accusers did not reside in the country.

Rights group Women's Link Worldwide had filed the complaint on January 5 on behalf of two women said to have worked in Iglesias' Caribbean residences over a 10-month period in 2021, based on an investigation by U.S. broadcaster Univision and Spanish outlet elDiario.es.

The accusations included human trafficking for forced labour and servitude, sexual assault and violations of workers' rights. Iglesias described them as "completely false" in various social media posts.

Attempts by Reuters to contact representatives of Iglesias, 82, have gone unanswered. His record label Sony has declined to comment on the case.

The prosecutor's office said in a filing seen by Reuters that the High Court was unable to try Iglesias as the alleged crimes were in the Dominican Republic and Bahamas, adding that prosecution could still be sought in those two countries.

In addition, the alleged victims were not Spanish and did not reside in Spain, it said, citing Supreme Court jurisprudence that limited the legal principle of universal jurisdiction.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:28:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio says Haiti transitional council must be dissolved by Feb 7</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rubio-says-haiti-transitional-council-must-be-dissolved-by-feb-7-2026-01-23/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 23 - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Friday that Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council (CPT) must be dissolved by February 7, as he backed Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé in a phone call with the Haitian leader, State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said in a statement.

Here's what we learned:

Europe learned the value of standing up to Trump . His claim to Greenland crossed all of its red lines on territorial sovereignty and Europe's resistance, possibly helped by the ensuing fall on financial markets, was seen as one reason he backed off.

But Europe's trust in the transatlantic relationship with Washington has been badly rattled, and its leaders are looking at how to act faster when the next crisis occurs.

"There are efforts to advance European decision-making. We are probably too slow," one European Union official said.

Many European leaders and executives said they found the Trump administration's approach offensive and rude, even as some said the U.S. president had raised legitimate issues.

Ukraine was at first overshadowed during Davos, but as Trump announced a deal on Greenland, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy flew in for talks.

A peace deal appears elusive, despite U.S., Ukrainian and Russian officials speaking of progress and Zelenskiy said territorial issues were still unresolved.

In another sign of the influence of the Trump administration on the agenda, Russian President Vladimir Putin's envoy Kirill Dmitriev landed in Davos for talks with U.S. officials on Tuesday - the first Russian official to visit Davos since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.

Dmitriev held talks at the USA House, without attending the Forum itself.

Leaders openly debated not just whether Trump might strike Iran, but what would come after. Would the regime crumble? And if it did, who would own the fallout? Trump's unpredictability once again became a defining feature of the event.

U.S. threats on the eve of the meeting to impose tariffs on European allies for resisting Trump's ambition to acquire Greenland inflamed trade tensions and reinforced concerns among some CEOs that Europe can no longer rely on the U.S.

"When you talk to CEOs today, what do they want? Stability, predictability, and the rule of law. I would say it's in short supply," Canadian Finance Minister François-Philippe Champagne said during a debate on tariffs.

Trump's gambit added fuel to arguments of those advocating for countries and companies to diversify commerce away from an increasingly protectionist U.S. and to trade more with each other.

Financial services firms hoped for increased business activity and growth this year, as they contended with potential disruption from U.S. policy, geopolitics, artificial intelligence and financial technology.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned that a proposal to cap credit card interest rates would amount to economic disaster, while other bankers said they were trying to shape the administration's policy on affordability.

Crypto industry executives talked up stablecoins and blockchain technology's potential to disrupt finance. Some bankers said they are experimenting with the new technology, while others remained wary.

Meanwhile, the macroeconomic outlook, questions about the U.S. Federal Reserve's independence and fears about bubbles in AI and other assets weighed on investors' minds.

The tech industry came to Davos in full force, with rare appearances by Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Nvidia's Jensen Huang.

AI startup Anthropic set up office space on Davos' main drag for the week, aiming to grow its enterprise sales. And unlike the scepticism of late 2025, executives said they were putting concerns that the market overvalued AI companies behind them.

While jobs would disappear, they said new ones would spring up. AI would be an excuse to justify layoffs, not necessarily the cause, two business leaders told Reuters.

But union leaders feared AI would destroy jobs and lead to more inequality, with some demanding regulation and training.

Big Oil returned to Davos with a vengeance after a year of Trump's presidency, as he orders a pause on wind parks and tells U.S. companies to drill for more oil at home and abroad.

U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told a panel that global oil production needs to more than double to meet rising energy demand, challenging widespread analysts' views that demand may peak in the next two decades.

Wright also said Europe and the U.S. state of California were wasting too much money on green energy investments. The Trump administration is radically changing the narrative and the oil industry likes it, one oil executive said.

But breaking ranks with Trump on renewable energy, Elon Musk said the U.S. could produce enough solar power to meet all of its electricity needs, including booming demand from the proliferation of Big Tech's power-hungry data centers.

"You could take a small corner of Utah, Nevada or New Mexico - a very small percentage of the area of the U.S. - to generate all of the electricity that the U.S. uses," he added.

"Unfortunately, the tariff barriers for solar are extremely high and that makes the economics of deploying solar artificially high," Musk said.

The world breathed a sigh of relief after Trump spoke of no military solution to his demands for Greenland. But some executives set their hopes on increased European and U.S. defence spending, including construction projects and hiring.

Trump also talked about a secret sonic weapon that he said was used during the capture of Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro.

Russia and China will have to go back to the drawing board, Trump said. Russian secret services are looking into it, the Kremlin said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 17:50:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4YJKUNRDURJEPKV5ZSB2KSFUEQ.jpg?auth=8876dac4a9d2ad294b1cba969438a4ea8be368a9bb62c9c7af806bce821502cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Lawsuit challenges Trump ending Ethiopians' temporary legal status</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/lawsuit-challenges-trump-ending-ethiopians-temporary-legal-status-2026-01-23/</link><description>BOSTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Immigrant rights advocates have filed a lawsuit seeking to block U.S. President Donald Trump's administration from ending temporary protections from deportation that had been granted to thousands of Ethiopians living in the United States.

Three Ethiopian nationals, along with the non-profit African Communities Together, allege in a lawsuit , opens new tab filed in Boston federal court on Thursday that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security is unlawfully putting over 5,000 people at risk of losing their temporary protected status after February 13.

They say that while Ethiopia remains a country in a humanitarian crisis, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem unlawfully terminated the Ethiopians' legal status with just 60 days' notice based on an unconstitutional animus, or ill will, against non-white immigrants. Ethiopia's population is predominantly Black.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

The case is the latest in a series of lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's efforts to curtail protections from deportation extended to citizens of numerous countries through grants of TPS.

Under federal law, TPS is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

Numerous lawsuits have been filed challenging the administration's moves to end similar protections for nationals from countries, including Syria , Venezuela , Haiti , Nicaragua and South Sudan , leading to court rulings that have at times slowed or halted the Trump administration's efforts to strip migrants of their legal status.

The latest lawsuit was filed after DHS said on December 12 it was ending TPS for Ethiopia, saying conditions in the African nation no longer posed a serious threat to people returning safely to it and that TPS was "never meant to be a ticket to permanent residency."

Former Democratic President Joe Biden's administration granted Ethiopians already in the United States that status beginning in 2022, citing the need to protect citizens fleeing armed conflict in their home nation.

The Ethiopian military and allies, including troops from neighboring Eritrea, had been battling forces from the northern region of Tigray in a conflict that killed thousands and displaced millions of people.

While that civil war formally ended later in 2022, the Biden administration extended TPS for Ethiopians in mid-2024, citing armed conflict in another region, Amhara , which is ongoing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:38:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PG7LMET3BROIFKHSJ53X4INAQE.jpg?auth=989e94e7d9e0d3faa8fd482748b250bfedae837e6f6143a5ee5d7487d546f7f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkish court rejects bid by Erdogan rival to overcome block to his presidential run</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/turkish-court-rejects-bid-by-erdogan-rival-overcome-block-his-presidential-run-2026-01-23/</link><description>ISTANBUL, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A Turkish court rejected on Friday a lawsuit from jailed Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu challenging the cancellation of his university degree, his legal team said, in a further blow to his plans to run for the presidency in the next election.

Imamoglu, who is President Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, has been since last March, pending trial on corruption charges. He received a separate prison sentence in July for insulting and threatening the city’s chief prosecutor.

Without a university degree, Imamoglu cannot stand as a candidate for president. His legal team told Reuters that he would appeal against Friday's court ruling.

His jailing has been criticised by Imamoglu's opposition Republican People's Party (CHP), other opposition parties, some Western leaders and rights groups as an anti-democratic move aimed at eliminating an electoral threat to Erdogan.

Imamoglu himself has denied all the accusations against him, saying they are politically motivated. Erdogan's government denies political pressure on the courts and says the judiciary is independent.

Istanbul University said last March it had annulled Imamoglu’s degree, days before the opposition picked him as its presidential candidate in the next election, which is scheduled to take place in 2028.

Imamoglu has said the university's decision was illegal and outside its jurisdiction.

In a post on X, CHP Vice Chair Burhanettin Bulut said the court's dismissal of the diploma case amounted to a political decision that showed the judiciary was being used against rivals.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 18:38:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XCWZW2KYJVLE5M2JRXCWZFNJXU.jpg?auth=45e9423c5bfaac4c5a191a128321f134af10b7dd20f4ed4c24220b89eaf0f41d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Prince Harry says sacrifices by NATO troops in Afghanistan deserve 'respect' after Trump comments</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/prince-harry-says-sacrifices-by-nato-troops-afghanistan-deserve-respect-after-2026-01-23/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry said in response to comments from U.S. President Donald Trump that NATO troops stayed off the front line in Afghanistan, that "sacrifices" made in the conflict by NATO forces "deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect".

"We are the ones who appointed Didier Fils-Aime in November 2024. We are the ones who worked with him for a year, and it is up to us to issue a new decree naming a new prime minister, a new government and a new presidency," Transitional Presidential Council (CPT) member Leslie Voltaire told a press conference.

The CPT, which sacked its first prime minister six months into the job, was appointed to oversee a move towards Haiti's first election in a decade, but this was repeatedly pushed back due to worsening insecurity amid conflict with powerful gangs.

It acts as the country's top executive body.

Five of nine CPT members have signed a resolution to remove Fils-Aime, several of those members have said. However, it has yet to be published in the country's official gazette, a necessary step before the decision becomes legally valid.

Voltaire spoke alongside fellow CPT member Edgard Leblanc Fils, who said the plan was to replace Fils-Aime within a maximum of thirty days. Voltaire said there would be a "pause" to allow political groups to find an acceptable solution for the political succession.

Washington has issued several strong warnings against Fils-Aime's removal, saying it would take firm action against politicians it deems corrupt and that the CPT must be dissolved when their mandate ends on February 7.

No official plan has been put forward for the succession, but Haiti's U.N. envoy on Thursday signaled that a prime minister could continue to head the country after the CPT's term is up.

Speaking to Radio Kiskeya on Thursday, CPT member Louis Gerard-Gilles, who also supported the ouster, said he could be replaced by Finance Minister Alfred Metellus, a public sector veteran and former IDB consultant.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 19:26:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ANOMMERXHZO53EAKP7HXV43DKM.jpg?auth=bd479b76c93083d6500a5da294115e8d9fab254a8c00c94b63c78386aa14d1ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kosovo detains 109 after vote tampering probe forces recount</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/kosovo-detains-109-after-vote-tampering-probe-forces-recount-2026-01-23/</link><description>PRISTINA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - More than 100 people have been detained on suspicion of tampering with votes from Kosovo's December 28 election , prosecutors said, amid investigations that have triggered a recount that could delay the formation of a new government.

The inquiries are not expected to overturn the victory of incumbent Prime Minister Albin Kurti's party , as prosecutors said the suspects were accused of switching votes between candidates on individual party lists - not between different parties - under the proportional representation system.

But they were seen as a severe embarrassment for the young country which aims to join the European Union.

Kurti's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bedri Hamza, head of the country's second biggest movement, the Democratic Party of Kosovo, called the discrepancies "deeply concerning".

The Kosovo Election Commission said it was launching initial investigations two weeks ago after checks on videos from some counting centres showed irregularities.

On Monday, it ordered a total vote recount, saying problems had been found in multiple locations.

On Friday, the Chief Prosecutor in the southern town of Prizren, Petrit Kryeziu, said 109 suspects had been detained on suspicion of changing votes there to favour certain candidates on lists drawn up by individual parties.

The suspects were officials, known as election commissioners, chosen to count votes by the parties under Kosovo's electoral system. Some were suspected of taking bribes, and officials from all four major parties must have been involved, Kryeziu added.

"It would have been impossible for these votes to be altered if there had been no compromise from the commissioners to do this from all four largest parties," Kryeziu said during a press conference.

“Now we have cooperative witnesses who have explained the methods of pressure used on them and some have revealed details of who took and who offered bribes to them,” Kryeziu added.

Similar arrests are expected in other towns, officials told Reuters.

“The manipulation of votes for candidates for MPs is a big embarrassment for Kosovo," political commentator Ilir Deda said. "It has eroded public trust in the electoral processes."

On Friday, the election commission said it had recounted more than half of the votes, and so far only one candidate had lost his seat to another candidate from the same party as a result.

Most of the candidates who are said to have benefited from the additional votes have denied any wrongdoing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 19:27:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/34ZPXV37NFO5LEOXZTL4AEQIBU.jpg?auth=a7a6b1a0261dc224797714c2dcfba592215f392edfeeb40cf76c7470d94de171&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Dangerous' winter storm to sweep US with snow, ice and deadly cold</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260123-catastrophic-ice-storm-set-to-sweep-across-us-over-weekend</link><description>A massive winter storm was set to drop a hazardous mix of freezing rain and heavy snow on some 160 million Americans starting Friday, threatening "catastrophic" icy conditions.

Multiple US states had declared states of emergency as meteorologists said the storm system forming off the California coast would soon begin its march across much of the continental US, covering a wide swath of the country's middle including the Rockies and Plains.

It could bring "catastrophic ice accumulation", the National Weather Service said, and could result in "long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous or impassable travel conditions".

The storm was expected to linger for days, shifting into the heavily populated mid-Atlantic and northeastern states while crippling daily life and ushering in a frigid air mass across wide areas of the country.

More than 1,500 weekend flights had already been cancelled, according to the tracker Flightaware, including many in Texas .

State officials there vowed the power grid that failed during a deadly winter storm five years ago and left millions without power was prepared this time around.

The southern state's Republican Governor Greg Abbott told journalists Thursday that "there is no expectation whatsoever that there's going to be any loss of power from the power grid" which he said "has never been stronger, never been more prepared and is fully capable of handling this winter storm".

Meanwhile in New York state, Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul warned of extreme cold that could make even short trips outdoors dangerous, urging people to stock up now, avoid unnecessary travel and stay inside.

She emphasised risks ranging from hypothermia and heart attacks while shoveling to power outages, while stressing precautions like protecting pipes, using heaters safely and checking on vulnerable neighbours.

Hochul told reporters the state is fully mobilised, with thousands of utility workers, plows and emergency crews on standby to keep roads clear, restore power and protect those most at risk.

"Five or six minutes outside could literally be dangerous for your health," she said, adding that "hypothermia can settle in quickly, frostbite can settle in".

The storm is set to usher in frigid temperatures and dangerous winds that could last a week in some areas. As of Friday morning, parts of the Upper Midwest were already experiencing wind chills forecast to hit in the range of -48C.

The brutal storm system is the result of a stretched "polar vortex," an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes stretches into a more oval shape, sending cold air spilling across North America.

Scientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions of the polar vortex may be linked to climate change , though the debate is not yet settled and natural variability also plays a role.

But US President Donald Trump – who scoffs at climate change science and has rolled back green energy policies – wasted no time in questioning how the cold front fit into broader climate shifts.

"Record Cold Wave expected to hit 40 States. Rarely seen anything like it before. Could the Environmental Insurrectionists please explain – WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???," the Republican leader posted on his platform Truth Social.

State officials were more focused on the immediate threats the powerful storm posed to residents, with at least 14 states from the south to the northeast as well as Washington, DC declaring states of emergency.

Political leaders across the country were encouraging people to stock up on food and dry goods, prepare emergency first aid and supply kits and keep their vehicle gas tanks full to prevent fuel lines from freezing.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 19:27:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4d378ac0-f88b-11f0-8eb8-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP5598506934977103.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Relatives of Argentine prisoners in Venezuela ask Vatican to intervene for release</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/relatives-argentine-prisoners-venezuela-ask-vatican-intervene-release-2026-01-23/</link><description>BUENOS AIRES, Jan 23 (Reuters) - The families of two Argentines detained in Venezuela on Friday appealed to the Vatican to intervene, urging it to help speed the release of their loved ones as Caracas has begun freeing some detainees.

The wife of Nahuel Agustín Gallo, a national security officer arrested on Dec 8, 2024, and the wife of German Giuliani, a lawyer imprisoned since May 2025, delivered a formal petition to the Catholic Church in Buenos Aires, calling for urgent action by the Holy See.

"There are still many innocent people missing, many who need to be released," said Alexandra Gomez, Gallo's wife. "These piecemeal releases only wear down the families," she added.

Gomez said her husband had been "forcibly disappeared in Venezuela for 411 days."

In a letter seen by Reuters, addressed to Pope Leo and Cardinal Pietro Parolin, relatives appealed to "the humanitarian sensitivity and the permanent commitment of the Holy See to the defense of human dignity, freedom and fundamental rights."

The families also demanded immediate steps to safeguard the physical and psychological well-being of the detainees.

The women were joined by relatives and friends of Venezuelan political prisoners who demonstrated outside with photographs of the detained, national flags and placards reading "They took them alive, we want them back alive" and "Political prisoners are not bargaining chips.

"We were glad they received us," said Virginia Rivero, wife of Giuliani. "But it felt a bit lukewarm. There were things they perhaps didn’t know."

Venezuela's interim authorities have begun releasing political prisoners and other detainees, though many still remain behind bars amid ongoing political tension.

The wave of releases comes as Caracas seeks to ease domestic pressure and signal a possible thaw with Washington following heightened U.S.–Venezuela confrontations.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:28:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNCHSESDOZMZDLMHGFBS4NWWSE.jpg?auth=126d388efe7dc5207cb752357c66ef86c19d8b8232fb0b76802ace4ea48b0e91&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ivory Coast president appoints brother as vice prime minister</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/ivory-coast-president-appoints-brother-vice-prime-minister-2026-01-23/</link><description>ABIDJAN, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara reshuffled his cabinet on Friday, maintaining most senior ministers while appointing his brother, Defence Minister Tene Birahima Ouattara, to the newly created role of vice prime minister, which he will hold alongside his defence portfolio.

The move elevates the younger Ouattara within the government hierarchy, while most key portfolios remained unchanged, signaling continuity rather than a comprehensive overhaul.

The reshuffle follows Ouattara's re-election in October and his party's victory in December's legislative elections, securing a parliamentary majority .

Ouattara, 84, a former deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has led the country since 2011 and has said that he intends to prepare the ground for a new generation of political leaders during his tenure.

The changes come as Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer, seeks to build on nearly 15 years of sustained economic growth that has made it among the region's fastest-growing economies.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:30:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F4RBG4PNFJPN7MDATI4DA6FQUI.jpg?auth=25082a7213b26e6de336d61907fce8172e89a213b11b7e91ad5c82b20f841b58&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey says Syria ceasefire should hold during Islamic State prisoner transfers to Iraq</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-says-syria-ceasefire-should-hold-during-islamic-state-prisoner-transfers-2026-01-23/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Turkey's foreign minister said the current ceasefire in Syria should remain in place while Islamic State prisoners are transferred to Iraq, saying this would limit security risks.

French couple Jacques and Jessica Moretti's bar, Le Constellation, in the ski resort of Crans-Montana, caught fire early on January 1 as party-goers celebrated.

Forty people, mostly teenagers, were killed in the blaze, and 116 others were injured.

The Morettis are under criminal investigation, facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence and arson by negligence.

Prosecutors believe the fire started when revellers raised champagne bottles with sparklers attached close to sound insulation foam on the ceiling of the bar's basement level.

Investigators are analysing whether the foam met safety standards, and whether the bar's fittings, fire safety equipment and emergency exits were all in order.

Jacques Moretti had been held in custody since January 9, while his wife has remained at liberty, under certain restrictions.

But he was cleared for release on bail of 200,000 Swiss francs ($250,000).

Jean-Luc Addor, a lawyer for the relatives of a teenager killed in the tragedy, said it was "a scandal and a disgrace to the victims and their families".

The Compulsory Measures Court in Wallis canton said in a statement it had duly "lifted the detention in custody" at a hearing on Friday.

Instead, it ordered "standard measures ... designed to counter the risk of flight" – namely a ban on leaving Switzerland , the surrender of identity and residence documents and reporting daily to a police station.

The bail was paid by a close friend, the statement said.

A statement from the Morettis's lawyers said the couple "will continue to respond to all requests from the authorities. Their thoughts remain with the victims of this tragedy".

Lawyers for victims' families were taken aback by the decision.

Christophe De Galembert, representing a bereaved father, said it was an "unexpected and shocking decision".

Romain Jordan, a lawyer for several victims' families, told AFP: "My clients note that, once again, no consideration has been given to the risk of collusion and the disappearance of evidence – a risk that greatly concerns them and compromises the integrity of the investigation."

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani called it a "real affront" to the victims' families. Six Italians were among those killed.

"We will strengthen our support and solidarity with the parents of the victims of this extraordinary tragedy. We will continue to work together to ensure that the Swiss authorities ascertain the truth, and responsibility for what happened," he said on X.

The bar's owners were formally questioned for a second time this week, with both facing 10 hours of questioning.

They will face a further round of questioning at a date yet to be fixed, prosecutors said.

Around 70 of the injured were still in hospital in Switzerland and abroad, Swiss authorities and hospitals said.

Patients were sent to specialist burns facilities around Switzerland and in neighbouring France , Germany and Italy , as well as Belgium .

According to sources contacted by AFP between Wednesday and Friday, around 26 people were still in Swiss hospitals this week: 12 in Zurich, 10 in Lausanne, two in Geneva and two in Wallis.

Switzerland's Federal Office for Civil Protection said on Thursday that 44 victims – Swiss and foreign – were still in hospitals abroad.

The picture is constantly changing, with patients moving between hospitals for different stages of their treatment, and some patients being readmitted.

Some are still in intensive care and some remain in a serious condition.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 20:50:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4a738e4a-f888-11f0-b984-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/ebd425b7f8973e95cf85a4a4875f4438c7e3526c.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN rights council steps up scrutiny of Iran crackdown as NGO puts death toll past 5,000</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260123-un-rights-council-steps-us-scrutiny-of-iran-after-death-toll-surpasses-5-000</link><description>The UN Human Rights Council decided Friday to deepen its scrutiny of Iran over its crackdown on protests that left thousands dead , including children, amid demands it end its "brutal repression".

The 47-member body voiced alarm about "the unprecedented scale of the violent crackdown on peaceful protests by security forces" in Iran .

With 25 votes in favour, seven opposed and the rest abstaining, it decided to extend and broaden the mandate of independent investigators gathering evidence towards ensuring accountability for rights violations in the country.

"A climate of fear and systematic impunity cannot be tolerated," Iceland 's ambassador Einar Gunnarsson said as he presented the text to the council before the vote. "Victims and survivors deserve truth, justice and accountability."

Stressing the need for "accountability", the adopted text extends the mandate of a special rapporteur on Iran for another year.

It also extended for two years the work of a separate fact-finding mission set up in November 2022, following Iran's crackdown on a wave of protests sparked by the death in custody of a Kurdish-Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini .

The resolution empowers the investigative body to probe "allegations of recent and ongoing serious human rights violations and abuses, and crimes perpetrated in relation to the protests".

The vote came at the end of an urgent session of the rights council, requested by Britain, Germany , Iceland , Moldova and North Macedonia , but harshly criticised by Iran.

In his opening remarks to the council, UN rights chief Volker Turk described how security forces used "live ammunition" against protesters, decrying that "thousands" had been killed, including children.

"I call on the Iranian authorities to reconsider, to pull back, and to end their brutal repression, including summary trials and disproportionate sentences," he said.

"I call for the immediate release of all those arbitrarily detained by the Iranian authorities, and I call for a complete moratorium on the death penalty."

His comments were broadly echoed during the rights council special session.

"There must be accountability for the dire events of the past weeks, and justice must be done for all those who were killed, injured or detained only for exercising their human rights and for voicing legitimate demands," the European Union representative Michele Cervone d'Urso told the gathering.

Iranian ambassador Ali Bahreini however slammed Friday's meeting as "posturing" and "a pressure tool against Iran". His colleague Somayeh Karimdoost described the resolution as "a thoroughly unbalanced biased and politically motivated text".

Watch more Iran's regime cannot 'hold its power just through terror', activist says

A number of countries also came to Iran's defence, accusing the council of being "politicised" and showing "double standards".

Cuban ambassador Rodolfo Benitez slammed the session as an "act of supreme cynicism", while China 's ambassador Jia Guide said Beijing "opposed interference in other countries' internal affairs on the pretext of human rights".

Turk's office and NGOs tracking the toll from the crackdown on the biggest protests in Iran in years have said their task has been impeded by a now two-week internet shutdown.

Giving their first official toll from the protests, Iranian authorities on Wednesday said 3,117 people had been killed since the massive demonstrations erupted late December.

But the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency on Friday put the number of deaths at more than 5,000, warning the confirmed figures were likely to be far lower than the actual toll.

Another NGO, Norway-based Iran Human Rights, has warned the final toll risks reaching the scale of 25,000.

The protests have now largely halted, but while "the killing in the streets of Iran may have subsided ... the brutality continues", Turk warned.

"I am deeply concerned by contradictory statements from the Iranian authorities about whether those detained in connection with the protests may be executed," Turk said.

He pointed out that Iran "remains among the top executioner states in the world", with at least 1,500 people reportedly executed there last year.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 21:25:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c784292e-f885-11f0-9194-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/15b75a3b5557ca5042c8ae1658c6b52d53f3adf1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea Prime Minister Kim holds talks with US VP Vance in Washington, Yonhap says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-prime-minister-kim-holds-talks-with-us-vp-vance-washington-yonhap-2026-01-23/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 24 (Reuters) - South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-seok, who is visiting the United States, held talks with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Washington, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported on Saturday.

The US initially drafted a plan to end the conflict that was heavily criticised in Kyiv and western Europe for being too close to Russia's line, while later proposals were criticised by Moscow for floating the idea of European peacekeepers.

Ahead of Friday's talks, which are set to continue on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said territory remained the key issue – with Moscow having said it is not dropping its demand that Kyiv pull out of its eastern Donbas region.

After the first day of talks, Ukraine's chief negotiator Rustem Umerov posted on social media that the meeting had focused "on the parameters for ending Russia's war and the further logic of the negotiation process", adding that meetings were scheduled for Saturday.

The UAE foreign ministry said in an earlier statement the talks were scheduled to last two days and were "part of ongoing efforts to promote dialogue and identify political solutions to the crisis".

Trump met Zelensky at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday and US envoy Steve Witkoff later held talks with Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin .

The Emirates meeting took place as thousands of people in Kyiv were without heating in sub-zero temperatures due to Russian strikes.

The European Union , which has sent hundreds of generators, accused Moscow of "deliberately depriving civilians of heat".

Kyiv said Russian strikes had killed three people on Friday in the Kharkiv region and four people – including a father and his five-year-old son – overnight in the east.

While diplomacy to end Europe's worst conflict since World War II has gained pace, Moscow and Kyiv appear deadlocked over the issue of territory.

Hours after Putin met Witkoff – and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner – in Moscow, the Kremlin said its maximalist demand that Kyiv withdraw from the eastern Donbas region still stood.

"Russia's position is well known on the fact that Ukraine, Ukrainian armed forces, have to leave the territory of the Donbas," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.

"This is a very important condition," he added.

Kyiv , which still controls around 20 percent of the eastern region, has rejected such terms.

Both sides say the fate of territory in Ukraine's east is one of the main outstanding issues in the search for a settlement to a war that has killed tens of thousands, displaced millions and decimated eastern Ukraine.

"The Donbas is a key issue," Zelensky – who said he and Trump had agreed on post-war security guarantees in Davos – told reporters on Friday, ahead of the talks.

Later in a post online, he added: "It is necessary that not only Ukraine has the desire to end the war and achieve full security, but that a similar desire somehow emerges in Russia as well."

Russian and Ukrainian negotiators are last known to have met face-to-face in Istanbul last summer, in talks that ended only in deals to exchange captured soldiers.

The Abu Dhabi meeting is the first time they have faced each other to talk about the Trump administration's plan.

Putin has repeatedly said Moscow intends to get full control of eastern Ukraine by force if talks fail.

After the Russia-US talks in the Kremlin, Putin aide Yuri Ushakov insisted Moscow was "genuinely interested in resolving" the war diplomatically.

But he added: "Until that happens, Russia will continue to achieve its objectives ... on the battlefield."

Trump has in the past pressured Ukraine to agree to terms that Kyiv sees as capitulation.

Trump repeated on Wednesday his belief that Putin and Zelensky were close to a deal.

"I believe they're at a point now where they can come together and get a deal done. And if they don't, they're stupid – that goes for both of them," he said.</description><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jan 2026 22:21:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1c46c954-f894-11f0-a316-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-23T193143Z-913083105-RC217JA1H0DX-RTRMADP-3-UKRAINE-CRISIS-RUSSIA-EMIRATES-TALKS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military says it struck vessel in eastern Pacific, killing two</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-military-says-it-struck-vessel-eastern-pacific-killing-two-2026-01-23/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - The U.S. Southern Command said on Friday it carried out a strike on a vessel in the eastern Pacific, killing two people.

Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said the two injured in the capital were in serious condition and being treated in hospital. He said there had been strikes in two districts on either side of the Dnipro River bisecting the capital.

"Kyiv is under a massive enemy attack," Klitschko wrote on the Telegram messaging app.

Ukraine's air force said both drones and missiles had been deployed in the assault on the capital.

Tymur Tkachenko, head of Kyiv's military administration, reported drone strikes in at least three districts, sparking fires in at least two locations.

Kyiv has endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year, knocking out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Emergency workers were still engaged in restoring services to residents, with overnight temperatures dipping to -13 Celsius (9 Fahrenheit).

In Kharkiv, a frequent Russian target 30 km (18 miles) from the border, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said Russian drones had attacked several districts, injuring 11 people.

Writing on Telegram, he said drones had struck a dormitory for displaced people, a hospital and a maternity hospital.

The latest attacks occurred after negotiators from Ukraine, Russia and the United States completed the first of two days of talks in the United Arab Emirates devoted to working towards a resolution of the nearly four-year-old war.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:44:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KET2DBDIQJJN5DH6PJAESZQSWY.jpg?auth=c62ad3ad450dd18f437b5e93885c35c13362432d5910d1d44304dd1a3f1ea8f1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran will treat any attack as 'all-out war against us,' says senior Iran official</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-will-treat-any-attack-all-out-war-against-us-says-senior-iran-official-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Iran will treat any attack "as an all-out war against us," a senior Iranian official said on Friday, ahead of the arrival of a U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days.

"This military buildup - we hope it is not intended for real confrontation - but our military is ready for the worst-case scenario. This is why everything is on high alert in Iran," said the senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

"This time we will treat any attack - limited, unlimited, surgical, kinetic, whatever they call it - as an all-out war against us, and we will respond in the hardest way possible to settle this," the official said.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an " armada " heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.

"If the Americans violate Iran's sovereignty and territorial integrity, we will respond," said the Iranian official. He declined to specify what an Iranian response might look like.

"A country under constant military threat from the United States has no option but to ensure that everything at its disposal can be used to push back and, if possible, restore balance against anyone who dares to attack Iran," the official said.

The U.S. military has in the past periodically sent increased forces to the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive. However, the U.S. military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran's nuclear program.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:44:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RU7CKG57WVIMRL55GBOTJ333DI.jpg?auth=b35a3109e9443f0a7e5c5f515bdbe253ea6d8e4a233f9f1fc1f76255b0ac799a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Safety fears hamper New Zealand rescue work after landslide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/safety-fears-hamper-new-zealand-rescue-work-after-landslide-2026-01-24/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 24 (Reuters) - New Zealand rescuers seeking six missing people after a landslide hit a busy campground on the country's North Island were hampered overnight due to a partial landslide in the search area, authorities said on Saturday.

Two teenagers are among those missing after heavy rains triggered Thursday's landslide at Mount Maunganui on the island's east coast, bringing down soil and rubble at the site in the city of Tauranga, crowded with families on summer holidays. No deaths resulting from the natural disaster have been reported.

Fire and Emergency New Zealand said on Saturday that 35 rescue workers, assisted by heavy machinery, were removing debris at the site after a partial slip in a section of the search area around 6 p.m. local time on Friday.

"Personnel have not searched that area since for their safety, but it is being continuously reassessed," fire and emergency official Megan Stiffler said in a statement.

Heavy rain forecast in the area on Saturday could present further challenges for rescuers, including having "to withdraw from the slip area for their safety", she said.

The authorities on Friday said rescue efforts could take several days due to the scale of the landslide and risks at the site.

No signs of life have been detected from the rubble since voices initially heard by first responders on Thursday, police have said. The youngest of the missing is aged 15.

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon visited the site on Friday and met affected families. "They are grieving incredibly hard, and I know that New Zealand grieves with them," he said.

The heavy rain this week unleashed another landslide in the neighbouring suburb of Papamoa, killing two.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:44:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PXU2ZMI7RNPRHJXOZAIFQNMP3Q.jpg?auth=985deb2fa1ba15aa8715d1dbbdc433d8ee285f16f3c7002bd45e72aa5b5c1a8f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says US VP headed to Azerbaijan, Armenia next month</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-says-us-vp-headed-azerbaijan-armenia-next-month-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President JD Vance will travel to Azerbaijan and Armenia next month, President Donald Trump said on Friday, months after the two countries signed a peace agreement in Washington.

Trump said Vance will travel to the countries to "advance the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity," a peace agreement he struck between the two countries in August.

"We will strengthen our strategic partnership with Azerbaijan, a beautiful Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation with Armenia, Deals for our Great Semiconductor Makers, and the sale of Made in the U.S.A. Defense Equipment, such as body armor and boats, and more, to Azerbaijan," he wrote on social media platform Truth Social.

The August deal followed nearly four decades of war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the mountainous region of Nagorno-Karabakh.

Under the agreement , the countries relinquished all claims to each other's territory and are required to refrain from using force against one another and pledge to respect international law.

Trump on Friday thanked the leaders of the two countries for upholding the agreement, saying there was now "Prosperity and Peace."

Earlier this week, Armenia announced it will integrate its energy systems with Azerbaijan to facilitate the import and export of electricity as part of a U.S.-backed project.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 01:44:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GQIKDJK6RZJTDDLUOU7KOJ4QUE.jpg?auth=73532debc15c36fbbbeeb0d79153adb0f32128ee84516767af0262ac99a800af&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to host meeting of Western Hemisphere defense chiefs Feb 11</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-host-meeting-western-hemisphere-defense-chiefs-feb-11-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - Top defense officials from 34 countries will meet in February to discuss common security priorities in the Western Hemisphere, the U.S. military said on Friday, just weeks after it deposed Venezuela's leader.

The climb, organised by Netflix (NFLX.O) , opens new tab for live broadcast, has been rescheduled for Sunday morning in Taipei, the streamer said on its X account.

"Safety remains our top priority, and we appreciate your understanding," it added.

The top of Taipei 101 was obscured by cloud on Saturday morning, with intermittent rain showers.

The 508 metre (1,667 feet) Taipei 101, which dominates the city's skyline and is a major tourist attraction, was the tallest building in the world from 2004 to 2010, a crown currently held by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

Taipei 101 has been scaled before.

In 2004, French climber Alain Robert, dubbed "Spiderman" for his ropeless ascents of some of the world's highest skyscrapers, climbed the building, in a time of four hours with a safety rope.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:27:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XHIWAO5BHZKI3DJQIYPJ6ICRXE.jpg?auth=77b5037b9907b608a42ada2c23ae6907446dd9831836e40824cb519e6404dff0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Chinese lantern festival lights up for Lunar New Year</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-lantern-festival-lights-up-lunar-new-year-2026-01-24/</link><description>ZIGONG, China, Jan 24 (Reuters) - In southwest China’s Sichuan province, the annual Zigong International Lantern Festival kicked off on Friday, showcasing the centuries-old art of illuminated lanterns on a grand scale.

This year’s Lunar New Year falls on February 17, marking the start of the Year of the Horse in the Chinese zodiac. Lanterns are a traditional feature of Lunar New Year celebrations in China, symbolising good fortune and guidance.

On opening night, crowds gathered to view more than 200 handmade lanterns depicting animals, mythological figures and scenes from ancient China.

“When I was a child, my parents took me to the Zigong Lantern Festival almost every year,” said Huang Ye, 32. “For us Zigong natives, the lantern festival is simply part and parcel of our Lunar New Year celebrations. Now, I bring my child to see the lanterns.”

Organisers said it took about 1,200 workers several weeks to produce the lanterns, some of which stretch for hundreds of metres.

One 210-metre-long display, titled “Magical China,” was inspired by an ancient legend and featured a giant mythical bird-fish hybrid known as Kunpeng.

Another, themed on the “Legend of Mulan” and extending for 180 m (591 feet), depicted the story of the female warrior and included a herd of galloping horses, a reference to this year’s zodiac animal.

Lanterns at the festival were made using a variety of materials, including straw, chillies and recycled medicine bottles.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:27:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HZVHA53SONIMDHWHUGPBU5XXBY.jpg?auth=0b10f2fd2ba3ec274836f081be444269f6ccf343c7dd7ac4387f609864acefe4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Players, fans brace for extreme heat at Australian Open</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/players-fans-brace-extreme-heat-australian-open-2026-01-24/</link><description>MELBOURNE, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Players sweated under a blazing sun and fans lathered themselves with sunscreen at the Australian Open on Saturday as temperatures rose toward an expected 40 degrees Celsius (104 F) at Melbourne Park.

Play started an hour earlier to take advantage of the relative cool of the morning but conditions were already stifling as women's defending champion Madison Keys entered centre court for her third-round match at 10:30 a.m. (2330 GMT).

Used to hot conditions in Florida, the American needed only 75 minutes to complete a straightforward 6-3 6-3 win over unseeded Czech Karolina Pliskova.

"I was excited by the heat," she said on court after booking a fourth-round matchup with fellow American and friend Jessica Pegula, the sixth seed.

Pegula wrapped up her early match at Margaret Court Arena even quicker than Keys, taking down Russian Oksana Selekhmeteva 6-3 6-2.

"I didn't have to kind of kill myself today," said Pegula, also based in Florida.

"Luckily today everything worked out pretty well."

Amanda Anisimova, who also lives in Florida, beat compatriot Peyton Stearns 6-1 6-4 and the U.S. Open runner-up made sure the contest was wrapped up quickly, claiming victory in just 71 minutes.

"Just the fact that we had so many outdoor courts in the summer, it was always so hot, I hated training in the summer," Anisimova said.

"But you know what? At least it paid off a little bit. It's just great to be playing out here even when it's so hot, it's nice to have a challenge."

The Australian Open operates under an extreme heat policy that considers air temperature, radiant heat, wind speed and humidity to assess playing conditions, allowing officials to delay or suspend matches when thresholds are exceeded.

The tournament's five-point Heat Stress Scale was at 3.4 in the early afternoon when men's defending champion Jannik Sinner was playing American Eliot Spizzirri in the second match at Rod Laver Arena.

When it reaches four points, players can take longer breaks between sets. Five points means the suspension of matches on outside courts and closing the roofs of the main showcourts.

Organisers warned fans to bring hats, drink plenty of water and make use of misting fans scattered around Melbourne Park.

Sydney resident Sarah Gellatly covered herself in sunscreen from one of the dispensers just outside the Melbourne Park gates.

She said players would be concerned about battling each other during the hottest part of the day.

"It's really hot but if you're a player that's touring around the world every day, then they're used to the heat," she told Reuters.

Melbourne resident Mat Vonarx and his partner had the cheap "ground pass" tickets which give access to the outside courts and said they were ready to handle whatever the weather threw at them.

"We knew it was going to be very hot today but it's the tennis," Vonarx told Reuters on his first visit to the Grand Slam. "We're ready for it, we've brought plenty of water and we're good to go."

Vonarx said the players would just have to tough it out.

"It's going to be tough for any sport in this condition but they're professionals, they're going to do what they need to do to complete the game," he said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 03:27:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EAR3UGBNIRLJNAN2TONJONZQ3Q.jpg?auth=3684229dc5b9b17bf8d9cacc53b5942e99acb17bc350719e658e8d3e2b82ed6a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Journalist Hunter S. Thompson took own life, Colorado investigators affirm</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/journalist-hunter-s-thompson-took-own-life-colorado-investigators-affirm-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 23 (Reuters) - A comprehensive case review into the 2005 death of author-journalist Hunter S. Thompson, including autopsy records, has affirmed authorities' original conclusion that he took his own life, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation said on Friday.

The review, conducted after the writer's widow, Anita Thompson, raised questions about the official suicide ruling, found no "new physical evidence, facts, or circumstances to support a conclusion different from the 2005 investigation," the CBI said.

The reexamination corroborated the original determination of the Pitkin County Sheriff's Office that Thompson died from a self-inflicted gunshot to his head at his Owl Creek farm retreat near Aspen in February 2005. He was 67.

In an apparent suicide note written days before his death but published months later by Rolling Stone magazine, his literary springboard, Thompson lamented the onset of old age and physical limitations, then concluded, "Relax -- this won't hurt." The note, scrawled in black marker, was titled, "Football Season is Over."

Friends and family had said at the time that Thompson, whose "gonzo" style of journalism eschewed any pretense of objectivity and established the hard-living writer as a counter-culture icon, had been in pain from a hip-replacement, back surgery and a recently broken leg.

Those close to him also had said that Thompson, a longtime gun enthusiast, had contemplated taking his own life for years.

But Anita Thompson, now 54, contacted Pitkin County Sheriff Michael Buglione with "new concerns and potential information" related to the original investigation into her husband's death, prompting the sheriff to request reopening the case in July 2025, the CBI said in a statement announcing its findings.

"While we have always believed the original investigation was conducted properly, we recognized the importance of an independent review for the Thompson family," Buglione wrote in the statement. "CBI's conclusions reaffirm the original findings and, we hope, provide reassurance and clarity."

Most of the original physical evidence and photographs from the 2005 probe have been disposed of, according to the CBI.

But state investigators reviewed autopsy and other law enforcement records from the case, re-examined the scene, and interviewed a number of people, including Anita Thompson, her late husband's son, Juan Thompson, and his ex-daughter-in-law, Jennifer Thompson. The original lead detective and the county coroner also were interviewed.

"The modern trajectory analysis and scene reconstruction conducted in 2025 - which was based on the intact bullet defect - was consistent with the original PCSO investigation, the autopsy report and the observations of original investigators," the CBI said.

In a statement carried by other news media outlets, Anita Thompson said she was grateful to the CBI for its "thorough" review, adding, "This allows all of us who loved Hunter to move forward with a clean conscience."

Hunter Thompson was best known for his book "Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas," adapted from a two-part article written for Rolling Stone in late 1971, chronicling his drug-fueled misadventures in Nevada while ostensibly covering a motorcycle race in the desert.

The book became the basis for a 1998 Hollywood adaptation, starring Johnny Depp as Thompson's alter-ego, Raoul Duke. The writer was also caricatured as Uncle Duke in the comic strip "Doonesbury," right down to his signature aviator glasses and cigarette holder.

The New York Times reported earlier this month that his widow went to authorities with suspicions about her husband's demise after hearing of rumors from a relative that his death had been staged to appear as a suicide.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 04:13:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven dead, 82 missing in Indonesian landslide, disaster agency says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/seven-dead-82-missing-indonesia-landslide-agency-says-2026-01-24/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Seven people have died and 82 are missing after a landslide hit in Indonesia's West Java province, Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency said on Saturday, amid reports of heavy rain in the area.

"The number of missing persons is high, we will try to optimise our search and rescue efforts today," Abdul Muhari, the agency spokesperson, told Reuters.

Nico Antic, 12, was attacked on Sunday as he and friends were jumping off rocks in Vaucluse, around 9 km (5.5 miles) from Sydney's central business district. He was pulled from the water by friends and taken to hospital with severe injuries to both legs.

"We are heartbroken to share that our son, Nico, has passed away," the family said in a statement. "Nico was a happy, friendly, and sporty young boy with the most kind and generous spirit. He was always full of life and that’s how we'll remember him."

Dozens of beaches, including in Sydney, were closed this week after four shark attacks in two days, as heavy rains left waters murky and more likely to attract the animals.

In September, a surfer was killed by a large shark at Sydney's Long Reef beach.

Australia averages 20 shark attacks a year, fewer than three of them fatal, according to data from conservation groups. Those numbers are dwarfed by drownings on the country's beaches.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 05:23:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NVN62P3KVVPKVF36KNL2XEJTAA.jpg?auth=128b3f7e2e8ce21f450b956174b7c76ff1e4d1482329171240afe82ad5e9535c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge extends deportation protections for migrants from Myanmar</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-judge-extends-deportation-protections-migrants-myanmar-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A federal judge ordered , opens new tab President Donald Trump's administration on Friday to delay its termination of the "Temporary Protected Status," or TPS, for Myanmar while a lawsuit challenging the termination continued.

The order by U.S. District Judge Matthew Kennelly in Chicago blocks the Trump administration from ending deportation protections for about 4,000 Myanmar nationals living in the U.S.

The judge said that U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision to end Temporary Protected Status for immigrants from Myanmar lacked a genuine basis. Kennelly postponed the effective date of the government's action, which was to be Monday, and scheduled a February 6 hearing in the case.

The Trump administration had no immediate reaction to the order.

The Trump administration said in November it was ending temporary legal status for citizens of Myanmar in the U.S., arguing they could safely return to the war-torn Southeast Asian country while citing the military junta's elections as evidence of an improving situation.

The United Nations, many Western countries and human rights groups have called the ongoing election a sham. The U.S. State Department's most recent human rights report said there were "significant human rights issues" in Myanmar.

The Trump administration's move had sparked concern for individuals who might be forced to return to Myanmar, which has been in political turmoil since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, ousting a civilian government and sparking a nationwide armed resistance.

"The Court cannot discern a genuine basis for the Secretary's action in the record and finds it more likely that the decision to terminate TPS was not actually rooted in the reasons cited in the notice," the judge wrote.

"It is more plausible that TPS was terminated to effectuate the Secretary's broader goal of curtailing immigration and eliminating TPS generally, not on her evaluation of changed conditions in Burma," the judge added.

"The termination of TPS for Burma appears to have occurred without a review of conditions in that country, much like the administration's termination of other TPS designations."

Trump has pursued a hardline immigration policy since taking office in 2025, including an aggressive deportation drive that has been widely condemned by human rights advocates. Trump has cited domestic security reasons for his actions.

A series of lawsuits have challenged his administration's efforts to curtail protections from deportation extended to citizens of numerous countries through grants of TPS.

Under federal law, TPS is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events. It provides eligible migrants with work authorization and temporary protection from deportation.

Court rulings have at times slowed or halted the Trump administration's efforts to strip migrants of their legal status.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 05:23:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MKHQFHJG5NKMJC4I55DZLLUWCY.jpg?auth=b57b1505c6f07e873108ee87992438da8e1460aa322db65ffe312de60649ea74&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Karachi mall inferno came after ignored warnings, delayed response</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/karachi-mall-inferno-came-after-ignored-warnings-delayed-response-2026-01-24/</link><description>KARACHI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Muhammad Imran did not take the fire seriously at first, thinking it was another small spark at the Karachi mall that would be quickly extinguished by fellow shop owners.

But smoke seeped through ducts and blackened the air in seconds. The lights went out soon after and phone flashlights turned useless, people could no longer see their own hands, he said.

Imran, who has diabetes and has undergone heart surgery, managed only a few steps before nearly giving up. "It felt like doomsday," he said. "You couldn't see the person next to you."

The blaze would rage for nearly two days and reduce Gul Plaza, a multi-storey complex of 1,200 family-run shops selling children's clothes, toys, crockery and household goods, to ash.

At least 67 people were killed, with 15 still missing and feared dead, police official Asad Ali Raza said, in the January 17 blaze, the Pakistani port city's largest in over a decade.

Imran's escape from the inferno, along with more than a dozen others who spoke to Reuters, was hampered by locked doors, poor ventilation, and crowded corridors. When they eventually got out, the survivors watched Gul Plaza crumble as rescue efforts faced delays and poor resources.

Police said the fire appeared to have started at an artificial flower shop and may have been caused by children playing with matches. They added that all but three of the 16 exits were locked , which was routine practice after 10 p.m.

Documents reviewed by Reuters showed Gul Plaza, located on a major artery in Karachi's historic city centre and built in the early 1980s, had violated building regulatory standards for over a decade, with authorities warning the situation was dire in the last review two years ago.

Gul Plaza's management did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Records from the provincial Sindh Building Control Authority showed court cases filed over Gul Plaza's lack of safety compliance in 1992, 2015 and 2021, as well as records of unauthorised construction.

The files reviewed by Reuters do not detail the outcomes of those cases, including whether fines were imposed or whether violations were fully remedied. SBCA did not respond to queries on enforcement action taken.

A Nov. 27, 2023, survey by the fire department, 
 covering more than 40 commercial buildings in the area, cited inadequate firefighting equipment, blocked escape routes, faulty alarms, poor emergency lighting and a lack of fire safety training for occupants and staff.

A follow-up audit by the fire department in January 2024 placed Gul Plaza among buildings that failed to meet regulations, with inspectors marking key safety categories, including access to firefighting equipment, alarm systems and electrical wiring conditions, as "unsatisfactory".

Separately, documents describing inspections by Karachi’s Urban Search and Rescue teams in late 2023 and early 2024 that were reviewed by Reuters also showed Gul Plaza was among several markets and commercial buildings flagged for deficiencies in one or more fire safety categories.

"Young boys were crying. People were panicking," Imran said, when they were confronted by locked exits.

Others smashed doors and locks as they moved through the darkness, holding hands and forming human chains to avoid getting lost.

With no way down, they ran to the roof, where 70 people, including families and children, were trapped for nearly an hour, survivors said. The smoke was even worse there, funnelled upward by the building's design, making it impossible to see even the neighbouring buildings.

Then the wind changed.

A sudden gust pushed the smoke aside, revealing Rimpa Plaza next door. Young men crossed first, found a broken ladder and began ferrying people across one by one.

"I was the last to leave. I wanted to make sure everyone was safe," Imran said. An ambulance from the Edhi Foundation charity was waiting on the other side.

Many survivors said the response by the fire brigade was delayed and inadequate. Imran and other shop owners said they had escaped from the building and watched Gul Plaza turn into a molten inferno as the first firefighters arrived.

The first emergency call came at 10:26 p.m. from a teenager, with two fire vehicles reaching the site within 10 minutes and classifying the blaze as a Grade 3 fire, "the highest category for an urban area", said a provincial government spokesperson Sukhdev Assardas Hemnani.

A citywide emergency was declared by 10:45 p.m., triggering the mobilisation of resources from across Karachi, he said.

Shopkeepers said the first engine soon ran out of water and left to refill but Hemnani said those allegations were inaccurate.

Firefighters used "water, foam, chemicals and sand", he said, adding the blaze was difficult to control because the building contained more than 50 gas cylinders and flammable material such as perfumes, generator fuel and car batteries.

Many of the shops were stocked to the brim because of the holy month of Ramadan in February-March, Pakistan's biggest shopping season.

The first fire truck was not delayed, Hemnani said, but later arrivals were slowed by heavy traffic on a busy Saturday night and a crowd of over 3,000 people that had gathered outside the mall.

The fire department did not respond to requests for comment.

Survivors said many of the missing were shop employees and traders who tried to help others escape — or went back inside looking for family members.

Abdul Ghaffar, a toy store employee who had worked in Gul Plaza for two decades, said one of his cousins was among those still unaccounted for after helping others flee.

His cousin's mobile phone voice message, in which he can be heard apologising to his family, was circulated widely on social media.

"He was helping people escape," Ghaffar said. "That's how he died." Three other relatives remain missing, he said, with the family still waiting for identification through DNA testing.

The internet and communication blackouts that accompanied the regime’s recent crackdown on protests have left him reliant on messages providing the barest, essential facts.

"To be honest, I couldn't talk to all of them," explained the 37-year-old, who now lives in France. "I am not aware of the situation of all of them, but I just heard that we are safe. We are still alive."

The situation this time in Alavi’s hometown of Saqqez in Iran’s Kurdistan province appeared to be a lot calmer than during the previous wave of anti-regime protests. Saqqez is also the hometown of Jina Mahsa Amini , whose death in police custody in September 2022 sparked the "Women, Life, Freedom" movement.

Alavi, like many townspeople, attended the young Kurdish woman’s funeral in Saqqez and joined the first protest that sparked a nationwide opposition movement. Months later, the high-school English teacher in a local school was forced to flee after spending two weeks in prison for participating in the protests that put Saqqez in the international spotlight.

The situation this time in his hometown was different, Alavi explained.

"The protests were very limited in some of the Kurdish areas this time," he said. “Maybe they were afraid of the huge suppression, which we see is happening in other cities."

While the 2022-2023 protests spread from the Kurdish periphery to the centre, the latest demonstrations erupted in the country’s commercial beating heart: Tehran’s Grand Bazaar, where merchants on December 28 voiced their frustration over the currency crisis , igniting another nationwide flame of discontent.

The contrast between the birthplaces of the "Women, Life, Freedom" movement and the latest protests could not be starker. Saqqez, a highland town in the Zagros Mountains straddling the borders of Iran, Iraq and Turkey, is more than 600 kilometres and a world away from the Grand Bazaar, the symbolic seat of the bazaaris , a socially conservative class of merchants who have been loyal to the Islamic Republic for nearly half-a-century.

Iran’s Kurds , in contrast, have historically opposed the theocratic rulers in Tehran and have borne the brunt of brutal regime crackdowns since the 1979 Islamic Revolution .

If the residents of Saqqez and the surrounding areas did not take to the streets en masse this time because they feared a repeat of the repression they experienced after the 2023 protests, they were unfortunately proved right.

In its latest crackdown, Iranian security forces, for the first time, used automatic or semi-automatic machine guns on crowds in the heart of Tehran, according to Amnesty International . Such lethal, military grade arms were previously used in the Kurdish provinces during the crackdown following Amini’s death , the London-based human rights group revealed at a press conference on Thursday.

The scorched-earth levels of bloodshed and brutality once confined to the ethnic margins have reached the nation’s centre. That does not bode well for stability inside Iran, the region, and for the country’s majority and minority groups.

A vast country of around 92 million people, Iran shares land borders with seven countries and is home to an ethnically diverse population with some communities sharing kinship ties across national frontiers.

Ethnic Persians, making up around 50 percent of the population, are the majority and are based predominantly in the central region. The country is also home to Azerbaijanis, the largest minority group estimated at between 16 to 24 percent, followed by Kurds (between 10 to 16 percent) and a mosaic of smaller ethnic groups such as the Lurs, Arabs, Baluch and other Turkic groups.

Spread across the borders of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey, the Kurds have a long, painful history of discrimination and suppression campaigns by regimes based in power centres far from their regions.

In Iran, Kurdish groups oppressed by the former shah were initially hopeful when the Islamic Revolution ousted the Pahlavi dynasty, but their hopes were quickly dashed once the Shiite regime took power. Since a 1979 rebellion in the northwest was brutally crushed, Kurdish parties with different acronyms and ideologies, most calling for federalism, a few with armed wings, have opposed the regime in Tehran.

For more than four decades, the state pursued a “what happens in the northwest stays in the northwest” position, with state and semi-official Persian language media informing audiences that security forces were battling “terrorists” and “separatists” in the Kurdish badlands.

That was until this month, notes Shukriya Bradost, a Middle East security expert who has studied the history of Iran’s Kurds.

In its latest crackdown on protesters across the country, the regime "used the same military weapons in Tehran and sadly, other central, Persian-majority provinces that they use every time in the Kurdish regions", she said. "After 47 years, the Persian cities feel the pain of the Kurdish regions."

The toll from the latest crackdown has been staggering. On Thursday, the Iranian state finally released official figures, putting the death toll at 3,117, including 2,427 "martyrs" defined as security force members or innocent bystanders. The remaining 690 dead were described as "rioters" backed by the US.

Human rights groups have put the figure far higher . Norway-based NGO Iran Human Rights says it has verified the deaths of more than 3,400 protesters and warned the true figure could be "between 5,000 and 20,000".

The public anti-regime demonstrations in many Kurdish areas this year did not draw the kind of crowds that took to the streets in the "Women, Life, Freedom" rallies. But the region did see a number of smaller protests, which were brutally suppressed.

Protests in the Kurdish-majority western province of Kermanshah in the first week of January faced harsh repression, with human rights groups such as Amnesty International verifying videos of security officials arresting protesters amid loud gunshots while the injured and dead lay on the streets. "Kermanshah feels like a war zone," said one wounded protester. "It’s a field of bullets."

In Malekshahi, a county in Ilam, another Kurdish-majority province, security forces fired live ammunition into a crowd of unarmed protesters and then stormed a hospital, "seeking to remove the bodies of those killed and forcibly take injured protesters out of the hospital", reported Hengaw , a Norway-based Kurdish human rights group.

Following the protests in Kermanshah and Ilam, seven Kurdish political parties got together to issue a joint call for a general strike on January 8. Other ethnic minority provinces – such as Baluchestan in the southeast near the Pakistan border and the Azerbaijan-majority states in the north – joined the strike call.

"More than 50 cities and towns joined the strike,"  Bradost said. "That was a huge success for the Kurdish parties, to show how much influence they have and how easily and effectively they can mobilise people."

By channelising the public anger in a strike call, the Kurdish parties not only helped kept their people off streets that had turned into killing fields. They also acknowledged the economic grievances of the bazaaris and all Iranian citizens by targeting the regime where it hurt most.

Iran’s ethnic minorities tend to be cohesive and have leadership structures, such as leftist parties and civil society institutions among the Kurds, and religious and community elders among the Baluchis. The Kurds, in particular, can play an important role in bringing political change, Bradost maintains.

"If there needs to be a powerful, mobilised force against the Iranian regime, these forces are Kurdish forces and the Kurdish regions," she said. "The Iranian opposition can use this as an opportunity to unite behind the Kurdish region, because these regions are the most mobilised region in the country."

One of the major problems confronting the Iranian opposition is the absence of a legitimate, or charismatic, leader who can unite disparate groups.

Reza Pahlavi , the US-based son of the deposed shah, has emerged as a potential leader, with the overseas Persian-language channels positioning the 65-year-old as an alternative to the Islamist regime. During the recent demonstrations in Iran, several protesters chanted the former crown prince’s name, according to witness accounts. But there were also chants of "No shah, no mullahs" – particularly in Iranian universities.

Pahlavi’s close ties to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is also a divisive issue – particularly after last year’s 12-Day War, which saw Israeli strikes targeting military infrastructure, killing civilians, but failing to bring down the regime, which simply increased its repression for ordinary Iranians.

For many Kurds, whose parents and ancestors suffered brutal discrimination under the Pahlavi monarchs, the California-based, Persian elite crown prince is a hard sell as a leadership figure.

A month after the June 2025 Israel-Iran war , Pahlavi’s team in exile released an "emergency phase" plan. But while the 169-page document featured the term "territorial integrity" several times, there was no mention of "federalism", a critical issue for Iran’s Kurds.

Whether it’s the Islamic regime or an old-new shah, the discourse of the Persian elites at home or abroad sounds dismayingly familiar for many Iranian Kurds.

“They've been brainwashed that all Kurds are separatists,” Bradost said. “When you use the term federalism, it’s viewed as separatism, against your territorial integrity.”

Just days after security forces unleashed a crackdown on protesters, the Iranian military this week targeted an Iranian Kurdish opposition party headquartered in neighbouring Iraq.

The Kurdistan Freedom Party (PAK) on Wednesday said the Iranian regime targeted one of the Kurdistan National Army's headquarters "using missiles and drones”, referring to an armed group that operates under its authority.

“We were prepared for this news, that the regime will attack Kurdish bases in Iraqi Kurdistan. There’s always this scenario,” Bradost said, noting that one of the regime’s main goals was to “distract the attention of protesters to the Kurdish party, to tell Iranians that the Kurds are separatists and that Iranian territorial integrity is in danger”.

A history of mobilisation spanning nearly a century has seen the formation of several Iranian Kurdish parties. In the past, some have fought each other. This was primarily during the 1990s, a brutal period for Kurds in Turkey and Iraq, which had ramifications for Iranian Kurdish parties as Tehran tried to leverage the factional fighting in a bid to maintain control in the Kurdish areas and extend its regional influence.

The oldest Iranian Kurdish party, the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan (KDPI) traces its roots to the 1946 Republic of Mahabad, a short-lived, self-governing Kurdish state in northwestern Iran that has symbolic weight among the Kurds.

While the KDPI seeks Kurdish rights within a federal Iranian state, other parties have armed wings based in the mountainous Kurdish areas of northeastern Iraq. The PAK, which was founded in Iran in 1991, for instance, includes fighters who took part in battles in Iraq against the Islamic State (IS) group .

Another party, the Kurdistan Free Life Party (PJAK), is the Iranian branch of the Turkey-based Kurdistan Workers’ Party ( PKK ), which is considered a terrorist group by Ankara, Washington and Brussels, but whose Syrian arm nonetheless joined the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) forces in the fight against the IS group in Syria.

The Kurds have been called “the world’s largest ethnic group without a state” for more than a century. But the international community has been largely unsuccessful in working with, or putting pressure on, regional capitals to address the root causes of the Kurdish problem across borders.

In Syria, the recent fighting between Kurdish SDF fighters and government forces under Turkey-backed interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa is just the latest example of the international diplomatic failure to negotiate a resolution to the Kurdish issue.

From his new home in France, Alavi sees new players and administrations playing new geopolitical games in the region – and that provides no grounds for optimism.

At a recent Iranian opposition demonstration outside the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Alavi saw some participants wave Israeli flags, which dismayed him.

“There are people who don’t like that, you know,” the mild-mannered former school teacher said.

Many Middle East experts say Israel over the past two years has sought to position itself as a champion of the region’s minorities – such as Syria’s Druze community – to weaken neighbouring states for its own security interests. While many Iranians oppose the Islamic regime’s “axis of resistance” support for the Palestinian cause at the cost of the welfare of their own countrymen, not all support Israel. Pahlavi’s outreach to Netanyahu has split an already divided opposition.

US President Donald Trump’s changing discourse on Iran has added to the unease for many in the Iranian opposition. The president’s initial threats to intervene against Tehran dwindled last week with the protests inside Iran.

As a populace reeling with the killings, shutdowns and surveillance struggled to find and bury their dead, Trump claimed he had stopped executions of prisoners, toning down his intervention rhetoric. On Thursday, he was back on the verbal offensive, telling reporters the US has “an armada ... heading in that direction, and maybe we won't have to use it".

“I can understand that people who are inside the country, who have no hope, who are seeing a huge massacre, are asking Trump to come to help us because they're killing us,” Alavi said.

“But we can see what's happening now is not a good situation. We’re completely stuck between two forces, none of them are very acceptable ... I don't know what to say,” he continued, sounding defeated after anxious weeks of watching the killings from afar and trying to crack the communications blackout to get news about his family.

“The biggest thing is feeling guilty. I see that with almost all my Iranian friends all over the world, we’re all feeling guilty for not being there.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 06:34:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/63efb734-f862-11f0-b8fd-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/main-cap.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US military to prioritise homeland defence, limit support for allies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260124-us-military-to-prioritise-homeland-defence-limit-support-for-allies</link><description>The US military will prioritize protecting the homeland and deterring China while providing "more limited" support to allies in Europe and elsewhere, a Pentagon strategy document released on Friday said.

The 2026 National Defense Strategy (NDS) marks a significant departure from past Pentagon policy, both in its emphasis on allies taking on increased burdens with less backing from Washington, and its softer tone on traditional foes China and Russia .

"As US forces focus on homeland defense and the Indo-Pacific, our allies and partners elsewhere will take primary responsibility for their own defense with critical but more limited support from American forces," the strategy said.

The previous NDS -- released under President Donald Trump 's predecessor Joe Biden -- described China as Washington's most consequential challenge and said that Russia posed an "acute threat."

The new document however urges "respectful relations" with Beijing -- while making no mention of US ally Taiwan , which China claims as its territory -- and describing the threat from Russia as a "persistent but manageable" one affecting NATO 's eastern members.

Both the Biden and Trump strategies say homeland defense is important, but their descriptions of the threats facing the US differ significantly.

The Trump administration's NDS takes aim at the past administration for neglecting border security, saying this led to a "flood of illegal aliens" and widespread narcotics trafficking.

"Border security is national security," and the Pentagon "will therefore prioritize efforts to seal our borders , repel forms of invasion, and deport illegal aliens," it said.

Biden meanwhile focused on China and Russia, saying they posed "more dangerous challenges to security and safety at home" than even the threat of terrorism .

The 2026 NDS also includes no mention of the dangers of climate change -- which Biden's administration had identified as an "emerging threat."

Like Trump's national security strategy, which was released last month, the NDS elevates Latin America to the top of the US agenda.

The Pentagon "will restore American military dominance in the Western Hemisphere. We will use it to protect our Homeland and our access to key terrain throughout the region," the NDS said.

The document called that the "Trump Corollary to the Monroe Doctrine," a reference to the declaration two centuries ago by the then-young United States that Latin America was off limits to rival powers.

Since returning to office last year, Trump has repeatedly employed the US military in Latin America, ordering a shocking raid that captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro and his wife, as well as strikes on more than 30 alleged drug-smuggling boats that have killed more than 100 people.

Trump's administration has provided no definitive evidence that the sunken vessels were involved in drug trafficking , and international law experts and rights groups say the strikes likely amount to extrajudicial killings as they have apparently targeted civilians who do not pose an immediate threat to the United States.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 06:34:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/228c4f00-db70-11f0-96fc-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/fdda9edcabb8546f111b3c09adfad7a48fc79335.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says two Islamic State‑linked men executed for 2023 bus bombing</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-two-islamic-statelinked-men-executed-2023-bus-bombing-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 24 (Reuters) - Iran executed two men for the 2023 bombing of a bus carrying pilgrims, identifying them as linked to Islamic State, the judiciary’s Mizan news agency reported on Saturday.

Dozens of eateries, attraction sites and other businesses shuttered as part of a day of coordinated action to defy the weeks-long federal immigration operation underway in Minnesota.

Images of an apparently terrified pre-schooler, Liam Conejo Ramos, being held by immigration officers who were seeking to arrest the boy's father have rekindled public outrage at the federal crackdown, during which an agent shot and killed a US citizen.

The superintendent of Columbia Heights Public Schools, where Ramos was a preschool student, said the child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias -- both asylum seekers -- were taken from their driveway as they arrived home on Tuesday.

Ramos was then used as "bait" by officers to draw out those inside his home, superintendent Zena Stenvik added.

One protester, who declined to be named, told AFP he was marching "because if we don't fight, we don't win. If we don't fight, fascism wins."

The local man held a sign reading "five-years-old, dude," a reference to Ramos.

Thousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city, as President Donald Trump presses his campaign to deport undocumented immigrants across the country.

On a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance confirmed Ramos was among those detained. But he argued that agents were protecting him after his father "ran" from officers.

"What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?" he said.

UN human rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the "harmful treatment of migrants and refugees."

Arias, the father of the boy, was at a Texas detention facility, according to an ICE database that does not list the whereabouts of under-18s.

Border Patrol senior official Gregory Bovino defended his officers' treatment of Ramos, telling reporters Friday: "I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children."

ICE commander Marcos Charles said Friday "my officers did everything they could to reunite him with his family" and alleged that Ramos's family refused to open the door to him after his father left him and ran from officers.

They would be detained "pending their immigration proceedings," he added after alleging they entered the United States illegally and were "deportable."

Ramos's teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him "a bright young student."

In Minneapolis, where temperatures touched -23C (-9F) on Friday, protesters wrapped in hats, gloves and scarves chanted "ICE out" as part of a broader anti-ICE day of action.

Separately, protesters picketed outside Minneapolis-St. Paul airport over the facility's use for deporting those swept up in immigration raids.

Methodist pastor Mariah Furness Tollgaard said in a statement that 100 members of clergy were arrested and charged with trespassing and disobeying a peace officer on Friday, while demonstrating at the airport.

"As a faith leader in Minnesota, my tradition teaches that every person bears the image of God and is worthy of dignity and safety, and in this moment, all people of faith and moral conscience must stand up," she said.

Former US vice president Kamala Harris said she was "outraged" by Ramos's detention and called him "just a baby."

Ramos is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, administrators said.

Minneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good on January 7.

An autopsy concluded that the killing was a homicide, a classification that does not automatically mean a crime was committed.

The officer who fired the shots that killed Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged.

Marc Prokosch, the lawyer for Ramos and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

Children have been caught up in immigration enforcement under both Republican and Democratic administrations.

Minnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps. There will be a hearing on the application Monday.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 07:24:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a906eb48-f8ef-11f0-aa7d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26023860167783.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: One killed in Kyiv as Ukraine and Russia to hold second day of direct talks in UAE</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260124-live-ukraine-and-russia-to-hold-second-day-of-direct-talks-in-uae-one-killed-in-kyiv</link><description>‍Nearly ​6,000 ⁠buildings in Ukraine's capital city Kyiv ​were ‍left ​without heat after ​an overnight Russian attack, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Zhang is a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), while Liu is chief of staff of the CMC Joint Staff Department, according to the ministry.

Zhang, 75, is widely seen as President Xi Jinping's closest military ally and one of just a few leading officers with combat experience. He is one of two vice-chairmen of the CMC, China's supreme armed forces command organisation.

The military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi in 2012. That drive reached the upper levels of the military in 2023 when the Rocket Force was targeted.

Eight top generals were expelled from the ruling Communist Party on graft charges in October 2025, including the country's number two general, He Weidong. He had served under Xi and alongside Zhang on the Central Military Commission.

Two former defence ministers were also purged from the party in recent years for corruption. The crackdown is slowing procurement of advanced weaponry and hitting the revenues of some of China's largest military firms.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:27:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AFVNNV53KNI4VHHTOBGMHXHQHE.jpg?auth=d05c84bac0a1a425c5871aba72476ee1283b73f3a4a1685271f234a886c5622a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nearly 6,000 buildings in Kyiv without heat after Russian attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/nearly-6000-buildings-kyiv-without-heat-after-russian-attack-2026-01-24/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Nearly 6,000 buildings in Ukraine's capital city Kyiv were left without heat after an overnight Russian attack, Mayor Vitali Klitschko said.

Dutch airline KLM also halted flights until further notice to cities in the Middle East and would not fly through the airspace of several countries in the region, including Iraq and Iran , according to the Netherlands ' state broadcaster.

President Donald Trump said on Thursday that a US "armada" was heading toward the Gulf and that Washington was watching Iran closely, even after downplaying the prospect of imminent military action and saying Tehran appeared interested in talks.

The airline added it was "constantly monitoring the evolution of the geopolitical situation in the territories served and overflown by its aircraft" to ensure "the highest level of safety and security" for its flights.

"Air France is monitoring the situation in real time and will provide further updates on its flight schedule," the French airline said.

KLM told Dutch public broadcaster NOS on Friday that it had suspended flights until further notice to Tel Aviv, Dubai, Dammam and Riyadh and would not fly through the airspace of Iraq, Iran, Israel and several countries in the Gulf.

The airline did not disclose the reason for the suspensions and said it was in touch with Dutch authorities, according to NOS.

Neighbouring Turkey, as well as some officials in Syria, said late on Friday that the deadline could be extended.

Government troops have seized swathes of northern and eastern territory in the last two weeks from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in a rapid turn of events that has consolidated President Ahmed al-Sharaa's rule.

Sharaa's forces were approaching a last cluster of Kurdish-held cities in the northeast earlier this week when he abruptly announced a ceasefire, giving the SDF until Saturday night to come up with a plan to integrate with Syria's army.

As the deadline approached, SDF forces also reinforced their defensive positions in the cities of Qamishli, Hasakeh and Kobane for a possible fight, Kurdish security sources told Reuters.

Syrian officials and SDF sources said it was likely the Saturday deadline would be extended for several days, possibly up to a week.

"Extending the ceasefire for a little longer may come onto the agenda," said Hakan Fidan, the foreign minister of Turkey, which is the strongest foreign backer of Sharaa's government and sees the SDF as an arm of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK.

The possible showdown in northern Syria is the culmination of rising tensions over the last year.

Sharaa, whose forces toppled longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad in late 2024, has vowed to bring all of Syria under state control - including SDF-held areas in the northeast.

But Kurdish authorities who have run autonomous civilian and military institutions there for the last decade have resisted joining up with Sharaa's Islamist-led government.

After a year-end deadline for the merger passed with little progress, Syrian troops launched an offensive this month.

They swiftly captured two key Arab-majority provinces from the SDF, bringing key oil fields, hydroelectric dams and some facilities holding Islamic State fighters and affiliated civilians under government control.

The U.S. has been engaging in shuttle diplomacy to establish a lasting ceasefire and facilitate the integration of the SDF - once Washington's main partner in Syria - into the state led by its new U.S.-favoured ally, Sharaa.

Senior officials from the United States and France, which has also been involved in talks, have urged Sharaa not to send his troops into remaining Kurdish-held areas, diplomatic sources told Reuters.

They fear that renewed fighting could lead to mass abuses against Kurdish civilians. Government-affiliated forces killed nearly 1,500 people from the Alawite minority and hundreds of Druze people in sectarian violence last year, including in execution-style killings.

Amid the instability in the northeast, the U.S. military has been transferring hundreds of detained fighters from the Islamic State group from Syrian prisons across the border into Iraq.

Iraq's Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein told the EU's foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, in a phone call on Saturday that Baghdad should not bear the "security and financial burdens" of the transfer of IS prisoners alone, the Iraqi foreign ministry said in a statement.

Turkey's Fidan, speaking on broadcaster NTV late on Friday, cited these transfers as possibly necessitating an extension to the Saturday deadline.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 08:51:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5IYAYBULIJNHPOHKTQAWCCXZLE.jpg?auth=205e6ae73f70be7992956d2c6099af2074390c964aed78a37d3a8254425eca9f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine's foreign minister says Putin 'cynically' attacked during Abu Dhabi talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraines-foreign-minister-says-putin-cynically-attacked-during-abu-dhabi-talks-2026-01-24/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Ukraine's foreign minister accused Russian President Vladimir Putin on Saturday of "cynically" ordering a massive missile strike while delegations from Ukraine, Russia and the U.S. were in Abu Dhabi for Washington-brokered peace talks.

"This barbaric attack once again proves that Putin's place is not at the board of peace, but at the dock of the special tribunal," Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote on X.

Russia launched waves of air strikes against Ukraine's two largest cities Kyiv and Kharkiv early on Saturday, with one person killed and at least 23 injured. Ukraine's air force said Russia had launched 375 drones and 21 missiles in the strikes, which once again targeted energy infrastructure, knocking out power and heat for large parts of the capital.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy had said on Friday that it was too early to draw conclusions from the first day of meetings in Abu Dhabi, and he had urged Russia to show it was ready to end the war. The talks were expected to resume for a final day on Saturday morning.

Ahead of the talks, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that Russia had not dropped its insistence on Ukraine yielding all of its eastern area of Donbas - Ukraine's industrial heartland grouping the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

Russian President Vladimir Putin's demand that Ukraine surrender the 20% it still holds of Donetsk - about 5,000 sq km (1,900 sq miles) - has proven a major stumbling block to any deal.

Zelenskiy refuses to give up land that Russia has not been able to capture in four years of grinding, attritional warfare. Polls show little appetite among Ukrainians for territorial concessions.

Russia says it wants a diplomatic solution but will keep working to achieve its goals by military means as long as a negotiated solution remains elusive.

Before Saturday's strikes, Kyiv had already endured two mass overnight attacks since the New Year that knocked out power and heating to hundreds of residential buildings. Ukraine's deputy prime minister said on Saturday that 800,000 people in Kyiv - where temperatures were around -10 Celsius - had been left without power after the latest Russian attack.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 09:23:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NFLXCKARHNL2RPX772TADMVO7U.jpg?auth=7a3852b1a29835f66b8019a58cd41171bf324a4e6afec6a5016fa6a165938d45&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Suicide bombing at Pakistan wedding kills 7, police say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/suicide-bombing-pakistan-wedding-kills-7-police-say-2026-01-24/</link><description>DERA ISMAIL KHAN, Pakistan, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The death toll from a suicide bombing at a wedding near the Afghan border rose to seven on Saturday, police said, as Pakistan struggles to deal with a rising wave of militant attacks.

The bombing tore through a building housing members of a peace committee during a wedding ceremony on Friday in northwestern Pakistan's Dera Ismail Khan district, said police official Muhammad Adnan.

The committees are made up of local residents and elders and supported by Islamabad as part of its efforts to counter Islamist militants in the regions along the Afghan border.

The four, who were among nearly a dozen people hurt in the attack, died in hospital, Adnan added.

Three people were confirmed dead on Friday.

No group has claimed responsibility for the bombing.

The Pakistani Taliban, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which operates on both sides of the Afghan border, has labelled peace committee members as traitors.

The Pakistani Taliban is an umbrella group of several Sunni militant groups, which has been fighting against the state since 1997.

Their stated goal is to replace Pakistan's system of governance with their strict brand of Islamic laws.

Islamabad has accused the Afghan Taliban of allowing the Pakistan group to plan its attacks from Afghanistan. Kabul denies the charge, saying the militancy is Pakistan's domestic problem.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 09:42:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's opposition taps energy expert to lead foreign policy ahead of vote</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-opposition-taps-energy-expert-lead-foreign-policy-ahead-vote-2026-01-24/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Hungary's opposition leader Peter Magyar, whose Tisza party leads most polls ahead of an April 12 election, has tapped international energy expert Anita Orban to be in charge of foreign policy.

Magyar's centre-right Tisza party is ahead of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz in most polls, though many voters remain undecided ahead of the election that will be highly consequential in Europe.

Anita Orban, unrelated to the prime minister, earned her PhD degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston in 2007 and is the author of the book  "Power, Energy and the New Russian Imperialism" published in 2008.

Between 2010 and 2015, she was an envoy for energy security in Viktor Orban's government, during his second, 16-year, spell in power, and has since worked in London in senior positions in the LNG sector and, most recently, at the Vodafone Group.

She joins Magyar's team a week after he appointed former Shell (SHEL.L) , opens new tab executive Istvan Kapitany to a senior economy role.

"Anita Orban is an experienced diplomat ... with insight and experience in diplomacy, foreign and energy policy and also about the decision-making of international companies," Magyar said in a statement on Saturday.

Magyar, a former government insider, has told Reuters he would keep Hungary firmly anchored in the European Union and NATO if he wins elections and would strive for "pragmatic relations" with Russia.

His Tisza Party swept into Hungarian politics in 2024, mounting the most serious challenge to Orban since he came to power in 2010.

Magyar has said he would unlock billions of euros in frozen EU funds to boost the economy, after a rule of law dispute with Brussels led to Hungary losing access to the funds under Orban.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 09:43:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6V7ORONRFPWNNOUUBVFOZHFO4.jpg?auth=c94e48fa00b3b8324da16042ac474a19a551fe34addb55150f73df46af5ddf08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>More than 8,000 flights cancelled as severe winter storm hits much of the US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260124-more-than-8-000-flights-cancelled-as-severe-winter-storm-us</link><description>More than 8,000 flights across the US set to take off over the weekend have been cancelled as a major storm expected to wreak havoc across much of the country bears down, threatening to knock out power for days and snarl major roadways.

Roughly 140 million people were under a winter storm warning from New Mexico to New England. The National Weather Service forecast warns of widespread heavy snow and a band of catastrophic ice stretching from east Texas to North Carolina.

Forecasters say damage, especially in areas pounded by ice, could rival that of a hurricane.

By Friday night, the edge of the storm was sending freezing rain and sleet into parts of Texas while snow and sleet were falling in Oklahoma. After sweeping through the South, the storm was expected to move into the Northeast, dumping about a foot (30 centimetres) of snow from Washington through New York and Boston, the weather service predicted.

Governors in more than a dozen states sounded the alarm about the turbulent weather ahead, declaring emergencies or urging people to stay home.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott told residents on the social media platform X that the state Department of Transportation was pretreating the roads and told residents, “Stay home if possible.”

More than 3,400 flights were delayed or canceled Saturday, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. More than 5,000 were called off for Sunday.

Angela Exstrom was supposed to fly back to Omaha, Nebraska , from a trip in Mexico, but she learned her Saturday flight out of Houston had been cancelled. So instead, she is going back via Los Angeles.

“If you live in the Midwest and travel in the winter, stuff can happen,” she said.

Utility companies braced for power outages because ice-coated trees and power lines can keep falling long after a storm has passed.

The Midwest saw wind chills as low as minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 40 Celsius), meaning that frostbite could set in within 10 minutes.

In Bismarck, North Dakota, where the wind chill was minus 41 (minus 41 Celsius), Colin Cross was bundled up Friday in long johns, two long-sleeve shirts, a jacket, hat, hood, gloves and boots as he cleaned out an empty unit for the apartment complex where he works.

“I’ve been here awhile and my brain stopped working,” Cross said.

The storm has been a popular topic of discussion for days at Saint Paul Mini Market in Baltimore.

“Every single person that walks in talks about the storm,” said owner Ayaz Ahmed.

“Somehow, this time around, they did a good job letting people know that here’s a storm coming their way, and everybody knows about the storm, but how to deal with that is another thing,” Ahmed said.

The federal government put nearly 30 search and rescue teams on standby. Officials had more than 7 million meals, 600,000 blankets and 300 generators placed throughout the area the storm was expected to cross, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

President Donald Trump said via social media on Friday that his administration was coordinating with state and local officials and “FEMA is fully prepared to respond”.

After the storm passes, it will take a while to thaw out. Ice can add hundreds of pounds to power lines and branches and make them more susceptible to snapping, especially if it's windy.

In at least 11 Southern states from Texas to Virginia, a majority of homes are heated by electricity, according to the US Census Bureau.

A severe cold snap five years ago took down much of the power grid in Texas , leaving millions without power for days and resulting in hundreds of deaths. Abbott vowed that will not happen again, and utility companies were bringing in thousands of employees to help keep the lights on.

Churches moved Sunday services online, and the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, Tennessee, decided to hold its Saturday night radio performance without fans. Carnival parades in Louisiana were cancelled or rescheduled.

Philadelphia announced schools would be closed Monday. Superintendent Tony B. Watlington Sr. told students, “It’s also appropriate to have one or two very safe snowball fights.”

Some universities in the South canceled classes for Monday, including the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of Mississippi's main campus in Oxford.

At the University of Georgia, in Athens, sophomore Eden England stayed on campus to ride things out with friends, even as the school encouraged students to leave dorms and go home because of concerns about losing power.

“I’d rather be with my friends,” England said, “kind of struggling together if anything happens”.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 10:24:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c212895c-f904-11f0-8f5a-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26023605674347.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Immigration raids in Minnesota fuel grassroots Somali activism</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/immigration-raids-minnesota-fuel-grassroots-somali-activism-2026-01-24/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 24 (Reuters) - When immigration agents began aggressive operations in Minneapolis last month, Kowsar Mohamed started knocking on doors, fielding late-night calls and mobilizing other Somali Americans into an ad-hoc response team. Many feared they were being singled out, a worry that revived memories of the state surveillance and arbitrary authority they thought they had left behind when they resettled in the United States.

More than 100 volunteers now patrol south Minneapolis, distribute "Know Your Rights" guides and escort frightened elders — part of a sweeping grassroots effort to counter what many describe as constitutionally suspect raids that are destabilizing Minnesota’s roughly 80,000‑strong Somali community, one of the country’s largest refugee populations.

"You would never fathom that people would just pluck you off the streets ... and say, 'Prove to me that you're a citizen,'" Mohamed said, referring to reports of aggressive tactics by the agents. "It's not that we never thought it was impossible. We just believed the Constitution was going to protect us from this level of interrogation."

The deployment of 3,000 federal agents — ordered by Republican President Donald Trump — has intensified accusations from Democrats and local leaders that he is targeting a politically influential community ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, deepening fears that the operations amount to intimidation aimed at suppressing Somali voter turnout.

Trump, who has described Somalis as "garbage" who should be thrown out of the country, has said the operations are necessary to combat crime, though many of those arrested have no criminal charges or convictions. He has also cited a fraud scandal around the theft of federal funds for social-welfare programs in Minnesota to justify sending agents into the state, many of them from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Democrats and community leaders accuse the agents of harassing peaceful protesters, racial profiling and searching houses without warrants. Minneapolis has been on edge since the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good by an immigration agent on January 7.

"A lot of community members escaped war and this administration is triggering another war zone," said Abdulahi Farah, co-chair of the Somali American Leadership Table, an advocacy group formed in response to hate crimes and political attacks on Somalis. He said Trump's history of racist rhetoric against Black and other immigrants of color has emboldened far-right activists and had a destabilizing effect on small businesses and citizens' general sense of safety.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to Reuters that immigrants who are served administrative warrants or I-205 removal orders "have had full due process and a final order of removal from an immigration judge."

In Cedar-Riverside, a normally bustling Somali neighborhood lined with restaurants, boutique shops and convenience stores, business owners say activity is noticeably quieter since immigration agents arrived there last month.

"It's been really slow,” said Rashid Jama, a grocery store manager in the neighborhood, also known as the West Bank. "A lot of our suppliers are Latino and they’re scared to come to work.”

The efforts of Mohamed, a third-year doctoral student at the University of Minnesota, are part of a broader wave of grassroots initiatives to push back by filming arrests, planning peaceful protests and accelerating voter outreach.

Some Somali Americans fear the raids are a bid to suppress voter turnout before midterm elections in November, according to over a dozen grassroots organizers, local officials and residents interviewed by Reuters.

"It's signaling that if we get rid of them, if we scare them, they're not going to come out to vote in the 2026 midterm election. We know that's the target," said Farah, whose group is partnering with other grassroots organizations to train people on priorities like opposing ICE raids as well as broader issues like affordability.

Mosques and neighboring community centers are now turning into political education hubs in Minnesota, local leaders said.

Civil rights advocates and scholars say the Minneapolis immigration operations echo past crackdowns in Black and Latino neighborhoods, fueling fears of political scapegoating, said political science professor Christina Greer at Fordham University.

Somali American voters have largely supported Democrats since refugees began resettling in the U.S. in the 1990s, before becoming more politically active in the 2000s. U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar is the community's most high-profile member and a frequent target of racist attacks from Trump.

Asked about that and tactics of agents decried by residents, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement to Reuters that immigrants “who fail to contribute to our economy, rip off Americans and refuse to assimilate into our society should not be here.”

Minnesota Republican Party Chairman Alex Plechash denied the raids were politically driven, calling the charge “categorically false” but said complaints about aggressive tactics warrant review.

Some Somali community leaders say mobilizing voters will be a priority in the months ahead.

"The power we have is to vote," said Abdullahi Kahiye, 37, who said he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2024. "ICE and whoever is trying to terrorize the Somali community will not succeed."</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 11:18:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R3UEVLXPOFO3HGNLXBHXKGS5YQ.jpg?auth=e2e325f7d53e33314a3ad500e68f6a456d54c9dc2fc247250449c87010aa67ef&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US presses Bolivia to expel suspected Iranian spies, harden approach to militant groups, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-presses-bolivia-expel-suspected-iranian-spies-harden-approach-militant-groups-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The United States is pushing Bolivia to kick suspected Iranian spies out of the South American country and designate Tehran's elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps as a terrorist group, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter.

Washington also wants the government in La Paz to designate Lebanese armed group Hezbollah and Palestinian militant organization Hamas - both of which the United States considers to be proxies of Tehran - as terrorist organizations, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations.

The private diplomatic push comes amid a broader U.S. effort to deepen its geopolitical influence in Latin America and diminish that of its adversaries in the region.

Following an operation earlier in January to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, U.S. officials quickly pushed the government of interim President Delcy Rodriguez to curtail economic and security cooperation between Caracas and Tehran, according to a separate source familiar with the matter. For years, Venezuela and Iran had been steadfast allies.

Asked for comment, the Bolivian foreign ministry said that "there is still no completely defined position regarding this matter." The State Department did not respond to a request for comment, while the Iranian mission to the United Nations declined to comment.

Bolivia, a landlocked country of 12 million people located in the heart of South America, would at first glance seem to be an unlikely venue for a proxy struggle between major world powers. Some current and former U.S. officials, however, said the nation has become an important base for Iran's diplomatic and intelligence operations throughout the continent.

In part, that is because of what U.S. officials have described as a permissive counterintelligence environment, as well as the nation's central location bordering several other nations, some of which have allegedly been the victim of attempted Hezbollah plots in recent years.

Rick de la Torre, a retired senior CIA officer and former Caracas chief of station, said Iran's base of diplomatic and intelligence operations in Latin America was Venezuela. However, Bolivia and Nicaragua - where an authoritarian government has cool relations with Washington - have served as Tehran's "secondary nodes" in the region in recent years.

"(Bolivia's) value to Tehran was the permissive political climate, lighter scrutiny and central geography," de la Torre said.

"In practice, the pattern you see across Latin America is Iran and Hezbollah using the most permissive jurisdictions as hubs, then projecting quietly into more capable or higher-value states nearby."

Evo Morales, Bolivia's leftist president from 2006 to 2019, deepened ties to Iran over the course of his presidency, including on defense and security-related matters, arguing both nations were united in the fight against U.S. imperialism.

Morales and leftist President Luis Arce, who governed from 2020 until late last year, were widely seen by U.S. officials as unreceptive to potential efforts to distance La Paz from Tehran. Now, however, U.S. officials believe they have a unique opportunity following the October election of centrist Rodrigo Paz, whose presidency marks an end to two decades of near-continuous rule by the leftist MAS party.

Paz's government, which has inherited significant economic turmoil and a fractious legislature, has sought to repair ties with Washington, while encouraging private investment. U.S. officials have publicly welcomed Paz's election, and in December the U.S. made Bolivia available for grant funding administered by the Millennium Challenge Corporation, an independent U.S. agency.

The sources said the Iran-related push in Bolivia is part of a broader U.S. campaign in the region. In September, U.S. ally Ecuador designated the IRGC, Hamas and Hezbollah as terrorist organizations, while Argentina designated Iran's Quds Force last week. The U.S. advocated for both moves, the sources said.

The IRGC has served as an elite military force loyal to Iran's Supreme Leader since the 1979 Iranian Revolution, while the Quds Force is an IRGC branch responsible for overseas operations.

While the current push to drive a geopolitical wedge between Iran and Latin America is not new, there are signs the effort is ramping up. A delegation including State Department and intelligence officials traveled to La Paz this month in part to discuss the potential terrorist designations, the sources said.

U.S. officials have also discussed pushing for terrorist designations in Chile, Peru and Panama, the officials added, though it is not clear they have yet discussed the matter with counterparts in those countries. Hezbollah operatives have been present in all of those nations, U.S. officials have alleged, and all have U.S.-aligned presidents or presidents-elect.

The Panamanian foreign ministry said it had not discussed the issue with U.S. officials. The Chilean foreign ministry declined to comment, while the Peruvian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

Among the most recent high-profile IRGC operations in the region was an alleged assassination plot targeting the Israeli ambassador to Mexico, which was foiled last year by Mexican security services. The plot, which was first reported by Axios in November, was orchestrated in part by an undercover Quds Force officer stationed in Caracas, one of the sources said.

Lebanon-based Hezbollah, which is closely allied with Tehran, has long operated in Latin America, often generating revenue for its global operations by participating in illicit smuggling networks and occasionally orchestrating terrorist attacks.

Still, while U.S. officials broadly hold that Hezbollah maintains a permanent presence in Latin America, there is significant debate within the intelligence community regarding how robust that presence is.

Some have characterized the group's fundraising operations in the region as well-organized and hierarchical, while others argue that some financial activities ascribed to Hezbollah are in fact a function of donations and remittances from Latin America's sizeable Lebanese diaspora that make their way to Hezbollah-linked individuals by happenstance.

"In my view, Hezbollah leadership does not micromanage every criminal scheme," said de la Torre, the retired CIA officer, "but it does authorize and benefit from a global facilitation architecture that includes Latin America."</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 11:40:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudan's women face 'world's worst' sexual violence amid brutal conflict, minister says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260124-women-facing-world-worst-sexual-violence-sudan-conflict</link><description>Women are the main victims of abuse in Sudan 's war, facing "the world's worst" sexual violence and other crimes committed with impunity, a rights activist turned social affairs minister for the army-backed government said.

The Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have been locked in a brutal conflict since April 2023 that has killed tens of thousands of people, displaced around 11 million and been marked by widespread sexual violence.

Sulaima Ishaq al-Khalifa said abuses against women routinely accompanied looting and attacks, with reports of rape often perpetrated as "the family witnessed" the crime.

"There is no age limit. A woman of 85 could be raped, a child of one year could be raped," the trained psychologist said at her home in Port Sudan.

The longtime women's rights activist, recently appointed to the government, said that women were also being subjected to sexual slavery and trafficked to neighbouring countries, alongside forced marriages arranged to avoid shame.

Khalifa said sexual violence has been reported on both sides, but she insisted it is "systematic" among the RSF, who she says use it "as a weapon of war" and for the purposes of "ethnic cleansing".

Her ministry has documented more than 1,800 rapes between April 2023 and October 2025 – a figure that does not include atrocities documented in western Darfur and the neighbouring Kordofan region from late October onwards.

"It's about... humiliating people, forcing them to leave their houses and places and cities. And also breaking... the social fabrics," Khalifa said.

"When you are using sexual violence as a weapon of war, that means you want to extend... the war forever", because it feeds a "sense of revenge", she added.

A report by the SIHA Network, an activist group that documents abuses against women in the Horn of Africa , found that more than three-quarters of recorded cases involved rape, with 87 percent attributed to the RSF.

The United Nations has repeatedly raised alarm over what it describes as targeted attacks on non-Arab communities in Darfur , while the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) has opened a formal investigation into " war crimes " by both sides.

Briefing the UN Security Council in mid-January, ICC deputy prosecutor Nazhat Shameem Khan said investigators had uncovered evidence of an "organised, calculated campaign" in El Fasher – the army's last stronghold in Darfur captured by the RSF in late October.

The campaign, Khan added, involved mass rapes and executions "on a massive scale", sometimes "filmed and celebrated" by the perpetrators and "fuelled by a sense of complete impunity".

Darfur endured a brutal wave of atrocities in the early 2000s, and a former Janjaweed commander – from the militia structure that later evolved into the RSF – was recently found guilty by the International Criminal Court of multiple war crimes, including rape.

"What's happening now is much more ugly. Because the mass rape thing is happening and documented," said Khalifa.

RSF fighters carrying out the assaults "have been very proud about doing this and they don't see it as a crime", she added.

"You feel that they have a green light to do whatever they want."

Watch more Half of all Sudanese children not in education due to civil war

In Darfur, several survivors said RSF fighters "have been accusing them of being lesser people, like calling them 'slaves', and saying that when I'm attacking you, assaulting you sexually, I'm actually 'honouring' you, because I am more educated than you, or (of) more pure blood than you".

Women in Khartoum and Darfur, including El-Fasher, have described rapes carried out by a range of foreign nationals.

These were "mercenaries from West Africa , speaking French, including from Mali, Burkina Faso , Nigeria , Chad , as well as Colombia and Libya" – allegedly fighting alongside the RSF, Khalifa added.

Some victims were abducted and held as sexual slaves, while others were sold through trafficking networks operating across Sudan's porous borders, said Khalifa.

Many of these cases remain difficult to document because of the collapse of state institutions.

In conservative communities, social stigma also remains a major obstacle to documenting the scale of the abuse.

Families often force victims into marriage to "cover up what happened", particularly when pregnancies result from rape, according to the minister.

"We call it a torture operation," she said, describing "frightening" cases in which children and adolescent girls under 18 are forced into marriage.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 11:44:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/157330a6-e8a7-11f0-bb30-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/4d2cdc9b2f7347c0c3594407405aaf3cbd667950.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US envoys in Israel to discuss future of Gaza, sources tell Reuters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-special-envoys-israel-discuss-future-gaza-sources-tell-reuters-2026-01-24/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner were in Israel on Saturday to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, mainly to discuss Gaza, two people briefed on the matter said, as local authorities reported further violence in the enclave.

The U.S. on Thursday announced plans for a "New Gaza" rebuilt from scratch, to include residential towers, data centres and seaside resorts.

The project forms part of President Donald Trump's push to advance an October ceasefire between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas that has been shaken by repeated violations.

The Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza said on Saturday that Israeli fire had killed three people, including two children, in two separate incidents in the northern Gaza Strip.

Since the beginning of the war, the death toll in Gaza now stands at 71,654 people, with 481 deaths since the October ceasefire, according to Health Ministry data.

A spokesperson for the Israeli prime minister's office confirmed that the meeting was planned but did not provide further details.

Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the war that was triggered by an attack by Hamas on southern Israel on October 7, 2023 that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.

The head of a transitional Palestinian committee backed by the U.S. to temporarily administer Gaza, Ali Shaath, said on Thursday that the Rafah border crossing - effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there - would open next week.

Israel wants to restrict the number of Palestinians entering Gaza through the border crossing with Egypt to ensure that more are allowed out than in, three sources briefed on the matter said ahead of the border's expected opening.

The border was supposed to have opened during the initial phase of Trump's plan to end the war.

Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory's administration.

The Gaza side of the crossing has been under Israeli military control since 2024.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 12:41:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MI3KYONQWNJ57B3VXHXU6YYL5M.jpg?auth=3f524c71477b9bdb83d60751fa1180048c645f559962cab058b8ad8e81ab5043&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy protests, recalls ambassador to Switzerland after New Year's bar fire suspect released</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italy-protests-recalls-ambassador-switzerland-after-new-years-bar-fire-suspect-2026-01-24/</link><description>ROME, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Italy formally protested on Saturday the release on bail of the owner of a Swiss bar engulfed in a deadly New Year's Day fire and recalled its ambassador to Switzerland, as the court's decision came under criticism in both countries.

Jacques Moretti and his wife Jessica, owners of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, are under investigation for negligent homicide and other crimes linked to the blaze that killed 40 people and injured more than 100, many of them teenagers.

Jacques Moretti was detained on January 9 but released on bail on Friday.

Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni overnight called his release "an affront to the memory of the victims of the New Year's Eve tragedy and an insult to their families".

Six of those killed in the bar blaze were Italian as were 10 of the injured.

A government statement on Saturday said Meloni and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani instructed Italy's ambassador to immediately contact the chief prosecutor in Switzerland's Valais canton to convey Italy's "strong indignation" over Moretti's release.

It added that the court had taken the decision despite the seriousness of the alleged crime, the risk of flight and the possibility of evidence being compromised.

"The whole of Italy is clamouring for truth and justice, and is calling for respectful measures to be taken in the wake of this disaster, which take full account of the suffering and expectations of the families," the statement said.

Meloni and Tajani also ordered Ambassador Gian Lorenzo Cornado to return to Rome to determine what further action to take, it said.

A Swiss Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson was not immediately available for comment.

Moretti was released under a bail arrangement that included a 200,000 Swiss franc ($256,377) payment and an order to report daily to a police station.

Lawyers for the victims of the fire and their families said they were struggling to understand the court order, adding that their clients were concerned about evidence disappearing.

The Morettis have both expressed grief over the tragedy and said they would cooperate with prosecutors.

In a statement following Jacques Moretti's release, their lawyers said they would both "continue to comply with all requests from the authorities".

The men, all British, were part of a "sophisticated and planned agreement" to go to the houses of the men, Shahzad Akbar and Adil Raja, at almost exactly the same time on December 24 and assault them, prosecutor Warren Stanier told Westminster Magistrates' Court.

Prosecutors say Akbar, a former adviser to jailed ex-Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan , was struck many times in the face after opening the door to his house in Cambridge, central England, to a masked man who had asked for him by name.

Meanwhile, two men called at the home of former army officer-turned YouTuber Adil Raja in Chesham, to the northwest of London, and tried to force entry. Raja, who was convicted in absentia in January of terrorism-related offences linked to online support for Khan, was not there at the time.

A week later two men, one of whom was suspected to have a firearm, are believed to have broken a window at Akbar's address and attempted to throw a burning rag inside. However, it did not cause any damage.

Police said because of the "highly targeted nature of the incidents", the investigation was being led by counter-terrorism offices.

Karl Blackbird, 40, is accused of two counts of conspiracy to assault and cause actual bodily harm while Chris McAulay, 39, faces a single count of the same charge. Doneto Brammer, 21, is charged with possession of a firearm, and conspiracy to commit arson.

The three men, who did not indicate a plea, were remanded in custody until their next appearance at London's Old Bailey Court on February 13.

Three other men have also been arrested in connection with the investigation but have either been released or not charged with any offence as yet.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 13:33:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R3ESFH2MZNKZFC4WPQE2KLBJQ4.jpg?auth=10cc3b77b038100043addd8d88cf9c1ac606472acac91592caf1f669df9fed8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to seek extradition of alleged leader of Ecuadorian drug trafficking gang from Spain, Ecuadorean official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-seek-extradition-alleged-leader-ecuadorian-drug-trafficking-gang-spain-2026-01-24/</link><description>QUITO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The United States filed charges against the alleged leader of the powerful Ecuadorean drug trafficking gang Los Lobos, paving the way for his direct extradition from Spain to the U.S., Ecuador's interior minister said.

Interior Minister John Reimberg said on X late on Friday that the U.S. Attorney's Office had initiated proceedings against Wilmer Geovanny Chavarria Barre, known as "Pipo," following what he described as "strategic and firm" international coordination.

Reimberg said the move showed that there were "no shelters, no borders and no impunity" for criminal leaders.

Chavarria was arrested in the Spanish city of Malaga in November in a joint operation of Ecuadorean and Spanish police, authorities said at the time. President Daniel Noboa announced his capture on November 16, calling it a key success in his government's efforts to combat powerful criminal gangs.

Los Lobos is one of Ecuador's largest drug trafficking groups and was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the United States in September, along with rival gang Los Choneros.

Ecuadorean authorities have accused Chavarria of overseeing drug routes linked to Mexico's Jalisco New Generation Cartel and of controlling illegal mining operations.

Officials have also said Chavarria faked his death, assumed a new identity and hid in Europe while continuing to order killings in Ecuador. Reimberg has previously said Chavarria was responsible for at least 400 deaths and directed criminal operations even while imprisoned between 2011 and 2019.

Noboa has pursued a hard-line security strategy, including deploying the military to confront gangs, as Ecuador faces its worst wave of violence in decades. Analysts say the arrest of gang leaders can fuel further bloodshed as rival groups fight for territory and influence.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:22:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda opposition leader says wife hospitalised after being choked by soldiers</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-opposition-leader-says-wife-hospitalised-after-being-choked-by-soldiers-2026-01-24/</link><description>NAIROBI, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Uganda's opposition leader Bobi Wine said on Saturday his wife had been taken to hospital after soldiers invaded their residence, partially undressed and choked her.

Wine, a pop star-turned-politician, was not at the property and is in hiding after he escaped a previous raid on his home last week hours before he was announced as the runner-up in the January 15 presidential election.

Overnight into Saturday, soldiers forcefully entered the opposition leader's home in the Magere suburb in Kampala's north, breaking down doors and beating up staff, Wine said in a post on X.

Ugandan military spokesperson Chris Magezi could not immediately be reached for comment.

Four-decade incumbent ruler Yoweri Museveni, 81, was declared winner of the vote with 71.6% against Wine's 24%. Wine rejected the results, alleging extensive fraud including ballot stuffing.

During the raid on the residence, Wine said, the soldiers held his wife Barbara Kyagulanyi at gunpoint, asking her to reveal his whereabouts.

"They grabbed my wife's phone, forced her to sit down, and ordered her to remove her password. She refused. They strangled her and insulted her," Wine said.

"They forcefully removed her blouse and took pictures... my wife was rushed to hospital where she remains admitted."

Uganda's military chief, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, who is also Museveni's son, has demanded that Wine surrender to police or he would be treated as a rebel, and has also issued death threats to him.

On Friday Kainerugaba also said authorities had killed 30 supporters of Wine's party National Unity Platform (NUP) and detained 2,000 others. Wine has not been accused of any crime.

Wine alleges that money, documents and other electronic gadgets were also taken during the raid.

On Thursday U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern over the arrests and violence involving opposition figures and supporters.

Rights groups and opposition critics have long accused Museveni of using the military to maintain his grip on power. Ruling party officials deny the accusations, and say Museveni's long rule is due to popular support among the voters.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:44:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5BJFJQ4QMBIHFFGDFB745GC2TM.jpg?auth=3bd56442db2bcf1fd20ab5524504a7d8ef9d09211dfaafd74a4b0e9a7c72c128&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Access road to Chile's Escondida, Zaldivar mines remains blocked amid contractor strike, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/sustainable-finance-reporting/access-road-chiles-escondida-zaldivar-mines-remains-blocked-amid-contractor-2026-01-24/</link><description>SANTIAGO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Striking contract workers employed by machinery contractor Finning resumed on Saturday a blockade of the access road to Chile's Escondida and Zaldivar copper mines, according to industry sources.

The oil is being refined in "various places" including Houston, he said.

The U.S. military has seized seven Venezuela-linked tankers since the start of Trump's month-long campaign to control Venezuela's oil flows.

Trump said on Tuesday that his administration had taken 50 million barrels of oil out of Venezuela, and was selling some of it in the open market.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:44:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/URVBAJ2SLRLVRPCQNOPCC5YKFQ.jpg?auth=7ecc69fac66408e2297b4d665f584c93f719931d54819d56f63b17c69a949e15&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkish pro-Kurd DEM party warns of 'humanitarian tragedy' in siege on Syria's Kobane</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260124-turkish-pro-kurd-dem-party-warns-of-humanitarian-tragedy-in-siege-on-syria-s-kobane</link><description>Turkey 's pro-Kurdish DEM party on Saturday called for the blockade on the Kurdish-majority city of Kobane in northern Syria to be lifted immediately, warning of a "humanitarian tragedy".

The situation in Kobane had escalated from a crisis into a "deadly catastrophe", DEM said after sending a delegation to visit northeastern Syria which over the past week has been targeted by a major Syrian military offensive.

The Kurdish-held city, which is also known as Ain al-Arab, is surrounded by the Turkish border to its north and government forces on all sides.

It lies around 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the Kurds' stronghold in Syria's far northeast.

"Both the military and humanitarian siege on Kobane must be lifted as soon as possible," said DEM co-chair Tulay Hatimogullari.

Kurdish forces have withdrawn from areas near Kobane over the past week following pressure from the Syrian military as President Ahmed al-Sharaa seeks to extend his control across the country.

As the military offensive advanced, residents of surrounding villages flooded into Kobane, where they were now stranded, Hatimogullari said.

"Electricity has been cut off, the internet is cut off, water is cut off. This is a great humanitarian tragedy," she told a news conference.

"Guarantor countries must urgently carry out their responsibilities to lift the siege on northern and eastern Syria," she said referring to the US and western allies who for years have thrown their support behind the Kurdish-dominated SDF forces which have been forced out of the area.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:44:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c6f750e8-f92b-11f0-8560-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TU9KE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Europe’s digital reliance on US Big Tech: Does the EU have a plan?</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260124-europe-s-digital-reliance-on-us-big-tech-does-the-eu-have-a-plan</link><description>In the digital era, almost every part of life – from communication to healthcare infrastructure and banking – functions within an intricate digital framework, led by a handful of companies operating mainly out of the United States. If the framework collapses, so do many of the essential services that allow society to function.

Transatlantic tensions have been steadily rising during US President Donald Trump’s chaotic first year back in the White House . Trump’s repeated demands for the Danish autonomous territory of Greenland and tariff threats have driven the EU to reassess its relationship with its long-time ally, who may not be as dependable as was previously thought. US cooperation with Europe isn’t just key for trade and diplomacy, it’s also essential to maintain a robust technological and digital frontier.

The bulk of European data is stored on US cloud services. Companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Google own over two-thirds of the European market , while US-based AI pioneers like OpenAI and Anthropic are leading the artificial intelligence boom. According to a European Parliament report , the EU “relies on non-EU countries for over 80 percent of digital products, services, infrastructure, and intellectual property”.

That dependency on a handful of providers has left the EU extremely vulnerable to sovereignty risks in its public and private sectors, to the point where technical issues, geopolitical disputes or malicious activity can have wide-reaching, disastrous effects.

With that fear in mind, EU lawmakers are pushing for alternatives to US Big Tech , and providing homegrown substitutes to Google , Open AI, Microsoft and others.

According to Johan Linåker, senior researcher at RISE Research Institutes of Sweden and adjunct assistant professor at Lund University, Europe’s complacency has led the bloc to a point where most of Europe runs on clouds provided by US Big Tech.

“Public sector and governments have been suffering by a comfort syndrome for decades. There’s a tradition of conservative procurement culture, risk aversiveness, and preference for status quo," he said.

“The difference now is that the geopolitical landscape adds a new dimension of risks to the palate – beyond lack of innovation and escalating license costs.”

Lawmakers are scrambling to make up for that complacency. In 2024, the European Commission appointed its first "technology sovereignty, security and democracy" chief, Henna Virkkunen, whose job it is to reduce dependency and formulate policies that will keep the EU digitally secure.

Lawmakers have also rallied behind the Eurostack movement, an initiative established in 2024 that aims to build an independent European digital infrastructure to limit the dependence of the European Union on foreign technology and US companies. It has lofty goals of cutting technological dependence, boosting industry competitiveness and driving innovation – all while committing to the EU’s sustainability goals.

However, an analysis by independent think-tank Bertelsmann Stiftung estimates that it will take roughly a decade and €300 billion for Eurostack to achieve its goal. A less conservative estimate by US trade group Chamber of Progress (which includes several US Big Tech companies) estimates that the full cost would be far higher at over €5 trillion.

Time and money – not will or talent – are the EU’s main problem.

“We have a brilliant pool of skillful and entrepreneurial minds, but they require beyond substantial investments and demand to fully leverage,” Linåker said. “Europe’s sovereignty hinges on its competitiveness and innovation.”

France , Germany , the Netherlands and Italy have also begun investing in open-source platforms. Open-source means that the technology – hardware or software – is available to be modified, reviewed, and shared.

“Essentially, the open-source piece of software is free to use," Linåker said. "In a public procurement you are free to point out the software explicitly and focus on buying the services needed for use. It provides a toolset for governments in growing their digital sovereignty and resilience, and increasingly recognised through upcoming strategies and legislation."

Certain websites like Switch to EU and european-alternatives.eu also provide lists of European or "European-friendly" digital substitutes that can replace US Big Tech: Mastodon can be an alternative to Elon Musk’s X, Switzerland’s Proton Mail can replace Gmail, etc. But habits are hard to break and these changes can only occur through a deliberate shift in mentality.

While that shift will be “massive”, according to Linåker, it must start somewhere.

“Policy-makers and governments need to lead by example by moving the public discourse and communication beyond incumbent platforms as X to options like Mastodon, which enables an open and federated infrastructure, not dependent on any single actor," he said. "But again, this is not an easy shift – although in practice it’s not that hard."

A few pioneering projects are taking digital sovereignty seriously and leading the way to making that change concrete.

The Swedish city of Helsingborg, for example, is testing how it’s public services would function in the event of a digital blackout. The German region of Schleswig-Holstein has gone a step farther: the regional government has substituted its Microsoft-powered computer systems with open-source alternatives, cancelling almost 80 percent of its Microsoft licenses . Although the system isn’t perfect, the Schleswig-Holstein administration hopes to phase out Big Tech almost entirely by the end of the decade.

“The regional government of Schleswig-Holstein proves the fact that one can create a sovereign digital infrastructure, while working with domestic and European vendors," Linåker said. "Myths regarding security and usability are no more. All of Europe should be pointing their eyes in their direction."

But weaning off US tech entirely will take its time.

“Decoupling is unrealistic and cooperation will remain significant across the technological value chain,” an EU digital strategy report draft reviewed by POLITICO in June 2025 said – which means the EU will, for now, continue to promote collaboration with the US and other tech players including China , Japan , India and South Korea .

The draft report's admission that untangling from the dominance of US tech companies is “unrealistic” only fuels fears about the EU’s reliance on their unpredictable transatlantic ally.

“If the plug gets pulled, consequences will be catastrophic. The likelihood is another question,” Linåker said. “Either way, policy makers and governments need to realise the risk is a fact, understand the potential consequences, and start treating digital infrastructure as a critical asset.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 14:44:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/16a8b99c-4965-11ef-a2ad-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP23156453868865.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Airlines reroute, cancel flights as tensions ramp up over Iran</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/airlines-reroute-cancel-flights-tensions-ramp-up-over-iran-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 24 (Reuters) - Airlines have been rerouting and cancelling some flights across the Middle East as tensions ramp up between Iran and the United States, with President Donald Trump saying on Thursday the U.S. had an "armada" heading towards Iran.

A senior Iranian official said on Friday Iran will treat any attack "as an all-out war against us", ahead of the arrival of a U.S. military aircraft carrier strike group and other assets in the Middle East in the coming days.

The European Union's aviation regulator recommended on January 16 that its airlines stay out of Iran's airspace as tensions flared over Tehran's deadly crackdown on protests and U.S. threats of intervention.

Airline KLM will avoid flying over large parts of the Middle East until further notice due to rising tensions there, the Dutch arm of airline group Air France KLM (AIRF.PA) , opens new tab said on January 24.

"As a precaution, given the geopolitical situation, KLM will not fly through the airspace of Iran, Iraq and Israel and will not fly over several countries in the Gulf region," a KLM spokesperson said.

Air France resumed its service to Dubai on January 24 after suspending it a day before, saying it was following the situation in the Middle East "in real time".

"Air France continuously monitors the geopolitical situation of the territories served and overflown by its aircraft," it said in a statement.

Lufthansa said on January 14 it would bypass Iranian and Iraqi airspace until further notice, and would only operate day flights to Tel Aviv and Amman between January 14 and January 19.

Some flights could be cancelled as a result of these actions, it added in a statement that day.

British Airways temporarily suspended flights to Bahrain on January 16 as a precautionary measure, saying it "continue(d) to keep the situation in the region under close review".

Flights to Bahrain were once again available on the BA website on January 24, and a spokesperson for the airline said all its flights were going ahead as scheduled.

Finnair (FIA1S.HE) , opens new tab said in a statement on January 16 it had stopped flying through Iraqi airspace, travelling to Doha and Dubai over Saudi Arabia instead.

The carrier had already been avoiding Iranian, Syrian and Israeli airspace for security reasons.

A Wizz Air (WIZZ.L) , opens new tab spokesperson said in January that the company avoided Iraqi and Iranian airspace.

"Therefore some westbound flights from Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports will have to make (refuelling and crew change) stops in Larnaca, Cyprus or Thessaloniki, Greece," the representative said.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 15:43:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MOQB6S7QMJOIBJSZPJTRF7DPUU.jpg?auth=26fa2121dfcfbb075acf1b5cedfd7ad336de4d8ca5e820b2076ba69c67725271&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pakistan sentences human rights activist to 17 years over anti-state posts</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-sentences-human-rights-activist-17-years-over-anti-state-posts-2026-01-24/</link><description>ISLAMABAD, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Saturday convicted a human rights activist and lawyer, Imaan Mazari and her husband on charges of anti-state social media posts, handing them sentences totalling 17 years, a court order said.

"The prosecution has been able to prove its case," said the court order seen by Reuters.

Mazari, a vocal critic of Pakistan's powerful military, and her husband were convicted on three counts and sentenced to five-year, 10-year and two-year jail terms that will run concurrently, the court said.

Mazari and her husband, Hadi Ali Chattha, who is also a lawyer, have previously denied the charges, saying they were being persecuted for raising their voice against disappearances of nationalist activists, which they blamed on the military, a charge the army denies.

Human rights groups have questioned the trial, raising concerns over shrinking space for civil rights, freedom of speech and political dissent in the nation of 240 million.

The charges under Pakistan's controversial cyber crime laws are linked to their social media posts from the period between 2021 and 2025, which the court said furthered the agenda of anti-state militants and portrayed the military as being involved in terrorism.

Responding to Saturday's court decision, Shireen Mazari, the activist's mother and a minister in the cabinet of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan, said the conviction was illegal without giving defence a chance to present its case.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:25:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens Canada with 100% tariff over pending trade deal with China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/trump-threatens-canada-with-100-tariff-over-possible-deal-with-china-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would impose a 100% tariff on Canada if it follows through on a trade deal with China and warned Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney that a deal would endanger his country.

"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the U.S.A."

Carney's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Canadian prime minister this month traveled to China to reset the countries' strained relationship and reached a trade deal with Canada's second-biggest trading partner after the United States. Immediately after Carney's China trip, Trump sounded supportive. "It's a good thing for him to sign a trade deal," Trump told reporters at the White House on January 16. "If you can get a deal with China, you should do that."

But U.S.-Canada tensions have grown in recent days following Carney's criticism of Trump's pursuit of Greenland.

Trump on Saturday suggested China would try to use Canada to evade U.S. tariffs. "If Governor Carney thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken," Trump said, using a title for Carney that refers to Trump's past calls for Canada to become the 51st U.S. state .

If Trump makes good on Saturday's threat, the new tariff would greatly increase U.S. duties on its northern neighbor, adding pressure to Canadian industrial sectors such as metal manufacturing, autos and machinery.

Relations between Carney and Trump seemed relatively placid until the Canadian leader this week spoke out forcefully against Trump's pursuit of Greenland.

Carney subsequently at the World Economic Forum called on nations to accept that a rules-based global order was over and pointed to Canada as an example of how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimized by American hegemony.

Carney, during his speech in Davos, Switzerland, did not directly call out Trump or the United States by name. However, the prime minister argued that “middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu."

Many world leaders and industry titans present at the Switzerland confab responded with a standing ovation.

Trump shot back in his own Davos speech and said Canada “lives because of the United States,” a statement that Carney rejected on Thursday.

"Canada and the United States have built a remarkable partnership in the economy, in security and in rich cultural exchange," Carney said in Quebec. "Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian."

Since then, Trump has dug in, revoking Canada’s invitation to his Board of Peace that he wants to deal with international conflicts and Gaza’s future.

After Carney’s election last year, Trump and Carney shared a congenial tone. "I think the relationship is going to be very strong,” Trump said at the time.

But Trump this month dismissed the mega trade deal between the United States, Canada, and Mexico — up for renegotiation in July — as “ irrelevant .”</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 16:26:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5SPUZGF6YVLCDLMGJ4GLBZNRDM.jpg?auth=7c09997878ef4d9507ffb2b4b0f8e6b57efe74eb3c909e91df3144e1f5a6682b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Minnesota governor says federal agents involved in shooting in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/minnesota-governor-says-federal-agents-involved-shooting-minneapolis-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - Federal agents have shot another person in Minneapolis, said Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who called for an immediate end to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement operations in the state.

That all changed less than two weeks later when Trump announced a special envoy to the vast island, Jeff Landry, who posted on social media that he would help "make Greenland part of the U.S." The appointment and the message stunned Copenhagen and blindsided senior U.S. officials across the administration who work on European and NATO issues, the sources said.

The exclusion of his own diplomats fit the pattern of Trump's foreign policy-making, which has veered wildly on a range of issues and has often been formulated without the national security officials who in other U.S. presidencies have helped steer policy.

Instead, the Trump administration's moves, which included an implied threat to seize Greenland, a plan for new tariffs on U.S. allies and a push to wring concessions from Denmark, which governs Greenland, appeared to be driven solely by Trump and a small group of close aides.

As Reuters reported this week, those aides included Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who proposed the idea of tariffs, and Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others who tried to steer Trump away from considering military force.

In many ways it's an approach that works for Trump, given his suspicion of the Washington bureaucracy and desire to have his decisions implemented quickly. But the sudden announcements and surprise reversals that flow from it risk lasting damage to relations with key U.S. allies.

When asked to comment on various examples of White House moves that surprised the diplomats involved in cases including Greenland, Ukraine and Syria, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said people “who leak to Reuters” were not clued in on sensitive discussions, and that the achievements of Trump’s national security team spoke for themselves.

"The president was elected to implement America First foreign policy, and he has done so more effectively through his top-down approach,” Kelly said.

The danger in this centralized - and personalized - approach became clear over the past few weeks.

Transatlantic fury over Greenland escalated after a January 5 CNN interview by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. Asked whether the White House would, after the military operation in Venezuela two days before, rule out military action to acquire Greenland, Miller declined to answer directly.

Trump and officials in his administration appeared to double down on the possibility that the U.S. could use force in Greenland in interviews and on social media.

The comments sowed confusion and alarm in Washington and among U.S. allies.

On Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans grew anxious - the administration appeared to be yet again moving forward with a major military operation without consulting Congress first, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Lawmakers phoned Rubio and senior White House officials, laying out their concerns and advising the administration not to move forward, one of those sources said. Some Republican lawmakers also told administration officials that they feared a potential impeachment investigation over any military invasion of Greenland, the sources said.

This week, Trump brought down the tension, withdrawing his threat to impose tariffs on allies supporting Greenland and saying he had reached the outlines of a deal with NATO on the island's future.

Trump said he and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte had "formed the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region" during talks in Davos, Switzerland.

But military action was never seriously considered, according to two sources close to the administration.

Kori Schake, a former Pentagon and White House official with the American Enterprise Institute, said that with Trump’s threat to seize Greenland by force, the damage has already been done.

"Trump is so erratic with his threats, there's no way to establish that he won't turn right around and do it again. He has made the United States untrustworthy to our closest friends,” Schake said.

Asked for comment, including about Miller's remarks, White House spokeswoman Kelly said: “If this deal goes through ... the United States will be achieving all of its strategic goals with respect to Greenland, at very little cost, forever."

Landry's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the Danish embassy did not have a comment for this story.

Trump and his backers have insisted the U.S. needs Greenland to fend off threats from Russian and Chinese in the Arctic and that Denmark cannot ensure its security. But the United States already has a base on the island and the ability to expand its presence there under a 1951 treaty with Denmark.

Trump's practice of centralizing foreign policy decisions, relying on trusted aides and effectively sidelining experts, has been a consistent theme of his second term.

It happened several times during negotiations to end Russia's war in Ukraine . Most recently in the fall, a 28-point plan to end the war emerged from meetings between Trump's Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev, who heads the Russian Direct Investment Fund, one of Russia's largest sovereign wealth funds.

Many senior U.S. officials inside the State Department and on the National Security Council, who would typically be in the know about the evolution of such a plan, were not briefed on the process, two people familiar with the plan said at the time.

The approach has also been apparent in Washington's Syria policy.

In May, Trump met with Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Saudi Arabia in front of cameras, effectively granting U.S. support to the former Islamist militant, even as some in his administration had advised against it. His decision to lift all U.S. sanctions on Syria caught many U.S. officials off guard.

Since then, U.S. envoy Tom Barrack has been the main implementer of Syria policy with officials at the State Department and other parts of the administration having little room to make policy suggestions, according to three sources familiar with the process.

Communications between Barrack and the subject matter experts in Washington have not been frequent, sources added.

A State Department spokesperson said: "There is tremendous collaboration throughout President Trump’s administration, and there are dedicated public servants dutifully advancing key priorities. Then there are the anonymous sources whining to the press who clearly don’t have the judgment or temperament to implement President Trump’s agenda."</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 17:19:13 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/D4ZSGRAUDNM6TMRVWKC2XUV6EY.jpg?auth=2df80cae061e9b5ab9ad5fb4fe7dbe7b5f91eca9ad5cb6292410026ce84e34bb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Man shot by US federal agents in Minneapolis immigration crackdown dies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260124-us-federal-agents-carry-out-another-horrific-shooting-minneapolis-governor</link><description>A 51-year-old man shot Saturday by federal immigration officers in Minneapolis has died, a hospital record obtained by The Associated Press shows.

Trump provoked widespread anger in Britain and across Europe after he said European troops had stayed off the front lines in Afghanistan.

Britain lost 457 service personnel killed in Afghanistan, its deadliest overseas war since the 1950s. For several of the war's most intense years it led the allied campaign in Helmand, Afghanistan's biggest and most violent province, while also fighting as the main U.S. battlefield ally in Iraq.

"The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America!" Trump wrote on Truth Social. "In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. It’s a bond too strong to ever be broken."

Trump's initial comments had provoked an unusually strong reaction from Starmer who has tended to avoid direct criticism of Trump in public.

The British leader's office issued a statement to say the prime minister had spoken to the president on Saturday about the issue.

"The prime minister raised the brave and heroic British and American soldiers who fought side by side in Afghanistan, many of whom never returned home," the statement said. "We must never forget their sacrifice, he said."

Veterans in Britain and elsewhere have been lining up to condemn the U.S. president's comments to Fox Business Network's "Mornings with Maria" on Thursday in which he said that the United States had "never needed" the transatlantic alliance and accused allies of staying "a little off the front lines" in Afghanistan.

Among them was King Charles' younger son Prince Harry, who served two tours in Afghanistan.

"Those sacrifices deserve to be spoken about truthfully and with respect," he said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:18:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MECFYQRYSNI4BOXWKKUNORT3ZA.jpg?auth=db80bd58c78fed507236c908825d66a32474cb80975f2a67d6b5fe5c8d95f20d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK's Starmer discusses need for enhanced security in Arctic in call with Trump</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/uks-starmer-discusses-need-enhanced-security-arctic-call-with-trump-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 24 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump by telephone on Saturday, with the leaders discussing the need for bolstered security in the Arctic, 10 Downing Street said in a statement.

The move paves the way for negotiations aimed at forming a new government, which will need to navigate the delicate balance between U.S. and Iranian influence.

The new government must manage dozens of armed groups that are closer to Iran and answerable more to their own leaders than to the state, while facing growing pressure from Washington to dismantle those militias.

Under the Iraqi constitution, parliament elected a speaker and two deputies on December 29 at its opening session, and must then choose a new president within 30 days. The president will in turn task the largest parliamentary bloc with forming a government.

The Shi'ite political alliance, the Coordination Framework, said in a statement that Maliki was picked "based on his political and administrative experience and his role in managing the state".

Maliki, a senior figure in the Shi'ite Islamist Dawa Party, previously served two terms as Iraq's prime minister from 2006 to 2014, a period marked by sectarian violence, a power struggle with Sunni and Kurdish rivals, and growing tensions with the U.S.

He stepped down after Islamic State seized large parts of the country in 2014 but has remained an influential political player, leading the State of Law coalition and maintaining close ties with Iran-backed factions.

He remains a potent force in Iraqi politics despite longstanding accusations that he fuelled sectarian strife and failed to stop Islamic State from seizing large areas of the country a decade ago.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 19:19:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'It's time to start doing something.' Despite risks of violence, Minnesotans step up to take on ICE</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/its-time-start-doing-something-despite-risks-violence-minnesotans-step-up-take-2026-01-24/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS,  Jan 24  (Reuters) - When Fabiola, a single mother and naturalized U.S. citizen from Latin America, first learned of the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent, she said she was heartbroken and terrified.

Then she joined the thousands of other Minnesotans who have volunteered to track ICE agents since Good was killed - despite her fears for herself and her son Asher, who is seven.

“I do feel scared, but at the same time, I know I have to take care of my people too,” she said.

Activists say they have been overwhelmed by new volunteers - despite the potential for violence - since Good was killed by ICE agent Jonathan Ross.

Federal agents on Saturday shot dead a Minneapolis resident, the second person since the Trump administration surged 3,000 immigration enforcement officials to the city.

Fabiola, who has lived in the U.S. for 20 years and owns a construction company, never knew Good. The mother of three was fatally shot when she stopped her car during an immigration enforcement action, just blocks from Fabiola's home.

DHS did not respond to requests for comment on the risks to observers in Minnesota, but officials say federal agents respond with gunfire when they fear for their lives. Kristi Noem, the DHS secretary, and other Trump administration officials have described the protesters and observers as "anti-ICE" and "far left" agitators.

Fabiola and Asher now blow their whistles when they spot immigration agents on their way to school. She taught Asher how to identify federal agents by their uniforms, and made him memorize his grandparents' phone numbers in case she is detained.

Fabiola, who declined to share her last name for fear of retribution, has also started delivering food to people afraid to leave their homes. And she regularly stops by the makeshift memorial to Good.

“She’s got kids, and her kids don’t have their mom now," Fabiola said. "If something happened to me, where is my boy going to go?”

Vice President JD Vance said during a visit to Minneapolis on Thursday that Good was trying to ram Ross with her car. Analyses of bystander video by Reuters and other outlets show Good's wheels were turned away from Ross, and that his legs were clear of the vehicle when he shot her.

At least five organizations offer training on how to monitor ICE actions, warn immigrants of their presence and document the use of force against detainees and protesters. Online training for one of those groups has been hitting maximum capacity of 1,000 within hours, said Kate Wegener, an immigration attorney who leads the trainings.

“We were fearful that attendance would be lower after her death, but it was the complete opposite,” she said.

The sessions typically offer safety tips: stay at least eight feet from federal agents; follow orders given by officers and keep one's distance when driving behind convoys of agents.

Some of the observers are hyper-aware of the risks. Janet, a resident of a Minneapolis suburb who declined to share her last name out of fear of doxxing, said she has written letters to friends and family to be opened if she's killed.

Minnesota authorities at state and local levels have encouraged the observers. Governor Tim Walz has urged residents to take out their phones and document federal agents.

The observers, often identified by their fluorescent green vests and whistles looped around their necks, are now an increasingly common sight along busy roads and residential neighborhoods when the heavily armed, masked federal agents dressed in tactical gear are deployed.

The community pushback has had some effect. Border Patrol Chief Gregory Bovino on Wednesday said the city presented a “difficult operating environment” for enforcement agents.

Organizers compared the level of engagement to the surge of activism following the police killing of George Floyd in 2020.

On a recent day, two new volunteers, a married couple, straddled their bikes next to a busy intersection on the lookout for ICE agents. Snow gathered on their jackets and frost clung to their eyelashes.

“I kind of woke up to what was happening when Renee Good was killed – I knew bad things were happening, but hadn't realized quite how bad it was yet,” said Aaron, who is 41 and works in marketing. He declined to share his last name out of fear of retribution. “And then when that happened, it was like, it's time to start doing something.”

Earlier that day, he said he had adjusted his six-mile run to cover neighborhoods where residents had reported ICE sightings near schools.

Pushing back against immigration enforcement carries risk. The immigration observers have been teargassed and arrested. State authorities said Friday they were compiling data on arrests but it was not immediately available.

For Patty O’Keefe, a 36-year-old non-profit worker, those risks underline the importance of the observers.

"They wouldn't be working so hard to intimidate us and utilizing all those resources if we weren't actually being successful in gumming up the works of their operation or slowing them down,” O’Keefe said.

Earlier this month, as she was following ICE agents in her car, she said five federal agents shattered her car window, handcuffed her, and put her in an unmarked SUV. She said ICE agents photographed her, insulted her and held her for eight hours in a Minneapolis detention center before she was released without charge.

DHS did not respond to a request for comment on O'Keefe's account of the incident, and Reuters was unable to determine independently what occurred.

She said she now struggles with anxiety - but will continue volunteering.

"I'm just stubborn, and I'm not wanting to give in to the fear."

Many residents speak about Good with a sense of reverence, describing her as an inspiration.

On the street where she was killed, dozens of people defied dangerously cold weather to add to the mounds of bouquets, stuffed animals and electric candles glowing through the snow at a makeshift memorial.

“She gave her life for us,” Fabiola said. “Her soul is in heaven, and she protects us.”</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 20:23:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/I2UR6TS3MBOHRI6WBNTNFAVI74.jpg?auth=2e291bcf066664ff5626da28051edbefa0082be97fcd169f5c9c7d7a9010e785&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>World Health Organization says it regrets US decision to withdraw</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/world-health-organization-says-it-regrets-us-decision-withdraw-2026-01-24/</link><description>Jan 24 (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) said it regrets that the U.S. has officially withdrawn from the U.N. health agency and it hopes Washington returns to active participation in the future.

The U.S. left the organization on Thursday after a year of warnings that doing so would hurt public health in the U.S. and globally.

President Donald Trump's administration has criticized the way the WHO handled the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump has said the WHO had failed to act independently from the "inappropriate political influence of WHO member states" and that the agency required "unfairly onerous payments" from the U.S. that were disproportionate to the sums provided by other, larger countries, such as China.

WHO said it stands by its response to the "unprecedented global health crisis" brought about by the pandemic, adding that "the systems we developed and managed before, during and after the emergency phase of the pandemic, and which run 24/7, have contributed to keeping all countries safe, including the U.S."</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 21:40:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HY5W5LMNKJKL3JSZRQT6Q6GGFI.jpg?auth=291af0011a53c63a354cce6dbdd695b3074fc21d4110ade726c728a1f1aa4e93&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens 100% tariffs on Canadian goods over pending China trade deal</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260124-trump-threatens-100-tariffs-on-canadian-goods-over-pending-china-trade-deal</link><description>US President Donald Trump on Saturday warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China , he will impose a 100 percent tariff on all goods coming over the border.

Relations between the United States and its northern neighbour have been rocky since Trump returned to the White House a year ago, with spats over trade and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney decrying a "rupture" in the US-led global order.

During a visit to Beijing last week , Carney hailed a "new strategic partnership" with China that resulted in a "preliminary but landmark trade agreement" to reduce tariffs – but Trump warned of serious consequences should that deal be realised.

If Carney "thinks he is going to make Canada a 'Drop Off Port' for China to send goods and products into the United States, he is sorely mistaken," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

"China will eat Canada alive, completely devour it, including the destruction of their businesses, social fabric, and general way of life," he said.

"If Canada makes a deal with China, it will immediately be hit with a 100% Tariff against all Canadian goods and products coming into the USA ."

Trump insulted Carney by calling him "Governor" – a swipe referring to the US president's repeated insistence that Canada should be the 51st US state.

Trump this week posted an image on social media of a map with Canada – as well as Greenland and Venezuela -- covered by the American flag.

Canada's minister responsible for trade with the United States, Dominic LeBlanc, pushed back against Trump's latest threat.

"There is no pursuit of a free trade deal with China. What was achieved was resolution on several important tariff issues," he wrote on X.

The two leaders have sharpened their rhetorical knives in recent days, beginning with Carney's speech on Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where he earned a standing ovation for his frank assessment of a "rupture" in the US-led global order.

His comment was widely viewed as a reference to Trump's disruptive influence on international affairs, although Carney did not mention the US leader by name.

Trump fired back at Carney a day later in his own speech, and then withdrew an invitation for the Canadian prime minister to join his "Board of Peace" – his self-styled body for resolving global conflict.

Initially designed to oversee the situation in postwar Gaza, the body appears now to have a far wider scope, sparking concerns that Trump wants to create a rival to the United Nations.

"Canada lives because of the United States. Remember that, Mark, the next time you make your statements," Trump said.

Carney shot back on Thursday: "Canada doesn't live because of the United States. Canada thrives because we are Canadian." He nevertheless acknowledged the "remarkable partnership" between the two nations.

Canada heavily relies on trade with the United States, the destination for more than three-quarters of Canadian exports.

Key Canadian sectors like auto, aluminium and steel have been hit hard by Trump's global sectoral tariffs, but the levies' impacts have been muted by the president's broad adherence to an existing North American free trade agreement.

Negotiations on revising that deal are set for early this year, and Trump has repeatedly insisted the United States doesn't need access to any Canadian products – which would have sweeping consequences for its northern neighbour.

Matthew Holmes, executive vice president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, said in a statement that he hoped the two governments would "come to a better understanding quickly that can alleviate further concerns for businesses."

The village is near the town of Vovchansk, close to the Ukraine-Russia border, where Russian forces launched an incursion in May 2024.

Moscow's troops have in recent months tried to extend gains in the area despite Ukrainian resistance.

The General Staff of Ukraine's military, in a report late on Saturday, said Russian forces had launched six attacks on an area including Starytsya. But it made no acknowledgement that the village had changed hands.

Ukraine's DeepState military blog, which uses open-source reports to track the positions of both armies, made no mention of the village in a report on Friday, but said Russian forces "are continuing their pressure in the Vovchansk area."

The Russian Defence Ministry report said Moscow's troops had also carried out a massive strike overnight on Ukrainian long-range drone sites and energy facilities.

Reuters could not independently verify the battlefield reports.

Russian forces have been engaged in a slow drive westward through southeastern Ukraine , announcing the capture of new villages several times a week.

Most of its gains have been in the Donetsk region, but Russian forces have also applied pressure to Ukrainian defences in the Kharkiv region and in the Zaporizhzhia region to the south, which they partially occupy.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 22:47:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Appeals court rejects Justice Department’s push to charge more people over Minnesota church demonstration</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/appeals-court-rejects-justice-departments-push-charge-more-people-over-minnesota-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court rejected the Justice Department's bid to charge five more people accused of disrupting a Minnesota church service this month, according to court documents made public on Saturday, revealing the lengths the Trump administration has gone to prosecute those involved in the demonstration.

The ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is the latest legal setback for the Justice Department as it pursues demonstrators who interrupted a service on Sunday in protest of a pastor's apparent connection to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. One judge involved in the case said the department's request appeared to be unprecedented.

A federal magistrate judge this week declined to approve arrest warrants for five proposed defendants, including former CNN anchor Don Lemon, who recorded the demonstration, citing a lack of evidence. The judge approved charges for three alleged leaders of the demonstration, but struck a proposed charge accusing them of physically obstructing a house of worship.

The case has drawn substantial attention as the Trump administration pursues a sweeping immigration crackdown in the state and administration officials have vowed to protect Christian services.

A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The three defendants — activists Nekima Levy Armstrong, Chauntyll Louisa Allen and William Kelly — were each charged with conspiracy against rights for allegedly intimidating and harassing parishioners, according to a criminal complaint. They have accused the Trump administration of retaliation over their protest.

The Justice Department first asked the chief trial judge and later the appeals court to immediately intervene and approve warrants for the five other proposed defendants, citing a risk of similar church disruptions.

The chief U.S. District Court judge in Minnesota, Patrick Schiltz, described the Justice Department's request as "unheard of in our district" and any other under the 8th Circuit, which covers seven U.S. states, according to a letter made public on Saturday.

All three judges on the 8th Circuit panel agreed not to intervene. One judge, Leonard Steven Grasz, wrote that he believed prosecutors had shown enough evidence to justify charges against the other proposed defendants, but that prosecutors have ways to get them approved other than through the appeals court.

The Justice Department can still ask a grand jury to approve charges against the demonstrators or seek to present additional evidence to the magistrate judge.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 23:22:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CECJ53VF3FOLPAD36EQ2BS36C4.jpg?auth=ccbbf6a01a72c88cb50f4453d481a6397e2ae6949aaaa95e24f715e33dd3f9ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canada's Carney to visit Australia in March</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-carney-visit-australia-march-2026-01-24/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney will visit Australia in March, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday, as he backed a speech by his Canadian counterpart decrying powerful nations using economic integration as weapons and tariffs as leverage.

"My friend Mark Carney will visit Australia with an address to the parliament in March," Albanese said in remarks on Australian Broadcasting Corp television.

Albanese said he concurred with Carney's well-received Davos address that called on nations to accept the end of a rules-based global order and pointed to Canada as an example of how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimised by American hegemony.

"I agree with him," Albanese said, referring to the speech that drew criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.

Carney's visit to Australia will come after the two allies in October deepened their relationship, signing an agreement to promote and strengthen cooperation and trade on critical minerals.</description><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jan 2026 23:41:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BPPHPECAGNNQDABZ6SGBKWA6BI.jpg?auth=1e60f610a63ddb9fc7613589da382266d6205c0e42e5b92ce6b8a8767033349f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Final phase of Myanmar's election underway, military-backed party set to win</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/final-phase-myanmars-election-underway-military-backed-party-set-win-2026-01-25/</link><description>Jan 25 (Reuters) - Polling stations in Myanmar opened on Sunday for the final round of a general election in the war-torn country, with a military-backed party set to win and the junta chief expected to take on a political role after the widely criticised election.

The previous two phases of the election - held on December 28 and January 11 - have been marked by low voter turnout of around 55%, well below the turnout of about 70% recorded in Myanmar's 2020 and 2015 general elections.

Voters in 60 townships will cast their ballots, including in the major cities of Yangon and Mandalay, amid a civil war triggered by a coup that brought the military to power.

Although the United Nations, some Western governments and rights groups have derided the polls as a sham exercise to perpetuate the military's hold, the ruling junta has vowed it will transfer power to a new government, likely in April.

The military took control of the impoverished Southeast Asian nation in a dawn coup on February 1, 2021, ousting an elected civilian government led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi.

The 80-year-old politician remains in detention and, like several other opposition groups, her National League for Democracy has been dissolved by the junta, tilting the political playing field in favour of the military-backed party that is leading the polls.

Malaysia, which last year chaired the 11-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, on Tuesday said the bloc had rejected an offer from Myanmar to send poll observers and would not endorse the election.

"Rather than resolving a crisis now in its fifth year, the vote is more likely to reinforce the military's hold on power, with little prospect of restoring domestic legitimacy or improving the country's standing with Western partners," said Kaho Yu, Principal Asia Analyst at risk intelligence company Verisk Maplecroft.

Fighting has continued through the election campaign and earlier voting in many parts of Myanmar, including air strikes around civilian areas in the border states of Rakhine, Shan and Kayin.

So far, the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party has secured 193 out of 209 seats in the lower house and 52 out of 78 seats in the upper house, according to the election commission, leaving the party in a dominant position.

The USDP, which was formed in 2010 and governed the country for five years following the end of a previous military government, is chaired by a retired brigadier general and packed with other former high-ranking officers.

Myanmar's military, which has ruled the country for five of the past six decades, does not appear to have any real intention of withdrawing from its political leadership role.

"Regardless of how successive governments may change over time, Tatmadaw remains a steadfast institution that will continue to shoulder the responsibilities of national defence and security," said junta leader Min Aung Hlaing last week, referring to the Burmese term for the military.

The 69-year-old general has indicated he is considering appointing a successor as armed forces chief and will likely move into a fully political role, Reuters has reported .

While the junta has portrayed the election as a success despite the low turnout , residents of Myanmar's biggest cities have told Reuters of an atmosphere of fear, where many felt compelled to vote to avoid potential arrest or retribution.

The military has insisted the election is free of coercion and has public backing.

On the back of an election protection law , the junta has charged over 400 people for criticising and obstructing the election process, according to state media.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:56:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WPXMPAPVQ5NOXJKWR2XSV7L5PU.jpg?auth=18a6d3382c04958b5a9fdc860fab2be843aeef4647a730840ab1f5caed2d1a9d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Deaths mount as Trump immigration push intensifies</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/deaths-mount-trump-immigration-push-intensifies-2026-01-25/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The fatal shooting of a man in Minneapolis on Saturday added to a mounting death toll in U.S. President Donald Trump’s intensifying immigration push this month, increasing scrutiny on the crackdown as backlash builds.

The incident was one of five shootings in January involving federal agents conducting immigration enforcement, including the fatal shooting of Minnesota woman Renee Good . At least six immigrants have died this month in federal immigration detention, an unusually rapid pace.

The Trump administration is dramatically ramping up immigration enforcement with $170 billion budgeted for immigration agencies through September 2029, a historic sum.

Minneapolis has become the focus of the Republican president’s crackdown this month, with some 3,000 agents deployed. Thousands of protesters took to the streets despite sub-zero temperatures on Friday to voice opposition to Trump’s enforcement and demand he withdraw the agents, which Minnesota officials have called an occupation.

Trump has argued the militarized operations are necessary to remove criminals from the U.S., but many of those arrested were picked up solely for possible civil immigration violations - the legal equivalent to a traffic violation.

Here is a closer look at the deaths from federal immigration enforcement and the often-conflicting accounts of what happened in each case.

The man killed in Minneapolis on Saturday was a U.S. citizen, identified in news reports as Alex Pretti, 37, a registered nurse and lawfully permitted gun owner.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said a Border Patrol agent fired at the man, who resisted agents' attempts to disarm him, but local leaders challenged that account.

In bystander videos verified by Reuters, agents are seen pepper spraying Pretti and other protesters as he films them with his cellphone. No weapon is visible. After multiple agents wrestle him to the ground, one draws his weapon and multiple shots can be heard.

The shooting followed Good’s death earlier this month, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer Jonathan Ross fired into her vehicle.

Within hours of that shooting, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem called Good a “domestic terrorist” who tried to ram the ICE officer with her car, although the department has not presented evidence of a link to terrorism. Video shows Ross fired as Good's car moved past him .

Federal agents have been involved in three other shootings this month during immigration actions.

The day after Good’s death, a U.S. Border Patrol agent shot and wounded a Venezuelan man and woman in Portland, Oregon, after what DHS called “a targeted vehicle stop.”

DHS said the driver, Venezuelan immigrant Luis Nino-Moncada, attempted to run over the agents before the agent fired, wounding Nino-Moncada and his passenger, a Venezuelan woman.

The Justice Department later charged Nino-Moncada with assaulting an officer. His passenger, Yorlenys Zambrano-Contreras, pleaded guilty this week to entering the U.S. illegally in 2023.

On January 15, an ICE agent shot Julio Cesar Sosa-Celis in the leg in Minneapolis after DHS said he fled authorities.

DHS said at the time that Sosa-Celis, a Venezuelan immigrant, and two other men hit an officer with a snow shovel and broom handle, prompting the shooting.

Court documents unsealed this week , opens new tab told a different story. An FBI affidavit said the ICE officers had scanned a license plate registered with a different person suspected of an immigration violation, leading them to chase the wrong person before the alleged assault and shooting.

At least six people have died in ICE detention centers since the start of 2026, following at least 30 deaths in ICE custody last year, a two-decade high.

The death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos has received the most scrutiny after federal authorities provided shifting accounts of what happened.

ICE initially said Lunas died on January 3 at a Trump-era detention camp on the grounds of a U.S. military base in Texas after experiencing "medical distress."

After the Washington Post reported , opens new tab the death would likely be classified as a homicide by the El Paso County medical examiner, DHS issued a new statement saying Lunas tried to commit suicide and then resisted security officers and died.

The medical examiner released a report this week that found the death was a homicide due to "asphyxia due to neck and torso compression," the Post reported.

On January 14, two other immigrant detainees died: a Nicaraguan man found unresponsive in the military base site, called East Camp Montana, and a Mexican man found unresponsive in a Georgia detention center, according to ICE.

Both deaths remain under investigation, but ICE said the Nicaraguan man, Victor Manuel Diaz, was presumed to have committed suicide.

The other deaths occurred in Houston, Philadelphia, and Indio, California, ICE said.

Trump increased immigration detention to record levels, with 69,000 held as of early January, according to ICE statistics. Some 43% of the detainees picked up by ICE had no criminal charge or conviction, the figures showed.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 01:57:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FXUF2P2C5NJOJHI4574VTLYC2E.jpg?auth=ea4d0e28a1ca93b35125b914f3c4db22b59ea84bf961b23d39ea8fec2d9ec241&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indonesia resumes search for 80 after landslide kills 10 in West Java</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/indonesia-resumes-search-80-after-landslide-kills-10-west-java-2026-01-25/</link><description>WEST BANDUNG, Indonesia, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Indonesian authorities resumed search-and-rescue efforts for 80 people missing after a landslide killed 10 in a residential area of West Java province.

The landslide early on Saturday was triggered by heavy rains starting the day before, which the weather agency warned could continue for a week in the province and several other regions.

Resident Dedi Kurniawan, 36, said it was the first big landslide he had witnessed in Pasir Langu village in a hilly area of the province about 100 km (60 miles) southeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.

"Sometimes we have only small floods from the nearest river, but this time (the landslide) came from the forest," he told Reuters.

Rescuers were hampered on Saturday as unstable terrain and rains hindered them from deploying heavy machinery, Kompas TV reported, citing authorities.

There were multiple reports of floods in West Java, including Jakarta. The floods have caused residents in heavily impacted areas to evacuate to higher ground or unaffected places.

The landslide occurred two months after cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra killed 1,200 people, destroyed homes and displaced over a million residents.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 03:57:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZFKC462VLJL65NEBVHRQCMQDLA.jpg?auth=dc92301e5860b34a6aa4b81667fb8a8adc34812f332ac80a970d5007959b5edb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian defence department chief to replace Kevin Rudd as US ambassador</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/australian-defence-department-chief-replace-kevin-rudd-us-ambassador-2026-01-25/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Sunday named the country's defence department chief as the next ambassador to the U.S., after Kevin Rudd said he would step down following criticism from U.S. President Donald Trump.

"Mr Moriarty is I think an outstanding Australian public servant," Albanese said in remarks on Australian Broadcasting Corporation television.

Rudd, a former prime minister who made critical comments about Trump before becoming ambassador, said earlier this month that he would leave the role a year earlier than expected, finishing his posting in March. In October, Trump criticised Rudd during an event at the White House saying: "I don’t like you either, and I probably never will."

Six people, including two teenagers, are presumed dead after heavy rains triggered Thursday's landslide at Mount Maunganui on the island's east coast, bringing down soil and rubble at the site in the city of Tauranga, crowded with families on summer holidays.

Authorities have been working to identify the victims after human remains were found at the site on Saturday.

But a crack found at the site prompted recovery work to cease for the day on Sunday, said police Superintendent Tim Anderson.

"As a result of that, we've had to pull all our staff out," Anderson told reporters at Mount Maunganui, adding, "We've had to do that for the safety of everyone concerned."

He did not specify when work would resume, saying the authorities were taking it "day by day at the moment".

Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said on Saturday it was "devastating to receive the news we have all been dreading", after the rescue operation shifted to recovery.

"To the families who have lost loved ones - every New Zealander is grieving with you," Luxon posted on X.

The heavy rain this week unleashed another landslide in the neighbouring suburb of Papamoa, killing two.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 04:55:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7Z3TIVJBWVNBJKBMTK6L3DDRHU.jpg?auth=3a3a3eaeee171dfd80b7b3c1371b500dcad81dd6402d60b8237ea2d0e99223c2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU set to elevate ties with Vietnam amid trade disruptions, source says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/eu-set-elevate-ties-with-vietnam-amid-trade-disruptions-source-says-2026-01-25/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The European Union and Vietnam will elevate ties during a visit to Hanoi by the European Council President Antonio Costa on Thursday, an EU official said, as both sides seek to expand international partnerships amid disruptions from U.S. tariffs.

The visit comes on the heels of To Lam's re-appointment as Vietnam's top official, potentially making Costa the first leader of a major power to meet Lam since the ruling Communist Party on Friday appointed him for a new term as general secretary.

The elevation of ties to Vietnam's highest level has been planned for months and was delayed largely because of schedule complications, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymlty.

It would place the EU on the same tier as China, the U.S. and Russia among others, further expanding Vietnam's advanced partnerships, in line with the country's strategy of balancing big powers.

The European Council declined to comment. Vietnam's government did not respond to a request for comment.

These upgrades are largely symbolic, as they merely entail more frequent high-level meetings and usually no binding agreements.

Vietnam's relations with the United States worsened last year after the Trump administration imposed tariffs, despite the upgrade of bilateral ties inked by former president Joe Biden during a visit to Hanoi in late 2023.

The upgrade with the EU is expected to generate more cooperation in multiple fields, including research, technology, energy and critical minerals, according to a draft joint statement, the official said. Vietnam has significant but often little exploited deposits of rare earths, gallium and tungsten.

The Southeast Asian trade-reliant nation is a major link in global supply chains, especially for electronics, clothing and footwear. It has a string of free trade agreements with multiple partners, including with the European Union.

The EU has repeatedly criticised Vietnam's implementation of the free trade agreement, which has boosted Vietnam's surplus with the 27-nation bloc since it came into force in 2020. The EU deficit with Hanoi stood at 42.5 billion euros ($50.26 billion) in 2024.

EU officials accuse Hanoi of hampering EU imports with multiple non-tariff barriers, but Brussels has so far taken limited action to address the situation.

Also, facing tariffs from the United States, the EU has prioritised improving ties with economic partners and expanding trade agreements, including recently with South American nations of the Mercosur bloc.

The nomination of the former three-time conservative party lawmaker was initially interpreted as an attempt by the liberal president to integrate the nation's politics, but Lee Hye-hoon has been facing pressure to step down amid allegations of abusive remarks to colleagues and controversial property investments.

"Sick," Honnold said as he got to the top spire of Taiwan's tallest building after his 91-minute "free solo" ascent, which was organised and broadcast live by Netflix (NFLX.O) , opens new tab .

"What a beautiful way to see Taipei," he told reporters after his mission, which was postponed by a day due to wet weather.

The 508-metre (1,667-foot) Taipei 101, which dominates the city's skyline and is a major tourist attraction, was the tallest building in the world from 2004 to 2010, a crown currently held by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

The climb, with no safety equipment, took place with the full support and permission of Taipei 101 and the city government.

Honnold said he had once thought of climbing the structure without permission.

"But then out of respect for the building and respect for all the people on the team who'd allowed me access to look at it, I was like, well obviously I'm not going to poach this, I'm going to respect the people and just see if it ever comes together."

Executive Producer James Smith said it was rare for a building to trust a climber and allow such an event to take place, calling Taipei 101 "a real icon of this country".

Taiwanese politicians took to social media to thank Honnold and Netflix for putting Taiwan - more accustomed to featuring in global headlines for its semiconductor prowess or Chinese military threats - in the international spotlight with such a different perspective.

"Congratulations to the brave, fearless Alex for completing the challenge," President Lai Ching-te wrote on his Facebook page.

"Through Netflix's live broadcast cameras, the world didn't just see Taipei 101 - it also saw the warmth and passion of the Taiwanese people, and the beautiful hills and scenery of this land," he added.

This is not the first time Taipei 101 has been scaled.

In 2004, French climber Alain Robert, dubbed "Spiderman" for his ropeless ascents of some of the world's highest skyscrapers, climbed the building, though did so with a safety rope in a time of four hours.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 06:33:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CAH2QDGNVRJA5AV3JLVQYVUWYU.jpg?auth=03fcbebb47db2dd8fd400404a9e085b732e6a4cbc05e22ef7b8bc2b987744e99&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australian PM says Trump's comments on NATO troops 'completely unacceptable'</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-australian-pm-says-trump-s-comments-nato-troops-completely-unacceptable</link><description>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday that comments from US President Donald Trump lamenting the efforts of non-US troops in Afghanistan were "completely unacceptable".

Trump said in a Fox News interview that NATO sent "some troops" but "stayed a little back, a little off the front lines".

Trump appeared to be partially walking back his remarks on Saturday amid growing outrage from European and now Australian allies.

Speaking on the ABC's Insiders programme on Sunday morning, Albanese said Australian families of fallen soldiers would be "hurting" as a result of Trump's comments.

"Those 47 Australian families who will be hurting by these comments, they deserve our absolute respect, our admiration," Albanese said.

"The bravery that was shown by 40,000 Australians (who) served in Afghanistan, they were certainly on the frontlines in order to, along with our other allies, defend democracy and freedom and to defend our national interests," he added.

"They deserve our respect."

On Saturday, a day after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned Trump's remarks as "appalling", Trump appeared to change his position -- at least as far as British troops were concerned.

"The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America!" Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

"In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. It's a bond too strong to ever be broken."

Albanese referenced Trump's later comments, suggesting he also appreciated the Australian effort in Afghanistan.

"I think President Trump's comments overnight indicate a very different position. He's acknowledged the contribution," Albanese told the ABC, but added that Trump's previous comments were "entirely not appropriate. Completely unacceptable".

Albanese also announced Australia's next Ambassador to the United States, recommending Greg Moriarty for the job.

Earlier this month, Australia announced its ambassador to the United States, Kevin Rudd , would leave after a three-year tenure overshadowed by Trump's verdict on him: "I don't like you either."

Former Australian prime minister Rudd, who departs his post on March 31 to become president of the Asia Society think tank in New York , had sharply criticised Trump while he was out of office.

Trump expressed disdain for Rudd during a televised US-Australia meeting at the White House in October last year, prompting some Australian opposition calls for his posting to be ended.

Albanese said Moriarty was an "outstanding Australian public servant", and he had consulted with the Trump administration on his selection.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:24:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/35947ffc-f9b9-11f0-96d7-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26003621877327.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New wave of protests in Minneapolis after man is killed by federal agents</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-protesters-in-minneapolis-demand-ice-leave-after-man-is-killed-by-federal-agents</link><description>The killing of a US citizen by federal immigration agents on Saturday -- the second in Minneapolis this month -- sparked new protests and impassioned demands by local leaders for the Trump administration to end its operation in the city.

Federal agents shot dead Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, while scuffling with him on an icy roadway, less than three weeks after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer shot and killed Renee Good, also 37, in her car.

The Trump administration quickly claimed, as it did after Good's death, that Pretti had intended to harm the federal agents, even as video of the incident appeared to contradict their account.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) pointed to a pistol and ammunition it said was discovered on Pretti.

"He was there to perpetuate violence," Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem told a briefing, while White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller referred to Pretti as an "assassin," in a post amplified on X by Vice President JD Vance .

However, as with Good's death, cell phone footage of the incident raised serious questions about the federal government's description of the incident.

Video aired widely by US media, which AFP has not verified, shows Pretti filming agents in the snow-lined street and directing traffic.

After an agent shoves a woman protester to the ground on the sidewalk, Pretti steps in between them and is sprayed in the face by a chemical irritant.

The agent then pulls Pretti to the ground and several officers struggle to detain him on the icy roadway.

Seconds later, as an officer apparently discovers and pulls a gun from Pretti's pants, agents open fire, also shooting his motionless body several times from a distance.

Pretti's parents in a statement circulated by US media called him a "kindhearted soul" and accused the Trump administration of telling "sickening lies" about their son.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called the shooting "horrific" and demanded state authorities lead the investigation.

"The federal government cannot be trusted to lead this investigation. The state will handle it, period," Walz told a news conference.

Federal authorities controversially blocked local investigators from jointly probing Good's death.

One Senate Republican on Saturday called for a joint investigation into the shooting.

"The events in Minneapolis are incredibly disturbing. The credibility of ICE and DHS are at stake," Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, wrote on X.

"There must be a full joint federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth."

Republican President Donald Trump meanwhile ratcheted up his war of words with Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, accusing the Democratic leaders of "inciting insurrection" with their rhetoric.

Trump had previously threatened to send troops to Minnesota by invoking the Insurrection Act.

As the president presses a sweeping campaign to deport undocumented migrants, thousands of ICE agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city.

Public outrage was also rekindled earlier this week by the detention of a five-year-old boy as federal agents sought to arrest his father.

Frey at a news conference urged Trump to end the federal immigration operation, which has sparked sometimes violent demonstrations.

"This is a moment to act like a leader. Put Minneapolis, put America first in this moment -- let's achieve peace. Let's end this operation."

Police Chief Brian O'Hara said an "incredibly volatile scene" erupted after the shooting as protesters arrived, with local officials unable to secure the scene for investigation.

O'Hara told a later briefing that Minnesota National Guard troops would help secure a vehicle exclusion zone set up around the site.

Local resident Maria, 56, told AFP the situation in the city was "escalating."

"They're attacking and terrorizing our communities right now."

Hundreds of protesters gathered in a park in Minneapolis Saturday evening, despite bitterly cold temperatures in the northern US city.

The shooting comes a day after tens of thousands of people braved the cold to gather in downtown Minneapolis to voice opposition to the federal operation.

O'Hara said police believed the victim did not have any serious criminal background and was a "lawful gun owner with a permit to carry."

Some gun rights advocates -- often staunch supporters of the president -- have raised concerns after the Trump administration quickly linked Pretti's legal gun possession to an intent to do mass harm.

The Gun Owners of America (GOA) condemned a statement by Bill Essayli, a federal prosecutor in California , who had said on X: "If you approach law enforcement with a gun, there is a high likelihood they will be legally justified in shooting you."

"The Second Amendment protects Americans' right to bear arms while protesting -- a right the federal government must not infringe upon," GOA said in a statement.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:24:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/c2016ade-f970-11f0-9313-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/0a20b64ac008f7acc606846637d05c3daf3978d9.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Crowds flock to Tokyo zoo to see pandas before they leave for China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/crowds-flock-tokyo-zoo-see-pandas-before-they-leave-china-2026-01-25/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Panda fans flocked to the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo on Sunday to say goodbye to its star attractions - two giant pandas, who will be sent back to China at the end of the month.

The departure of four-year-old twins Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei leaves Japan panda-less for the first time since 1972, prompting thousands to apply for lottery-assigned tickets to say goodbye.

"I've been coming since the parents of Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei were here," said 54-year-old finance-sector worker Machiko Seki. "It feels like one family's story is coming to an end."

While their move to China has been planned for some time, the pandas' coming absence has been viewed as a reflection of deteriorating China-Japan relations in recent months.

In November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. That triggered a furious response from Beijing, which claims sovereignty over the democratically-governed island.

Political tensions were not the focus of many zoo-goers on Sunday, when visitors were allowed one-minute windows to see the bears.

"The pandas have given me so much - energy, courage, healing," Seki said. "I wanted to come today to express my gratitude."

Even people who did not win tickets made the journey.

"Today, I didn't win the lottery for the panda viewing, so I can't see the pandas in person," said 49-year-old housewife Akiko Kawakami.

"I came here today because I wanted to breathe the same air as the pandas."</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 07:42:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C3EQF45QVRISDDNHZTY3R6URG4.jpg?auth=aa5438621bb483c52d30e8ae334deaa4fb75030dfafe1082c6c5dedb0116c2c9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US storm leaves 230,000 without power, forces thousands of flight cancellations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/thousands-flights-canceled-ahead-us-winter-storm-2026-01-24/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - More than 4,000 flights were canceled in the U.S. on Saturday ahead of a monster winter storm that had already cut power to more than 230,000 customers as far west as Texas and threatened to paralyze eastern states with heavy snowfall.

Forecasters said snow, sleet, freezing rain and dangerously frigid temperatures would sweep the eastern two-thirds of the nation on Sunday and into the week.

Calling the storms "historic," President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations in South Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Indiana, and West Virginia.

"We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm," Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social.

Seventeen states and the District of Columbia have declared weather emergencies, the Department of Homeland Security said.

"We do have tens of thousands of people in affected states in the South that have lost power," DHS Secretary Kristi Noem said on Saturday. "We have utility crews that are working to restore that as quick as possible."

The number of outages continued to rise. As of 2:44 a.m. EST (0744 GMT) on Sunday, some 230,000 U.S. customers had no electricity, the bulk of them in Louisiana, Mississippi, Texas, Tennessee and New Mexico, according to PowerOutage.com.

The Department of Energy on Saturday issued an emergency order authorizing the Electric Reliability Council of Texas to deploy backup generation resources at data centers and other major facilities, aiming to limit blackouts in the state.

On Sunday, the DOE issued an emergency order to authorize grid operator PJM Interconnection to run "specified resources" in the mid-Atlantic region, regardless of limits due to state laws or environmental permits.

The National Weather Service warned of an unusually expansive and long-duration winter storm that would bring widespread, heavy ice accumulation in the Southeast, where "crippling to locally catastrophic impacts" can be expected.

Weather service forecasters predicted record cold temperatures and dangerously cold wind chills descending further into the Great Plains region by Monday.

As of 10:21 p.m. EST, more than 4,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Saturday had been canceled, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. More than 9,400 U.S. flights originally set for Sunday also have been canceled.

Major U.S. airlines warned passengers to stay alert for abrupt flight changes and cancellations.

On Saturday, Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) , opens new tab continued to adjust its schedule and made additional cancellations in the morning for Atlanta and along the East Coast, including in Boston and New York City.

It added it was relocating experts from cold-weather hubs to support de-icing and baggage teams at several southern airports.

JetBlue (JBLU.O) , opens new tab said that as of Saturday morning it had canceled about 1,000 flights through Monday.

United Airlines (UAL.O) , opens new tab said its weather preparations included proactively canceling some flights in places with the worst weather.

U.S. electric grid operators on Saturday stepped up precautions to avoid rotating blackouts.

Dominion Energy (D.N) , opens new tab , whose Virginia operations include the largest collection of data centers in the world, said if its ice forecast held, the winter event could be among the largest to affect the company.

Noem, at a news conference about U.S. government preparations for the storm, warned Americans to take precautions.

"It’s going to be very, very cold," Noem said. "So we'd encourage everybody to stock up on fuel, stock up on food, and we will get through this together."</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 08:29:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YSDVGYA2JJME5HXIJY5NQLLH5E.jpg?auth=a5d51ca46f69026b70d2ee2e8703fcfe3f08c7a65905d387c89c25a8a84cbed3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Around 1,700 Kyiv apartment blocks still without heating after Russian strike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/around-1700-kyiv-apartment-blocks-still-without-heating-after-russian-strike-2026-01-25/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Around 1,700 apartment buildings in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv were still without heating following a Russian missile and drone attack earlier this week, Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko said on Sunday.

Moscow has sharply intensified bombardments of Ukraine's energy system since it invaded its neighbour in 2022.

Russia launched a vast attack on Ukraine's energy system on Saturday, rocking Kyiv with explosions overnight, leaving 1.2 million properties without power countrywide during sub-zero winter temperatures.

"Russia’s main targets right now are our energy sector, critical infrastructure, and residential buildings," Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on X.

This week alone, he said Russia had launched more than 1,700 attack drones, over 1,380 guided aerial bombs and 69 missiles on Ukraine.

Every massive attack by Russia could have a devastating impact, said Zelenskiy, who on Sunday visited Lithuania.

"We are working with every leader to strengthen Ukraine. Everyone must clearly understand the threat coming from Russia," he said.

Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba said on Saturday that more than 3,200 of Kyiv's buildings were without heating late that evening, down from 6,000 in the morning.

"Since yesterday evening, utility workers and energy companies have restored heat supply to more than 1,600 buildings. They are continuing to work to restore services to the homes of Kyiv residents," Klitschko said on Telegram.

The large-scale attack on the Ukrainian capital took place just as Ukrainian, Russian and American negotiators were discussing options in Abu Dhabi for ending the war.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 08:29:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/H3RZUALKO5MA3PVFVTH6MXVGMI.jpg?auth=ff3ee6180052b590b05852016310f83e507e0cdb000bf70ed711dd3a704382f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>What we know about Alex Pretti, the man shot dead by federal agents in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-what-we-know-about-alex-pretti-the-man-shot-dead-by-federal-agents-in-minneapolis</link><description>Family members of Alex Pretti, the man killed by a US Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Saturday, said he was an intensive care nurse at a VA hospital who cared deeply about people and was upset by President Donald Trump ’s immigration crackdown in his city.

Alex Jeffrey Pretti, 37, was an avid outdoorsman who enjoyed getting in adventures with Joule, his beloved Catahoula Leopard dog who also recently died. He worked for the US Department of Veterans Affairs and had participated in protests following the January 7 killing of Renee Good by an Immigration and Customs officer.

“He cared about people deeply and he was very upset with what was happening in Minneapolis and throughout the United States with ICE, as millions of other people are upset,” said Michael Pretti, Alex’s father. “He thought it was terrible, you know, kidnapping children, just grabbing people off the street. He cared about those people, and he knew it was wrong, so he did participate in protests.”

Pretti was a US citizen, born in Illinois. Like Good, court records showed he had no criminal record and his family said he had never had any interactions with law enforcement beyond a handful of traffic tickets.

In a recent conversation with their son, his parents, who live in Colorado, told him to be careful when protesting.

“We had this discussion with him two weeks ago or so, you know, that go ahead and protest, but do not engage, do not do anything stupid, basically,” Michael Pretti said. “And he said he knows that. He knew that.”

The Department of Homeland Security said the man was shot after he “approached” Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun. Officials did not specify if Pretti brandished the gun. In bystander videos of the shooting that emerged soon after, Pretti is seen with a phone in his hand but none appears to show him with a visible weapon.

Family members said Pretti owned a handgun and had a permit to carry a concealed handgun in Minnesota. They said they had never known him to carry it.

The family first learned of the shooting when they were called by an Associated Press reporter. They watched the video and said the man killed appeared to be their son. They then tried reaching out to officials in Minnesota.

“I can’t get any information from anybody,” Michael Pretti said Saturday. “The police, they said call Border Patrol, Border Patrol’s closed, the hospitals won’t answer any questions.”

Eventually, the parents called the Hennepin County Medical Examiner, who they said confirmed had a body matching the name and description of their son.

As of Saturday evening, the family said they had still not heard from anyone at a federal law enforcement agency about their son's death.

After seeing videos of top Trump administration officials suggesting their son was a “domestic terrorist” who attacked the officers who shot him, they issued a written statement describing themselves as both heartbroken and angry.

"The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting," the family's statement said. They added that videos showed Alex Pretti was not holding a gun when he was tackled by federal agents, but holding his phone with one hand and using the other to shield a woman who was being pepper-sprayed.

“Please get the truth out about our son. He was a good man,” they said.

Alex Pretti grew up in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where he played football, baseball and ran track for Preble High School. He was a Boy Scout and sang in the Green Bay Boy Choir.

After graduation, he went to the University of Minnesota, graduating in 2011 with a bachelor’s degree in biology, society and the environment, according to the family. He worked as a research scientist before returning to school to become a registered nurse.

Pretti’s ex-wife, who spoke to the AP but later said she didn’t want her name used, said she was not surprised he would have been involved in protesting Trump’s immigration crackdown. She said she had not spoken to him since they divorced more than two years ago and she moved to another state.

She said he was a Democratic voter and that he had participated in the wave of street protests following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020, not far from the couple’s neighbourhood. She described him a someone who might shout at law enforcement officers at a protest, but she had never known him to be physically confrontational.

She said Pretti got a permit to carry a concealed firearm about three years ago and that he owned at least one semiautomatic handgun when they separated.

Pretti lived in a four-unit condominium building about 2 miles (3.2 kilometres) from where he was shot. Neighbours described him as quiet and warmhearted.

“He’s a wonderful person,” said Sue Gitar, who lived downstairs from Pretti and said he moved into the building about three years ago. “He has a great heart.”

If there was something suspicious going on in the neighborhood, or when they worried the building might have a gas leak, he would jump in to help.

Pretti lived alone and worked long hours as a nurse, but he was not a loner, his neighbours said, and would sometimes have friends over.

His neighbours knew he had guns – he’d occasionally take a rifle to shoot at a gun range – but were surprised at the idea that he might carry a pistol on the streets.

“I never thought of him as a person who carried a gun,” said Gitar.

A competitive bicycle racer who lavished care on his new Audi, Pretti had also been deeply attached to his dog, who died about a year ago.

His parents said their last conversation with their son was a couple days before his death. They talked about repairs he had done to the garage door of his home. The worker was a Latino man, and they said with all that was happening in Minneapolis he gave the man a $100 tip.

Pretti’s mother said her son cared immensely about the direction the county was headed, especially the Trump administration’s rollback of environmental regulations.

“He hated that, you know, people were just trashing the land,” Susan Pretti said. “He was an outdoorsman. He took his dog everywhere he went. You know, he loved this country, but he hated what people were doing to it.”</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:23:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0a200ada-f9cd-11f0-88fc-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26024696586709-1.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Polls close in Myanmar's junta-run elections with army set for victory</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260125-polls-close-in-myanmar-s-junta-run-elections-with-army-set-for-victory</link><description>Voting concluded in Myanmar 's month-long election on Sunday, with the dominant pro-military party on course for landslide victory in a junta-run poll critics say will only prolong the army's grip on power.

The Southeast Asian nation has a long history of military rule, but the generals took a back seat for a decade of civilian-led reforms.

That ended in a 2021 military coup when democratic figurehead Aung San Suu Kyi was detained, civil war broke out, and the country descended into humanitarian crisis.

The election's third and final phase closed after voting took place in dozens of constituencies across the country, just a week shy of the coup's five-year anniversary.

The military pledges the election will return power to the people but with Suu Kyi sidelined and her hugely popular party dissolved, democracy advocates say the ballot is stacked with military allies.

Junta chief Min Aung Hlaing – who has not ruled out serving as president after the poll – toured voting stations in Mandalay, wearing civilian dress.

"This is the path chosen by the people," he told reporters in response to a question from AFP. "The people from Myanmar can support whoever they want to support."

Voting is not being held in rebel-held parts of the country, and in junta-controlled areas rights monitors say the run-up has been characterised by coercion and the crushing of dissent.

Teacher Zaw Ko Ko Myint cast his vote at a Mandalay high school around dawn.

"Although I do not expect much, we want to see a better country," the 53-year-old told AFP. "I feel relieved after voting, as if I fulfilled my duty."

The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) – packed with retired officers and described by analysts as a military puppet – won more than 85 percent of elected lower house seats and two-thirds of those in the upper house in the poll's first two phases.

"States that endorse the results of these polls will be complicit in the junta's attempt to legitimise military rule through a fabricated vote," UN rights expert Tom Andrews said in a statement Friday.

Official results are expected late this week.

A military-drafted constitution also gives the armed forces a quarter of the seats in both houses of parliament, which will vote as a whole to pick the president.

"I don't expect anything from this election," a 34-year-old Yangon resident told AFP earlier, requesting anonymity for security reasons. "Things will just keep dragging on."

Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy party thrashed the USDP in the last elections in 2020, before the military seized power on February 1, 2021, making unfounded allegations of widespread vote-rigging.

The military has long presented itself as the only force guarding restive Myanmar from rupture and ruin.

But its putsch tipped the country into full-blown civil war, with pro-democracy guerrillas fighting the junta alongside a kaleidoscope of ethnic minority armies which have long held sway in the fringes.

Air strikes are frequent in some regions, others enjoy relative peace, while some zones are blockaded, haunted by the spectre of starvation.

Polling was called off in one in five lower house constituencies, but some frontline locations went to the polls Sunday.

"Candidates still haven't held any campaigning because of security," complained one parliamentary candidate, speaking on condition of anonymity for security reasons. "It's not safe at all to travel."

There is no official death toll for Myanmar's civil war.

But monitoring group ACLED, which tallies media reports of violence, estimates more than 90,000 have been killed on all sides.

Meanwhile, more than 400 people have been pursued for prosecution under stark new legislation forbidding "disruption" of the election and punishing protest or criticism with up to a decade in prison.

Turnout in the first and second phases of the vote was just over 50 percent, official figures say, compared to roughly 70 percent in 2020.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 10:47:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a11856c0-f9d4-11f0-b9b9-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26025240999456.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy’s anger over bar manager release understandable, Swiss president says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/italys-anger-over-bar-manager-release-understandable-swiss-president-says-2026-01-25/</link><description>MILAN, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Rome's outrage was understandable over the release on bail of the owner of the bar where a deadly fire broke out on New Year's Day, Swiss President Guy Parmelin told an Italian daily on Sunday, but added that magistrates act independently.

A blaze that erupted early on January 1 in a bar crowded with teenagers in the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana, killed 40 people, including six Italian nationals, and injured more than 100 - a tragedy that has reverberated across Italy's media and public opinion.

The Italian Prime Minister's office on Saturday said the decision to release bar owner Jacques Moretti was "a serious affront and a further wound inflicted to the families of the Crans-Montana victims and of those who are still hospitalised".

In comments to Corriere della Sera on Sunday Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni urged Switzerland to heed Italy's call to set up a joint investigative team.

Italy said it had instructed its ambassador to Switzerland to express its "deep indignation" to the chief prosecutor of the Valais canton and to travel to Rome to discuss further steps.

Parmelin said in an interview with Sunday's Corriere della Sera that Switzerland had not been officially informed of the decision to recall the ambassador to Rome.

"It's an ordinary diplomatic measure ... after the consultations the ambassador will return to Switzerland," Parmelin said. "It's not the job of politicians to interfere with the judicial system.

Burnham, one of the party's most high-profile politicians and an elected mayor in the northern English city of Manchester, said on Saturday he wanted to become Labour's candidate to replace a lawmaker who resigned last week.

Local news outlets, including the BBC and the Guardian newspaper, reported that he was refused permission by Labour's National Executive Committee.

Blocking Burnham's candidacy will deny him the chance of winning a platform from which he could have formally challenged Starmer, because only members of parliament can trigger a leadership contest.

Labour did not immediately confirm the NEC's decision, and said a statement would be issued later on Sunday.

The NEC decision will fuel discontent in a governing party whose popularity has plummeted since a landslide election win in July 2024 as Starmer has struggled to deliver on promises of a stronger economy, better public services and tighter borders.

Last week, bond markets reacted negatively to the prospect of Burnham's return to parliament, with some investors taking a view that it could trigger political turmoil and, if he did eventually replace Starmer, a looser fiscal policy.

Burnham criticised Starmer's leadership last year but said on Saturday he had assured the prime minister he wanted to "support the work of the government, not undermine it".

Burnham ran unsuccessfully to become party leader in 2015, when he was beaten by Jeremy Corbyn. He left parliament to become Greater Manchester Mayor in 2017 but has remained an influential figure for some centre-left groups within Labour, particularly those critical of Starmer's more centrist stance.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:44:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3ABW6TBQJFNURPATLDCGY54DGM.jpg?auth=a53795c77188d97552105d36e65d41ebe402a047031d7409fec29015b6e319de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland's capital restores power, heating after storm damaged line</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenlands-capital-nuuk-sees-city-wide-power-outage-due-accident-2026-01-25/</link><description>NUUK, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Greenland's capital restored power early on Sunday after a storm damaged a transmission cable and left thousands without electricity and heating through the cold winter night.

Electricity suddenly cut off across Nuuk late on Saturday, witnesses said.

The Nukissiorfiit utility - which supplies Nuuk from the Buksefjord hydropower plant southeast of the capital - said power came back online around 4:30 a.m. (0630 GMT).

Greenlanders are used to outages, often caused by harsh weather damaging the cable which runs through rugged terrain and spans two fjords.

Three days before the power cut, the government updated recommendations for crisis preparedness - including advice for people to keep five days' worth of water and food - in the wake of tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's demands to acquire the Danish territory.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 12:44:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo says civilians in Ukraine are suffering, calls for war to end</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-says-civilians-ukraine-are-suffering-calls-war-end-2026-01-25/</link><description>MILAN, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Pope Leo on Sunday said ongoing Russian attacks against Ukraine were leaving civilians in the country exposed to the cold of winter, and called for an end to the conflict .

Medical workers said an Israeli drone exploded on the rooftop of a multi-floor building in Gaza City, wounding four civilians in the street nearby.

There was no comment by the Israeli military on either incident.

Gaza has been reduced to rubble in the war that was triggered by an attack by Palestinian militant group Hamas on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, that killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies.

The Gaza health ministry says more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed by Israeli fire since then. It says that at least 480 people were killed by Israeli fire since the ceasefire agreement came into effect last October.

Israel said four soldiers have been killed by militants in Gaza since the ceasefire began. Both sides have traded blame over the violation of the truce.

Earlier this month, Washington announced that the plan had now moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza, and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory's administration.

U.S. envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner met in Israel on Saturday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, mainly to discuss Gaza, two people briefed on the matter said, as local authorities reported further violence in the enclave.

Meanwhile, in Khan Younis, over a hundred people attended the funeral of a person who was killed by Israeli drone fire on Saturday, after holding special prayers in front of his white-shrouded body at the morgue in Nasser Hospital.

"They are liars, there is no ceasefire," said Fares Erheimat, a relative of the dead man, during the funeral.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 13:34:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Power cut to Russia's main naval base home town after pylons collapse</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/power-cut-russias-main-naval-base-home-town-after-pylons-collapse-2026-01-25/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 25 - The home town of Russia's main naval base was forced to switch to emergency generators after aging power lines collapsed during bad winter weather, cutting electricity and some heating, Russian officials said.

The closed town of Severomorsk, the headquarters of Russia's Northern Fleet on the Kola Bay of the Barents Sea, is home to Russia's most important naval command. It controls Russia's biggest fleet of ballistic missile submarines and extensive arsenals of nuclear warheads, missiles and repair yards.

Andrei Chibis, the governor of the Murmansk region, said on Friday night that the city of Murmansk and Severomorsk had their electricity supplies cut due to the collapse of pylons. Local officials said there were still some houses without electricity and heat in Severomorsk on Sunday.

Five pylons, two of them almost 60 years old, collapsed about 7 km (4 miles) from Murmansk on Jan. 23, according to local media. Two dated from 1966, two from 1982 and one from 1988, according to Severomorsk online news site.

The ships of the Northern Fleet docked in Severomorsk were switched to autonomous power mode to free up capacity, Vladimir Evmenkov, the head of Severomorsk, said.

Russia's so-called "closed towns," usually around major defence or nuclear installations, have much stricter controls than most other places.

Boston-based U.S. District Judge Indira Talwani issued a preliminary injunction , opens new tab late on Saturday that prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the humanitarian parole granted to thousands of people from Cuba, Haiti, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

They had been allowed to move to the United States under family reunification parole programs that were created or modernized by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration.

Since Republican President Donald Trump succeeded Biden, his administration has ramped up immigration enforcement with $170 billion budgeted for immigration agencies through September 2029, a historic sum.

Under the family reunification programs, U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents, also known as green card holders, could apply to serve as sponsors for family members in those seven countries, letting them live in the U.S. while they waited for their immigrant visas to become available.

The Homeland Security Department said on December 12 it was ending the programs on the grounds that they were inconsistent with Trump's immigration enforcement priorities and were abused to allow "poorly vetted aliens to circumvent the traditional parole process."

The termination was originally set to take effect January 14, but Talwani issued a temporary restraining order blocking it for 14 days while she considered whether to issue Saturday's longer-term injunction.

Talwani said the department, led by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, had provided no support for its fraud concerns or considered whether individuals could feasibly return to their home countries, where many had sold homes or left jobs.

"The Secretary could not provide a reasoned explanation of the agency's change in policy without acknowledging these interests," wrote Talwani, who was appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama. "Accordingly, failure to do so was arbitrary and capricious."

The department did not respond to a request for comment.

The ruling came in a class action lawsuit pursued by immigrant rights advocates challenging the administration's broader rollback of temporary parole granted to hundreds of thousands of migrants .

Talwani earlier in that case blocked the administration from ending grants of parole to about 430,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, but the Supreme Court lifted her order, which an appeals court later overturned .</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:21:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/U3QHXS7T2RIARAZBZCZTKZAY2A.jpg?auth=4e58a7663a43bc4d526ce1c4d28860fa657deb84d9d95d4c1a8b93f16afa2f9a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Acquire territory, export culture wars: How to make sense of Trump’s ‘new imperialism’</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-acquire-territory-export-culture-wars-trump-new-imperialism-greenland-venezuela</link><description>As he raged at European leaders this week for resisting his claim to Greenland , US President Donald Trump brought up another island territory – located 12,000 kilometres away – for a dig at one of America’s closest allies.

In a typically virulent social media post, Trump berated Britain for agreeing to transfer sovereignty of the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia to Mauritius and lease back a key US-UK military base there, a move he labelled “an act of great stupidity”.

A relic of empire with a dark history of colonial abuse , Diego Garcia is part of the Chagos Islands archipelago, which Britain held on to after Mauritius gained independence in 1968. Since then, various international tribunals have ruled that the islands belong to Mauritius, saddling the UK with a diplomatic boil it has long been eager to lance.

When Britain and Mauritius finally settled the dispute last year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it showed "the value of diplomacy in addressing historical grievances".

Trump, however, has shown scarce interest in international law, let alone colonial grievances. In his mind, Britain surrendered a strategic asset “for no reason whatsoever”, thereby projecting “total weakness”.

His swipe at a key ally underlined the erratic nature of a president who just months ago gave his blessing to the Chagos deal, and whose Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it a “monumental achievement”. It also underscored his administration's unapologetic stance on territorial acquisition, and contempt for what it perceives as European self-punishment.

The 47th US president has expressed similar views about some of his predecessors’ actions, not least Jimmy Carter’s decision to transfer ownership of the Panama Canal to Panama – a move he branded a “disgrace”.

The canal has featured prominently on Trump’s territorial wish list, along with key ally Canada , which he claims should become America’s 51st state, and Greenland. Talk of territorial expansion is a throwback to American empire-building from more than a century ago, and a clear break from US policy since at least World War II.

“Trump is opposed to post-1945 forms of power projection. He is very eager to do something his predecessors have not done, which is to claim territory,” says historian Daniel Immerwahr, a humanities professor at Northwestern University and the author of “How to Hide an Empire: A History of the Greater United States”.

Trump’s favourite president is William McKinley, whose imperialist drive in the late 19th century saw the US take over a host of territories including Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Another reason Trump likes the 25th president is because he authored the McKinley Tariff, says Jay Sexton, director of the Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy at the University of Missouri and author of “The Monroe Doctrine: Empire and Nation in Nineteenth-Century America”.

“There’s high tariffs in that period. There’s imperial expansion and very lightly regulated, if not unregulated, development of the United States. There’s also the emergence of the Gilded Age elite [a period roughly covering the 1870s through to the late 1890s], with a massive asymmetry in the distribution of wealth and power,” says Sexton. “The late 19th century fits with a lot of the Trump team’s vision and objectives both at home and in foreign policy.”

Named after former president James Monroe, the 1823 “Monroe Doctrine” was originally intended as a barrier to European colonial ambitions in the Americas. Trump has now repackaged it as a more muscular “Donroe Doctrine” aimed at shutting out US rivals from the western hemisphere, described by his administration as "OUR hemisphere”.

The administration’s talk of a “Trump corollary” to the doctrine references another former president, Theodore Roosevelt, whose 1904 “Roosevelt corollary” established Washington’s right to prevent “wrongdoing” anywhere in the region.

Roosevelt’s approach is typically associated with the adage ”speak softly and carry a big stick”. Trump’s actions, however, suggest he is only interested in the "big stick” part.

In the 12 months since he took office, the US has attacked Venezuela and seized its president, carried out extrajudicial killings in international waters in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, and threatened military strikes on Mexico to target drug cartels. The US president has also imposed sanctions on his Colombian counterpart, decisively meddled with elections in Argentina and Honduras, and sought to interfere with Brazilian justice.

“He’s very drawn to threat and menace as an axis of interaction,” says Immerwahr. “And he’s always interested in the United States bombing places.”

The irony with this newfound focus on the Western Hemisphere, coming from a president who promises to make America “great again”, is that it harks back to an age preceding the country’s great power status.

“The United States was a rising power at the time, staking its claim to a sphere of influence as a first step to becoming a global power,” says Sexton. “What we’re seeing now is the reverse, like America is a contracting power, globalism is gone, and spheres of influence are back.”

Immerwahr says the focus on the Western Hemisphere shows that Trump “has a narrower vision of US power than his predecessors”, all of whom came to accept the notion that “US security interests are so extensive that anything, anywhere is relevant to the United States”. In contrast, “Trump feels constrained and oppressed” by America’s traditional engagements, he adds, pointing to his disregard for European alliances and his hostility towards NATO .

Dafydd Townley, an expert in US politics and international security at the University of Portsmouth, likens Trump to a “spreadsheet president” in that he “doesn’t see the political, economic and soft power, benefits that the US has gained from its position in NATO – he only sees the costs”.

The same could be said for much of the postwar order that the US has sought to uphold until Trump’s arrival at the White House. While left-wing critics of the post-1945 global order have long accused it of enshrining Western domination, this has sometimes concealed the fact that the system is also despised by the far right.

“Trump is a right-wing critic of US hegemony, and his argument is that it doesn’t pay off for the United States," says Immerwahr. “He’s not interested in the United States playing the role of managing a global system (...) Whereas in the past the US has asserted itself as an umpire that can call plays as fair or foul, Trump has very little interest in that. He wants to be a player and he wants to win.”

In a social media post shortly after Maduro’s capture, White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller pointed to another, more ideological motive behind this repudiation of the postwar order.

“Not long after World War II the West dissolved its empires and colonies and began sending colossal sums of taxpayer-funded aid to these former territories (despite have [sic] already made them far wealthier and more successful),” wrote Miller, who has emerged as a key ideologue of the second Trump administration.

"The neoliberal experiment, at its core, has been a long self-punishment of the places and peoples that built the modern world,” he added.

Watch more Who is the Trump administration architect, Stephen Miller?

Miller’s talk of the West suffering “reverse colonisation” through immigration is akin to far-right theories of a purported “great replacement” of native Europeans by non-white immigrants – a theory largely embraced by the Trump administration’s National Security Strategy (NSS) published last November.

Throughout the past year, members of the Trump administration have voiced support for European far-right, “patriotic” parties that share its illiberal, anti-immigrant agenda – and its tendency to belittle the threat posed by Russia.

In stark contrast to previous versions of the strategy, the most recent NSS has very little to say about Russian expansionism, warning instead that the main threat to Europe is one of “civilisational erasure”. It advocates interfering with internal politics on the continent by “cultivating resistance to Europe’s current trajectory within European nations”.

In analysis of the NSS published by the Brookings Institution, Visiting Fellow Tara Varma described it as a “clear plan for subversion in Europe”, noting that US support for the transatlantic alliance "is now conditioned on full ideological alignment across the Atlantic”. The document, wrote Senior Fellow Daniel Hamilton, “makes clear that the major transatlantic divide these days is not between the United States and Europe; it is between transatlantic liberals and transatlantic illiberals”.

The administration’s blistering critique of European politics “sounds almost exactly like the way in which they critique the American left”, adds Sexton. “The culture wars are being exported to Europe itself.”

At the heart of this illiberal thinking is the notion that might is right – and an unapologetic stance on imperial plunder.

Immerwahr points to a long history of imperial powers seeking to lock down territories for resources, “and being fairly explicit about it”, while also framing their actions as legal or benevolent. “What’s unusual about Trump is just how quickly he will allow the mask to fall,” he adds.

Trump makes no secret of the way he covets the mineral wealth of other countries, having previously sought to extract profit from Ukraine’s resources in return for assistance. His real-estate mindset appears to inform his foreign policy, most notably his plan to turn war-shattered Gaza into a glitzy Riviera largely emptied of its Palestinian population. It also helps to explain his insistence on “ownership” of Greenland rather than any leasing agreement like the one Britain negotiated for Diego Garcia.

“It’s not even about national interests,” says Sexton, noting that existing agreements with Denmark already allow the US to develop its military presence in Greenland and mine minerals there. “It’s more about the personal interests of the administration and its players.”

Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is one of several Trump allies who have held or explored potential mining investments on the island. Other supporters who have ties to investments in Greenland include Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen, tech entrepreneur Sam Altman and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

Addressing reporters after Maduro’s capture, Trump wasted no time before boasting that the US would "run” Venezuela and exploit its vast oil reserves, which he called “our oil”. His focus on oil raised questions about his administration's efforts to frame its brazen actions as a law enforcement operation aimed at choking off drug shipments to the US.

Trump notably made no mention of democracy, traditionally the official goal of US-led regime change. He dismissed the idea that the Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado, who won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize, should lead the country, and made no mention of Edmundo González, who many Venezuelans believe was the rightful winner of elections in 2024.

“Even when ruthlessly pursuing its material interests in the 20th century, the United States at least talked about promoting democracy, and I think it’s meaningful that it felt it needed to present things that way,” says Sexton. “That’s now completely gone.”

So has America’s professed commitment to international law, adds Immerwahr. “Until now, the US always felt a need to honour the rulebook even when breaking some of those rules. Trump is clearly not doing that.”

In a speech in Davos this week, Canada’s Prime Minister Mark Carney noted that honouring the rulebook, at least rhetorically, has for decades been a cornerstone of American hegemony. “The fiction was useful”, he said, helping to provide financial stability, collective security and a framework to resolve disputes.

Without naming him, Carney made clear that Trump had precipitated a “rupture in the world order, the end of the pleasant fiction and the dawn of a brutal reality in which great-power geopolitics is unconstrained”. Middle powers like Canada, he added, “must act together because if we’re not at the table, we’re on the menu”.

European leaders in Davos also rued the demise of the rules-based international order and the rise of what France’s President Emmanuel Macron described as a “new imperialism” on the world stage. Their thinly veiled criticism of Trump signalled mounting exasperation with a mercurial ally they spent much of the past year cajoling, only to be showered with insults in return.

Trump’s refusal, until this week, to rule out military action against NATO allies to acquire Greenland has also led to pushback at home, including rare criticism from Republicans in Congress. Surveys suggest there is very little public backing for Trump’s expansionism, including among supporters who cheered at Maduro’s capture.

“American voters love the military. They love the Black Ops chopper coming down and taking Maduro,” says Sexton. “They do not love raising taxes to pay for boots on the ground in protracted colonial wars. And that was learned the hard way in the early 20th century.”

The revisionist rhetoric coming from Washington suggests some of those lessons from history have been unlearned.

Analysts have warned that Trump’s unprovoked attack on Venezuela could inspire similar action from Russia and China. “If the norms are busted and the United States is going to stake its claim to its sphere, there's really nothing to stop the Chinese or Russians from doing it in theirs,” says Sexton.

Russia under Vladimir Putin has already expanded into Georgia and Ukraine while China’s Xi Jinping has repeatedly threatened to use force to acquire Taiwan. Both leaders share with Trump an aspiration to restore past grandeur.

“They all have some story to tell about how the ‘liberal’ international order has not been kind to them,” notes Immerwahr. “Trump shares with them a sense that there are past privileges that powerful countries used to have that he would like to see restored.”

With the US president now openly pursuing expansionist aims, he adds, the fear is that “we may be tilting back to a world of colonial land grabs”, in which great powers race to lock down territories and resources – and threaten to close off markets, as Trump has already done.

Colonial powers’ late-19th century scramble for territories was accompanied by murderous campaigns to subjugate populations, while imperial rivalry eventually led to two world wars.

“Both turned out to be incredibly bloody forms of war,” says Immerwahr. “I do not want to see us revisit those, especially in the age of nuclear weapons.”</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 14:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a60c8550-f9d1-11f0-9548-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/main-trump-imperialisme-v2.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Zelenskiy says security guarantees document from US is 100% ready</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-says-security-guarantees-document-us-is-100-ready-2026-01-25/</link><description>VILNIUS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A U.S. document on security guarantees for Ukraine is completely ready and Kyiv is waiting for a time and place for it to be signed, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday.

The aid came as the Syrian government and Kurdish forces extended a ceasefire agreement by 15 days, after Kurdish forces relinquished swathes of territory to government troops.

Earlier this week, residents in Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab in Arabic, told AFP that they lacked food, water and power and that the enclave was flooded with people who had fled the Syrian army's advances.

In a statement, the Syrian military said it was opening two corridors, one to Kobane and another in nearby Hasakeh province to allow "the entry of aid".

Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, representative of the United Nations' refugee agency in Syria, said on X that "thanks to the cooperation with the Syrian government... a convoy of 24 trucks carrying essential food, relief items, and diesel" departed for Kobane "to deliver life-saving and winter assistance to civilians affected by the hostilities".

The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) lost large areas to government forces during the weeks-long clashes, and find themselves restricted to Kurdish-majority areas in the northeast and Kobane in the north.

The town is surrounded by the Turkish border to the north and government forces on all sides. It is around 200 kilometres (125 miles) from the Kurds' stronghold in Syria's far northeast.

Kobane, which Kurdish forces liberated from a lengthy siege by the Islamic State group in 2015, became a symbol as their first major victory against the jihadists.

On Saturday, Syria's government and Kurdish forces extended their truce with Damascus saying it was intended to support the US transfer of Islamic State group detainees from Syria to prisons in Iraq, which started earlier this week.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:30:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/963c43d0-f9ff-11f0-a79a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93TV363.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rights group leader says at least 80 political prisoners released in Venezuela</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/rights-group-leader-says-least-80-political-prisoners-released-venezuela-2026-01-25/</link><description>Jan 25 (Reuters) - At least 80 people considered political prisoners by a leading Venezuelan rights group had been released on Sunday as part of an ongoing release process, according to the leader of the group.

The people were released from prisons across the country and more releases were likely taking place, Alfredo Romero, the director of Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal, said on X.

Venezuela's interim president Delcy Rodriguez said on Friday that 626 people have been released from prison, yet she did not specify the timeline of the reported releases.

Foro Penal, however, before Sunday had confirmed the release of just 156 political prisoners in Venezuela since Jan 8.

Rodriguez said that she is due to have a call on Monday with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, to ask the U.N. to verify the lists of those released so far in the Andean nation.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 16:50:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Federal officials dig in on Minneapolis shooting narrative despite video evidence</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/federal-officials-dig-minneapolis-shooting-narrative-despite-video-evidence-2026-01-25/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Senior Trump administration officials on Sunday defended the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by immigration agents in Minneapolis even as video evidence contradicted their version of events and tensions grew between local law enforcement and federal officers.

As residents visited a makeshift shrine of flowers and candles in frigid temperatures and snow to mark Saturday's fatal shooting of Alex Pretti — the second shooting death by federal officers in Minneapolis this month — the Trump administration argued that Pretti assaulted officers, compelling them to fire in self-defense.

Gregory Bovino, Border Patrol commander-at-large speaking on CNN's "State of the Union", could not offer evidence that Pretti was trying to impede a law enforcement operation, but focused on the fact that the ICU nurse was carrying a gun, which he had a license to carry.

"The victims are border patrol agents," Bovino said. "Law enforcement doesn't assault anyone."

Bovino and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accused Pretti of assaulting the agents, rioting and obstructing them.

"We do know that he came to that scene and impeded a law enforcement operation, which is against federal law," Noem told Fox News' "Sunday Briefing" program. "It's a felony. When he did that, interacting with those agents, when they tried to get him to disengage, he became aggressive and resisted them."

That official line, echoed by other Trump officials on Sunday, triggered outrage from local law enforcement, many in Minneapolis and Democrats on Capitol Hill, because of bystander videos that appear to show a different version of events.

Videos from the scene verified and reviewed by Reuters showed Pretti, 37, holding a phone in his hand, not a gun, as he tries to help other protesters who have been pushed to the ground by agents.

As the videos begin, Pretti can be seen filming as a federal agent pushes away one woman and shoves another woman to the ground. Pretti moves between the agent and the women, then raises his left arm to shield himself as the agent pepper sprays him.

Several agents then take hold of Pretti — who struggles with them — and force him onto his hands and knees. As the agents pin down Pretti, someone shouts what sounds like a warning about the presence of a gun.

Video footage then appears to show one of the agents removing a gun from Pretti and stepping away from the group with it.

Moments later, an officer with a handgun pointed at Pretti's back and fired four shots at him in quick succession. Several more shots can then be heard as another agent appears to fire at Pretti.

Darius Reeves, the former head of ICE's field office in Baltimore, told Reuters that federal agents' apparent lack of communication is troubling. "It's clear no one is communicating to me, based on my observation of how that team responded," Reeves said.

One of the officers appeared to have taken possession of Pretti's weapon before he was killed, Reeves said. "The proof to me is how everyone scatters," he said. "They're looking around, trying to figure out where the shots came from."

Brian O'Hara, the Minneapolis police chief, told CBS' "Face the Nation" that "the videos speak for themselves," adding the Trump administration version of events was "deeply disturbing." He said he had seen no evidence that Pretti brandished a gun.

Tensions in the city were already running high after a federal agent fatally shot U.S. citizen Renee Good on Jan 7. Trump officials claim she was trying to ram the agent with her car, but other observers have argued that bystander video suggests she was trying to steer away from the officer who shot her.

Federal authorities have refused to allow local officials to participate in their investigation of the incident.

U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, told ABC News' "This Week" that Trump's surge of federal agents into Minneapolis was "completely out of control and out of balance," and that they should leave Minnesota. She described the shooting of Pretti as "simply horrific".

The deaths of Good and Pretti have sparked large protests in the Democrat-run city, although on Sunday morning the area where Pretti was shot was calm.

A woman wearing nursing scrubs ventured out in Sunday's frigid temperatures to pay homage to Pretti, who she said worked with her. When asked what brought her out, the woman began to sob.

"He was caring and he was kind. None of this makes any sense,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified by name, saying she feared retribution from the federal government.

In addition to large protests in Minneapolis since Good's death, there have been rallies in other cities led by Democratic politicians, including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., since Trump began sending immigration agents and National Guard troops to those communities last year.

Trump has defended the operations as necessary to reduce crime and enforce immigration laws.

Pretti's shooting triggered legal filings on Saturday night from state and local officials, as well as others.

A U.S. district judge issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting federal officials from destroying or altering evidence related to the shooting in response to a lawsuit filed by Minnesota's attorney general, the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office and the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. A full hearing is set for Monday.

Lawyers representing protesters in Minnesota also asked an appeals court to reinstate a lower court's order that prevented violent retaliation by federal agents against protesters, citing Pretti's death and the likelihood of a surge of people taking to the streets.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:31:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/42KXX3GEGJOVLLNL65SFSRLKFA.jpg?auth=ef4458458e67df9ceb07182d0dd48f46fa04e5c7c2be17151914c9f1781949f8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Videos of fatal Alex Pretti shooting in Minneapolis contradict government statements</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-videos-of-fatal-alex-pretti-shooting-in-minneapolis-contradict-government-statements</link><description>Videos quickly emerged showing the fatal shooting of a Minneapolis protester by a Border Patrol agent that has been widely denounced as a case of excessive force carried out by untrained federal officers. The administration says it was a case of an armed man provoking violence.

The Associated Press reviewed multiple bystander videos that show a Border Patrol agent shooting and killing 37-year-old Alex Prett i after a roughly 30-second scuffle around 9am Saturday. The videos appear to contradict statements by the Trump administration, which said the shots were fired “defensively” against Pretti as he “approached” them with a gun.

In the videos, Pretti is seen with only a phone in his hand. None of the footage appears to show him with a weapon. During the scuffle, agents discovered that he was carrying a 9 mm semiautomatic handgun, and they opened fire with several shots. Pretti was licensed to carry a concealed weapon.

Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, who said he watched one of the videos, said he saw “more than six masked agents pummeling one of our constituents, shooting him to death." Frey has said Minneapolis and St. Paul are being “invaded” by the administration's largest immigration crackdown, dubbed Operation Metro Surge.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Pretti attacked officers, and Customs and Border Patrol Commander Gregory Bovino said Pretti wanted to do “maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.” In posts on X, President Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff, Stephen Miller, called Pretti "a would-be assassin.”

It was the second fatal shooting in Minneapolis by federal immigration authorities this month. The first, on January 7, involved Renee Good . It also was captured on videos and produced a similar schism among political leaders.

The shooting occurred when officers were pursuing a man in the country illegally wanted for domestic assault, Bovino said. Protesters routinely try to disrupt such operations, and they sounded high-pitched whistles, honked horns and yelled at officers.

Among them was Pretti. At one point, in a video obtained by AP, Pretti is standing in the street and holding up his phone. He is face-to-face with an officer in a tactical vest, who places his hand on Pretti and pushes him toward the sidewalk.

Pretti is talking to the officer, though it is not clear what he is saying.

The video shows protesters wandering in and out of the street as officers persist in trying to keep them at bay. One protester is put in handcuffs. Some officers are carrying pepper spray canisters.

Pretti comes in again when the video shows an officer wearing tactical gear shoving a protester. The protester, who is wearing a skirt over black tights and holding a water bottle, reaches out for Pretti.

The same officer shoves Pretti in his chest, leading Pretti and the other protester to stumble backward.

A different video then shows Pretti moving toward another protester, who falls over after being shoved by the same officer. Pretti moves between the protester and the officer, reaching his arms out toward the officer.

The officer deploys pepper spray, and Pretti raises his hand and turns his face. The officer grabs Pretti's hand to bring it behind his back, deploys the pepper spray canister again and then pushes Pretti away.

Seconds later, at least a half-dozen federal officers surround Pretti, who is wrestled to the ground and hit several times. Several agents try to bring Pretti’s arms behind his back, and he struggles.

Videos show an officer, who is hovering over the scuffle with his right hand on Pretti’s back, backs away from the group with what appears to be a gun in his right hand just before the first shot.

Someone shouts “gun, gun.” It is not clear if that’s a reference to the weapon authorities say Pretti had.

And then the first shot is heard.

Videos do not clearly show who fired the first shot. In one video, seconds before the first shot, one officer reaches for his belt and appears to draw his gun. That same officer is seen with a gun to Pretti’s back as three more shots ring out. Pretti slumps to the ground. Videos show the officers backing away, some with guns drawn. More shots are fired.

The Department of Homeland Security said Pretti was shot after he “approached” Border Patrol officers with a gun. Officials did not say if Pretti brandished the weapon or kept it hidden.

An agency statement said officers fired “defensive shots” after Pretti “violently resisted” officers tried to disarm him.

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz expressed dismay at the characterization.

“I’ve seen the videos, from several angles, and it’s sickening,” he said.

Trump weighed in on social media by lashing out Walz and Frey. Trump shared images of the gun that immigration officials said was recovered from Pretti and said “What is that all about? Where are the local Police? Why weren’t they allowed to protect ICE Officers?”</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 18:34:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1d1656aa-fa16-11f0-bd79-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-25T011454Z-1656472056-RC2Z7JAF2VU4-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Arctic siege': US winter storm brings frigid temperatures, cuts power to hundreds of thousands</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260125-arctic-siege-us-winter-storm-brings-frigid-temperatures-cuts-power</link><description>A massive winter storm dumped sleet, freezing rain and snow across much of the US on Sunday, bringing subzero temperatures and paralyzing air and road traffic. Power lines were draped in ice, and hundreds of thousands of people in the Southeast were left without electricity.

The ice and snowfall were expected to continue into Monday in much of the country, followed by very low temperatures, which could cause “dangerous travel and infrastructure impacts” to linger for several days, the National Weather Service said.

Heavy snow was forecast from the Ohio Valley to the Northeast, while “catastrophic ice accumulation” threatened from the Lower Mississippi Valley to the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast.

“It is a unique storm in the sense that it is so widespread,” weather service meteorologist Allison Santorelli said in a phone interview. “It was affecting areas all the way from New Mexico, Texas, all the way into New England, so we’re talking like a 2,000 mile spread.”

President Donald Trump had approved emergency declarations for at least a dozen states by Saturday, with more expected to come. The Federal Emergency Management Agency pre-positioned commodities, staff and search and rescue teams in numerous states, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the state was bracing for the longest cold stretch and highest snow totals it has seen in years. Communities near the Canadian border have already seen record-breaking subzero temperatures, with Watertown registering minus 34 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 37 degrees Celsius) and Copenhagen minus 49 F (minus 45 C), she said.

“An Arctic siege has taken over our state,” Hochul said. “It is brutal, it is bone chilling and it is dangerous.”

As of Sunday morning, about 213 million people were under some sort of winter weather warning, Santorelli said. The number of customers without power topped 900,000, according to poweroutage.us, and the number was rising.

Tennessee was hardest hit with nearly 325,000 customers out, and Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi all had more than 100,000 customers in the dark. Tens of thousands of homes and businesses were without power in Kentucky, Georgia, Alabama and West Virginia.

Some 11,000 flights had already been canceled Sunday and more than 13,000 have been delayed, according to the flight tracker flightaware.com. Airports in Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore, North Carolina, New York and New Jersey were hit especially hard.

At Philadelphia International Airport, inside displays registered scores of canceled flights and few vehicles could be seen arriving Sunday morning. At Reagan National in Washington, virtually all flights were canceled.

Even once the ice and snow stop falling, the danger will continue, Santorelli warned.

“Behind the storm it’s just going to get bitterly cold across basically the entirety of the eastern two-thirds of the nation, east of the Rockies,” she said. That means the ice and snow won’t melt as fast, which could hinder some efforts to restore power and other infrastructure.

Along the Gulf Coast, temperatures were balmy Sunday, hitting the high 60s and low 70s, but thermometers were expected to drop into the high 20s and low 30s there by Monday morning. The National Weather Service warned of damaging winds and a slight risk of severe storms and possibly even a brief tornado.

In New York City, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said at least five people died as temperatures plunged Saturday before the snows arrived in earnest.

“While it’s still too early to determine the causes of death, it is a reminder that every year New Yorkers succumb to the cold,” he wrote on X.

The Democrat also announced that Monday would be a remote learning day for students in the nation’s largest school system. Other officials across the affected areas also announced that school would be canceled or held remotely Monday.

In Corinth, Mississippi, where power outages were widespread, Caterpillar told employees at its remanufacturing site to stay home Monday and Tuesday.

“May God have mercy on Corinth, MS! ... The sound of the trees snapping, exploding &amp; falling through the night have been unnerving to say the least,” resident Kathy Ragan said on Facebook.

University of Georgia sophomore Eden England said there was a thin layer of ice on the ground of the campus in Athens and a mist fell as she walked with friends from the campus dining hall to her residence hall.

“It is definitely a little deserted but plenty of people chose to stay on campus,” England said.

Nashville and the surrounding area was seeing ice accumulations of half an inch or more, with icicles hanging from power lines and overburdened tree limbs crashing to the ground.

In Oxford, Mississippi, police on Sunday morning used social media to tell residents to stay home as the danger of being outside was too great. Local utility crews were also pulled from their jobs during the overnight hours.

“Due to life-threatening conditions, Oxford Utilities has made the difficult decision to pull our crews off the road for the night,” the utility company posted on Facebook early Sunday. “Trees are actively snapping and falling around our linemen while they are in the bucket trucks."

Tippah Electric Power in Mississippi said there was “catastrophic damage” and that it could be “weeks instead of days” to restore everyone.

The Tennessee Valley Authority provides power to some utilities across the region, and spokesperson Scott Brooks said the bulk power system remains stable but overnight icing had caused power interruptions in north Mississippi, north Alabama, southern middle Tennessee and the Knoxville, Tennessee, area.

Icy roads made travel dangerous in north Georgia, where the Cherokee County Sheriff’s office posted on Facebook, “You know it’s bad when Waffle House is closed!!!” along with a photo of a shuttered restaurant. Whether the chain’s restaurants are open – known as the Waffle House Index – has become an informal way to gauge the severity of weather disasters across the South.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 19:21:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a3f83036-fa1f-11f0-9a55-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26025634506618.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Can ICE agents be prosecuted for Minneapolis shootings?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/can-ice-agents-be-prosecuted-minneapolis-shootings-2026-01-25/</link><description>Jan 25 (Reuters) - U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents shot and killed two U.S. citizens in separate enforcement actions in Minneapolis this month as part of President Donald Trump’s hardline immigration crackdown.

Local officials have disputed administration officials' claims that the shootings were acts of self-defense, citing bystander video that appears to contradict the government’s accounts.

Here is a look at the potential legal repercussions for the officers.

An ICE officer shot 37-year-old Renee Good in her car on January 7. The Department of Homeland Security said the officer had fired "defensive shots" after Good attempted to run him over, though online videos of the shooting verified by Reuters cast doubt on the government's narrative.

ICE agents shot 37-year-old Alex Pretti in a separate incident on January 24. DHS said Pretti approached with a handgun and violently resisted attempts to disarm him, though bystander videos verified by Reuters show Pretti - whom Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said carried a handgun lawfully - holding a phone as he tries to help protesters whom agents pushed to the ground.

Minnesota’s use-of-force law permits state police to use deadly force only if reasonable officers would believe doing so was necessary to protect themselves, or others, from death or serious harm.

Federal law has a similar standard, permitting use of deadly force when a reasonable officer would have probable cause to believe a person posed an immediate threat of death or serious injury.

Federal agents are generally immune from state prosecution for actions taken as part of their official duties. Immunity only applies when an officer's actions were authorized under federal law and were necessary and proper.

If Minnesota charged the agents, they could seek to move the case to federal court and argue they are immune from prosecution. To prevail, the state would have to show their actions were outside of their official duties or were objectively unreasonable or clearly unlawful. If a judge ruled an officer was immune, the case would be dismissed and the state would not be able to charge him again.

Federal prosecutors can charge law enforcement officers for fatal shootings, but the bar is very high and charges are rare. Prosecutors would need to show an officer knew his conduct was unlawful or acted with reckless disregard for the constitutional limits of his authority, which is difficult to prove in court. The Trump administration has so far defended the officers' actions.

In addition to federal immunity, the agents could argue that their actions were reasonable under the Constitution, that they acted in self-defense or that they did not act with intent to harm or kill the victims.

Federal officers are immune from civil lawsuits unless their conduct clearly violated a clearly established constitutional right. This legal standard, known as qualified immunity, has become a highly effective tool for shielding police officers accused of using excessive force, a series of Reuters investigative stories found in 2020.

However, victims can also sue the federal government for compensation when its employees cause financial or bodily injury in the course of their work. This is covered by the Federal Tort Claims Act of 1946, an exception to a legal doctrine called sovereign immunity that usually shields the federal government from lawsuits.

In an FTCA case, a plaintiff typically alleges a government employee acted negligently or wrongfully. The statute would allow family members of someone killed by ICE to seek compensation for wrongful death.

But while the FTCA opens a rare avenue for a lawsuit against the federal government, these claims face limits and obstacles, and legal experts generally consider the law a weak mechanism for addressing government officials' misconduct.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:25:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TIRBCTB2MVJNTKDOULFT67A7JI.jpg?auth=512fc34d043d6342728c1e04c4bbc4e98bae0eaf8d09df2fd016fb8bc8e3a90c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>One rescued, 50 feared drowned after migrant boat sinks off Tunisia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/one-rescued-50-feared-drowned-after-migrant-boat-sinks-off-tunisia-2026-01-25/</link><description>VALLETTA, Jan 25 (Reuters) - A migrant has been rescued and 50 others are feared drowned after a boat sank in the Mediterranean, officials said on Sunday.

Lima severed relations with the Mexican government in early November after Peru's former Prime Minister Betssy Chavez was granted asylum in the Mexican embassy in the country.

Chavez, the last prime minister for Peru's ousted and now jailed former President Pedro Castillo, faces conspiracy charges linked to Castillo's 2022 attempt to dissolve Congress. Chavez denied the allegations.

In a statement, the Brazilian Foreign Ministry said it took the representation at the request of the Mexican government and with approval from Lima.

Brazil said the representation includes the safekeeping of the Mexican embassy's premises in Peru, including the residence of the head of mission, as well as its assets and archives.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:26:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4RAK2UABDZMFFDPZCNW6VFMHBU.jpg?auth=805498bae65ead38f9e8c8cf21c14fa422ef998ab8458ba07f715d239566886f&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thousands protest in Paris over death of immigrant worker in police custody</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260125-thousands-protest-paris-over-death-migrant-worker-in-police-custody-hacen-diarra</link><description>Several thousand people protested in Paris Sunday over the death in custody of a Mauritanian immigrant worker, yelling slogans against "a police force that kills us", an AFP journalist saw.

The controversy over his death is just the latest in a series of cases in which activists have accused French police of racism and violence .

The demonstration gathered at the shelter in the northeast of the capital where the man, El Hacen Diarra, 35, had been living and in front of which he was violently arrested by police on the night of January 14.

Video filmed by neighbours, shared on social media, showed a policeman punching what appears to be a man on the ground as another officer stands by and watches.

The protesters, gathered to support Diarra's family, members of whom also took part, unfurled banners reading "Justice" and "RIP", before marching to the local police station.

The family has filed a legal complaint accusing security forces of "intentional violence that led to a death", their lawyer, Yassine Bouzrou told AFP a week ago.

Paris police have launched an internal investigation into what happened.

France's Interior Minister Laurent Nunez on Sunday again rejected calls for the officers concerned to be suspended until there is clear evidence they did something wrong.

"The officer who, in the footage, throws two punches will have to explain himself," he told Sunday's edition of Le Parisien newspaper.

"But nothing indicates, at this stage, what the causes of death are," he added.

According to the family, Diarra had been drinking a coffee outside the shelter when he encountered police officers and the situation deteriorated.

Prosecutors say police alleged they had seen Diarra roll a cannabis joint and proceeded to arrest him when he refused a body search.

He was taken into custody for allegedly resisting arrest and allegedly possessing "a brown substance resembling cannabis" and "forged administrative documents".

While waiting on a bench at the police station, officers said Diarra was seen to pass out and paramedics were called who tried to revive him, but he was pronounced dead.

At the protest, Diarra's cousin, Diankou Sissoko, told AFP: "I don't believe at all that we will see justice, because even before El Hacen died there were other deaths and there has never been justice."

She described Diarra as "kind, smiling" and "quiet", nothing like the police account that described him as aggressive.

There have been an increasing number of allegations of police violence in France in recent years, notably during the "yellow vest" protests between 2018 and 2019.

Activists have repeatedly accused French police of violence and racism, but few cases make it to criminal court in France, as most are dealt with internally.

Prosecutors have called for a police officer to be tried over the 2023 killing of a teenager at a traffic stop, in a case that sparked nationwide protests .

A court is to rule in March whether he will face a criminal trial over the killing of 17-year-old Nahel M.

In 2024, a judge gave suspended jail sentences to three officers who inflicted irreversible rectal injuries to a black man during a stop-and-search in 2017.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 20:28:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f03863b4-fa22-11f0-89c1-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/000-93XJ4RE.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump moved to cut funding for ICE body cameras, pared back oversight</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-moved-cut-funding-ice-body-cameras-pared-back-oversight-2026-01-25/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s administration opposed efforts to expand the use of body cameras by immigration officers and sharply cut oversight staffing as it surged officers into Minneapolis and other cities, leading to a series of violent clashes.

Footage from bystanders of two fatal shootings of U.S. citizen protesters, including Saturday’s incident that left an ICU nurse dead , has underscored the power of video in checking official statements that have portrayed people who have been shot as provoking violent encounters with immigration officers.

Cameras worn by officers long have been central to police reform efforts for this reason. The Trump administration, however, moved last year to slow-walk a pilot program to give ICE officers body cameras, urging Congress in June to cut the funding by 75% and bucking a nationwide trend of cameras for law enforcement.

Officials last year also placed on paid leave nearly all staffers working for three internal watchdogs conducting oversight of immigration agencies, undermining their capacity to investigate abuses.

Darius Reeves, who was the director of ICE’s Baltimore field office until August, said a body camera pilot program rollout had been slow in 2024 under President Biden, a Democrat, and “died on the vine” under Trump, a Republican.

In response to a request for comment, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said ICE officers “act heroically to enforce the law and protect American communities.”

“Anyone pointing the finger at law enforcement officers instead of the criminals is simply doing the bidding of criminal illegal aliens,” she said.

At least three of the eight or more Border Patrol agents at the scene of Saturday's shooting were wearing body cameras, a Reuters view of verified video showed. Reuters could not determine if the cameras were activated or if any agents involved in the physical encounter were wearing them.

When ICE or Border Patrol have engaged in acts of violence - including the fatal shootings of U.S. citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis - top Trump officials have been quick to label the deceased as aggressors rather than call for thorough investigations.

Trump has started ramping up immigration enforcement this year after Republicans in Congress passed a bill last year that provides $170 billion for the crackdown, a major funding surge expected to transform the way ICE and Border Patrol operate.

White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, called Pretti a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin” in social media posts hours after he was fatally shot by a Border Patrol agent.

The shooting has galvanized some Democratic senators who say they will oppose a spending bill to fund the U.S. Department of Homeland Security unless it reins in immigration enforcement.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection - Border Patrol’s parent agency - had 13,400 cameras for some 45,000 officers as of June, according to a congressional aide.

ICE launched a body-camera pilot program in 2024 and deployed cameras to officers in five cities: Baltimore, Buffalo, Detroit, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C.

While the Trump administration kept the program, it called on Congress to freeze its expansion and slash funds to run it in its budget request for fiscal year 2026.

The proposal called for maintaining ICE’s 4,200 body-worn cameras but cutting the 22-person staff to three employees and running the program in a more “streamlined” approach.

DHS says there are some 22,000 ICE officers but a federal workforce database suggests the figure is lower.

A homeland security spending bill passed in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives last week rejected that proposal, instead providing $20 million for ICE and Border Patrol cameras.

Still, the bill - which now faces a challenging route to passage in the U.S. Senate - did not require either agency to use the devices.

Scott Shuchart, a top ICE official under Biden, said officers do not bring the cameras with them when detailed to other locations outside their normal operating area, an issue that has been more relevant as officers have been surged to cities around the country.

DHS did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Trump administration placed some 300 workers in three separate DHS oversight offices on paid leave in early 2025 as it redirected thousands of federal agents from across government to assist its crackdown, a move that drew criticism from Democrats and civil rights groups.

A lawsuit over the reductions argues the Trump administration effectively eliminated the offices, something only Congress would be authorized to do, and left no way to address abuses.

In May, a career federal employee, Ronald Sartini, was tasked with top roles at three of the oversight offices, including the one that handled allegations of abuse in immigration detention.

As of December, there were only a few employees per office. The Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman had three full-time employees and two detailees, compared to more than a hundred in March.

In 2023, OIDO received more than 11,000 complaints in person and received 282 complaints via its web portal, court documents show. Between March and December of 2025, OIDO received 285 complaints in total, court documents show.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 21:20:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AJZSEF4XHFKD5C4ZKYUUA7VJPY.jpg?auth=e2156deda9a62fd82d34f3f05af8bdcaad91b3e79c6099bc8bd81c63e186de42&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim views sculptures for memorial of soldiers who died in Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/north-koreas-kim-views-sculptures-memorial-soldiers-who-died-ukraine-2026-01-25/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 26 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un visited an art studio on Sunday to guide the creation of sculptures to be displayed at a memorial for North Korean troops who died fighting overseas, state media KCNA said on Monday.

Under a mutual defence pact with Russia, in 2024 North Korea sent some 14,000 soldiers to fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 of them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources.

Visiting the Mansudae Art Studio, Kim said the sculptures would "convey forever the legendary feats... of admirable sons of the DPRK", according to KCNA, using North Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

Kim has repeatedly lauded the troops' "heroism" in fighting abroad and honoured them, including greeting and decorating them and working on the memorial for the fallen soldiers personally.

Kim's move comes as North Korea has initiated procedures to convene a key party congress, expected to set out major policy goals for the next five years.

Analysts said the Ninth Party Congress of the Workers' Party is expected to be held early next month, potentially accompanied by a large military parade.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 22:21:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/R55HLVWOHRMADFD23UMZSO47AQ.jpg?auth=632e47ec82134d70a9a0b046c413616d8aae42d3dff1be78abc5f529dd820fad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US restricts visas for two members of Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-restricts-visas-two-members-haitis-transitional-presidential-council-2026-01-25/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 25 (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Sunday it was imposing visa restrictions on members of Haiti's Transitional Presidential Council and revoking the visas of two council members and their immediate families.

In a statement, the State Department attributed the visa restrictions to council members' alleged "involvement in the operation of gangs and other criminal organizations in Haiti, including through interference with the Government of Haiti's efforts to counter gangs designated as Foreign Terrorist Organizations by the United States."

The statement did not identify any council members by name.

Haiti's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for more information.

The mandate of the council, which acts as Haiti's top executive, is scheduled to expire on February 7. No official succession plan is in place.

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime on Friday. Rubio insisted that the council dissolve as scheduled but emphasized the importance of Fils-Aime remaining in his post, a State Department spokesperson said.

Two council members called on Friday for the removal of Fils-Aime from his post.

The council was appointed in 2024 to oversee a move toward Haiti's first election in a decade. This has been repeatedly delayed by a collapse in security during a bloody conflict between security forces and powerful, heavily armed gangs.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 22:45:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GRVXD35QEZKB5BTFGOOPQHOKQA.jpg?auth=158d79f382f986e629eab8f93d53d0aa9c7c59855b21849108a6fb0268e950d2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel to reopen Rafah crossing after search for last hostage body ends</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-reopen-rafah-crossing-after-search-last-hostage-body-ends-2026-01-25/</link><description>Jan 25 (Reuters) - Israel will reopen Gaza's Rafah crossing with Egypt for the passage of people only after an operation to locate the body of the last remaining Israeli hostage in the enclave is completed, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said late on Sunday.

The border was supposed to have opened during the initial phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the war, under a ceasefire reached in October between Israel and Hamas.

However, Israel conditioned the reopening on the return of all living hostages held by Palestinian militant factions in Gaza, as well as a "100% effort" by Hamas to locate and return the bodies of all deceased hostages.

All have been returned except for the body of police officer Ran Gvili. The Israeli military said on Sunday it had launched a "targeted operation" in northern Gaza to retrieve his remains, while an Israeli military official said there were "several intelligence leads" regarding his possible location.

The Israeli military "is currently conducting a focused operation to exhaust all of the intelligence that has been gathered in the effort to locate and return the fallen hostage, Master Sgt. Ran Gvili, of blessed memory," Netanyahu's office said in a statement.

It added that when the operation is complete, "Israel will open the Rafah Crossing."

On Thursday, Ali Shaath, head of a transitional Palestinian committee backed by the U.S. to temporarily administer Gaza, said the Rafah Crossing would open this week. It is effectively the sole route in or out of Gaza for nearly all of the more than 2 million people who live there.

The Gaza side of the crossing has been under Israeli military control since 2024.

"As part of President Trump's 20-point plan, Israel has agreed to a limited reopening of the Rafah Crossing for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism," Netanyahu's office said.

This month, Washington announced the plan had moved into the second phase, under which Israel is expected to withdraw troops further from Gaza and Hamas is due to yield control of the territory's administration.

Last week, three sources told Reuters Israel wants to restrict the number of Palestinians entering Gaza through the border crossing with Egypt to ensure that more are allowed out than in.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 22:45:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F4UH5TVXFBJT3ANNU7QZX2ECNM.jpg?auth=4d645bfe6e25dea14b7b7636100c92f01e66ab5e06e261053be42df4721d0567&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel launches large-scale Gaza operation to find last hostage</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260125-israel-gaza-israel-launches-operation-to-locate-hostage</link><description>Israel said Sunday its military was conducting a “large-scale operation” to locate the last hostage in Gaza, as Washington and other mediators pressure Israel and Hamas to move into the next phase of their ceasefire.

The statement came as Israel’s Cabinet met to discuss the possibility of opening Gaza’s key Rafah border crossing with Egypt, and a day after top US envoys met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about next steps.

The return of the remaining hostage, Ran Gvili, has been widely seen as removing the remaining obstacle to moving ahead with opening the Rafah crossing, which would signal the US-brokered ceasefire' s second phase.

Late Sunday, Netanyahu's office in a statement said that once this search operation is "exhausted and in accordance with the agreement with the United States, Israel will open the Rafah crossing.”

The return of all remaining hostages, alive or dead, has been a central part of the first phase of the ceasefire that took effect on Oct. 10. Before Sunday, the previous hostage was recovered in early December.

While Israel has carried out search efforts before for Gvili, more detail than usual was released about this one. Israel’s military said it was searching a cemetery in northern Gaza near the Yellow Line, which marks off Israeli-controlled parts of the territory.

Separately, an Israeli military official said Gvili may have been buried in the Shujaiyya–Daraj Tuffah area, and that rabbis and dental experts were on the ground with specialised search teams. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing an operation still under way.

Gvili’s family has urged Netanyahu’s government not to enter the ceasefire’s second phase until his remains are returned.

But pressure has been building, and the Trump administration has already declared in recent days that the second phase is under way.

Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas in a statement Sunday said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili’s remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.

The shuttered headquarters of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees in east Jerusalem was set ablaze overnight, days after Israeli bulldozers demolished parts of the compound.

It was not known who started the fire. Israeli settlers were observed at night looting the main building for furniture, said Roland Friedrich, the agency’s West Bank director. He said multiple holes were cut in the fence.

Israel’s fire department said it sent teams to prevent the blaze from spreading. In May 2024, UNRWA said it was closing its compound after settlers set fires to its fence.

Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini of the agency, also known as UNRWA, told The Associated Press the incident was the “latest attack on the UN in the ongoing attempt to dismantle the status of Palestine refugees.”

UNRWA’ s mandate is to provide aid and services to some 2.5 million Palestinian refugees in Gaza, the Israeli-occupied West Bank and east Jerusalem, as well as 3 million more refugees in Syria, Jordan and Lebanon. But its operations were curtailed last year when Israel’s Knesset passed legislation severing ties and banning it from functioning in what it defines as Israel, including east Jerusalem.

Israel has long railed against the agency, accusing it of being infiltrated by Hamas and alleging that some of its employees were involved in the 2023 attack that triggered Israel’s two-year war in Gaza. UNRWA leaders have said they took swift action against the employees accused of taking part in the attack, and have denied allegations that the agency tolerates or collaborates with Hamas.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 23:22:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/18f63de6-ed3d-11f0-b102-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26006617469257.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>New Zealand resumes victim recovery efforts after fatal landslide</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/new-zealand-resumes-victim-recovery-efforts-after-fatal-landslide-2026-01-25/</link><description>WELLINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - New Zealand police on Monday restarted recovery efforts for the victims of a landslide that hit a busy campground on the country's North Island last week.

Six people, including two teenagers, are presumed dead after heavy rains triggered Thursday's landslide at Mount Maunganui on the island's east coast, bringing down soil and rubble at the site in the city of Tauranga, crowded with families on summer holidays.

Human remains were found at the site on Saturday, but police have yet to confirm if they had been identified.

On Sunday, efforts to recover the victims were suspended after a contractor driver noticed potential instability on the face of the landslide.

Bay of Plenty District Commander Tim Anderson said in a statement on Monday that the recovery effort resumed at 10:30 a.m. local time (2130 GMT on Sunday).

"Additional monitoring equipment has been brought in and specialist crews removed loose material that was of concern above the slip area this morning," Anderson said.

A vigil was held for the victims at a nearby park on Sunday, which was attended by around 200 locals as well as Prime Minister Christopher Luxon and Emergency Management Minister Mark Mitchell, according to Radio New Zealand.

Luxon said in a post on X that it had been "very special to join the Mt Maunganui community" to remember the precious lives lost.</description><pubDate>Sun, 25 Jan 2026 23:43:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7Z3TIVJBWVNBJKBMTK6L3DDRHU.jpg?auth=3a3a3eaeee171dfd80b7b3c1371b500dcad81dd6402d60b8237ea2d0e99223c2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven killed, scores missing as passenger ferry capsizes off southern Philippines</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/seven-killed-scores-missing-passenger-ferry-capsizes-off-southern-philippines-2026-01-26/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - At least seven people died after a passenger boat carrying more than 300 people capsized off the southern Philippine province of Basilan, the Philippine Coast Guard said.

The accident occurred after midnight on Monday as the passenger vessel, MV Trisha Kerstin 3, was en route to Jolo in Sulu province, after departing Zamboanga. The PCG said the vessel had 332 passengers on record and 27 crew.

Coast Guard Commander Romel Dua of Southern Mindanao District told DZBB radio that 215 people had been rescued and seven bodies recovered, while search and rescue operations continued for 144 others who remained missing.

Dua said an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the accident.

Basilan Governor Mujiv Hataman shared on Facebook clips from the scene at Isabela port in Mindanao which showed survivors being ushered off boats, some wrapped in thermal blankets, and others being carried on stretchers.

It was the first time the approval rating had fallen below 70% since Takaichi was sworn in as prime minister in October, the Nikkei reported on Sunday.

The ratio of those who said they do not support Takaichi's administration rose to 26% from 18% in the previous poll in December, it said.

Of the total, 56% said they did not think Takaichi's stimulus package designed to cushion the blow from rising living costs would be effective, higher than the 38% who thought it would have a positive effect.

Takaichi called a snap general election on February 8 to seek a mandate to gear up her expansionary fiscal policy, a move that triggered a spike in bond yields on market concerns Japan may be forced to issue additional debt.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 01:58:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/G53CQACP3VNG5CMZCCQHLYKJ7A.jpg?auth=f14adc0c89642061e52449c623f41321598cbc730cd974e7eb27c5deb8ca463a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea police say detain 55 scam suspects repatriated from Cambodia</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-police-say-detain-55-scam-suspects-repatriated-cambodia-2026-01-26/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 26 (Reuters) - South Korean authorities on Monday detained 55 of the 73 people repatriated from Cambodia last week as part of an investigation into suspected involvement in online scam operations, police said.

Federal agents shot and killed Alex Pretti, a 37-year-old ICU nurse, early Saturday while scuffling with him on an icy roadway in the Midwestern city, less than three weeks after an immigration officer fired on Renee Good, also 37, killing her in her car.

Trump administration officials quickly claimed that Pretti had intended to harm the federal agents -- as it did after Good's death -- pointing to a pistol it said was discovered on him.

However, video shared widely on social media and verified by US media showed Pretti never drawing a weapon, with agents firing around 10 shots at him seconds after he was sprayed in the face with chemical irritant and thrown to the ground.

Trump provocatively attributed the deaths to Minnesota's Democratic elected officials, including Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, writing on his Truth Social platform: "Democrat run Sanctuary Cities and States are REFUSING to cooperate with ICE."

"Tragically, two American Citizens have lost their lives as a result of this Democrat ensued chaos," he added.

After top officials described Pretti as an "assassin" who had assaulted the agents, Pretti's parents issued a statement Saturday condemning the administration's "sickening lies" about their son.

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, asked on Fox News show "The Sunday Briefing" what she would say to Pretti's parents, responded: "Just that I'm grieved for them."

US Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, speaking to NBC's "Meet the Press," said an investigation was necessary to get a full understanding of the killing.

Asked if agents had already removed the pistol from Pretti when they fired on him, Blanche said: "I do not know. And nobody else knows, either. That's why we're doing an investigation."

Their comments came after multiple senators from Trump's Republican Party called for a thorough probe into the killing, and for cooperation with local authorities.

The Trump administration controversially excluded local investigators from a probe into Good's killing.

Walz posed a question directly to the president during a press briefing Sunday, asking: "What's the plan, Donald Trump?"

"What do we need to do to get these federal agents out of our state?"

On Sunday, business leaders from 60 corporations headquartered in Minnesota -- including retailer Target, food giant General Mills and several professional sports franchises -- signed an open letter "calling for an immediate de-escalation of tensions and for state, local and federal officials to work together to find real solutions."

Thousands of federal immigration agents have been deployed to heavily Democratic Minneapolis for weeks, after conservative media reported on alleged fraud by Somali immigrants, which Trump has repeatedly amplified.

The city, known for its bitterly cold winters, has one of the country's highest concentrations of Somali immigrants.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison pushed back against Trump's claim, telling reporters "it's not about fraud, because if he sent people who understand forensic accounting, we'd be having a different conversation. But he's sending armed masked men."

Since "Operation Metro Surge" began, many residents have carried whistles to notify others of the presence of immigration agents, while sometimes violent skirmishes have broken out between the officers and protesters.

Local authorities have sued the federal government seeking a court order to suspend the operation, with a first hearing set for Monday.

Recent polling has shown voters increasingly upset with Trump's domestic immigration operations, as videos of masked agents seizing people off sidewalks -- including children -- proliferate.

Barack and Michelle Obama on Sunday forcefully condemned Pretti's killing, saying in a statement it should be a "wake-up call" that core US values "are increasingly under assault."

The former president and first lady blasted Trump and his government as seeming "eager to escalate the situation."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 01:58:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/22d9e178-fa1c-11f0-9d29-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-24T222122Z-771571134-RC2W7JAH6FTX-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-MINNESOTA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Sudan crisis heightens 'risk of mass violence' against civilians, UN experts say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260126-sudan-civilian-mass-violence-risk-un-experts-report</link><description>The situation in South Sudan is heightening "the risk of mass violence against civilians", independent UN experts warned on Sunday as fresh conflict and violent rhetoric grips the country.

The UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan in a statement expressed "grave alarm" at fighting in Jonglei state north of the capital Juba, where witnesses have described civilians fleeing into swamps.

South Sudan People's Defence Forces (SSPDF) spokesperson Lul Ruai Koang later on Sunday told Jonglei residents to "immediately evacuate" areas controlled by the Sudan People's Liberation Army in Opposition (SPLA-IO) and move to "government controlled areas as soon as possible".

Civilians "would be considered as legitimate military targets", the spokesperson added.

The world's youngest country has been beset by war, poverty and massive corruption since it was formed in 2011, with violence once again on the rise between rival factions.

A power-sharing agreement between the two main sides is all but dead after President Salva Kiir moved against his vice-president and long-time rival, Riek Machar, who was arrested last March and is now on trial for "crimes against humanity".

Their forces have fought several times over the past year, but the most sustained clashes began in late December in Jonglei.

Public statements by commanders encouraging violence against civilians, along with troop mobilisation, "represent a dangerous escalation at a moment when the political foundations of the peace process are already severely weakened", the UN commission said.

Army chief Paul Nang Majok on Wednesday ordered troops deployed in the region to "crush the rebellion" within seven days.

Local media have also quoted a senior army official as saying "no one should be spared, not even the elderly".

The UN mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) said it was "gravely concerned" about the public declarations.

"Inflammatory rhetoric calling for violence against civilians, including the most vulnerable, is utterly abhorrent and must stop now," said UNMISS head Graham Maitland.

Renewed fighting in South Sudan has displaced more than 180,000 people, according to the country's authorities.

Kiir and Machar fought a five-year war shortly after independence that claimed 400,000 lives. A 2018 power-sharing deal kept the peace for some years but plans to hold elections and merge their armies did not materialise.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 01:58:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4d550da0-e596-11f0-880b-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25280544088823.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Death toll from landslide in Indonesia's West Java rises to 17</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/death-toll-landslide-indonesias-west-java-rises-17-2026-01-26/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The death toll from a landslide that hit Indonesia's West Java province at the weekend rose to 17 on Monday, the country's disaster mitigation agency said, with dozens still missing.

The landslide that hit a residential area in the Bandung Barat region early on Saturday was triggered by heavy rains starting the day before, which the weather agency warned could continue in the province and several other regions for another week.

The impacted Pasir Langu village is located in a hilly area of the province about 100 km (60 miles) southeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta. More than 30 houses were buried by the landslide, the agency said.

At least 17 have died from the landslide, agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari told Reuters on Monday, with 73 still missing.

The agency said on Sunday that a smaller landslide together with bad weather was hindering the search, which requires drones and heavy equipment.

Flash floods hit several parts of Indonesia last week, including West Java and Jakarta, forcing residents to flee their homes and evacuate to higher ground.

The landslide occurred two months after cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra killed 1,200 people, destroyed homes and displaced over a million residents.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:59:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MEQTTIT6NNI5XNGV3MXZARMG3A.jpg?auth=6d69b15b58e7286a887da95d3111723bdb9181f0c454eb24581c52fe858b573a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia Day marked by 'Invasion Day' rallies, anti-immigration protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/australia-day-marked-by-invasion-day-rallies-anti-immigration-protests-2026-01-26/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Thousands marked Australia's national day on Monday by attending "Invasion Day" rallies in support of Indigenous Australians and calling for unity, while separate anti-immigration protests also drew crowds.

Australia Day commemorates the day Britain established the state of New South Wales as a penal colony, with the arrival in Sydney of ships bringing colonists and convicts.

However, for many Indigenous Australians, who make up about 4% of the country's 27 million people, the holiday is known as "Invasion Day" and marks the destruction of their cultures by European settlers.

At Sydney's Hyde Park, the annual "Invasion Day" rally started at 10 a.m. (2300 GMT) with a tribute to those killed by a gunman in a NSW rural town last week.

Indigenous speakers also talked about land repatriation, the high number of deaths of Aboriginal people in police custody and the need to stay united against increasing nationalism with the right-wing opposition in disarray and Pauline Hanson's populist One Nation party rising in the polls .

Australia - where one in two people is either born overseas or has a parent born overseas - has seen record-high immigration in recent years, fuelling discontent among some voters amid soaring costs of living and a housing shortage.

"We need a coalition of all new Australians because if it wasn't for immigrants, Australia would have perished," Aboriginal woman Gwenda Stanley told the rally, as she condemned Hanson.

"So don't just stand with us today. Stand with us every day."

Every year on January 26, protesters rally against the mistreatment of Indigenous people, demanding the government drop the Australia Day celebrations or move the date. However, a survey by the Sydney Morning Herald , opens new tab newspaper on Sunday showed a record number of Australians wanting to maintain the holiday on the same date.

Nearby, anti-immigration demonstrations began at noon as protesters, estimated in the hundreds by local media, arrived carrying Australian flags on poles. March for Australia, which has been criticised for alleged links to neo-Nazi groups, organised the demonstration.

Similar events - "Invasion Day" rallies and March for Australia protests - are being held across the country.

Earlier in the day, in a speech as he presided over an Australia Day citizenship ceremony, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called for unity, not division.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 03:59:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W2FDJOA4P5PW5KM6I2UDPAZGPQ.jpg?auth=5937a39f192482d535d3adc79f1b2d8ea489f35d9945694bd8d56b0b7ce51f8c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China's Xi says India, China are 'friends, partners'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinas-xi-says-india-china-are-friends-partners-2026-01-26/</link><description>HONG KONG, Jan 26 (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping said China and India were "good neighbours, friends and partners" as he wished President Droupadi Murmu congratulations on the South Asian nation's Republic Day, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Monday.

Xi said that over the past year, China-India relations have continued to improve and develop and are of "great significance for maintaining and promoting world peace and prosperity," according to Xinhua.

Xi said China has always believed that being "good neighbours, friends and partners" is the right choice for both China and India.

He referred to China and India as the "dragon and the elephant dancing together," Xinhua said.

Xi said he hoped that both sides would expand exchanges and cooperation and address each other's concerns to promote healthy and stable relations.

The nuclear-armed Asian neighbours share a 3,800 km (2,400-mile) border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s.

Ties between the countries were shaken by a 2020 clash in which 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers died in hand-to-hand combat. After that, the Himalayan border was heavily militarised by both sides.

Both countries began improving ties last year after staging a series of high-level bilateral visits.

Direct flights resumed in 2025 as both countries stepped up trade and investment flows against the backdrop of U.S. President Donald Trump's combative foreign policy.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 04:00:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VK5FUUU6RNNSHNMGRZFUFR4MUU.jpg?auth=778440c6d0ed7b44d1e01daec3bce331f286806f3698c5e00610e23686a70215&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan monitoring 'abnormal' China military leadership changes after top general put under investigation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/taiwan-monitoring-abnormal-china-military-leadership-changes-after-top-general-2026-01-26/</link><description>TAIPEI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Taiwan is monitoring what it called "abnormal" changes to China's military leadership after its most senior general was put under investigation, and will use various methods to decipher Beijing's intentions, Defence Minister Wellington Koo said on Monday.

China announced on Saturday that Zhang Youxia, second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, and another senior officer, Liu Zhenli, were under investigation for suspected serious violations of discipline and law .

"We will continue to closely monitor abnormal changes among the top levels of China's party, government, and military leadership. The military's position is based on the fact that China has never abandoned the use of force against Taiwan," Koo told reporters at parliament.

Zhang has long been seen as Xi's closest military ally, and is one of the few senior Chinese officers with combat experience, having taken part in the 1979 border conflict with Vietnam.

China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, sends warplanes and warships into the skies and waters around the island on an almost daily basis, in what Taipei views as a harassment campaign to get the government to accept Beijing's sovereignty claims.

Koo said what the ministry was looking at is not any "single leadership reshuffle that would be enough to draw conclusions".

Taiwan will use a range of joint intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance methods, as well as intelligence-sharing, to "grasp" China's possible intentions, he added.

"What we want is a comprehensive grasp of all indicators - military and non-military - reflecting China's intentions and actions, and then make an integrated overall assessment," Koo said, without elaborating.

China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control, and held its latest round of war games around the island late last month. Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their future.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 04:00:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6CKXFS5P5JP75IB2IAQ6JYGV3E.jpg?auth=2c16ad7c25879b7b55d5d73e037d0d8130d35b5215a3925ff9f34399fc102d19&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Venezuela frees more political prisoners, Rodriguez pushes back on US pressure</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260126-venezuela-frees-political-prisoners-rodriguez-rejects-us-pressure</link><description>More than 100 political prisoners were freed Sunday in Venezuela, where detainees are slowly being released under pressure from the United States, the non-governmental organisation Foro Penal said.

"At Foro Penal we have verified 104 releases of political prisoners in Venezuela today," the NGO wrote on social media.

Foro Penal had earlier reported 80 political prisoners being released Sunday.

Director Alfredo Romero said on X that the group was verifying the identities of those released from jails nationwide.

Foro Penal attorney Gonzalo Himiob said the initial releases had taken place in the early hours of the day.

"This figure is not yet definitive and could increase as we proceed with verifications," he said, also on X.

The government of Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodriguez , who took power after leftist president Nicolas Maduro was captured by US special forces early this month, has promised to release a "large number" of the hundreds of Maduro opponents languishing in prison.

In an address Sunday to oil worker's in Venezuela's eastern state of Anzoategui, Rodriguez struck a confident tone.

"Enough orders from Washington on politicians in Venezuela. Let Venezuelan politics resolve our differences and internal conflicts. Enough of foreign powers," Rodriguez said.

"It has cost this republic dearly to have to face the consequences of fascism, of extremism in our country."

Authorities in Caracas say they have freed 626 detainees since December, but Foro Penal has only recorded about half as many releases in that time.

Venezuela's political opposition and human rights groups have criticised the slow unfolding of the process.

Loved ones of detainees have been camped out outside prisons waiting for their release.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 04:00:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6deaadd2-f175-11f0-8834-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-14T180613Z-2042008953-RC261JALUC9L-RTRMADP-3-USA-VENEZUELA-RODRIGUEZ.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Armed attack in Mexico's Salamanca kills 11</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/armed-attack-mexicos-salamanca-kills-11-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 25 (Reuters) - An armed attack in the Mexican city of Salamanca killed 11 people, the office of the attorney general in the state of Guanajuato, home to the city, said in a statement on Sunday.

The MV Trisha Kerstin 3 issued a distress signal around 1:50 am (1750 GMT Sunday), a bit over four hours after it departed the Port of Zamboanga City on the southwestern tip of Mindanao, the coast guard said in a statement.

At least 316 people have been rescued, Romel Dua, a coast guard commander, told AFP, with 15 confirmed dead and 28 still unaccounted for.

"A coast guard aircraft is also on the way to help with the operation. The Navy and Air Force also sent their assets," Dua, who is based in southern Mindanao, told AFP.

The 44-metre (144-foot), triple-decker vessel went down about five kilometres east of Baluk-Baluk Island, part of the Basilan province chain of islands off the Zamboanga peninsula.

"Based on the account of some survivors, the waters in the area were rough at the time," Philippine Coast Guard spokeswoman Noemie Cayabyab said in a televised interview.

Basilan emergency responder Ronalyn Perez told AFP that rescuers were struggling to handle the sudden influx of survivors.

"The challenge really is the number of patients that are coming in. We are short-staffed at the moment," Perez said in an interview, adding at least 18 had been brought to one local hospital.

"The ferry was sailing from Zamboanga City to Jolo Island when the incident happened," she added.

Video released by the Philippine Coast Guard showed survivors being plucked from the water and receiving medical attention.

Survivors could be heard shouting for help in the dark in a live video on Facebook.

"We cannot say for now the reason of the sinking, but we were instructed to conduct a marine casualty investigation to determine the cause," Dua said.

"As of now, we are focused on the rescue."

Survivors were being brought to the coast guard stations in Zamboanga and Isabela City, he added.

In its statement, the coast guard said the ferry had not been overloaded.

The archipelago nation of 116 million has a long history of disasters involving the inter-island ferries that ply its seas.

Many rely on cheap and poorly regulated boats and ships for transport between the country's more than 7,000 islands, despite regular accidents.

In 2023, more than 30 people were killed when a fire ripped through a ferry in the southern Philippines, while a 2015 capsizing off the western coast of Leyte Island resulted in more than 60 deaths.

In 1987, the Dona Paz ferry collided with an oil tanker in a pre- Christmas accident that claimed more than 4,000 lives. It was the world's worst peacetime disaster at sea.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 05:03:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/60157944-fa6c-11f0-b906-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026083659072.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Drone debris spark fire at two enterprises in Russia's Krasnodar region, authorities say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/drone-debris-spark-fire-two-enterprises-russias-krasnodar-region-authorities-say-2026-01-26/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Two enterprises caught fire and one person was injured in the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban in Russia's Krasnodar region after drone fragments fell on them, the regional emergencies centre said on Monday.

The Chinese Embassy and officials in Manila have stepped up their rhetoric in recent weeks, with the former criticising the Philippines' coast guard spokesperson and its lawmakers. Foreign Affairs Secretary Theresa Lazaro told Reuters last week that differences between states are best handled through diplomacy, not public exchanges.

The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Philippine foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday that it backed statements by Philippine officials, saying they were part of their mandate to uphold the country's sovereignty and sovereign rights. At the same time, the ministry called for "sober, professional and respectful exchanges in the public sphere".

"The Department believes that circumspection in language and actions are necessary so that the exchanges ... will not unnecessarily derail the diplomatic space needed to manage the tensions in the maritime domain," the foreign ministry said.

Manila and Beijing have been locked in a series of maritime confrontations in recent years, with the Philippines accusing China of repeatedly aggressive actions inside its exclusive economic zone, including dangerous manoeuvres, water‑cannoning, and the disruption of resupply missions.

Beijing continues to assert sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, including areas that fall within the EEZs of the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 06:38:39 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P4CGFZPE2FJD7A6F5UXN7UJ7UE.jpg?auth=910633db2174efcacc677e8f81d2c7f68045b052af3bd1a4f612b13b78ecdfea&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, South Korea agree to deepen cooperation on nuclear-powered subs, Seoul says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-south-korea-agree-deepen-cooperation-nuclear-powered-subs-seoul-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby and South Korean Defence Minister Ahn Gyu-back agreed during talks on Monday to deepen cooperation on Seoul's pursuit of a nuclear-powered submarine, South Korea's defence ministry said.

Colby is visiting Seoul on his first overseas trip in the post, which comes as Washington signals it expects South Korea to take a more leading role in deterring North Korea.

In a statement, the ministry said both sides viewed cooperation on a nuclear-powered submarine as a step that would strengthen South Korea's ability to lead the defence of the peninsula and elevate the security alliance.

The Pentagon's new National Defense Strategy released on Friday said that it expects a "more limited" U.S. role in deterring North Korea, with South Korea taking the primary responsibility.

Ahn also pressed for faster progress on the transfer of wartime operational control to Seoul and called for closer coordination on alliance follow-up measures, the ministry said.

Colby, the Pentagon's top defence and foreign policy official, said in a post on X on his arrival that South Korea is a "model ally" committed to increasing defence spending in line with U.S. regional strategy.

South Korea hosts about 28,500 U.S. troops and last year pledged to lift defence spending to 3.5% of GDP, a move that Colby and other U.S. officials have praised as strengthening Seoul's role in deterring North Korea.

Colby will also visit Japan during his Asian trip, according to media reports.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:29:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ETTYX3JHIRIGHMZJ4CU2IQMRJU.jpg?auth=93b3e562adeda5e293ce0e22e92d5ff0b0353f2a9b8a43a88e2d7efe3f4d9066&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Top Chinese officials hold talks with OIC secretary general</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/top-chinese-officials-hold-talks-with-oic-secretary-general-2026-01-26/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 26 (Reuters) - China's vice president and foreign minister held talks with the secretary-general of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation on Monday, according to a ministry statement and the official news agency, Xinhua.

The talks in the Chinese capital of Beijing come amid heightened Middle East tension after an Iranian official said the country would treat any attack "as an all-out war against us".

Those comments followed U.S. President Donald Trump's remark the previous day that the United States had an "armada" heading toward Iran, adding it was "just in case", warning Iran not to kill protesters or restart its nuclear program.

An Iranian official in the region said on Sunday at least 5,000 were killed after a wave of protest over economic hardship.

In Monday's talks, Foreign Minister Wang Yi called for the building of a regional security partnership and the political settlement of hot-spot issues, the ministry said.

Thick black smoke billowed into the sky as around 40 firefighters and 13 trucks tackled the fire engulfing the industrial facility, with flames still visible across the roof of the complex.

The region has long worried about threats posed by Russia – but more recently tensions have surged over US President Donald Trump 's push for the autonomous territory of Denmark .

German Chancellor Friedrich Merz hosts the talks just days after Trump backed away from his threat to seize Greenland by force and level punitive tariffs against European NATO allies who stand in his way.

Trump said he had reached a "framework" agreement with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte , but this sparked both relief and confusion as the details have not been disclosed.

"We will have to pay increased attention to all parts of NATO's European territory," Merz said Thursday after an extraordinary European Council meeting.

"This concerns the North above all."

On the guest list Monday will be Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who visited Greenland on Friday, and representatives of NATO and the European Commission as well as Iceland .

Leaders from Norway , the Netherlands , Ireland , Belgium and Luxembourg are also expected, while Britain and France are sending ministers to the summit in the northern port city of Hamburg.

"Given the make-up of the meeting, I am certain that security in the High North will also be of interest to the participants," said Steffen Meyer, spokesman for Merz.

Formally, the aim of the summit is to push cross-border expansion of offshore wind energy, the hydrogen market and interconnected offshore infrastructure.

Security fears will be high on the agenda as the North and adjoining Baltic Seas have long been the targets of so-called "hybrid attacks" widely blamed on Russia.

Cargo ships linked to Russia have been suspected of sabotaging undersea communication cables and surveilling critical infrastructure.

In Germany, mysterious drone flights over airports , military bases and industrial sites have further unnerved authorities, who believe some were launched from ships sent by Russia.

Merz said last week that "maritime security" as well as "shared economic success in the North" would be topics for discussion in Hamburg.

The goal was to make the North Sea "the world's largest reservoir of clean energy", which he described as being of "crucial importance for a strong, secure and independent Europe".

At the last North Sea summit in 2023, nations agreed to build up to 300 gigawatts of wind capacity by mid-century, with an intermediate target of 120 GW set for 2030.

But based on current trends, there will be just 82 GW of installed capacity by the end of the decade, according to consultancy Baringa.

Government sources have said addressing the industry's "current difficulties" will be an issue in Hamburg.

Stumbling blocks have included logistical bottlenecks at ports, parts shortages and a grid infrastructure that struggles to handle additional and variable power.

There have also been fears about Chinese turbine makers entering the supply chain as European players seek to boost their own autonomy and industrial self-reliance.

Proponents of wind energy argue it is not only good for the climate but also for security, as such decentralised systems are more resilient to sabotage and attack than fossil fuel power plants, pipelines or oil tankers.

Simon Skillings of think tank E3G said that "we've learnt a lot over recent years from not just some of the hybrid attacks that have happened on infrastructure, but also looking at the Ukraine-Russia situation. We've learnt that dispersed assets are more resilient."

"A more dispersed infrastructure is more robust... You need basically multiple attacks rather than single attacks to knock out an energy supply."

Skillings said offshore wind farms could help boost maritime security if surveillance equipment or drones are integrated into turbines.

But there is still "very little coordination on these issues in the North Sea", he said, adding that building resilience into the system would also drive up costs.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:31:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/61bc8f92-fa64-11f0-b028-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/318a040b1eae06b6674da2d0472972e8ace364fe.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US to step up coordination with Nigeria to pursue Islamic State group militants</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20260126-us-steps-up-cooperation-with-nigeria-to-pursue-islamic-state-group-militants</link><description>The US military is increasing materiel deliveries and intelligence sharing with Nigeria , Africom's deputy commander said, as part of a broader American push to work with African militaries to go after Islamic State group -linked militants.

The Pentagon has also kept open lines of communication with militaries in the junta-led Sahel countries of Burkina Faso , Niger and Mali , Lieutenant General John Brennan said.

The increased cooperation with Abuja follows Washington's diplomatic pressure on Nigeria over jihadist violence in the country, but also as the US military is becoming "more aggressive" in pursuing IS group-linked targets on the continent.

Under the Trump administration, "we've gotten a lot more aggressive and (are) working with partners to target, kinetically, the threats, mainly ISIS," Brennan said in an interview on the sidelines of a US-Nigeria security meeting in the Nigerian capital last week.

"From Somalia to Nigeria, the problem set is connected. So we're trying to take it apart and then provide partners with the information they need," he added.

"It's been about more enabling partners and then providing them equipment and capabilities with less restrictions so that they can be more successful."

Last week's inaugural US-Nigeria Joint Working Group meeting came roughly a month after the US announced surprise Christmas Day strikes on IS group-linked targets in northwest Nigeria.

Though both militaries seem keen on increased cooperation after the joint strikes, hanging over it all is diplomatic pressure by Washington over what Trump claims is the mass killing of Christians in Nigeria.

Abuja and independent analysts reject that framing of Nigeria's myriad, overlapping conflicts, which has long been used by the US religious right.

Charged politics were on display at the Joint Working Group meeting in Abuja, where Allison Hooker, the number three at the State Department, pushed the Nigerian government "to protect Christians" in a speech that did not mention Muslim victims of armed groups.

Africa's most populous country is roughly evenly split between a mostly Muslim north and mostly Christian south. Though millions live peacefully side by side, religious and ethnic identity remains a sensitive topic in a country that has seen sectarian violence throughout its history.

Brennan said that US intelligence would not be limited to protecting Christians.

He also said that following the US strikes in northwestern Sokoto state, American support going forward would focus on intelligence sharing to aid Nigerian air strikes there, as well as the northeast, where a jihadist insurgency by Boko Haram and rival breakaway ISWAP has raged since 2009.

Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) is "our most concerning group", he said.

Analysts have been tracking US intelligence flights over the country in recent months, though some have questioned whether air support alone can push back armed groups that thrive amid widespread poverty and state collapse in rural areas.

US-Nigerian cooperation going forward will involve "the whole gamut of intel sharing, sharing... tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as enabling them to procure more equipment," Brennan said.

The initial strikes targeted militants linked to the Islamic State Sahel Province group, typically active in neighbouring Niger, Brennan said.

Analysts have voiced concerns about ISSP's spread from the Sahel into coastal west African countries like Nigeria.

The impact of those strikes so far has been unclear, however, with local and international journalists unable to confirm militant casualties.

Asked about their effectiveness, Nigerian information minister Mohammed Idris said last week it was "still a work in progress".

In the Sahel more widely, Brennan said "we still collaborate" with the junta-led governments in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, which have broken away from their west African neighbours and largely shunned the West.

Security cooperation has been curtailed since coups toppled civilian governments across the three countries from 2020 to 2023.

"We have actually shared information with some of them to attack key terrorist targets," he said. "We still talk to our military partners across the Sahelian states, even though it's not official."

Brennan also said the US is not seeking to replace its bases in Niger after its troops were pushed out by the ruling junta.

"We're not in the market to create a drone base anywhere," he said, referencing the shuttered US drone operations in Agadez.

"We are much more focused on getting capability to the right place at the right time and then leaving. We don't seek long-term basing in any of the western African countries."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:31:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7bd57a4e-fa80-11f0-ad87-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-22T131724Z-1703878274-RC296JAZ7DJY-RTRMADP-3-USA-NIGERIA-SECURITY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel to allow 'limited reopening' of Rafah crossing once last hostage is recovered</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260126-israel-to-allow-limited-reopening-of-rafah-crossing-once-last-hostage-is-recovered</link><description>Israel said Monday it would allow a "limited reopening" of the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt once it had recovered the remains of the last hostage in the Palestinian territory.

Reopening Rafah, a vital entry point for aid into Gaza, forms part of a truce framework announced by US President Donald Trump in October, but the crossing has remained closed since Israeli forces took control of it during the war in the Palestinian territory.

Visiting US envoys had reportedly pressed Israeli officials to reopen the crossing during talks in Jerusalem over the weekend.

World leaders and aid agencies have repeatedly pushed for more humanitarian convoys to be able to access Gaza, which has been left devastated by more than two years of war and depends on the inflow of essential medical equipment, food and other supplies.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 's office said on Monday that Israel had agreed to a reopening "for pedestrian passage only, subject to a full Israeli inspection mechanism".

The move would depend on "the return of all living hostages and a 100% effort by Hamas to locate and return all deceased hostages", it said on X.

The Israeli military said it was searching a cemetery in the Gaza Strip on Sunday for the remains of the last hostage, Ran Gvili.

Netanyahu's office said: "Upon completion of this operation, and in accordance with what has been agreed upon with the US, Israel will open the Rafah Crossing."

The announcement came after Gaza's newly appointed administrator, Ali Shaath, said the crossing would open " in both directions " this week.

"For Palestinians in Gaza, Rafah is more than a gate, it is a lifeline and a symbol of opportunity," Shaath said at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday.

Israeli media had also reported that US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner had urged Netanyahu to reopen Rafah during their Jerusalem talks.

A spokesman for Hamas's Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Abu Obeida, said on Sunday that the group had "provided mediators with all the details and information in our possession regarding the location of the captive's body", referring to Gvili.

Obeida added that "the enemy (Israel) is currently searching one of the sites based on information transmitted by the Al-Qassam Brigades".

Except for Gvili, all of the 251 people taken hostage during Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel have since been returned, whether living or dead.

A non-commissioned officer in the Israeli police's elite Yassam unit, Gvili was killed in action on the day of the attack and his body taken to Gaza.

The first phase of the US-backed ceasefire deal had stipulated that Hamas hand over all the hostages in Gaza.

Gvili's family has expressed strong opposition to launching the second phase of the plan, which includes reopening Rafah, before they have received his remains.

"First and foremost, Ran must be brought home," his family said in a statement on Sunday.

The Gaza war was sparked by Hamas's October 7, 2023 attack on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of 1,221 people.

The Israeli retaliation flattened much of Gaza, home to about 2.2 million people, a territory that was already suffering severely from previous rounds of fighting and from an Israeli blockade imposed since 2007.

In November, authorities in Gaza said more than 70,000 people had been killed there.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:31:50 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/d45990c2-fa50-11f0-8867-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/3f21da3893f3797812582e2b98be347321c1438f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Historic winter storm kills several, causes mass travel disruption across US</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260126-historic-winter-storm-kills-several-causes-mass-travel-disruption-across-us</link><description>A monster storm barreling across swaths of the United States has killed at least 10 people and prompted warnings to stay off the roads, mass flight cancellations and power outages, as freezing conditions persisted into Monday.

As the storm dumped snow , sleet and freezing rain across the wide expanse, officials cautioned that an Arctic air mass behind the system would see temperatures fall dangerously low for days, prolonging disruptions to daily life.

The US National Weather Service (NWS) told Americans to expect more of the same weather conditions into Monday morning.

New York Mayor Zohran Mamdani said five people were found dead outside over the weekend in freezing temperatures. While he did not confirm the deaths were weather-related, he told reporters "there is no more powerful reminder of the danger of extreme cold".

In Texas , authorities confirmed three deaths, including a 16-year-old girl killed in a sledding accident.

Two people died in Louisiana from hypothermia, the southern state's health department said.

The PowerOutage.com tracking site showed more than 840,000 customers without electricity as of Sunday night, mostly in the US South where the storm intensified Saturday.

In Tennessee, where a band of ice has downed power lines, more than 300,000 residential and commercial customers were without electricity, while Louisiana, Mississippi and Georgia – where such storms are less common – each had over 100,000 outages.

The outages are particularly dangerous as the South is being walloped by treacherous cold that the NWS warns could set records.

Authorities from Texas to North Carolina and New York urged residents to stay home due to the perilous conditions.

"Stay off the roads unless absolutely necessary," Texas's Emergency Management Division posted on X.

The storm was moving Sunday into the northeast, dumping snow and sleet on heavily populated cities including Philadelphia, New York and Boston.

At least 20 states and the US capital Washington have declared states of emergency.

Residents in the capital Washington awoke to a blanket of several inches of snow on sidewalks and roads, followed by heavy sleet.

Federal offices have been preemptively closed for Monday.

Several major airports in Washington, Philadelphia and New York had nearly all flights cancelled for the day.

Tracking site Flightaware.com showed more than 19,000 flights into and out of the country had been scrapped since Saturday.

President Donald Trump , who was riding out the storm at the White House , said on his Truth Social platform Saturday: "We will continue to monitor, and stay in touch with all States in the path of this storm. Stay Safe, and Stay Warm!"

The brutal storm system is the result of a stretched polar vortex, an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes morphs into a more oval shape, sending cold air spilling across North America.

Scientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions may be linked to climate change, though the debate is not settled and natural variability plays a role.

But Trump – who scoffs at climate change science and has rolled back green energy policies – questioned how the cold front fit into broader climatic shifts.

"WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GLOBAL WARMING???" the Republican leader posted.

The NWS warned that heavy ice could cause "long-duration power outages, extensive tree damage, and extremely dangerous or impassable travel conditions", including in many states less accustomed to intense winter weather.

Authorities warned of life-threatening cold that could last a week post-storm, especially in the Northern Plains and Upper Midwest, where wind chill lows were forecast to dip to extremes under -50F (-45C).

Such temperatures can cause frostbite within minutes.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 07:54:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/54183a5a-fa80-11f0-b39c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/54398d430caa0351966b436bbd448516e3d0b299.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Kremlin sticks to demand that Ukraine cede all of Donbas in talks, TASS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kremlin-sticks-demand-that-ukraine-cede-all-donbas-talks-tass-reports-2026-01-26/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Monday that the issue of territory remained

fundamental to Russia when it came to getting a deal to end the fighting in Ukraine, the state TASS news agency reported after trilateral weekend talks in Abu Dhabi.

President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly said that Russia will take all of Ukraine's Donbas region - of which Moscow's forces currently control 90% - by force unless Kyiv gives it up in a peace deal.

"It's no secret that this is our consistent position, the position of our president, that the territorial issue, which is part of the Anchorage formula, is of fundamental importance to the Russian side," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the TASS state news agency.

The "Anchorage formula" refers to what Russia says was agreed between U.S. President Donald Trump and Putin at a summit in Alaska last August, according to a source close to the Kremlin.

That purported agreement, according to the same source, envisages Ukraine handing Russia control of all of Donbas and freezing the front lines elsewhere in Ukraine's east and south as a condition of any future peace deal.

Kyiv has repeatedly said that it will not gift Russia territory which Moscow has failed to win on the battlefield.

State news agency RIA cited Peskov as saying that Moscow positively assessed what he called the "constructive talks" with Ukraine in Abu Dhabi.

The talks, brokered by the United States, ended without a deal, but with more talks are expected next weekend.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:34:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHA4EYDYS5JJPMSIGKKVZKSLSU.jpg?auth=f8efab9f94331a25943ce180cdc3b9ee3565be343adf418f48b58580092617d0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Sudan orders UN personnel, civilians to leave parts of Jonglei State</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/south-sudan-orders-un-personnel-civilians-leave-parts-jonglei-state-2026-01-26/</link><description>JUBA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - South Sudan's military has ordered all civilians and personnel from the UN mission and all other charities to evacuate three counties in Jonglei State ahead of an operation there against opposition forces.

Clashes that the United Nations says are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017 have been convulsing South Sudan, Africa's youngest country, for months.

Some of the fiercest fighting has taken place in Jonglei, located in the country's east on the border with Ethiopia, where the South Sudan People's Defence Forces (SSPDF) is seeking to halt an offensive by fighters loyal to Sudan People's Liberation Army-in-Opposition (SPLA-IO).

An operation code-named "operation enduring peace" was "imminent," the SSPDF said in a statement on Sunday.

The military said all civilians living in Nyirol, Uror and Akobo counties in Jonglei were "directed to immediately evacuate for safety to government-controlled areas as soon as possible."

All personnel from the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and those working for non-governmental organisations were also ordered to evacuate the three counties within 48 hours.

"Our peacekeepers in Akobo remain in place, carrying out all efforts under our mandate to help de-escalate tensions and prevent conflict," a UNMISS spokesperson told Reuters. She did not say whether UN staff also remained in the other counties.

Last week SPLA-IO called on its forces to march on South Sudan's capital Juba, signalling a major escalation.

Earlier this month SPLA-IO forces seized the town of Pajut in heavy fighting in the north of Jonglei and the town's capture was seen as putting the state capital of Bor at risk.

In a statement on Sunday UNMISS said 180,000 people in the state had already been displaced by the conflict and urged South Sudan's leaders "to put the interests of their people first by stopping the fighting."

Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said in a statement on Sunday it had evacuated key staff from Akobo county after "clear instruction from the relevant authorities, and in response to the deteriorating security situation in the area."

SPLA-IO forces led by South Sudan's vice president Riek Machar battled the military in the 2013-18 civil war, which was fought along largely ethnic lines and killed about 400,000 people.

A peace deal in 2018 quieted the conflict, although localised clashes have persisted.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 08:34:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gold prices hit record high as investors seek safe bet amid geopolitical turmoil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/economy/20260126-gold-prices-hit-record-high-as-investors-seek-safe-bet-amid-geopolitical-turmoil</link><description>Gold surged to a record high above $5,100 an ⁠ounce on Monday, extending a historic rally as investors piled into the safe-haven asset amid rising geopolitical uncertainties .

Spot gold were up 2.2 percent at $5,089.78 per ounce by 0656 GMT, after earlier touching an all-time high of $5,110.50. US gold futures for February delivery also gained ​the same amount to $5,086.30 per ounce.

The metal soared 64 percent in 2025, its biggest annual gain since 1979, driven by ‍safe-haven demand, US monetary policy easing, robust central bank purchases including China 's fourteenth straight month of buying in December, and record inflows into exchange-traded funds.

Prices have set consecutive record peaks ​over the past week and have already risen more than 18 percent this year.

The latest catalyst "is effectively ​this crisis of confidence in the US administration and US assets, that was set off by some of the erratic decision-making from the Trump administration last week", said Kyle Rodda, a senior market analyst at Capital.com.

"We expect further upside (for gold). Our current forecast suggests that prices will peak at around $5,500 later this year," said Philip Newman, director at Metals Focus.

"Periodic pullbacks are likely as investors take profits, but we expect each correction to be short-lived and met with strong buying interest," Newman added.

China experts said Xi’s move against his long-term ally and Politburo member Gen. Zhang Youxia also concentrates even more power in the president's hands, makes the already secretive command of China’s military more opaque, and suggests that a near-term attack on Taiwan is less likely.

"Zhang's removal means that truly nobody in the leadership is safe now,” said Jonathan Czin of the Washington-based Brookings Institution, who called the investigation “astonishing”.

Czin, who spent years as a top China analyst for the Central Intelligence Agency and, in 2021-2023, served as the director for China at the United States National Security Council, added that the probe marked a “profound shift” in Chinese politics.

The change is remarkable as past purges targeted people who may have had some overlap with Xi but lacked strong personal ties. This time around, the purge has crossed into what Czin has described as the " asteroid belt , opens new tab " of Xi's political solar system.

Both Xi and Zhang are princelings, children of former senior officers. The 75-year-old general was initially expected to retire in 2022, but Xi kept him on the Central Military Commission (CMC), the Chinese military's top leadership body, for a third term, underscoring their closeness.

The defence ministry announced a probe on Saturday into Zhang - second-in-command under Xi as senior vice-chairman of the CMC - “for suspected serious violations of discipline and law”.

The military was one of the main targets of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi after coming to power in 2012. The purges reached its elite Rocket Force, which oversees nuclear weapons as well as conventional missiles, in 2023. Two former defence ministers were also purged from the ruling Communist Party in recent years for corruption.

“I think corruption concerns are probably real, though those are typically more a pretext to remove someone in Chinese politics," said Czin, citing how deeply entrenched graft was before Xi's campaign.

Another senior member, Liu Zhenli, chief of staff of the CMC's Joint Staff Department, was also placed under investigation, effectively shrinking the seven-member body into two, with Xi at the top.

"Xi has eviscerated the People's Liberation Army (PLA) top brass like no leader before him," said Neil Thomas, a fellow at the Asia Society.

In a front-page editorial on Sunday, the PLA Daily described the probe as a major achievement, adding that the two generals had "seriously undermined and violated" the Chairman Responsibility System.

Under the system, Xi, as the CMC chairman, is vested with the "supreme military decision-making." It also serves as the "institutional arrangement for practising the party's absolute leadership over the army," according to China's government , opens new tab .

“To invoke violating the Chairman Responsibility System suggests Zhang had too much power outside of Xi himself,” said Lyle Morris, a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis.

The PLA Daily article did not offer further details and did not provide any evidence of a power struggle. While some analysts say it suggests disloyalty, others are sceptical Zhang posed a threat to Xi's power.

“For Xi to undertake such a dramatic move suggests two things: Xi has the full support of the Chinese Communist Party, and Xi is confident in his consolidation of power over the military,” Morris said.

Zhang has in the past overseen the PLA’s procurement department which has become the target of a broad corruption crackdown ordered by Xi, but he himself has until now been spared.

James Char, a scholar at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore, said that by placing Zhang under the probe, "Xi has also responded to criticisms that his PLA anti-corruption campaign has been a selective process - that his fellow princeling gets a free pass."

"Zhang had got off scot-free after his acolyte, Li Shangfu, got into trouble in the latter half of 2023,” added Char. Former defence minister Li was ousted for suspected corruption in military procurement.

But leaving the army leadership depleted and without replacements raises questions about how the world's largest military is run.

“It is honestly not clear how the chain of command should be functioning - especially since so many of the officers who would otherwise be eligible to replace the disposed members of the CMC have themselves been ousted,” Brookings’ Czin said.

Other analysts said they expect higher-level initiatives like expanding joint training to slow down until Xi can rebuild the commission.

“That could look like adding additional members, or it could involve building some sort of new apparatus around Xi as the central decision maker,” said Eric Hundman, director of research at BluePath Labs, a Washington-based security consultancy.

Asia Society's Thomas said Xi wanted to renew the military leadership and may be waiting until the Communist Party Congress next year to "thoroughly vet suitable candidates for vacancies on the CMC.”

Until then, the military will continue to push for Xi’s ambitious modernization goals, analysts said.

While China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly muscular line in regional maritime disputes, as well as over the self-ruled Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Beijing staged the largest war games to date around Taiwan late last year.

With U.S. President Donald Trump's attention elsewhere, and Taiwan scheduled for an election in 2028, Xi has time to "clean house," analysts said.

“Gutting the PLA high command suggests that Xi is not contemplating a major military escalation against Taiwan in the near term. But his crackdown is designed to elevate a cadre of more competent and loyal generals who will pose more of a threat in the future,” Thomas said.

“Xi is a man on a mission,” he added. “He will do whatever it takes to ensure the Party and its military are politically loyal and ideologically committed.”</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:29:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E5SXHVYSAZK5HBSIUT4UETO55Y.jpg?auth=49e9f03fcb0a818bf53e5ac0587f24992b2e6b7290d5ec3e2ac040a00862f117&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Americans hunker down, help each other under blizzard and brutal cold</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/americans-hunker-down-help-each-other-under-blizzard-brutal-cold-2026-01-26/</link><description>WASHINGTON/TULSA, Oklahoma Jan 26 (Reuters) - Tens of millions of Americans hunkered down on Monday or ventured out to help neighbors under bitter cold, blizzards of snow and lashings of freezing rain from a huge winter storm that paralyzed the eastern United States.

From New York and Massachusetts in the northeast to Texas and North Carolina in the south, roads were frozen slick with ice and buried under often more than a foot of snow.

In some southern states, residents faced winter conditions unseen in those areas for decades, with inch-thick ice coating branches, bringing down trees and power lines.

Flights were canceled, schools were shut and volunteers staffed emergency shelters to provide warmth for the needy and homeless.

"I just saw a need for getting people out of the cold," said Ryan DuVal, who owns a vintage firetruck and was driving it through the frozen streets of Tulsa, Oklahoma, looking for people who needed help.

"You know, just cruise the streets, see someone, offer a ride. If they take it, great. If not, I can at least warm them up in the truck and just get them a water, meal, something. And it's just giving back to the community like everybody should do."

Winter storm warnings covered 118 million people. An estimated 157 million were warned to bundle up against cold, ranging from sub-zero Fahrenheit temperatures (-18 Celsius) along the Canadian border to below freezing as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.

While the storm system was expected to drift away from the East Coast into the Atlantic on Monday, more Arctic air was forecast to rush in behind it, prolonging bitter cold, icy conditions over the next few days, the National Weather Service said.

Its Monday morning forecast predicted more heavy snow in the northeast, with snow also in the Appalachians and rain, some of it freezing, in the mid-Atlantic and along the southeast coast.

New York Governor Kathy Hochul said she had mobilized National Guard troops in New York City, Long Island and the Hudson Valley to assist with the state's emergency storm response.

Announcing that schools would be shut for a remote school day, New York City's Mayor Zohran Mamdani quipped: "I know that this may disappoint some students, so if you do see me, feel free to throw a snowball at me."

The onslaught of snow, ice and winds hit air travel especially hard, with major carriers forced to cancel more than 11,000 U.S. flights scheduled for Sunday, according to an industry tracking service FlightAware.com. More cancellations and delays were expected on Monday, though not quite as severe.

More than 820,000 electricity customers were without power as of 4 a.m. EST (0900 GMT) on Monday across a swathe of southern states from Texas to Virginia, according to PowerOutage.us. Worst-hit was Tennessee, accounting for nearly a third of the outages.

Calling the storm "historic," President Donald Trump on Saturday approved federal emergency disaster declarations for a dozen states, mostly in the mid-South.

Still, despite the emergency and the danger, the winter conditions were fun for many, including in Washington DC, where a huge crowd gathered for a raucous impromptu snowball fight in Meridian Hill Park, one man wearing an astronaut space suit.

Families brought sleds to Capitol Hill, where children zoomed down the steep slope below the white-domed seat of the U.S. Congress.

"It's beautiful. It's so fun to go down Capitol Hill. It was great powder this morning. Getting a little sleety now but we're having a great time!" said a man who pushed his daughter down the hill on a purple plastic sled.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:29:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NHNRXJ7DLNONJG5VOW6BLQSB6A.jpg?auth=9075c04d758bf05050d6798231e62888bc9cb43a61aa040f68f7de53c9b4c804&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German defence minister urges Trump to apologise for Afghanistan remarks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/german-defence-minister-urges-trump-apologise-afghanistan-remarks-2026-01-26/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 26 (Reuters) - German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to apologise for remarks suggesting that America's NATO allies in Afghanistan avoided frontline service, joining a chorus of criticism from European politicians and army veterans.

Trump caused deep offence among U.S. allies when he told Fox Business Network last week that the U.S. had "never needed" the transatlantic alliance and accused allies of staying "a little off the front lines" in Afghanistan.

"It's just not right and it's disrespectful to talk about the dead of your allies in that way. They all stood there, at the side of the United States. To claim something else today is simply not true," he told a talk show on Germany's ARD public broadcaster late on Sunday.

Thousands of German troops took part in NATO's Operation Enduring Freedom and Resolute Support missions in Afghanistan and 59 were killed. The operations were launched following the al Qaeda attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.

Pistorius said he would bring up the issue the next time he spoke with U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and he urged Trump to apologise.

"That would be a sign of decency, respect and also insight," he said.

His comments follow similar statements from other European politicians including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who called Trump's remarks "frankly appalling" , in a departure from his usual avoidance of direct criticism of the U.S. president.

Trump on Saturday praised "brave" British soldiers , though he made no apology for his earlier comments and he did not mention the sacrifices of other NATO allies. Britain lost 457 service personnel in Afghanistan.

Trump administration officials have been critical of European countries for failing to meet NATO spending targets and for being too dependent on the U.S. for their own defence.

Pistorius, who has been leading a drive to rebuild Germany's armed forces, said Europe had to accept it could not depend on the U.S. as it had over the past 70 years but that the German military was on an "excellent path" to achieving its goals of being back up to strength by 2029.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:30:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SILNKLFFFNL5FNJ5WQ3LEKCKGQ.jpg?auth=5961d59309ff86940ae6e64258b97432caf420507b868fa0f351e1abfd805b90&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Live: Ukraine must cede Donbas as 'fundamental' condition of peace talks, Moscow says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260126-live-ukraine-must-cede-donbas-as-fundamental-condition-of-peace-talks-moscow-says</link><description>Ukraine’s ​military struck ⁠the Slavyansk Eko oil refinery in Russia's Krasnodar ​region overnight, ‍it has said ​in a statement on ​the Telegram app.

"Strike drones were recorded hitting the plant's ‍territory and explosions were ​heard in the target area. According to preliminary ‌information, elements of ‍the primary oil processing facility were hit," the statement said.

European ‍Union countries on Monday ​gave their final approval to the bloc's plan ⁠to ban Russian gas imports by late 2027, allowing it to pass into law.

Under the agreement, the EU will halt Russian ‌liquefied natural gas imports by the end of 2026 and pipeline gas by 30 September ‍2027, legalising ​EU's vow to cut ties with its former ‍top gas supplier, nearly four years after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion ​of Ukraine.

Ministers from EU countries approved the law ​at a meeting in Brussels on Monday, although Slovakia and Hungary voted against.

Hungary and Slovakia remain heavily reliant on ​Russian energy imports and want to maintain close ties with Moscow. Hungary said it would take the case to the European Court of Justice.

The ​Kremlin has said that the issue of territory remains fundamental to ⁠Russia when it comes to getting a deal to end the fighting in Ukraine, the state TASS news agency reported after trilateral weekend ​talks in Abu Dhabi.

President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly ‍said that Russia will take all of Ukraine's Donbas region – of which Moscow's forces ​currently control 90% – by force unless Kyiv gives it ​up in a peace deal.

"It's no secret that this is our consistent position, the position of our president, that the territorial issue, which is part of the Anchorage formula, is of fundamental importance to the Russian side," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the TASS state news ‍agency.

The "Anchorage formula" refers to what Russia says was agreed between US President Donald ​Trump and Putin at a summit in Alaska last August, according to a source close to the Kremlin.

That purported agreement, according to ‌the same source, envisages Ukraine handing Russia control of all of Donbas and freezing the front lines elsewhere ‍in Ukraine's east and south as a condition of any future peace deal.

The Kremlin has said the US-brokered trilateral talks in the UAE between Russian and Ukrainian negotiators had been held in a "constructive spirit" but that there was still "significant work ahead".

"It would be a mistake to expect any significant results from the initial contacts... But the very fact that these contacts have begun in a constructive spirit can be viewed positively. However, there is significant work ahead," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.

The ​Kremlin has said that the territorial issue remains ​of ‍fundamental importance ​to Russia in peace ​talks with the United States and Ukraine, Russian state media reported.

State ‍news agency ​RIA cited Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peksov as ‌saying that Moscow positively ‍assesses what he called "constructive talks" on Ukraine.

‍Two enterprises ​caught fire and ⁠one person was injured in the city of Slavyansk-on-Kuban ​in Russia's Krasnodar ‍region after drone ​fragments fell on them, the regional ​emergencies centre have said.

The centre did not specify what enterprises were affected. The city hosts ‍a private refinery with ​a capacity of around 100,000 barrels per day, supplying ‌fuel for both domestic use and ‍export.

Russia's defence ministry said air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed 40 Ukrainian drones overnight, including ‍34 in the Krasnodar ‌region.

North ‍Korean leader ​Kim Jong Un on Sunday ⁠viewed sculptures to be displayed at a memorial for North Korean troops who ​died fighting overseas, state media KCNA ‍said on Monday.

Under a mutual defence pact with Russia, ​in 2024 North Korea sent some 14,000 soldiers to ​fight alongside Russian troops in Ukraine, where more than 6,000 of them were killed, according to South Korean, Ukrainian and Western sources.

Visiting the Mansudae Art Studio, Kim said the sculptures would "convey forever the legendary feats... of ‍admirable sons of the DPRK", according to KCNA, using North ​Korea's official name, Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that a US security guarantees document for Ukraine is “100% ready” after two days of talks involving representatives from Ukraine, the US and Russia.

Speaking to journalists in Vilnius during a visit to Lithuania, Zelensky said Ukraine is waiting for its partners to set a signing date, after which the document would go to the US Congress and Ukrainian parliament for ratification.

Zelensky also emphasized Ukraine’s push for European Union membership by 2027, calling it an “economic security guarantee.”

The Ukrainian leader described the talks in Abu Dhabi, the capital of the United Arab Emirates, as likely the first trilateral format in “quite a long while” that included not only diplomats but military representatives from all three sides. The talks, which began on Friday and continued Saturday, were the latest aiming to end Russia’s nearly four-year full-scale invasion.

Zelensky acknowledged fundamental differences between Ukrainian and Russian positions, reaffirming territorial issues as a major sticking point.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:31:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2f7e1a50-fa9b-11f0-9a35-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/000-36WK4AN.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Paris appeals trial begins for four involved in murder of French teacher Samuel Paty</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260126-paris-appeals-trial-begins-four-islamists-involved-murder-french-teacher-samuel-paty</link><description>Paty , a history and geography teacher, was beheaded on October 16, 2020 near the Bois d'Aulne school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, northwest Paris , by a Chechen Islamist, Abdoullakh Anzorov, who was shot dead by the police shortly after the crime.

During the initial trial, the eight defendants, seven men and one woman, were all found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to 16 years.

Four of them are being retried by the special Court of Appeal in Paris.

Prior to his murder, Paty had been the subject of an online campaign of intimidation and hatred based on a lie told by a 13-year-old student, accusing him of discriminating against Muslim students during a lesson on freedom of expression in which he had shown a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed .

In reality, she had not been present in the class.

Her lie was widely shared on social media by her father, Brahim Chnina, and Islamist preacher Abdelhakim Sefrioui, who were sentenced to 13- and 15-years’ imprisonment respectively for criminal association with a terrorist enterprise.

Both are appealing the sentence along with two friends of Anzorov, Naïm Boudaoud and Azim Epsirkhanov, were sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment for complicity in murder.

Over 3,600 flights were canceled and 714 were delayed as of early Monday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware, following more than 11,000 cancellations reported on Sunday.

The number of cancellations and delays was expected to rise as the day progressed.

Low pressure south of New England is expected to move east over the Atlantic on Monday, bringing heavy snow to parts of the Northeast and freezing rain across sections of the Mid-Atlantic, the U.S. National Weather Service said.

Snow is also expected along the Appalachian region, while rain will spread along the Southeast coast as a cold front moves offshore, the agency said.

American Airlines (AAL.O) , opens new tab accounted for the largest share of disruptions on Monday, with nearly 570 flights canceled and about 57 delayed, followed by Republic Airways, JetBlue Airways (JBLU.O) , opens new tab and Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) , opens new tab .

Boston's Logan International Airport, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport and New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport were among the hardest hit.

Major U.S. carriers rolled out sweeping travel waivers and flexible re-booking options to assist passengers whose travel plans were disrupted by the cancellations.

Airline operations are highly interconnected, meaning cancellations can leave aircraft and crews out of position, complicating efforts to restore normal flight schedules.

The storm also impeded road travel. The Federal Emergency Management Agency warned that driving conditions could become dangerous as blizzard-like conditions, strong winds and ice spread further.

Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of customers across several U.S. states, from Tennessee to the Carolinas, reported power outages, with Tennessee reporting the highest number of cases.

More than 820,000 customers were without electricity as of early hours on Monday, according to data from PowerOutage.us.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:56:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VVQECZMNEVMOVOPKHO4JLKOT6A.jpg?auth=6fa5ebf1f952c28e5b06bc170ea32f02a0081adc4a4aac4a09574f491ba63e0e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ethiopia declares end of Marburg outbreak that killed nine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/ethiopia-declares-end-marburg-outbreak-that-killed-nine-2026-01-26/</link><description>ADDIS ABABA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Ethiopia has declared the end of an outbreak of Marburg virus, the World Health Organization said on Monday, after the disease killed at least nine people.

Jakarta, France's main arms client in Southeast Asia, has placed orders for as many as 42 Rafales, built by Dassault Aviation (AM.PA) , opens new tab , as well as French frigates and submarines, as the archipelago steps up defence spending under President Prabowo Subianto, a former special forces commander.

"The aircraft have been handed over and are ready for use by the Indonesian Air Force,” Defence Ministry spokesperson Rico Ricardo Sirait said in a message in response to a Reuters query - the first confirmation that Indonesia has possession of the advanced military aircraft after striking an $8 billion deal with France in 2022 and expanding it last year.

Sirait said the three aircraft arrived on Friday and were stationed at Roesmin Nurjadin Air Base in Pekanbaru, located on the western island of Sumatra.

Three more jets are expected to arrive later this year, he added.

Indonesia has been one of the biggest players on the international fighter jet market as it looks to upgrade its aircraft, setting aside big budgets for defence spending.

It has been considering a number of options alongside the Rafales, including China's J-10 fighter jets and U.S.-made F-15EX jets. For the longer term, it has also signed a contract to buy 48 KAAN fighter jets from Turkey , a fifth-generation aircraft powered by General Electric F-110 engines that are also used in fourth-generation Lockheed Martin F-16 jets.

Reuters also reported that Indonesia and Pakistan discussed a potential deal earlier this month for Jakarta to buy combat jets and killer drones.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 10:57:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/F5DMKR7MFVJ4DC4INQX2W7CM6Q.jpg?auth=d5308b05f3cfd873cf11949308bea57a8e4fbe1cc18065dba69004ff33c3d2be&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU launches probe of Musk's Grok AI chatbot over sexualised images</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260126-eu-launches-probe-of-musk-grok-ai-chatbot-over-sexualised-images</link><description>The European ​Commission has launched an ⁠investigation into Elon Musk 's AI chatbot Grok over the production ​of explicit ‍imagery , Regina Doherty, a ​member of the European parliament ​representing Ireland , said in a statement on Monday.

Carney is making all-out efforts to diversify Canada's alliances beyond the U.S. , its top ‌trade partner. In Davos last week, he earned a rare standing ovation for saying the old rules-based order is over and called on middle powers like Canada to build coalitions to shape a fairer, more resilient world.

His viral speech followed an agreement with China to slash tariffs on electric vehicles and canola and open up to C$7 billion ($5.11 billion) in export markets as he tries to double non-U.S. exports over the next decade.

Carney is also resetting relations with India after his predecessor Justin Trudeau accused the Indian government of involvement in the killing of a Sikh separatist leader in 2023. India has denied those claims.

Prime ‌Minister Narendra Modi attended the Group of 7 summit on Carney's invitation last year and several of Carney's ministers have traveled to India.

"I have ​a feeling in the first week of March is what we are looking at," said High Commissioner Patnaik on Carney's visit during a weekend interview.

Carney's office declined to comment. Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said on Sunday Carney would visit Australia in March to address parliament.

Canada's Energy Minister Tim Hodgson is visiting India this week and said the timing of Carney's trip was not yet set.

“There ‍are plans for the Prime Minister to visit at some point this year, it will depend on the progress we make,” Hodgson said in a Sunday interview.

Formal negotiations for a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India should also start in March, Patnaik said. The countries agreed to restart stalled trade talks in November.

Carney will sign smaller agreements with the Indian government on nuclear energy, oil and gas, the environment, AI and quantum computing as well as deals ⁠on education and culture during his visit, Patnaik said.

A 10-year C$2.8 billion uranium supply deal is likely to be included, he added.

Hodgson did not confirm the deal, but said Canada is happy ‍to sell uranium under the Canada-India nuclear cooperation agreement as long as India is prepared to abide by International Energy Agency safeguards.

"We know that India is a major nuclear country and it has major plans ‌to grow ‌its civilian use of nuclear energy," Hodgson said. "So that would be one of the topics I expect that we will discuss with my counterpart."

Between Hodgson's visit and Carney's, both countries will be announcing agreements around energy and mining, Patnaik said, adding that a pact on critical minerals and crude and LNG transactions will be the most prominent ones.

“We need to focus on economies that are large and growing. India squarely falls into that category. India is a growing user of critical minerals that Canada can supply," Hodgson said.

Both countries are moving with a sense of urgency after ⁠two years of stalled talks, and a ⁠renewed impetus to move fast to make ​sure countries hit by U.S. tariffs forge their own path, Patnaik said.

"Now we are living in a world where the natural rules-based order which gave a certainty to the world is not functioning," he said, referring to Carney's speech at Davos.

"(We) should work together to have an agreement that protects us from the vagaries of the international order," he added.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened 100% tariffs on Canada if it signed ‍a deal with China.

Carney responded that Canada respects its commitments under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to not pursue free trade agreements with non market economies.

Patnaik said India is also seeking new agreements.

India and the EU are expected to announce on Tuesday the conclusion of for a free trade pact.

Within a year of starting formal negotiations with Canada, a CEPA pact could be signed, Patnaik added.

India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman are ​also likely to visit Canada very soon, he said.

Patnaik said that there is a court case ongoing in Canada ‍on four people accused of the murder of Sikh separatist leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. If evidence comes out that there were Indians involved, India will take action, he said.

He said India's National Security Advisor will visit Ottawa next month ​as part of regular engagements between the two countries to exchange intelligence and discuss security measures.

The call was the first between the two leaders since To Lam was unanimously reappointed as head of Vietnam's ruling Communist Party for the next five years last Friday.

Xi, in a congratulatory message to Lam, described the two nations as a "community with a shared future" and said Beijing was willing to strengthen communications with Hanoi.

"China and Vietnam should stay the course and remain unwavering in their aspirations, working together to advance development," Chinese state broadcaster CCTV quoted Xi as saying.

The two communist-ruled states have a long history of mistrust and territorial disputes, including over South China Sea boundaries, although their Communist parties have remained officially close.

Xi urged Lam to "jointly oppose hegemonism and bloc confrontation", state media reported, although he did not mention any particular country.

China and the U.S. reached a one-year tariff truce following talks between Xi and President Donald Trump in South Korea last October, although the average U.S. duties on Chinese exports still stands at 47.5%.

Vietnam has in recent years deepened engagement with Washington. Last year it pledged to cut tariffs on several U.S. products and moved to approve Starlink services, part of efforts to stave off U.S. levies due to its large bilateral trade surplus.

Trump's administration has accused Vietnam of serving as a transshipment point for Chinese goods.

In Monday's call, Xi said the two sides must "strengthen confidence, uphold fundamental principles while advancing innovation, and guard against and defuse various risks and challenges".</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:50:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WZWKWGUIURKYXIEB26B32GCANI.jpg?auth=ceac5ac731dafba309cbfa548a8e2ec8daa44ad6c684d54b8675f3a51b832ab9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China warns citizens against Japan visits during longest annual holiday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/chinese-airlines-extend-free-cancellations-japan-related-flights-october-2026-01-26/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 26 (Reuters) - China on Monday warned its citizens against travelling to Japan during the Lunar New Year, its longest public holiday, as Beijing's anger over a comment Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made in early November about democratically governed Taiwan showed no signs of abating.

Citing "a surge in crimes targeting Chinese citizens" and earthquakes, the Chinese foreign ministry said nationals "face serious security threats in Japan," according to a statement it released.

Beijing has issued similar warnings following Takaichi's remark in November suggesting that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could trigger a military response from Tokyo.

The remark infuriated Beijing, which has responded with export curbs , flight cancellations, and vitriolic state media commentaries . Its defence ministry warned Tokyo of a "crushing" military defeat if it were to use force to intervene over Taiwan.

Major Chinese airlines including Air China (601111.SS) , opens new tab , China Eastern (600115.SS) , opens new tab and China Southern Airlines (600029.SS) , opens new tab , on Monday extended their free-of-charge change and cancellation policies for Japan-related flights until October 24. The airlines first announced the policies in November in the wake of Takaichi's remark and then last month extended them until this March.

The number of Chinese tourists to Japan plunged 45% in December, but overall tourist numbers to Japan hit a record high, Japan's tourism minister said last week.

While Takaichi has not retracted her November remark, she has tempered it by reaffirming Japan's position on China's "One China policy". She has also said that China’s characterisation of her remarks are inconsistent with facts.

At a January 19 press conference to announce a snap election, Takaichi observed that: "China has conducted military exercises around Taiwan, and economic coercion is increasingly being used through control of key supply-chain materials." She added that: "The international security environment is becoming more severe."

While warning its nationals to shun trips to Japan, Beijing has been upbeat about a "tourism boom" with another of its eastern Asian neighbours - South Korea - as it seeks to shore up ties with Seoul following the rupture with Tokyo.

Buoyed by visa-free policies, the numbers of South Korean tourists to China and Chinese visitors to South Korea have been on the rise.

"This two-way tourism boom is a microcosm of the growing economic exchanges and cooperation between China and South Korea," state-run tabloid Global Times said in a editorial published on Sunday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:50:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/UZU72BCHIFL5HKRIW4NNTRLLMM.jpg?auth=6cb355494104410ee97bf4424d5b50d6b522f709bd121d52ac6972a4b93c807a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Czechs fundraise over $6 mln to buy generators for freezing Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/czechs-fundraise-over-6-mln-buy-generators-freezing-ukraine-2026-01-26/</link><description>PRAGUE, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Czechs have collected more than $6 million in just five days in a grassroots fundraising effort to buy generators, heaters and batteries for Ukraine, where hundreds of thousands are freezing in subzero temperatures after Russian attacks on power plants.

Ukrainian engineers have been working around the clock in hazardous conditions for weeks since Russia escalated its attacks on Ukraine's grid during a cold snap that has seen temperatures plunge to minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 F).

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy declared an energy emergency after the Russian strikes.

The European Commission said on Friday it would send 447 emergency generators worth 3.7 million euros ($4.39 million).

The darekproputina.cz initiative has been collecting donations for Ukraine since Russia's full invasion in 2022 , including campaigns to buy a Blackhawk helicopter and a tank as well as drones, ammunition and medical supplies worth more than 55 million euros.

Its latest effort raised 126 million crowns ($6.16 million) from 74,745 donors from last Wednesday until Monday morning, and another roughly 15 million crowns is on the way from donors, organiser Martin Ondracek told Reuters.

"Over the weekend we booked two generators - the diesel-fuelled boxes that come on a truck - for 8 million crowns each that should go to two smaller health facilities," Ondracek said.

The initiative cooperated with three funds in Ukraine to avoid lengthy logistical and customs delays but is also in talks with Czech suppliers as not everything is available on the spot, he added.

"There are about 30 people working on this, we need to spend the money as fast as possible," Ondracek said, adding there was a particular demand for chemical heaters and batteries.

"Batteries are key for people to charge when power is available so they have at least some power for a kettle or charging phones."

A police statement said a multi-agency security team was pursuing the attackers, and the area had been secured as operations continued.

"We urge the public to remain calm and vigilant, and to cooperate with the security agencies," the statement added.

Al Shabaab, which controls large swathes of southern and central Somalia, frequently carries out cross-border attacks on Kenyan military and civilian targets. Security analysts say the assaults are aimed at pressuring Kenya into withdrawing its troops from peacekeeping missions in Somalia.

In June 2023, seven people were killed in two separate incidents in the same region. Police said at the time they suspected members of al Shabaab were responsible for one of the attacks.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 12:50:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Finland hopes to prevent cable damage with new surveillance centre</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/finland-teams-up-with-eu-baltic-sea-states-enhance-undersea-infrastructure-2026-01-26/</link><description>HELSINKI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Finland's Border Guard hopes to prevent damage to critical undersea infrastructure in the Gulf of Finland with a maritime surveillance centre it plans to set up in cooperation with other Baltic Sea states and the EU Commission, it said on Monday.

The Baltic Sea region has been on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The most recent incident occurred on New Year's Eve when Finnish authorities seized a cargo vessel en route from Russia to Israel on suspicion of sabotaging an undersea telecoms cable.

While NATO has boosted its military presence in the region with frigates, aircraft and naval drones, the Finnish surveillance centre is part of a joint action plan that the European Commission proposed to enhance the security of submarine cables in February last year, the Border Guard said.

"We are developing, and we have the need for, broader preventive measures, even before any harm has occurred," Mikko Hirvi, Head of Maritime Safety and Security at the Finnish Border Guard, told Reuters.

The preventive measures include sensors in the seabed, artificial intelligence solutions for enhanced and real-time analysis of maritime traffic and exchanging information on vessels with allies, he added, declining to comment on which capabilities were already operational.

Hirvi said the surveillance centre would be built gradually, drawing on the Border Guard's existing capabilities, and that Finland planned also to seek EU funding for it.

After a Chinese container ship sailed on after damaging a gas pipeline and cables in the Baltic seabed in 2023, Finnish authorities have boarded and seized two vessels - the oil tanker Eagle S in December 2024 and the cargo vessel Fitburg in December 2025 - on suspicion that they had severed undersea cables by dragging their anchors.

By seizing the ships, authorities managed to prevent further damage from happening, Hirvi said.

Mikko Simola, commander of the Gulf of Finland Coast Guard District, said factors to be monitored included unusual deviations in vessels' speed or course.

"For the past year in particular, we have focused on obtaining real-time information about vessel deviations," he told Reuters.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:46:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VAJNB7TCHNOIJN5V623GD5YOIQ.jpg?auth=d717d42ac5ae7a75ec8fc85a27befb184d0cdd4d6016545fe3a5efc44a39095e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French senator on trial for allegedly drugging lawmaker to assault her</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-french-senator-trial-allegedly-drugging-lawmaker-assault-her-2026-01-26/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A former French senator went on trial on Monday accused of spiking a lawmaker's drink with ecstasy with the intention of sexually assaulting her.

Joel Guerriau, 68, who resigned as a senator over the case in October 2025, allegedly administered lawmaker Sandrine Josso with "a substance liable to alter her discernment or control over her actions, in order to commit rape or sexual aggression", a court document showed.

The centre-right politician also faces charges related to the possession and use of ecstasy, the document read. Guerriau has denied the charges against him.

The case has resonated in France following the 2024 conviction of Dominique Pelicot , who was found guilty of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, Gisele, and inviting dozens of strangers to assault her while she was unconscious.

The Pelicot trial attracted headlines worldwide and raised awareness about drug-facilitated assaults .

Josso told investigators she felt unwell after drinking a few sips from a glass of champagne offered to her by Guerriau at his apartment to celebrate an electoral win.

She told them the champagne did not taste normal and that if she had not managed to leave the flat she was certain Guerriau would have assaulted her, convinced he wanted to "satisfy an urge", according to the court document.

A toxicology test later revealed traces of ecstasy in her blood, and ecstasy was also found in Guerriau's apartment, the document stated.

If found guilty, he could face a jail sentence of up to five years and a fine of 75,000 euros ($88,950). His lawyer was not immediately available for comment.

The former senator's Horizons party, which is part of French President Emmanuel Macron's governing alliance, told French media following the accusations in November 2023 that Guerriau had been suspended with immediate effect.

The trial runs until Tuesday.

Parliament last year approved changes to France's rape law to include consent, bringing the legislation more into line with more than a dozen other European countries in a move that was given new impetus by the Pelicot mass rape trial.

Here are some reactions from governments and regulators in January:

The European Commission on January 26 opened an investigation into whether Grok disseminates illegal content such as manipulated sexualised images in the EU. The probe will examine whether X properly assessed and mitigated risks as required under the bloc's digital rules.

The Commission had on January 8 extended a retention order sent to X last year to retain and preserve all internal documents and data related to Grok until the end of 2026.

Britain's media regulator Ofcom has launched an investigation into X to determine whether sexually intimate deepfakes produced by Grok violated its duty to protect people in the UK from content that could be illegal, under the country's Online Safety Act framework.

In France, government ministers referred sexually explicit Grok-generated content circulating on X to prosecutors and alerted French media regulator Arcom to check the platform's compliance with EU rules.

Germany's media minister Wolfram Weimer also said EU rules provided tools to tackle illegal content and alleged the problem risked turning into the "industrialisation of sexual harassment".

Italy's data protection authority warned that using AI tools to create "undressed" deepfake imagery of real people without consent could amount to serious privacy violations and, in some cases, criminal offences.

Swedish political leaders have also condemned Grok-generated sexualised content after reporting that imagery involving Sweden's deputy prime minister was produced from a user prompt.

India's IT ministry sent X a formal notice on January 2 over alleged Grok-enabled creation or sharing of obscene sexualised images, directing the content to be taken down and requiring a report on the actions being taken within 72 hours.

Japan also probed X over Grok, stating that the government would consider every possible option to prevent the generation of inappropriate images.

Indonesia's communications and digital ministry said it had blocked access to Grok, a move digital minister Meutya Hafid said was meant to protect women and children from AI-generated fake pornographic content, citing Indonesia's strict anti‑pornography laws.

Malaysia restored access to Grok for its users after X implemented additional safety measures, its communications regulator said on January 23.

The Philippines will reinstate access to Grok after its developer pledged to remove image-manipulation tools that had sparked child-safety concerns, the country's cybercrime investigation unit said on January 21.

California's governor and attorney general said on January 14 they were demanding answers from xAI amid the spread of non-consensual sexual images on the platform.

Canada's privacy watchdog said it was widening an existing investigation into X after reports that Grok was generating non-consensual, sexually explicit deepfakes.

Brazil's government and federal prosecutors gave xAI 30 days to prevent the chatbot from spreading fake sexualised content, according to a joint statement on January 20.

Australia's online-safety regulator eSafety said on January 7 it was investigating Grok-generated "digitally undressed" sexualised deepfake images, assessing adult material under its image‑based abuse scheme and noting current child-related examples it had reviewed did not meet the legal threshold for child sexual abuse material under Australian law.

HOW HAS xAI RESPONDED?

xAI said on January 14 it had restricted image editing for Grok AI users and blocked users, based on their location, from generating images of people in revealing clothing in "jurisdictions where it's illegal". It did not identify the countries.

It had earlier limited the use of Grok's image generation and editing features only to paying subscribers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:47:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/YDM7ZFTLJJI5LHSR4QJR6TOHHY.jpg?auth=39c4516da4f7542d06b530b413e5dfb1bc77949b544c232b9c0c94ce5cd253de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ackman donates $10,000 to Minneapolis shooting victim Alex Pretti's family, WSJ reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ackman-donates-10000-minneapolis-shooting-victim-alex-prettis-family-wsj-reports-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Billionaire Bill Ackman donated $10,000 to a fundraiser for the family of Alex Pretti, who was fatally ​shot by immigration agents in Minneapolis over the ‌weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing a spokesman for Ackman.

The GoFundMe page that intended to support Pretti's "loved ones" raised over $1 million as of Monday morning and listed Ackman's ‌donation.

Ackman's Pershing Square declined a Reuters request for ​comment.

Pretti is the second American to be fatally shot by federal immigration officers this month in Minneapolis, ‍where Trump, a Republican, has deployed thousands of armed and masked agents in a deportation effort with little precedent.

Trump told the Wall Street Journal ⁠in an interview published on Sunday that his ‍administration was "reviewing everything and will come out with a determination" about ‌the ‌shooting, as officials in his administration defended it even as video evidence contradicted their version of events.

Ackman previously donated $10,000 to a GoFundMe for Jonathan Ross, the Immigration and Customs ⁠Enforcement officer who ⁠fatally shot ​Renee Good, the first Minneapolis shooting victim this month.

The billionaire, however, wrote at the time that he also aimed to support ‍Good's family, "but it was already closed as it had achieved its $1.5 million fundraising objective."

"I was simply continuing my longstanding commitment to ​assisting those accused of crimes of ‍providing for their defense," Ackman wrote earlier in January.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:47:40 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/GWTJYJMEZZJHHH67TWD6CYWMZE.jpg?auth=3ce38657ea711950932422770021af1808c5c1f037a019245eb2fa20d58c8ba6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French lawmakers to vote on social media ban for under-15s</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260126-french-lawmakers-to-vote-on-social-media-ban-under-15s</link><description>French lawmakers on Monday were set to vote on draft legislation to ban social media for under-15s , an effort championed by President Emmanuel Macron as a way to protect children from excessive screen time.

The legislation, which also provides for a ban on mobile phones in high schools, follows Australia banning social media for under-16s in December, a world first.

As social media has grown around the world, so has concern that too much screen time is arresting child development and contributing to declining mental health in minors.

"The emotions of our children and teenagers are not for sale or to be manipulated, either by American platforms or Chinese algorithms," Macron said in a video broadcast on Saturday.

The French bill proposed by centrist lawmakers will be examined from 4:00pm (1500 GMT) and, barring any surprises, is expected to be given the green light by the lower house, the National Assembly. The legislation would then go to the Senate upper house.

Authorities want to move quickly, with measures to be enforced from the start of the 2026 school year for new accounts.

Former Prime Minister Gabriel Attal , who leads lawmakers from Macron's Renaissance party in the lower house, said on Monday he hoped the bill would be passed by the Senate in mid-February.

"This means that in a month's time, it could be adopted and that on September 1, the ban will come into force for new accounts," he added.

He added that "social media platforms will then have until December 31 to deactivate existing accounts" that do not comply with the age limit.

In addition to combating the impact of screens and social media on the mental health of young adolescents, Attal stressed that the measure would help oppose "a number of powers that, through social media platforms, want to colonise minds".

"France can be a pioneer in Europe in a month: we can change the lives of our young people and our families, and perhaps also change the destiny of our country in terms of independence," he said.

France's public health watchdog ANSES said this month that social media such as TikTok , Snapchat and Instagram had numerous detrimental effects on adolescents – particularly girls – while not being the sole reason for their declining mental health.

The risks listed are numerous, including cyberbullying and exposure to violent content.

The legislation stipulates that "access to an online social networking service provided by an online platform is prohibited for minors under the age of 15".

The draft bill excludes online encyclopaedias and educational directories from the ban.

For the ban to become a reality, an effective age verification system will have to be put in place. Work on such a system is currently underway at the European level.

Macron has also backed a ban on pupils having mobile phones in high schools.

In 2018, France already banned children from using mobile phones in "colleges", the middle schools children attend between the ages of 11 and 15.

But former prime minister Elisabeth Borne expressed reservations about the measure on Monday.

"It's more complicated than that," she told broadcaster France 2.

"We first need to make sure that the ban is properly enforced in middle schools."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 13:48:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ea26c60-f2c5-11f0-8087-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/79748f2b2f9084e83220ff4614f89ed9963fcd4d.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain expels Nicaraguan ambassador in diplomatic tit-for-tat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-expels-nicaraguan-ambassador-diplomatic-tit-for-tat-2026-01-26/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Spain has ordered the expulsion of Nicaragua's ambassador and another Nicaraguan diplomat, the Foreign Ministry said on Monday, a day after Nicaragua expelled Spain's ambassador and his deputy from Managua.

Relations between the two countries have been strained for years over Madrid's recurring criticism of President Daniel Ortega's crackdown on opposition figures, civil society and independent media, as well as its backing for European Union sanctions tied to human rights and democratic backsliding.

The ministry said the move was strictly reciprocal and described Managua's decision to expel the Spanish diplomats as unjust.

"Spain will continue working to maintain the best possible relations with the brotherly people of Nicaragua," it added.

The spat follows earlier diplomatic frictions, including Spain recalling its ambassador to Nicaragua , opens new tab for consultations in 2021. Relations were later reset with new ambassadorial appointments in 2023.

The Spanish envoy in Managua, Sergio Farre, had been appointed to the posting only in December, according to the official state gazette. The Nicaraguan government has yet to provide an official explanation for the expulsions.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:29:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel retrieves remains of last Gaza hostage, military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-retrieves-remains-last-gaza-hostage-military-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Israel has retrieved the remains of the last remaining hostage held in Gaza, the military said on Monday, fulfilling a key condition of the initial phase of U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.

The remains of police officer Ran Gvili's have been identified and will be returned for burial, the military said in a statement.

Israel has said that it will reopen Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the enclave's main gateway to the world, once Gvili's remains are returned or the search operation for his body concludes.

Gvili had been held in Gaza since he was killed at Kibbutz Alumim during Hamas' attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

Hamas and Israel agreed to a ceasefire in October under pressure from regional powers and Trump, who called the deal a first step toward a "strong, durable and everlasting peace".</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:29:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/72HQQ4I4QROKXMCQHO72T4C5UE.jpg?auth=b48e78043716da4a5ca595039394d401b7c7e157a1ecf48f4fa70441d2c5e71c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russia withdrawing troops from airport in northeast Syria, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-withdrawing-troops-airport-northeast-syria-sources-say-2026-01-26/</link><description>QAMISHLI, Syria, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Russia is withdrawing forces from an airport in northeastern Syria, moving to end its military presence in a corner of the country where the Damascus government is trying to seize control from Kurdish forces, five Syrian sources said.

Russia has stationed forces at Qamishli airport in the northeast since 2019, a relatively small deployment compared to its air base and a naval facility on Syria's Mediterranean coast, both of which it is expected to maintain.

Government forces under President Ahmed al-Sharaa have taken swathes of northern and eastern Syria from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces this month, as Damascus aims to assert its authority over the entire country.

A fragile ceasefire between the sides was extended on Saturday for 15 days.

Two of the sources said Russian forces had begun a gradual withdrawal from Qamishli airport last week. Some of the forces were expected to move to in western Syria while others would return to Russia, one Russia's Hmeimim air base of the sources said.

Another Syrian security source on Syria's western coast said Russian military vehicles and heavy weaponry had been transported from Qamishli to the Hmeimim military airport over the last two days.

There was no immediate comment from Russia's defence ministry. Russian daily Kommersant reported last week, citing an unnamed Syrian source, that the Syrian government might ask Russian forces to leave the base once it had pushed the Kurds out because "there’s nothing for them (the Russians) to do there".

A Reuters journalist saw Russian flags still flying at Qamishli airport on Monday, where two planes bearing Russian markings were parked on the runway.

Russia, a close ally of Syria's ousted President Bashar al-Assad, has established ties with Sharaa since he seized power some 14 months ago.

Sharaa told Russian President Vladimir Putin last year he would honour all past deals struck between Damascus and Moscow, a pledge suggesting Moscow's two main military bases in Syria are safe.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:30:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/735I65KFZZOP5KAA7FGOOITYWE.jpg?auth=b957769356da39998d012fd05ab12400d765123ed4d3d048c84034cd28241048&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Islamic State‑linked militants kill 22 in eastern Congo, UN report says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/islamic-statelinked-militants-kill-22-eastern-congo-un-report-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>KINSHASA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Islamic State‑linked militants killed at least 22 civilians in a village in eastern Congo's Ituri Province early on Sunday, according to an internal U.N. report and local civil society leaders, the latest in a series of deadly attacks in the region.

The U.N. report seen by Reuters said the assailants struck Apakolu, about 25 km (15 miles) northwest of Eringeti in Ituri province’s Irumu territory, at around 0400 GMT on Sunday, and abducted an unknown number of people.

Christophe Munyanderu, head of the local rights group known by its French acronym CRDH, based in Irumu, said 25 civilians had been killed, including 15 men whose bodies were found inside a house and seven others along a road.

The attackers were identified as members of the Allied Democratic Forces , a Ugandan armed group active in eastern Congo that is recognised by Islamic State as an affiliate.

The U.N. report said Sunday's attack in Apakolu came two days after ADF fighters attacked the nearby village of Kazaraho, where they clashed with the army and local militia groups.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack in Kazaraho and said it also abducted and killed three Christians.

In a separate incident, local officials said ADF fighters attacked the village of Musengo in Lubero territory, North Kivu province, on Saturday night, burning houses, shops and a Catholic church.

Colonel Alain Kiwewa, administrator of Lubero territory, told Reuters that two Congolese soldiers were killed during the army’s response. He said 14 houses were destroyed, along with the local health centre and part of the church.

Congo's army and Ugandan forces have pursued operations against the ADF, but the group's raids persist across the region.

The ADF were responsible for 138 killings in eastern Congo in November, according to a tally published last week by the U.N. human rights office, making them one of the region's most lethal armed groups.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:30:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Marshall Islands' nuclear past and precarious future explored in London exhibition</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/marshall-islands-nuclear-past-precarious-future-explored-london-exhibition-2026-01-26/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A group of artists is shining a light on the impact of climate change, rising sea levels and nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands after travelling to the remote Pacific nation as part of an expedition.

The "Kõmij Mour Ijin/Our Life is Here" exhibition at London's National Maritime Museum features paintings, sculptures, photos and video installations exploring the nation's dark history and the threat facing its inhabitants.

Led by Cape Farewell, a cultural art and climate project founded by artist David Buckland, a team of artists, writers, scientists and filmmakers set sail to the Marshall Islands in 2023.

They visited various atolls, including Bikini, where the U.S. carried out nuclear bomb tests from 1946 to 1958, such as "Castle Bravo" in 1954 - the largest U.S. bomb ever detonated.

"‘Our Life is Here’... refers to them. It's how they could construct their life in among the terrible history and the potential future," Buckland told Reuters.

"The atolls are six feet above sea water, that doesn't take much of the Pacific Ocean to rise, to actually make them uninhabitable. So that threat is hanging over them."

On show at the exhibition, which opened in late November and runs until June, are works exploring the threat of rising flood waters as well as photographs of Marshall Islanders both by international and local artists.

Home to around 40,000 people, the Marshall Islands is one of the countries most vulnerable to rising sea levels, which are projected to put 96% of the capital Majuro , opens new tab at risk of frequent flooding, according to a 2021 World Bank study.

Last year was among the planet's three warmest on record , the World Meteorological Organization said earlier this month, as EU scientists also confirmed average temperatures have now exceeded 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming for the longest since records began.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:31:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's shifting political scene: defections to Nigel Farage's Reform</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/britains-shifting-political-scene-defections-nigel-farages-reform-2026-01-15/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Nigel Farage's right-wing Reform UK Party is benefiting from a raft of high-profile defections from the centre-right Conservative party, with former interior minister Suella Braverman and Robert Jenrick both switching sides this month.

Led by the veteran Brexit campaigner, the anti-immigration Reform UK party is currently leading opinion polls in Britain, positioning itself as a genuine threat to both Prime Minister Keir Starmer's governing centre-left Labour Party and the Conservatives, who lost a 2024 election after 14 years in power.

Should Reform UK's popularity translate into victory in the next election, likely in 2029, it would upend a political system dominated by Labour and the Conservatives for a century.

Here is a list of some former Conservatives who have joined Reform UK in the last year.

Braverman, a current member of parliament who was interior minister (Home Secretary) in 2022-23, announced on Monday that she was joining Reform , accusing her former party of lying to voters on immigration.

A former lawyer, Braverman, 45, has long argued Britain should leave the European Convention on Human Rights, one of Reform UK's key policies.

A current member of parliament, Jenrick came second to Kemi Badenoch in the 2024 race to lead the Conservatives. He joined Reform on January 15, hours after she fired him , saying he was plotting to defect.

Before he switched sides, Jenrick, 44, had been the Conservatives' justice spokesperson, using that position to build a personal profile on key issues such as immigration and crime that many saw as a platform for a future challenge to Badenoch's leadership.

The former lawyer held several ministerial positions in governments in the late 2010s and early 2020s, including the role of housing minister from 2019-2021.

Nadhim Zahawi is a former UK finance minister who joined Reform in January 2026, when he was no longer a sitting member of parliament.

His two-month stint as chancellor came during a chaotic period for the Conservatives, and he is best known publicly for driving British efforts to roll out the COVID-19 vaccine.

Zahawi, 58, co-founded the polling company YouGov. He was born in Iraq and came to Britain as a refugee when he was a child.

Danny Kruger, a current member of parliament, had been a leading Conservative figure until September 2025 when he defected to Reform UK, becoming the first sitting member to do so.

The 51-year-old is a former aide to prime ministers Boris Johnson and David Cameron and had served as welfare spokesperson for the Conservatives until he quit the party.

"This is my tragic conclusion: the Conservative Party is over, over as a national party, over as the principal opposition," he said at the time of his defection.

Nadine Dorries, 68, was culture minister for a year in 2021-2022 when Boris Johnson was prime minister. A best-selling author, she stepped down as a member of parliament in 2023.

She defected to Reform UK in September 2025, when she wrote that her decision had been based on the feeling that "a sense of dread" was spreading across British communities.

"I believe that the only politician who has the answers, the knowledge and the will to deliver is Nigel Farage," she said at the time.

Jake Berry lost his parliamentary seat to Labour in 2024. He had served as chair of the Conservative Party for a short period in 2022 and had previously been a junior minister in the governments of Theresa May and Boris Johnson.

The 47-year-old defected to Reform in July 2025.

"I've always believed that change comes with challenging the old order, in shaking up the system when it isn't working," he said at the time.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:31:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CWOKJ5XMGVN4TMC63IVZX2JVBQ.jpg?auth=385319cffb9790c45854cf2e8cf09871cd2a0eb962ab780a8ddf5f78143c3a8d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel retrieves remains of last Gaza hostage, Netanyahu says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260126-israel-retrieves-remains-of-last-gaza-hostage-netanyahu-says</link><description>The remains of the final hostage in Gaza have been recovered, Israel 's military said Monday, clearing the way for the next phase of the ceasefire that paused the Israel-Hamas war.

The announcement that the remains of Ran Gvili had been found and identified came a day after Israel’s government said the military was conducting a “large-scale operation” in a cemetery in northern Gaza to locate them.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called it “an incredible achievement” for Israel and its soldiers, telling Israeli media that “I promised we would bring everyone home and we have brought everyone home." He said Gvili, who was killed during the Hamas-led attack on October 7, 2023, that sparked the war, was among the first to be taken into Gaza.

The return of all remaining hostages , living or dead, has been a key part of the Gaza ceasefire’s first phase, and Gvili’s family had urged Israel’s government not to enter the second phase until his remains were recovered and returned.

Netanyahu’s office said Sunday that Israel would open the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt, which Palestinians see as their lifeline to the world, once the search for Gvili was finished. It has been largely shut since May 2024, except for a small period in early 2025.

Israel and Hamas had been under pressure from ceasefire mediators including Washington to move into the second phase of the US-brokered truce, which took effect on October 10.

Israel had repeatedly accused Hamas of dragging its feet in the recovery of the final hostage. Hamas said it had provided all the information it had about Gvili’s remains, and accused Israel of obstructing efforts to search for them in areas of Gaza under Israeli military control.

Israel’s military had said the large-scale operation to locate Gvili’s remains was “in the area of the Yellow Line” that divides the territory.

The October 7, 2023 attack killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage. Gvili, a 24-year-old police officer known affectionately as “Rani,” was killed while fighting Hamas militants.

Before Gvili’s remains were recovered, 20 living hostages and the remains of 27 others had been returned to Israel since the ceasefire, most recently in early December. Israel in exchange has released the bodies of hundreds of Palestinians to Gaza.

The next phase of the 20-point ceasefire plan has called for creating an international stabilisation force, forming a technocratic Palestinian government and disarming Hamas.

Israeli forces on Monday fatally shot a man in Gaza City’s Tuffah neighborhood, according to Shifa Hospital, which received the body. The man was close to an area where the military has launched the search operation for Gvili, the hospital said.

Another man was killed in the eastern side of Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, according to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital, which received his body. The circumstances of his death were not immediately clear.

More than 480 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire since October 10, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. The ministry, which is part of the Hamas-led government, maintains detailed casualty records that are seen as generally reliable by UN agencies and independent experts.

The Foreign Press Association on Monday asked Israel’s Supreme Court to allow journalists to enter Gaza freely and independently.

The FPA, which represents dozens of global news organizations, has been fighting for more than two years for independent media access to Gaza. Israel has barred reporters from entering Gaza independently since the October 7, 2023, attacks by Hamas, which triggered the war, saying entry could put both journalists and soldiers at risk.

The army has offered journalists brief, occasional visits under strict military supervision.

FPA lawyers told the three judge panel that the restrictions are not justified and that with aid workers moving in and out of Gaza, journalists should be allowed in as well. They also said the tightly controlled embeds with the military are no substitute for independent access. The judges are expected to rule in the coming days.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:32:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/b3510726-f18a-11f0-9895-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25355673486164.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Third batch of Iranians deported by US to return home, Tasnim reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/third-batch-iranians-deported-by-us-return-home-tasnim-reports-2026-01-26/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A third group of Iranians deported from the United States is returning home, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported on Monday, amid heightened tension between Washington and Tehran following Iran's crackdown on nationwide protests .

"These people, who have been under pressure to leave (the U.S.) for two months, made their return journey via Cairo and Kuwait," Tasnim said. "Fourteen people arrived at Imam Khomeini International Airport on a flight today, and the rest will return in the coming weeks." Tasnim did not clarify the group's total number.

Facilitation of the transfers has required an unusual degree of coordination between two adversaries. Last week, President Donald Trump renewed warnings to Tehran over the killing of protesters and any move to restart its nuclear program.

In September, officials said the U.S. had identified about 400 Iranians to be deported , with a first flight carrying 120 people returning to Tehran via Qatar’s capital.

A second group of 55 returned to Iran in December, with Iran's foreign ministry accusing Washington of conducting deportations on "political grounds and anti-migrant policies."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:57:54 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Western Balkan truck drivers block border cargo terminals over EU entry rules</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/western-balkan-truck-drivers-block-border-cargo-terminals-over-eu-entry-rules-2026-01-26/</link><description>Gevgelija, North Macedonia, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Truck drivers across four Western Balkan countries began a blockade of border cargo terminals on Monday in protest over restrictive EU entry rules that have left drivers facing deportation for exceeding Schengen visit limits.

The blockade was halting transport through a critical corridor that links the EU with Turkey and the Middle East.

More than 100 truck drivers were deported last year for exceeding the 90 days they were allowed to stay in the EU, with another 100 deportations announced last week, said Bosnia's Logistika, which represents 47,000 workers.

In Gevgelija, the biggest border crossing between Greece and North Macedonia, around 100 trucks with North Macedonia's flags blocked the cargo terminal. Drivers from Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia blocked borders in their respective countries.

The truckers demand an extension to how long they are allowed to stay in the Schengen free travel area, as with the large amounts of freight they transport, they reach the visit limit quickly.

"It's putting our economy at risk and the whole Balkans economy at risk. The drivers may lose their jobs, the transport companies will shut down," Filip Stojanov, a 26-year old truck driver from North Macedonia, said in English.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 14:58:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5OSKT6H3QRIVPAVTYW44MNRY3M.jpg?auth=eaddd4c02948fe8dc5865c17886046cd4e2b9160d3394432aec80b6210735083&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France pays tribute to fallen soldiers in Afghanistan after Trump’s false NATO troops claim</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260126-france-pays-tribute-to-fallen-soldiers-in-afghanistan-after-trump-s-false-nato-troops-claim</link><description>A senior French government official said Monday the memory of the French soldiers who died in Afghanistan should not be tarnished following President Donald Trump 's false assertion that non-US troops from NATO countries avoided the front line during that war.

Alice Rufo, the minister delegate at the Defence Ministry, laid a wreath at a monument in downtown Paris dedicated to those who died for France in overseas operations. Speaking to reporters, Rufo said the ceremony had not been planned until the weekend, adding that it was crucial to show that “we do not accept that their memory be insulted."

In October 2001, nearly a month after the September 11 attacks, the US led an international coalition in Afghanistan to destroy al Qaeda, which had used the country as its base, and the group’s Taliban hosts.

Alongside the US were troops from dozens of countries, including from NATO, whose mutual-defence mandate had been triggered for the first time after the attacks on New York and Washington. In an interview with Fox Business Network in Davos, Switzerland, Trump on Thursday claimed that non-US NATO troops stayed “a little off the frontlines” in Afghanistan.

Ninety French soldiers died in the conflict.

“At such a moment, it is symbolically important to be there for their families, for their memory, and to remind everyone of the sacrifice they made on the front line,” Rufo said.

“I have seen the statements, in particular from veterans’ associations, their outrage, their anger, and their sadness,” Rufo said, adding that trans-Atlantic solidarity should prevail over polemics.

“You know, there is a brotherhood of arms between Americans, Britons, and French soldiers when we go into combat.”

After his comments caused an outcry, Trump appeared to backpedal and heaped praise on the British soldiers who fought in Afghanistan. He had no words for other troops, though.

On Saturday, a day after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer condemned his remarks as "appalling", he appeared to have changed position – at least as far as British troops were concerned.

"The GREAT and very BRAVE soldiers of the United Kingdom will always be with the United States of America!" Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

"In Afghanistan, 457 died, many were badly injured, and they were among the greatest of all warriors. It's a bond too strong to ever be broken," Trump said.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 15:36:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/4f051baa-fac6-11f0-beb5-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026522521484.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Seven dead, one seriously injured in Sunday plane crash in Maine, according to FAA</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/7-dead-1-seriously-injured-plane-crash-maine-airport-cnn-reports-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Seven people were killed and one person was seriously injured on Sunday when a private jet crashed as it was taking off from an airport in Bangor, Maine, according to preliminary information released by the the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday.

The deal paves the way for free trade of goods between the bloc of 27 European nations and India, which together make up a quarter of the world's gross domestic product and a market of 2 billion consumers.

"It will be a balanced, forward-looking deal for better economic integration with the EU. The deal will propel trade and investment between both sides," said India Trade Secretary Rajesh Agrawal.

Trade between the two sides stood at $136.5 billion in the fiscal year through March 2025.

The formal signing would take place after legal vetting expected to last five to six months, an Indian government official aware of the matter said.

"We expect the deal to be implemented within a year,” the official added.

The agreement comes days after the EU signed a pivotal pact with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.

During the same period, New Delhi finalised agreements with Britain , New Zealand and Oman.

The spate of deals underscores global efforts to hedge against the United States as President Donald Trump's bid to take over Greenland and tariff threats on European countries test longstanding alliances among Western nations.

After nearly two decades of on-off negotiations, the deal will see India open up its vast and guarded market, the world's largest, to free trade with the EU, its biggest trading partner.

India and the EU pushed to close the deal after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to fast-track negotiations last year.

Two-way talks, relaunched in 2022 after a nine-year lull, gathered momentum after Trump imposed import tariffs on several trading partners, including a 50% tariff on goods from India.

An India-U.S. trade deal collapsed last year after a breakdown in communication between their two governments.

Both the EU and India had been locked in last-minute give and take over cars and steel trade, among the final points of contention.

The EU had sought sharp cuts by India in import duties on its cars that can exceed 100%, while India - a major steel producer - has been pushing the EU to reduce trade curbs to its steel exports.

Reuters reported on Sunday that India was planning to slash tariffs on cars imported from the EU to 40% from as high as 110% as part of the deal.

Negotiations excluded some sensitive farm and dairy items, as New Delhi maintains the need to protect millions of subsistence farmers.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 16:38:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QUXLR4H4WFNURDWTRXQAAPWHCQ.jpg?auth=26149076b593bce21102346efa9c4c76a02e81c9b6f0f8284729b8abf4ae4258&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>As Russia bombs, Ukraine's artists squeeze frozen paint from the tube</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/russia-bombs-ukraines-artists-squeeze-frozen-paint-tube-2026-01-26/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 26 (Reuters) - In his cramped Kyiv studio where icicles hang from the tap in the bathroom sink, surrealist painter Yuriy Denysenkov reckons he can work a bit more today if he can just keep the room warm enough so paint will still squeeze from the tube.

Russia's relentless bombardment of Ukraine's heating and power system has left millions of Ukrainians facing the coldest and darkest winter yet after four years of war.

"The paint freezes and it's hard to squeeze it out," he says, managing to squirt a streak of dark blue onto a palette.

"If I do it quickly like this, I can even get a bit warmer," he says as he makes quick brush strokes on a moody picture of a child sticking a toe into a puddle in the countryside with a dog.

In another studio, steam billows from Oleksandr Liapin's lips as the 70-year-old dabs at a painting of an astonished-looking white bunny in a room with a candle on the ceiling - painted in bright yellow, pink and orange in a naive style.

It's minus 10 Celsius (14 F) outside, but it's nudged a bit above freezing inside, thanks to a gas camping stove that boiled up a kettle.

Tensions between Iran and the United States have grown following a severe crackdown on protests across Iran in which thousands were killed in the past few weeks, which President Donald Trump said could lead to a U.S. response. Tehran said any attack on Khamenei would trigger a "holy war".

"We are concerned with what is happening and targeted by potential aggression. We are determined to defend ourselves. We will choose in due course how to act, whether to intervene or not... but we are not neutral," Qassem said in a televised address.

The Hezbollah leader said mediators had told the group the U.S. and Israel were considering hitting it in case there was an attack on Iran, saying that a war on Iran could ignite the entire region this time.

Hezbollah was severely weakened in 2024 during cross border fighting with Israel that Hezbollah said was in support of Palestinians in Gaza.

U.S. prosecutors allege Mohamed and his father Nazar conspired to commit fraud and launder money through their gold exporting firm, Mohamed’s Enterprise, to enrich themselves and defraud the government of Guyana.

The men, who were indicted in Florida but deny wrongdoing, were briefly detained in October . They are contesting the extradition proceedings in court.

“The process was very smooth. No hiccups. No delay. In less than five minutes, I was elected leader of the opposition, ready to serve the people of this country,” Mohamed told journalists after the vote.

His political party, We Invest in Nationhood, is less than a year old but became the top opposition force in parliament in September's election, winning 16 of 65 seats.

The Guyanese government, which Mohamed has accused of persecuting him because of his entry into politics, has said making him opposition leader could taint the legislature.

The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and several guided-missile destroyers have crossed into the Middle East region, which comes under the U.S. military's Central Command, the officials told Reuters.

Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an "armada" heading toward Iran, but hoped he would not have to use it.

The warships began deploying from the Asia-Pacific region earlier this month, as tensions between Iran and the United States escalated following a crackdown on protests across Iran.

Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated. The president said he had been told that killings were subsiding and that he believes there is currently no plan for the executions of prisoners .

The U.S. military has in the past surged forces into the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive.

However, the U.S. military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran's nuclear program.

In addition to the carrier and warships, the Pentagon is also moving fighter jets and air-defense systems to the Middle East.

Over the weekend, the U.S. military announced that it would carry out an exercise in the region "to demonstrate the ability to deploy, disperse, and sustain combat airpower."

A senior Iranian official said last week that Tehran would consider any attack as an "all-out-war against us."

The United Arab Emirates said on Monday that it will not let its airspace, territory or territorial waters be used for any hostile military actions against Iran.

United Nations Special Rapporteur on Iran, Mai Sato, also told Reuters in an interview via video link that families were facing demands for ransoms of $5,000 to $7,000 to retrieve the bodies of loved ones, a crushing burden amid Iran's mounting economic woes.

Anti-government protests that swept across Iran since December have triggered the bloodiest crackdown by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, drawing international condemnation. Iran has blocked internet access since January 8.

U.S.-based rights group HRANA has put the unrest-related death toll at 5,937, including 214 security personnel, while official figures put the death toll at 3,117. Reuters has been unable to independently verify the numbers.

Sato, who is also a professor at Birkbeck University in London, said she too could not independently verify the death toll but believed casualties far exceeded official figures.

"There's been many reports of hospital staff (from multiple provinces across Iran) reporting that the security forces have raided their hospital," she said, as well as families showing up the next day and their loved ones no longer being there.

The Iranian mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the reports.

Medical staff in Iran who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity confirmed some of the reports to which Sato referred.

"Dozens of patients were in our hospital with gunshot wounds. They had undergone surgery, and then the Revolutionary Guards came and took them all away. We don’t know what happened to them," said one doctor in the northern city of Rasht.

One nurse and two doctors at hospitals in Tehran also told Reuters that members of the Revolutionary Guards and police had visited their facilities seeking records of protesters who had been hospitalised and then discharged, in order to arrest them.

"They even checked every room in the hospital, looking for wounded protesters,” said the nurse.

Such actions create a chilling effect, deterring people from seeking medical care and risking death or a worsening of their health condition due to fears of detention, Sato said.

Such behaviour is also a serious violation of medical neutrality, she added. Under the Geneva Conventions, doctors, hospitals and patients must be protected to ensure impartial care.

Unarmed protesters across Iran's 31 provinces have been shot in the chest and head - targeting vital organs - in a sign of lethal force used indiscriminately by security forces, Sato said, citing reports. International law permits such force only as a last resort, proportionately.

"In those incidents, that would indicate that they are unlawful deaths and arbitrary killings," she said, adding that recent reports had also documented a surge in eye injuries caused by pellets.

Of the reported demands from Iranian authorities for ransom money, Sato said: "This practice really compounds grief with extortion."

Sato said Iranian attempts to label the protesters as "terrorists" or "rioters" was deeply problematic and was intended to justify a brutal crackdown on what she described as a local, organic movement.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:31:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2AGR2OGXT5JUNHKE5OMGOFSFTY.jpg?auth=d0d6100d70fbf9dd47ca53b20ebac15c079152a01b826eb4d551e8c5a4a2f694&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy declares state of emergency after storms in southern regions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/italy-declares-state-emergency-after-storms-southern-regions-2026-01-26/</link><description>ROME, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Italy's government on Monday declared a state of emergency for southern regions battered by a violent storm last week, pledging swift financial aid to rebuild roads and businesses hit by the severe weather.

Relentless rain, powerful winds and waves as high as nine metres (30 ft) battered Sicily, Sardinia and Calabria for two days, pushing water inland and overwhelming coastal defences.

Authorities have estimated that the damage ran to more than 1 billion euros ($1.19 billion) but despite the scale of the destruction, officials reported no casualties.

Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government set aside an initial 100 million euros to address the initial needs of the hardest-hit areas, Civil Protection Minister Nello Musumeci said in a statement.

"In the coming days, the government will adopt a new interministerial measure to allow the restoration and reconstruction of the damaged infrastructure," Musumeci said.

Sicily alone suffered around 740 million euros worth of damage, the regional government said last week, but the island's governor, Renato Schifani, warned on Monday that the final amount could be double that.

The sea flooded streets in popular hotspots near Taormina, wrecking infrastructure such as wastewater treatment facilities, and raising concerns over the forthcoming tourist season. In Catania, a section of sidewalk collapsed on the seafront.

Land subsidence, probably triggered by the bad weather, is now threatening the town of Niscemi, in central Sicily, and around 1,000 people have had to be evacuated from their homes, the civil protection said in a statement.

Sardinia was also badly hit. Beniamino Garau, the mayor of Capoterra in the south of the island, said the sea had pushed about 100 metres inland.

In Calabria, the regional administration said the storm caused "major damage to agricultural business...with serious repercussions for the rural economy" in one of Italy's least developed areas.

Extreme weather events have become more frequent in Italy in recent years. Floods have devastated cities across the country, killing dozens of people and amplifying risks of landslides and floods also in historically less exposed areas.

However, locals said regional civil protection alerts issued ahead of the storm had persuaded people to stay at home, preventing any deaths or serious injuries.

Rutte told advocates of a European force separate from the U.S.-led NATO alliance to "keep dreaming", and said Russian President Vladimir Putin would "love" the idea as it would stretch Europe's armies and make them weaker.

Speaking to the European Parliament in Brussels, Rutte said European nations should continue to step up to take more responsibility for their own security, as Trump has demanded - but within the transatlantic alliance.

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Albares and European Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius have both raised the prospect of a European force in recent weeks.

Without referring explicitly to either proposal, Rutte gave the general idea short shrift, insisting Trump and the U.S. remained strongly committed to NATO, despite the uncertainty caused by Trump's demands that NATO member Denmark cede control of Greenland.

"I think there will be a lot of duplication and I wish you luck if you want to do it, because you have to find the men and women in uniform - they'll be on top of what is happening already," he said.

"It will make things more complicated. I think Putin will love it. So think again."

Rutte told the lawmakers that if Europe really wanted to go it alone, it would cost far more than the 5% of GDP that NATO nations have agreed to spend on defence and security-related investments.

"You have to build up your own nuclear capability - that costs billions and billions of euros. You will lose then, in that scenario ... the ultimate guarantor of our freedom, which is the U.S. nuclear umbrella. So hey, good luck."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:32:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/RBAR3QLQRNKA7GSC4Q4EPDRLZM.jpg?auth=a769f2dd529c6cb87e9f87be0e6e5ff9346646028565914b203d7efe574981e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigeria military to try officers over alleged plot to topple government</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigeria-military-try-officers-over-alleged-plot-topple-government-2026-01-26/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - A probe by Nigeria's military found that some of the 16 officers arrested last year for misconduct may have been plotting to overthrow the government and they will now face trial, the Defence Headquarters said in a statement on Monday.

The statement said the investigation uncovered firm cases against several, including "allegations of plotting to overthrow the government," but gave no details of the plans or how many of the 16 were involved.

Defence spokesperson Major-General Samaila Uba said the officers were detained in October and those now accused of plotting a coup will face a military judicial panel.

If found guilty the officers would face the death penalty.

Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, alleged troops broke into his residence overnight into Saturday in the Magere suburb of Kampala, assaulted staff and choked his wife , Barbara Kyagulanyi, forcing her to seek medical treatment.

Wine, who has been in hiding following the East African nation's disputed presidential election , said he was not at home at the time.

Kainerugaba, who is also President Yoweri Museveni's son, dismissed the accusations in a post on X, saying the army "do not beat up women."

"They are not worth our time. We are looking for her cowardly husband not her," Kainerugaba said, referring to Wine and his wife.

Wine, a pop-star-turned-politician, has accused Ugandan security forces of harassment since the January 15 presidential election, which President Museveni won with 71.6% of the vote.

Wine, who finished second, has rejected the result , alleging fraud.

It is unclear why the military is searching for him.

Rights groups and the opposition have long accused Museveni's government of using the military to suppress dissent, accusations the government denies.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:33:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6ALIX4ONWJOPRG5LA5WHQ6KYIA.jpg?auth=29ea2acad582d41acb0454176c4618171159333ed15bec76124ec13f7912c2c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French ex-senator goes on trial over allegedly spiking MPs drink to sexually assault her</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260126-french-ex-senator-goes-on-trial-over-allegedly-spiking-mps-drink-to-sexually-assault-her</link><description>A ‍former French senator ​went on trial on Monday accused of spiking a lawmaker's drink with ecstasy with the ⁠intention of sexually assaulting her.

Joel Guerriau, 68, who resigned as a senator over the case in October 2025, allegedly administered lawmaker Sandrine Josso with "a substance liable to alter her ​discernment or control over her actions, in order to commit rape or ‍sexual aggression", a court document showed.

The centre-right politician also faces charges related to the possession and use of ecstasy, ​the document read. Guerriau has denied the charges against him.

The case has ​resonated in France following the 2024 conviction of Dominique Pelicot , who was found guilty of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, Gisèle, and inviting dozens of strangers to assault her while she was unconscious.

The Pelicot trial attracted headlines worldwide and raised awareness about drug-facilitated assaults.

Josso told investigators she felt unwell after drinking a few sips from a glass of champagne offered to her by Guerriau ‍at his apartment to celebrate an electoral win.

She told them the champagne did not taste normal and that ​if she had not managed to leave the flat she was certain Guerriau would have assaulted her, convinced he wanted to "satisfy an urge", according to the court document.

A toxicology ‌test later revealed traces of ecstasy in her blood, and ecstasy was also found in Guerriau's apartment, the document stated.

If found guilty, he ‍could face a jail sentence of up to five years and a fine of 75,000 euros ($88,950). His lawyer was not immediately available for comment.

The former senator's Horizons party, which is part of French President Emmanuel Macron's governing alliance, told French media following the accusations in November 2023 that Guerriau had been suspended with immediate effect.

The trial runs until Tuesday.

Parliament last year approved ‍changes to France's rape law to include consent, bringing the legislation more into line with more than a ‌dozen other European ​countries in a move that was given new impetus by the Pelicot mass rape trial .</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:34:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7c975106-fad9-11f0-8ad3-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026473862799.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump to send border czar to Minneapolis, judge considers legality of immigration raids in Minnesota</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260126-trump-to-send-homan-architect-of-his-anti-immigration-policy-to-minneapolis-amid-shooting-scrutiny</link><description>US President Donald Trump announced Monday he is sending a top official to Minnesota as outrage grew over his administration's militarised immigration raids and the shooting dead of a second protester in Minneapolis .

Trump said that Tom Homan, his point man for border security, would arrive in the state later and "will report directly to me".

The high-profile assignment suggested that the 79-year-old Republican president is seeking to regain control over a rapidly deteriorating political and security situation.

In a separate post, White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said that Homan “will be managing ICE operations on the ground in Minnesota to continue arresting the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens".

Minneapolis has become ground zero in the clash between Trump and growing numbers of Americans over his nationwide immigration crackdown.

In Congress, Democrats are threatening to hold up funding for the US government unless immigration enforcement agencies are reformed.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) , an agency under the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), has been transformed under Trump into the United States' most heavily funded law enforcement body. But polls show growing anger over its frequently brutal tactics.

A huge rally took place in bitter cold in Minneapolis on Friday to protest the raids and the point blank shooting by an ICE agent of protester Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three on January 7.

Then on Saturday, immigration agents gunned down Alex Jeffrey Pretti, also 37, after having already tackled him to the ground. Like Good, the intensive care unit nurse was a US citizen.

New rallies erupted after his death in Minneapolis, New York and other major cities.

Trump has so far dismissed concerns. His first reaction to Pretti's killing was to suggest that the nurse had come intending to shoot at the police.

Pretti was carrying a pistol with him at the time but never removed it and had apparently already been disarmed when he was shot. He was licensed to carry a weapon.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison on Sunday accused Trump of pushing a "flat-out insane" narrative.

Trump repeated the insinuation that Pretti was to blame when he told The Wall Street Journal on Sunday: "I don't like any shooting ... but I don't like it when somebody goes into a protest and he's got a very powerful, fully loaded gun."

A federal judge in Minneapolis was to consider Monday whether the deployment of federal officers – many of them masked, heavily armed and unidentified – violates the state of Minnesota's sovereignty.

The state of Minnesota and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an ICE officer.

In arguments before US District Judge Katherine Menendez, lawyers for the state and Twin Cities argued the situation is so dire on the street as to require the court to halt the federal government’s immigration enforcement actions.

The judge will hear arguments from state and city lawyers that the federal deployments amount to an occupying force.

Also under consideration is a bid to force federal officials to preserve evidence related to Pretti's killing.

Menendez asked attorneys where she should draw the line between legitimate law enforcement response and one that violates the Constitution.

The lawsuits highlight the deep rift between local and federal law enforcement over the deployment, dubbed "Operation Metro Surge".

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

Justice Department attorneys have called the lawsuit “legally frivolous” and said Minnesota "wants a veto over federal law enforcement.” They asked the judge to reject the request or to at least stay her order pending an anticipated appeal.

Trump's immigration raids have focused deliberately on Democratic-run cities, pitting mayors and governors against the president.

Local police have repeatedly confronted federal agents and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called out the state's National Guard to push back against the federal forces.

Trump will also be watching signs of growing disenchantment from his Republican Party in Congress. The party is usually in lockstep with Trump but it has only a slender majority.

One of the most prominent cautions came from House Oversight Committee chairman James Comer, who signaled Sunday that federal agents should withdraw from Minneapolis – an intervention that would normally be unheard-of from a figure considered one of Trump's staunchest loyalists.

Trump told the Journal that the immigration agents would leave Minneapolis "at some point".</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:34:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ff1e551c-fad3-11f0-8617-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26014601305166.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain busts cocaine ring that used offshore floating bases</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/spain-busts-cocaine-ring-that-used-offshore-floating-bases-2026-01-26/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Spanish police have broken up a vast cocaine trafficking operation that used speed boats to bring the drug onshore from floating bases in the Atlantic, seizing 10 metric tons of the drug and arresting 105 suspects.
Police said on Monday that a year-long investigation in cooperation with law enforcement in countries including Cape Verde, Colombia, France, Portugal and the U.S. showed the group brought an estimated 57 tons of cocaine to Europe in the period.
Speed boats -- operating at night from rivers in southern Spain, the northwestern Galicia region and the Canary Islands, as well as from Portugal and Morocco -- navigated far into the Atlantic to offload drugs from transport and storage ships.
"They managed to create genuine aquatic platforms where pilots would remain at sea for over a month at a time, carrying out several successive operations", while other members used sophisticated equipment to monitor security agencies' communications and movements, a police statement said.
Officers seized 30 boats, 70 vehicles and numerous pieces of high-tech communications and surveillance equipment.
The investigation also showed that at one point the group paid as much as 12 million euros to the family of a deceased crew member in order to buy their silence.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 17:58:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US security team flags drone threat at Milano Cortina Games</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us-security-team-flags-drone-threat-milano-cortina-games-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. officials helping to safeguard Americans at next month's Winter Olympics are stepping up planning for potential drone disruptions from illicit filming over venues to worst-case scenarios involving explosive payloads.

The threat of drone attacks has drawn growing attention since the war in Ukraine demonstrated their lethal capabilities, and the U.S. government has recently ramped up spending on anti-drone technology .

Drones have also disrupted airspace across Europe in recent months, while low-cost unmanned aircraft have become an everyday challenge for major sporting events.

"Our authorities are constantly on the lookout," Tim Ayers, Director of the U.S. State Department's Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), said in an interview.

Ayers described drones as "a massive issue" that host nations and visiting security teams now treat as a standing threat category.

Italian police and their military counterparts are preparing restrictions and monitoring systems around outdoor mountain venues for the Milano Cortina Games, where drones are harder to control and easier to conceal, U.S. officials said.

Legitimate drone use - such as television broadcasts - can be approved under a credentialing system, but security planners expect fans to attempt flights regardless.

As part of preparations, U.S. officials recently convened a high-level drone symposium in Italy, bringing American specialists to brief their Italian counterparts and establish direct communication channels for rapid problem-solving during the Games.

"The Italians have primacy, it's their country," Ayers said. "We're there as a backstop to share information and expertise as needed."

Security officials pointed to the Paris Olympics as a recent case study. While authorities planned for the possibility of drones being used to deliver harmful devices, the more common incidents involved spectators trying to capture unauthorised footage or conduct activity that could resemble surveillance.

In those cases, officials said, host-nation forces focus on identifying and apprehending operators, enforcing no-drone zones and deploying counter-unmanned aircraft systems to force drones down, take control of them or block them electronically.

The American effort is coordinated by DSS through an interagency body that plans security support for major events outside the United States, officials said.

The group draws support from the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy and the intelligence community, among others.

U.S. officials said planning for an Olympics typically begins years in advance, with agents embedded on the ground.

Becky McKnight, a DSS special agent based in Milan for nearly two years, said her day-to-day work has focused on relationship-building with Italian law enforcement and venue security managers and repeatedly visiting Olympic clusters across northern Italy to understand terrain, travel choke points and command structures.

"Some of these venues, when we first went out there two years ago, most of them hadn't been built," she said.

Beyond drones, officials cited cyber incidents as a major concern, including scenarios in which payment systems or ticketing access could be disrupted.

Officials also anticipate protests - both issue-driven demonstrations and routine anti-Olympics activity - as well as opportunistic crime targeting tourists.

Organisers have said they are taking every precaution to deliver a safe Games for athletes and fans.

For U.S. citizens traveling to Italy, officials urged enrollment in the State Department's Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) for safety messages about significant disruptions such as protests or transit issues.

They also advised avoiding flashy jewelry, staying aware of surroundings and expecting delays.

"Everyone wants to go," Sheinbaum said at her daily morning press conference on Monday, adding that she had sent a diplomatic letter to South Korea's Lee seeking more concerts.

"Around 1 million young people want to buy tickets, but there are only 150,000 tickets available," she said.

The chart-topping band is set to embark on a global tour in April , shortly after they launch their first new album in three years. The band has been on hiatus since 2022 while its members undertook South Korea's mandatory military service.

The new tour launched a worldwide scramble for tickets , particularly in Mexico, one of K-pop's largest fan bases, where many people missed the initial rush and others complained to the consumer watchdog about problems with sales.

Mexico's consumer watchdog said it has launched a probe into Ticketmaster and is sanctioning resale platforms StubHub (STUB.N) , opens new tab and Viagogo for "abusive and disloyal practices" over the BTS ticketing process, without giving more details.

Tickets were selling on Ticketmaster from about 1,800 pesos to as much as 17,800 pesos for VIP tickets (around $100 to $1,030), but on resale platforms on Monday the tickets were selling from 11,300 to 92,100 pesos (more than $5,300).

The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The watchdog agency said it would help develop new guidelines to better regulate ticket sales to concerts and festivals, with prices and locations established ahead of the tickets' release.

Ticketmaster, which is owned by Live Nation Entertainment (LYV.N) , opens new tab , has faced other controversies in Mexico, including in 2022 when it reimbursed around $1 million to customers after more than a thousand fans reported being denied access to a Bad Bunny concert at Mexico's Estadio Azteca.

At the time, Ticketmaster criticized resellers and fraudulent ticket vendors and called for stronger control measures.

BTS's new album "Arirang" is slated for release in March and the world tour will begin in Goyang, South Korea, on April 9. Just three concerts have been scheduled in Mexico, all in Mexico City's GNP Seguros Stadium, from May 7 to May 10.

"The final toll may be significantly higher, a stark reminder that this route remains the deadliest migration corridor in the world," the IOM stated.

Three people - including twin girls about one year old - were confirmed dead in Lampedusa, Italy, after a search-and-rescue operation for a boat that left Sfax, Tunisia, the International Organization for Migration said in a statement. They died of hypothermia, according to their Guinean mother, a survivor. A man also died from the same cause, the IOM added.

Survivors from the same boat said another vessel departed simultaneously but never arrived and its fate remains unknown, the IOM said.

Over the past 10 days - amid a violent Mediterranean storm triggered by Cyclone Harry - several boats are believed to have gone missing, leaving hundreds unaccounted for, according to the IOM. Search efforts have been hampered by poor weather.

The agency is verifying a survivor's report from another boat, rescued by a commercial vessel near Malta, of a shipwreck where at least 50 people could be missing or dead. Separately, 51 people are feared dead after a wreck off Tobruk, Libya, the IOM said.

"Smuggling migrants on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats is a criminal act," the IOM said.

"Arranging departures while a severe storm was hitting the region makes this conduct even more reprehensible, as people were knowingly sent to sea under conditions amounting to a near-certain risk of death," it added.

In 2025, at least 1,340 people died in the Central Mediterranean, according to the agency's figures.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:38:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5WD4VPWQFRMAXEUUQQ3XNHPQKM.jpg?auth=73127635b7a329295ff84328acf96238197dd1774ae08cc4743a0ef3c026c3f3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary to summon Ukrainian envoy over what PM Orban says is election meddling</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungary-summon-ukrainian-envoy-over-what-pm-orban-says-is-election-meddling-2026-01-26/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Viktor Orban said on Monday that Hungary would summon Ukraine's ambassador over what Orban said were attempts to interfere in a Hungarian parliamentary election due on April 12.

Orban has intensified his anti-Ukraine campaign in the past weeks, and has sought to associate Hungarian opposition leader Peter Magyar with Kyiv and the EU executive in Brussels as the campaign heats up.

As Hungary's economy stagnates, Orban's Fidesz party trails the opposition Tisza in most polls.

In a campaign primarily targeting rural voters, Orban has portrayed Ukraine as unworthy of financial support, framing the April vote as a choice between war and peace and echoing his past anti-migrant campaigns.

Orban, who has kept close ties with Moscow, has repeatedly refused to support European Union aid for Ukraine, and has launched a "national petition" asking voters to sign up to say they do not want to help pay for the war.

"Last week, Ukrainian leaders and even the president himself made grossly insulting and threatening statements against Hungary ... Our national security services have ... concluded this is a coordinated attempt to interfere in Hungarian elections," Orban said in a video.

The Ukrainian foreign ministry gave no immediate response to a request for comment.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy last Thursday criticised Europe for being a "fragmented kaleidoscope of small and middle powers" lacking the courage to act decisively. He also said Europe should not allow its capitals to become "little Moscow".

"Every 'Viktor' who lives off European money while trying to sell out European interests deserves a smack upside the head," Zelenskiy said in a speech in Davos.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:38:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7AZZDRVMTRJENDI3RNG5SKZW5Y.jpg?auth=8fff77da3ca252ce2f638968a10aec8affd199faa0adea8242fb9b0920000b35&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brazil's Lula holds call with Trump, agrees to visit Washington</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/brazils-lula-holds-call-with-trump-agrees-visit-washington-2026-01-26/</link><description>BRASILIA, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva held a phone call with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump on Monday and agreed to visit Washington soon, the Brazilian government said in a statement.

The two leaders discussed several issues during the 50-minute call, including the situation in Venezuela, Trump's proposed Board of Peace and the fight against organized crime.

Regarding Venezuela, the Brazilian president stressed the importance of "preserving peace and stability in the region," the statement said.

Lula has criticized the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who was deposed earlier this month and taken to New York to face drug-trafficking charges. The Brazilian president had condemned the move as the crossing of "an unacceptable line."

Lula emphasized to Trump on Monday the need to work for the welfare of the Venezuelan people.

Lula also suggested that Trump's new proposal for a Board of Peace be limited to the situation in Gaza, as global powers worry the initiative launched last Thursday could assume a wider role and rival the United Nations.

Brazil's president also called for Palestinian representation on the board, according to the statement.

Lula said last week that Trump was attempting to create a "new U.N." and be its sole owner, yet the U.S. president has said the Board of Peace would work alongside the U.N.

The Brazilian government's statement did not say whether Lula accepted Trump's invitation to join the initiative.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:38:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PLE3E2N57JM3HGDNX6SSAEWIRY.jpg?auth=a5f25e40a692b6e0d96c69d694c1fa2b31e84f6815f2fcb216f34fb92d8e4c3a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France's National Assembly debates banning under-15s from social media</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/frances-national-assembly-debates-banning-under-15s-social-media-2026-01-26/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - France's National Assembly debated legislation to ban children under 15 years old from social media on Monday, amid growing concerns about online bullying and mental health risks.

The bill proposes banning under-15s from social networks and "social networking functionalities" embedded within broader platforms, and reflects rising public angst over the impact of social media on minors.

It now passes to the Senate before a final vote in the lower house.

President Emmanuel Macron has pointed to social media as one factor to blame for violence among young people. He is urging France to follow Australia, whose world-first ban for under-16s on social media platforms including Facebook (META.O) , opens new tab , Snapchat (SNAP.N) , opens new tab , TikTok and YouTube (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab came into force in December.

Macron wants the ban in place in time for the start of the next academic year in September.

"With this law, we are setting a clear boundary in society and saying social media is not harmless," centrist lawmaker Laure Miller told the chamber as she presented the bill.

"Our children are reading less, sleeping less, and comparing themselves to one another more," she continued. "This is a battle for free minds."

Australia's social media ban is being studied in countries including Britain, Denmark, Spain and Greece.

The European Parliament has called for the European Union to set minimum ages for children to access social media, although it is up to member states to impose age limits.

There is broad political and public support in France for curbing minors' access to social media, and the bill was expected to pass in a vote later on Monday evening.

Far-right lawmaker Thierry Perez said the bill responded to a "health emergency".

"Social media has allowed everyone to express themselves, but at what cost to our children?” Perez said.

The French ban would require platforms to block access to young teenagers through age‑verification mechanisms compliant with European Union law.

Enforcing such bans can be difficult. Australia's government acknowledged the rollout of its ban would be bumpy after children claiming to be under 16 flooded the country's social media feeds with messages gloating about their continued ability to access networks.

The French legislation also extends an existing ban on smartphones in junior and middle schools to cover high schools.

A Harris Interactive survey in 2024 showed 73% of the public supported a ban on social media access for under-15s.

Teenagers on the streets of Paris were split in their views. Some said they acknowledged the dangers associated with social media. Others felt a ban was excessive.

"I don’t think it should be forbidden, for anyone," said 14-year-old Bonnie Pretot Jacobi. "Like, 13 or 14, I think it’s old enough. Way old enough."</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:39:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ALVWBWLUNZNN7KMZ5IHD6MOGBQ.jpg?auth=f9a035a92d95974a7f183c1a2e7ec3cd17d24a02bd510b930a29c42c53734f90&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Italy summons Israeli ambassador after police held at gunpoint in West Bank</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/italy-summons-israeli-ambassador-after-police-held-gunpoint-west-bank-2026-01-26/</link><description>ROME, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Italy on Monday summoned Israel's ambassador to protest after two Italian policemen were threatened at gunpoint by an Israeli during a field visit in the occupied West Bank, the foreign ministry said.

The two military policemen were stopped on Sunday by an armed Israeli while they were carrying out a site inspection ahead of a planned visit by EU ambassadors to a village near Ramallah.

According to a government source, the Israeli, believed to have been a settler, forced the two men to kneel at gunpoint and subjected them to an improvised interrogation.

The soldiers were travelling in a vehicle with diplomatic licence plates and carrying diplomatic passports.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani wanted the Israeli ambassador in Rome to receive a "strong protest" over the incident, the foreign ministry said in a statement.

Italy's embassy to Israel has already submitted a formal protest to the Israeli government, contacting the foreign ministry, the Israeli military, the police and the Shin Bet domestic security agency.

The two policemen returned unharmed to Italy's Consulate General in Jerusalem following the incident.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 18:39:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>European countries including UK lose measles elimination status</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/european-countries-including-uk-lose-measles-elimination-status-2026-01-26/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Britain and several other European countries have lost their measles elimination status, the World Health Organization said on Monday, after a jump in infections across the continent.

Spain, Austria, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan also lost their status, and the WHO urged countries to boost vaccination rates, particularly among under-protected populations, to prevent the viral disease infecting more children.

Measles is entirely preventable by vaccination, but is very contagious, and so is among the first illnesses to rebound when vaccination rates decline. It commonly causes symptoms including high fever and a rash, but can also lead to serious long-term complications and even death.

Health experts have warned that rising outbreaks worldwide point to a resurgence of other preventable illnesses in populations increasingly mistrustful or skeptical of vaccines since the COVID-19 pandemic.

"The UK's change of status reflects a broader challenge we're facing across the WHO European Region," the U.N. health agency said on its website. Several other European countries already have regular measles transmission, according to the WHO, including France and Romania.

Canada lost its elimination status last year, and the U.S. is working to retain its status as infections mount.

WHO committees in each region decide whether a country is measles-free using case rates. To be considered measles-free by the WHO, a country must have no locally transmitted cases of the same strain for 12 months or longer.

The decision to strip certain European countries of their status was made last September based on data from 2024. But the WHO only released the information on Monday after getting sign-off from every country involved.

To keep measles at bay, vaccination rates must exceed 95%, the WHO estimates. Yet in the UK, only 84.4% of children had the two doses needed for full protection in 2024. Government data showed 2,911 confirmed cases in England that year, the most since 2012.

On Monday, the UK Health Security Agency said all children should be vaccinated to protect themselves from measles. The UK was first given elimination status in 2016, before losing it in 2018 then regaining it in 2021.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 19:25:09 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Y6LIZDTBHZNHPBTDB5HVYYWCLQ.jpg?auth=3672eccce8102824ca09e54237a7a3f9a3efa5d150406406f112aae9a65fb988&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>At least two injured in Russian attack on dwellings, school in Ukraine's Kharkiv</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/least-two-injured-russian-attack-dwellings-school-ukraines-kharkiv-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Russian forces on Monday launched a drone and missile attack on Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, hitting apartment buildings, a school and a kindergarten and injuring at least two people, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said on Telegram.

The poll, conducted nationwide between Friday and Sunday, gathered responses before and after immigration officers on Saturday killed a second U.S. citizen in Minneapolis during confrontations with protesters over Trump's deployment of immigration agents to cities across the U.S.

Just 39% of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing on immigration, down from 41% earlier this month, while 53% disapprove, the poll found. Immigration was a brighter spot for Trump's popularity in the weeks following his January inauguration. In February, 50% approved and 41% disapproved.

Trump's overall approval rating sank to 38%, tying the lowest level of his current term as it dropped from 41% in the prior Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted January 12-13.

Some 58% of poll respondents said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have gone "too far" in their crackdown, while 12% said they had not gone far enough and 26% said the agents' efforts were "about right." About nine in 10 Democrats said the agents have gone too far, compared to two in 10 Republicans and six in 10 independents.

The poll, conducted online nationwide, gathered responses from 1,139 U.S. adults and had a margin of error of about 3 percentage points.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:26:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PX3XXPERHNIIHKEFDE5FP535NA.jpg?auth=730e1f96ea241489166457290dcfb817367e19ec63ce23da58d720c217fc9f2a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's state TV airs several ‘forced confessions’ after protest crackdown, activists say</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260126-iranian-state-tv-airs-several-forced-confessions-after-protest-crackdown-activists-say</link><description>The man faces the camera with his face blurred as dramatic music pounds in the background.

"I made a mistake," he says, his voice trembling as an unseen interrogator presses him about the deaths of members of Iran 's security forces. "If I'd known, I would not have done it."

According to one rights group, at least 240 such "forced confessions" have been broadcast by Iranian state television in recent weeks – an "unprecedented" quantity – after authorities arrested thousands of people in the wake of protests that shook the country's clerical leadership.

Questioned by an interviewer, detainees are shown confessing to a variety of alleged offences ranging from committing violence against members of the security forces, to accepting money from monarchists or Iran's foes, or sharing images with banned groups or media outlets.

In some cases, people are accused of merely following accounts of opponents of the Islamic republic on social media.

Activists say the so-called confessions are extracted by psychological and physical torture , and are a familiar tactic used in the past by Iranian authorities against detainees who in some cases have subsequently been executed.

Amnesty International termed the scenes "propaganda videos", saying it had received reports "authorities are forcing detainees to sign statements they have not been allowed to read and to give forced 'confessions' to crimes they did not commit as well as to peaceful acts of dissent".

The UN special rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Mai Sato, told the UN Human Rights Council that such "false confessions" seek to "reinforce the state's narrative that protesters are dangerous criminals".

Iran's feared judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei appeared to take the lead earlier this month by personally interrogating detainees in sessions broadcast by state TV.

"Coerced televised confessions in totalitarian regimes such as Iran have multiple key functions, including that of manufacturing political legitimacy, creating a false, official narrative such as framing peaceful protesters as violent agents of foreign influence, and deterring dissent," Roya Boroumand, director of the US-based Abdorrahman Boroumand Center for Human Rights in Iran, told AFP.

The demonstrations started in late December sparked by economic grievances but grew into a mass movement against the Islamic republic, with huge street protests from January 8, when authorities imposed an internet blackout.

Thousands were killed in an ensuing crackdown on the protests, which have for now abated, with the authorities blaming the unrest on Iran's enemies, including Israel and the United States.

More than 41,000 people have been arrested in the crackdown, according to the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA), which has recorded 240 instances of "forced confessions".

One video widely circulating on social media Monday showed a teen, identified by users as 18-year-old Shervin Bagherian, being questioned over the killing of a member of the security forces and then told he would face charges that could see him executed.

In another widely shared case, a man was shown admitting to having sent footage of the protests to US President Donald Trump via social media accounts.

Such broadcasts have in the past been used ahead of executions.

In one notorious case, the formerly Paris-based dissident Ruhollah Zam, who according to supporters was abducted from Iraq by Iranian security forces, was subjected to an interrogation on Iranian TV before his execution in December 2020.

Foreigners have also been subjected to the same treatment.

French citizen Cécile Kohler was shown in October 2022 on Iranian television making what activists described as a "forced confession" before being sentenced on espionage charges her family vehemently rejects.

She and fellow French citizen Jacques Paris were released late last year but are still unable to leave Iran.

The US-based Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI) said that in the wake of the protests, the forced confessions were being broadcast by Iranian state television on an "unprecedented scale".

"These false confessions are routinely used as the sole evidence to convict, including in capital cases where the death penalty may be imposed," it added.

"By forcing dissidents to publicly 'confess' to actions such as 'colluding with foreign powers', the state legitimises its repression as necessary to protect national security and, bypassing the presumption of innocence, uses the televised confessions as proof of guilt to justify severe punishment such as executions," said Boroumand.

"These broadcasts also aim at humiliating and destroying dissidents' credibility while reminding the public of the high cost of challenging the state," she added.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:29:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fcc39166-da6b-11eb-b621-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/2c47c04f7580c96190ffadb683830c7c96b80e2a.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria's Sharaa to meet Putin in Moscow on Wednesday, Syria TV says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syrias-sharaa-meet-putin-moscow-wednesday-syria-tv-says-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa will meet Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on Wednesday in Moscow, pro-government Syria TV reported on Monday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 21:47:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6IWFVYAQPZMR5BRMEVJ7EGM4AM.jpg?auth=d5f92e85d8ce78153bb90982b832c55b43f9dddee8904c7bca3ba17c4d262750&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Canadian ex-Olympic snowboarder pleads not guilty to US drug charges</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/canadian-ex-olympic-snowboarder-pleads-not-guilty-us-drug-charges-2026-01-26/</link><description>SANTA ANA, Calif., Jan 26 (Reuters) - Ryan Wedding, a Canadian former Olympic snowboarder, pleaded not guilty to charges of becoming a cocaine smuggling kingpin responsible for multiple drug-related murders in a U.S. federal court in Santa Ana, California, on Monday.

Wedding was flown to California after being arrested in Mexico City on Thursday .

Wedding, 44, is accused of leading a transnational drug trafficking network and working with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel to transport hundreds of kilograms of cocaine from Colombia through Mexico to the U.S. and Canada. He was on the FBI's "Top 10 Most Wanted" list and the U.S. government had offered a $15 million reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction.

Wedding, who competed for Canada at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, faces charges including conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiracy to commit murder and conspiracy to tamper with a witness. Prosecutors accused him of ordering several drug-related murders, including that of a U.S. federal witness in Colombia in January 2025 before he could testify against him, the department said.

Prosecutors also accuse him of directing the murders of two people and the attempted murder of a third in Ontario, Canada, in November 2023 over a stolen drug shipment, and of ordering the killing of another person in Canada in May 2024 over a drug debt.

"South Korea's Legislature is not living up to its Deal with the United States," Trump wrote on social media.

"Because the Korean Legislature hasn't enacted our Historic Trade Agreement, which is their prerogative, I am hereby increasing South Korean TARIFFS on Autos, Lumber, Pharma, and all other Reciprocal TARIFFS, from 15% to 25%."

South Korea's presidential Blue House did not have an immediate comment.

South Korea had been working to implement a deal announced with Washington in November that was going to lower U.S. tariffs against its exports. More recently, South Korea has engaged with Washington to explain Seoul's probe of U.S.-based e-commerce company Coupang (CPNG.N) , opens new tab , stemming from a mass data leak.

Trump has used the leverage of tariffs throughout his second term in office in his foreign policy. Economists have raised concerns about the approach and the policy also faces a test in an ongoing case at the U.S. Supreme Court.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:48:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4DZJ5FHR6ZIGXNUGXACCKTXK24.jpg?auth=a1f67ef66144ea8890982ba5dc72152122baf4a849a061ad5eeffc0049faab9c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US Official says Washington is open for business if Iran wishes to contact them</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-official-says-washington-is-open-business-if-iran-wishes-contact-them-2026-01-26/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The United States is "open for business" if Iran wishes to contact Washington, a U.S. official said on Monday, as the United States seeks to pressure Tehran over a government crackdown on protesters.

"I think they know the terms," the official told reporters when asked about the terms of talks with Iran. "They're aware of the terms."

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States had an "armada" heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear program.

Trump had repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations have since abated. The president said he had been told that killings were subsiding and that he believes there is currently no plan for the executions of prisoners.

A U.S. aircraft carrier and supporting warships have arrived in the Middle East, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday, expanding Trump's capabilities to defend U.S. forces, or potentially take military action against Iran.

The U.S. military has in the past surged forces into the Middle East at times of heightened tensions, moves that were often defensive.

However, the U.S. military staged a major buildup last year ahead of its June strikes against Iran's nuclear program.

Iran will treat any attack "as an all-out war against us," a senior Iranian official said on Friday.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:48:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VKTA3H3XS5IR7BWZCFTFTKEU2U.jpg?auth=52f6f8692452354272193dad4a93df2ca930890f5e4cde4bdc0956eb60ada16e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US believes Hamas disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty, US official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-believes-hamas-disarmament-comes-along-with-some-sort-amnesty-us-official-2026-01-26/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - The United States believes disarmament by Hamas militants in Gaza comes along with some sort of amnesty for the Palestinian group, a U.S. official said on Monday.

The official, speaking to reporters on condition of anonymity, spoke to mark the return of the remains of the last Israeli hostage held by Hamas. Israel and the United States are pressuring Hamas to disarm as part of a plan in which Gaza will be redeveloped.

The official said there is confidence among U.S. officials that Hamas will disarm.

"We are listening to many of their people talk about disarming. We think they're going to. If they don't disarm, then they've breached the deal. We think disarmament comes along with some sort of amnesty and candidly we think we have a very, very good program to disarm," the official said.

The Israeli embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a question on whether Israel would agree to amnesty for Hamas members if they give up their weapons.

Under President Donald Trump's 20-point Gaza plan, once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries, under the plan.

The Israeli military said on Monday that the remains of the last remaining hostage held in Gaza, police officer Ran Gvili who was held hostage for more than 840 days - have been identified and will be returned for burial.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:49:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/VHPE5BDRAJIK3G37PKTWNW4JIA.jpg?auth=ec2dcdf067d76eb83deb93433c87344743ac732e6ca7050aef7d00cbc832938e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rift at influential Silicon Valley venture firm shows tech's divide over ICE shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/rift-influential-silicon-valley-venture-firm-shows-techs-divide-over-ice-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - Heated political rhetoric over the fatal shooting of a U.S. citizen by immigration agents in Minneapolis on Saturday spilled into Silicon Valley as partners at an influential venture firm distanced themselves from a colleague who defended the killing.

The death of 37-year-old Alex Pretti was one of five shootings this month involving federal agents conducting immigration enforcement, including the fatal shooting of Minnesota woman Renee Good . At least six immigrants have died this month in federal immigration detention , an unusually rapid pace.

The Pretti shooting has drawn anger across the U.S. political spectrum as the administration of Republican President Donald Trump backed the agents even as video evidence contradicted its version of events.

The back-and-forth on social media highlights an ongoing political fracture at the heart of the U.S. tech industry where some executives have abandoned the sector's longstanding reputation for progressive social values to publicly back Trump's policies.

After Khosla Ventures partner Keith Rabois said , opens new tab on social media on Saturday that law enforcement had not shot an innocent person and that illegal immigrants commit crimes daily, the firm's founder, Vinod Khosla, and partner Ethan Choi , opens new tab both disavowed the comments. The firm is notable for having backed companies including OpenAI, DoorDash (DASH.O) , opens new tab and Instacart.

"ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) personnel must have ice water running thru their veins to treat other human beings this way," Khosla said in a post on X , opens new tab . "There is politics but humanity should transcend that," Khosla added.

Several other tech executives including Jeff Dean , opens new tab , chief scientist at Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) , opens new tab Google DeepMind AI lab, and Microsoft (MSFT.O) , opens new tab Chief Scientific Officer Eric Horvitz , opens new tab praised Pretti, who was an intensive-care nurse at a Veterans Affairs hospital.

Billionaire Elon Musk has led the charge to the politically conservative right, with hundreds of millions of dollars in campaign donations to Trump's 2024 campaign and support for his anti-immigration moves. This has led to public clashes with the likes of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, a major Democratic donor.

Musk has not commented on the Pretti shooting, while Hoffman echoed Khosla's message that humanity should transcend politics.

Wary of government retaliation, tech executives have spent the past year largely silent on policies impacting their businesses including the chaos surrounding the H-1B visa program and U.S tariffs.

Executives have instead sought to improve ties with Trump, contributing millions to his inauguration a year ago and backing his manufacturing push with tens of billions in pledged spending, which some analysts have called empty posturing.

Urging tech CEOs to break their silence, more than 450 employees from firms such as Google, Meta Platforms (META.O) , opens new tab , Salesforce (CRM.N) , opens new tab and OpenAI signed a letter on Saturday , opens new tab urging their top executives to pressure the White House to withdraw ICE from U.S. cities, cancel all contracts with ICE and to speak out publicly against ICE's violence.

"The wanton brutality ... has removed any credibility that these actions are about immigration enforcement. Their goal is terror, cruelty, and suppression of dissent," they said in the letter.

The workers noted that Trump had said he refrained from deploying federal agents to San Francisco after Nvidia (NVDA.O) , opens new tab CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff advised against the action.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 22:50:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OV7DDB5ZVBMTLM2QRPFW4ILOYA.jpg?auth=7ecb75acbc18d6811e431bab6ef90d55bf856e865bb708fa0176eb33f2886ef1&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hezbollah says Israeli strike killed Al-Manar TV presenter in southern Lebanon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/hezbollah-says-israeli-strike-killed-al-manar-tv-presenter-southern-lebanon-2026-01-26/</link><description>Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Lebanese armed group Hezbollah said on Monday that an Israeli strike in the country's south killed TV presenter Ali Nour al-Din, who worked for the group's affiliated Al-Manar television station.

The group said the killing portends "the danger of Israel's extended escalations (in Lebanon) to include the media community".

The Israeli military said later on Monday that al-Din was a Hezbollah militant who recently worked to rehabilitate the group's artillery capabilities in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Lebanon agreed to a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in 2024 to end more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which culminated in Israeli strikes that severely weakened the Iran-backed militant group. Since then, the sides have traded accusations over ceasefire violations.

Lebanon has faced growing pressure from the U.S. and Israel to disarm Hezbollah. The group's leaders fear that Israel could dramatically escalate strikes across the battered country, aiming to push the Lebanese government for quicker action to confiscate Hezbollah's arsenal.</description><pubDate>Mon, 26 Jan 2026 23:23:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump threatens to raise tariffs on South Korean goods to 25 percent</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260127-trump-threatens-to-raise-tariffs-on-south-korean-goods-to-25-percent</link><description>US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would raise tariffs on South Korean goods including autos, lumber and pharmaceuticals, taking aim at the country for “not living up to” an earlier trade pact struck with Washington.

The increase would bring tariff levels from 15 percent to 25 percent.

“South Korea’s legislature is not living up to its deal with the United States,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.

He added that he was increasing tariff rates “because the Korean legislature hasn’t enacted our historic trade agreement, which is their prerogative”.

South Korea ’s presidential office said it had not been informed about the tariff hike plans in advance.

It said Trade Minister Kim Jung-kwan, currently in Canada , would head to Washington for talks on the issue with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.

Trump’s apparent about-face comes months after Washington and Seoul struck a trade and security deal, capping a period of tense negotiations.

The agreement was finalised after Trump met his South Korean counterpart Lee Jae Myung in October and included investment promises by South Korea alongside tariff cuts by the United States.

Under the pact, Washington would maintain levies of up to 15 percent on South Korean goods including vehicles, car parts and pharmaceuticals.

Crucially, the deal’s terms brought US tariffs on South Korean cars down from a 25 percent level.

Trump’s latest threat, if enacted, would reverse that.

The auto industry accounts for 27 percent of South Korea’s exports to the United States , which takes in nearly half of the country’s car exports.

A reversal to a higher tariff level could also put South Korean exports at a disadvantage compared with economies such as Japan and the European Union , which have both struck deals for a 15 percent US tariff.

The Trump administration has yet to issue formal notices to enact the changes.

The US president’s threat targeting South Korea is his latest against key trading partners in recent days.

Over the weekend, Trump warned Canada that if it concludes a trade deal with China , he would impose a 100 percent tariff on all goods coming across the border.

Earlier in January, Trump also threatened to slap tariffs on multiple European nations until his purchase of Greenland is achieved. He has since backed off the threat.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 01:53:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/e73d5c04-fac9-11f0-bcc6-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-26T093638Z-2099064647-RC29HHABFS6W-RTRMADP-3-USA-TRUMP-AFGHANISTAN-GERMANY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In possible thaw, Trump and Minnesota's governor talk after fatal shooting</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-send-border-czar-homan-minnesota-2026-01-26/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 26 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz each struck a conciliatory tone on Monday after a private phone call in a sign the two sides were seeking to defuse a crisis over the Trump-ordered deportation drive that has claimed the lives of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis.

In another apparent signal of a thaw in the standoff, a senior Trump administration official confirmed reports that Gregory Bovino, a top U.S. Border Patrol official who has been a lightning rod for criticism from Democrats and civil liberties activists, will be leaving Minnesota along with some of the Border Patrol agents deployed to the Midwestern state.

The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Trump's designated border czar, Tom Homan, would be tasked with overseeing the Minnesota operations. Trump said earlier in the day that Homan was being dispatched to Minnesota.

Later on Monday, a different person familiar with the matter said Bovino has been removed from his role as Border Patrol "commander at large" and will return to his former job as a chief patrol agent along California's El Centro sector of the U.S.-Mexico border. The source said he would then soon retire.

Another source confirmed Bovino would return to the El Centro sector but did not provide further details.

Word of Bovino's demotion was first reported by The Atlantic on Monday, citing an official from the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and two other people with knowledge of the change. The Atlantic also said Bovino was expected to retire soon.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin disputed those reports, posting on X: "Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties."

Following his phone call with Walz, Trump said he was "on a similar wavelength" with the Democratic governor, weeks after ordering thousands of heavily armed federal immigration agents to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area in a deportation drive over the staunch opposition of state and local authorities.

Walz's office said he and Trump held a "productive call" in which the president said he would consider reducing the number of immigration agents in the state. He said Trump also agreed to direct the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to ensure that the state could conduct its own investigation into the Pretti shooting.

Trump and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey also said they had spoken together by telephone. Writing on his social media platform Truth Social, the president said that "lots of progress" was being made following their discussion.

Frey said Trump had "agreed the present situation can't continue," adding that it was understood that some federal agents "will begin leaving" the Twin Cities on Tuesday.

The unexpected burst of telephone diplomacy came two days after a 37-year-old intensive-care-unit nurse, Alex Pretti, was shot and killed by federal agents on a Minneapolis street during a confrontation between the immigration officers and protesters.

The killing of Pretti, the second U.S. citizen fatally shot by immigration agents since the Trump administration deployed a force of 3,000 federal officers to the Minneapolis-St. Paul area several weeks ago, has prompted a sharp public backlash against the mass deportation operation. Opinion polls show waning support for Trump's immigration enforcement tactics.

A new Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Monday showed some 58% of poll respondents said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents have gone "too far" in their crackdown, while 12% said they had not gone far enough and 26% said the agents' efforts were "about right."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:48:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ACGLVBHV45IEZBAHFBNNB3Y3NE.jpg?auth=c3e00e0b6651a858509ee04727505adb9bc8ef3f99ea28749975b52c1a4b7cf4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fearing China clash, Japan asks fishermen to avoid flashpoint islands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/fearing-china-clash-japan-asks-fishermen-avoid-flashpoint-islands-2026-01-27/</link><description>ISHIGAKI, Japan, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hitoshi Nakama, 76, sees himself as a frontline defender of Japan's claims to disputed islands in the East China Sea, where he regularly evades Chinese coast guard ships to harvest the bountiful waters.

But since late last year, some Japanese officials have been discreetly urging Nakama and his peers to steer clear of the remote outcrops - known as Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China - to avoid escalating a diplomatic clash with Beijing , according to Nakama and three other people with knowledge of the requests.

The requests, reported for the first time by Reuters, signal an abrupt shift after years in which Tokyo tacitly accepted such trips, used by some fishermen as a way to assert Japan's control of the uninhabited islets and surrounding seas.

The islands, administered by Japan but also claimed by China, have long been a flashpoint in relations between the two Asian powers. Ties have deteriorated since Japanese leader Sanae Takaichi angered China in November by commenting on how Tokyo might respond to a Chinese attack on Taiwan.

U.S. President Donald Trump later that month asked Takaichi, a staunch nationalist who became prime minister in October, not to further inflame the tensions . Reuters couldn't determine whether the pleas to the fishermen were ordered by Takaichi or linked to the appeal from the United States, Japan's security backer.

Takaichi's office and Japan's foreign ministry declined to address questions about the requests to fishermen. The foreign ministry said in a statement that the islands were an inherent part of Japan's territory and that it had repeatedly lodged diplomatic protests over Chinese incursions.

The warnings issued to fishermen illustrate a catch-22 for Tokyo: Fishing underlines Japan's control of the islands but risks triggering a more serious confrontation with Chinese coast guard vessels that could escalate rapidly, according to more than a dozen people interviewed by Reuters, including fishermen, Japanese officials and security analysts. Yet a pullback may lead China to more assertively press its claims, some of these people said.

China's foreign ministry told Reuters some right-wing Japanese had repeatedly entered the waters of the islands "in the name of 'fishing' to provoke and cause trouble", adding that maritime issues should be addressed through dialogue and consultation.

A Trump administration official declined to address questions about the president's November call with Takaichi but said the U.S. opposed unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East China Sea.

As tensions with China flared in November, the pleas to fishermen began.

Hiroaki Hayashi, a businessman who chairs a nationalist group that helps fund Nakama's fishing trips, told Reuters he received a request from a Japanese coast guard official to stop Nakama from going on a planned voyage at the end of that month. Nakama reluctantly opted to steer clear, Hayashi said.

Another fisherman, Kazushi Kinjo, 53, said he had been planning to fish around the islands during a week-long voyage that started on November 26. But just before he set sail, and while at sea, he received calls from multiple officials urging him to avoid the Senkaku islands.

"They've never said anything like that to me before," he said, declining to identify the officials. Kinjo said he briefly transited the waters around the islands on the way back to his home port but didn't stop to fish.

A few weeks later, Finance Minister Satsuki Katayama - previously an adviser to the Senkaku Islands Defence Association, the nationalist group that supports Nakama - hosted the fisherman in Tokyo on December 19.

During their 20-minute meeting, she asked about his previous visits to the islands and remarked that "small incidents can grow bigger and lead to war", Nakama said. He interpreted the message as a request to stay away, though she didn't say so directly, he said.

"What she was really saying was that she didn't want me to go," Nakama told Reuters as small waves rocked his boat in his home port of Ishigaki, where he serves as a local councillor.

Katayama's office declined to comment on the meeting. The Japan Coast Guard said it informs relevant parties about the security situation in waters surrounding the islands as necessary, but declined to discuss specifics.

Ishigaki Mayor Yoshitaka Nakayama said Japanese officials appeared concerned about the risk that fishermen could be detained or subjected to inspections by Chinese authorities during a period of heightened tensions with Beijing.

"If someone should actually be detained it would escalate into a much bigger international issue, so I think that is what the government wants to avoid," he told Reuters at his office.

China in recent years has stepped up efforts to enforce its sweeping maritime claims, notably in repeated confrontations with Philippine vessels in which Chinese coast guard ships used water cannons , opens new tab .

The last major maritime dispute between China and Japan erupted in 2010, after Japan's coast guard detained the captain of a Chinese fishing boat that collided with Japanese vessels near the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands. Relations soured further in 2012 when Japan nationalised several of the then-privately owned islands.

Washington has committed to defending the islands under its security treaty with Japan, meaning any clash there risks drawing in the United States.

"It's kind of the touch paper for further deterioration between Japan and China, because China is really pushing its claims on the islands. It is phenomenally tense around there at the moment," said Robert Ward, Japan chair at the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS).

Chinese coast guard ships were spotted near the islands on a record 357 days last year, according to Japan's coast guard. The islands lie more than 300 kilometres from mainland China, about 150 kilometres from Japan's nearest inhabited territory, and about 170 kilometres from Taiwan, which also claims them.

Fishing has long been associated with the islands.

After Japan first claimed them in the late 19th century, a skipjack tuna processing plant was established on the main Uotsuri Island until it was abandoned in the 1930s.

In 1977, before Beijing began more assertively pressing its claims and scaring off fishermen, there were at least 164 Japanese fishing trips to the islands, according to a Japanese government-commissioned research report.

Last year, there were only eight documented visits by Japanese fishing vessels, down from 18 in 2024, according to the Japan Coast Guard.

Nakama and his nationalist backers say they are determined to reverse the decline in fishing around the islands, arguing that such activity helps demonstrate Japan's control.

Paul Midford, a professor of international studies at Meiji Gakuin University in Yokohama, said while that argument has merit, it can lead to escalation as both sides try to outdo each other to demonstrate control.

Yet a complete lack of Japanese economic activity could invite China to flood the area with its own ships, said IISS's Ward. "The need for Japan to keep showing it has a pulse in the Senkaku Islands is really important," he said.

Kinjo said his motivation is money, not politics.

"I earn my income there... a substantial income," he said, describing the seas as a treasure trove of red snapper, a local delicacy.

While rough winter seas may help keep fishermen away for now, Kinjo and Nakama said they were determined to return soon, despite the risks.

"I'll go there for as long as I have this boat. I'll keep on going," Nakama said, as he sat on an ice box on the deck of his ship.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:48:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JYCZYFJ5TNK6VPP3JEE7IRTW5I.jpg?auth=8be81778698de4cf9ca350007f8f25134023a2309caff9122524a7739b9b25f4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan-US alliance would crumble if Tokyo ignored Taiwan crisis, PM Takaichi says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japan-us-alliance-would-crumble-if-tokyo-ignored-taiwan-crisis-pm-takaichi-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan's strategic alliance with the U.S. would collapse if Tokyo were to turn away from a conflict in Taiwan, but distanced herself from previous comments that suggested a possible military response in such an event.

Takaichi expressed her latest views on a nationally broadcast TV programme late on Monday, where an opposition party leader criticised her for igniting tensions with China with the earlier remarks.

Ties between Japan and China have sunk to the worst level in years after Takaichi said in November that a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response. Beijing has responded with export curbs, flight cancellations and vitriolic commentaries, repeatedly demanding a retraction.

China claims sovereignty over the democratically-governed island of Taiwan.

“I want to make it absolutely clear that this is not about Japan going out and taking military action if China and the United States come into conflict (over Taiwan)," Takaichi said on the live TV show, referring to the comments she made in parliament in November.

"If something serious happens there, we would have to go to rescue the Japanese and American citizens in Taiwan. In that situation, there may be cases where we take joint action.

"And if the U.S. forces, acting jointly with us, come under attack and Japan does nothing and simply runs away, the Japan–U.S. alliance would collapse. So we would respond strictly within the limits of the law — within the limits of the laws as they currently exist — while making a comprehensive judgment based on what is happening on the ground."

Takaichi did not elaborate.

With an eye on the electorate, Takaichi has stopped short of retracting the remarks from November, saying her stance was consistent with Japan's long-standing policy. She has also said that China’s characterisation of her remarks was inconsistent with the facts.

Japan's pacifist constitution prohibits direct military action but allows it to exercise the right of collective self-defence, or defending the United States or another friendly country that comes under attack, in cases where Japan faces a "threat to its survival."

Takaichi has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking office in October 2025 and has called a snap election on February 8, hoping to capitalise on her popularity.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:49:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MWFJRP4QE5NE7L7PCHTAVAJN4Y.jpg?auth=fbb8fc94cdd054609e384170d42ff25a005177a3e35c413723e314645d752f47&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia heatwave raises bushfire threat as Melbourne braces for hottest day in 17 years</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/australia-heatwave-raises-bushfire-threat-melbourne-braces-hottest-day-17-years-2026-01-27/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A major heatwave across Australia's southeast raised bushfire threats, with Melbourne forecast to record its hottest day in nearly 17 years on Tuesday, and hundreds of residents in rural towns were ordered to immediately evacuate their homes.

Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said the temperature in Melbourne could hit 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) with severe to extreme heatwave conditions expected to peak on Tuesday and Wednesday, before gradually easing later in the week.

The heatwave has raised the fire danger across Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, where a fast-moving bushfire in the Otways region has burned about 10,000 hectares (24,000 acres).

Officials warned that strong winds forecast for later in the day could further spread the blaze, threatening homes.

"It's the change that's going to come through about 5 p.m. (0600 GMT) with some really punchy winds that is likely to do most of the damage and drive that fire further," Country Fire Authority Chief Officer Jason Heffernan told ABC News.

Emergency services have doorknocked about 1,100 homes and sent text messages to around 10,000 phones urging residents to leave the region, Heffernan said.

Total fire bans were declared across Victoria, as officials tried to lower the risk of new fires.

Organisers of the Australian Open tennis Grand Slam in Melbourne said matches on the outside courts and roof closures would follow its extreme heat condition protocols. Wheelchair matches have been postponed to Wednesday.

In inland towns, the temperature is expected to reach the high-40s. The town of Ouyen, with a population of just over 1,000 and 440 km (273 miles) northwest of Melbourne, is likely to touch 49 degrees Celsius (120.2 Fahrenheit), the weather bureau said.

Local butcher Nathan Grayling told ABC Radio that he would try to keep his business as dark and cool as possible, with most residents expected to stay indoors.

"If we get everything done, we might knock off early and go down the local pub for a beer," Grayling said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:50:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines, U.S. hold joint sail in disputed South China Sea shoal</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/philippines-us-hold-joint-sail-disputed-south-china-sea-shoal-2026-01-27/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Philippine and U.S. militaries sailed together at a disputed South China Sea shoal this week, Manila's armed forces said on Tuesday, performing joint exercises to boost interoperability between the two treaty allies.

The joint sail was held in the Scarborough Shoal in South China Sea waters lying within the Philippines' exclusive economic zone, which China also claims as part of its territory. It was the 11th "maritime cooperative activity" involving the United States and the Philippines since November 2023 .

"The successful conduct of these activities enhanced coordination, tactical proficiency, and mutual understanding between allied forces," the Philippine armed forces said in a statement.

The joint sail showcased the Philippines' frigate Antonio Luna, a Philippine coast guard offshore patrol vessel, as well as two military planes and a helicopter.

The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command deployed the USS John Finn, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer and an MH-60R Seahawk helicopter.

Military engagements between the treaty allies have soared under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has pivoted closer to Washington in response to China's growing presence in the South China Sea.

China claims sovereignty over nearly all the South China Sea, including parts of the exclusive economic zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:50:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rescue efforts under way after Philippine ferry sinks, leaving 18 dead</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/rescue-efforts-under-way-after-philippine-ferry-sinks-leaving-18-dead-2026-01-26/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Search and rescue operations continued on Tuesday for 10 people still missing after a passenger boat capsized off a southern Philippine province, with the death toll rising slightly to 18, the Philippine Coast Guard said.

Captain Noemie Cayabyab, a spokesperson at the PCG, said the total number of people on board had been revised to 344, down from the earlier figure of 359, after verifying that 15 people listed on the manifest did not board the vessel.

The number of rescued passengers remained at 316, Cayabyab told reporters.

The accident occurred at 1:50 a.m. (1750 GMT) on Monday while the passenger vessel, MV Trisha Kerstin 3, was en route to Jolo in Sulu province after departing from Zamboanga. The PCG said the vessel has an authorised passenger capacity of 352.

The PCG said it was not yet prepared to conclude why the ferry sank, with the investigation still ongoing.

Sea accidents are common in the Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands with a patchy maritime safety record.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:51:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/FOLHBEEHXJNRLOIGJBNBIMZKEU.jpg?auth=83687700548717eca58693d8a9be4eb1708853eec76e1ff41a9d900c98e28bcf&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gavin Newsom accuses TikTok of suppressing content critical of Trump</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260127-gavin-newsom-accuses-tiktok-of-suppressing-content-critical-of-trump</link><description>California Governor Gavin Newsom accused TikTok on Monday of suppressing content critical of President Donald Trump as he launched a review of the platform’s content moderation practices to determine whether they violated state law.

The step comes after TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, said it had finalised a deal to set up a majority US-owned joint venture that will secure US data, to avoid a US ban on the short video app used by more than 200 million Americans.

“Following TikTok ’s sale to a Trump-aligned business group, our office has received reports, and independently confirmed instances, of suppressed content critical of President Trump,” Newsom’s office said on X, without elaborating.

“Gavin Newsom is launching a review of this conduct and is calling on the California Department of Justice to determine whether it violates California law,” it added.

The White House and TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Newsom, a Democrat , and Trump, a Republican , have long been critical of each other.

Last week’s TikTok deal was a milestone for the firm after years of battles with the US government over Washington’s concerns about risks to national security and privacy under Trump and former president Joe Biden .

ByteDance said TikTok USDS Joint Venture LLC would secure US user data, apps and algorithms through data privacy and cybersecurity measures, in a deal praised by Trump.

With more than 16 million followers on his personal TikTok account, Trump credited the app with helping him win the 2024 election.

The deal provides for American and global investors to hold 80.1% of the venture, while ByteDance will own 19.9%.

Each of the joint venture’s three managing investors – cloud computing giant Oracle, private equity group Silver Lake and Abu Dhabi-based investment firm MGX – will hold a stake of 15%.

The US and Chinese governments had signed off on the deal, a White House official said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:51:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/974766ca-ba16-11f0-ac6d-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25309178500980.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICC judges rule former Philippine president Duterte fit for trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260127-icc-judges-rule-former-philippine-president-duterte-fit-for-trial</link><description>Judges at the International Criminal Court have ruled that former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte , 80, is fit to attend pre-trial hearings and will hold a confirmation of charges hearing on February 23, the court said on Monday.

His defence had argued that Duterte, who is being held in The Hague over murders committed during his war on drugs , could not stand trial due to cognitive decline.

Judges said in a statement that a report by independent medical experts found that Duterte would be able to understand and participate in his case.

They recalled that, for someone to be deemed fit to take part in proceedings, it is sufficient that they have a broad understanding of the procedures, not that they operate at their highest level.

“The Chamber is satisfied, in law, that Mr Duterte is able effectively to exercise his procedural rights and is therefore fit to take part in the pre-trial proceedings,” the judges said.

It is rare for international courts to find suspects, even elderly ones, wholly unfit for trial. The ICC has never found a suspect unfit to stand trial, despite petitions from several other defendants.

Duterte served as president of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022 and was arrested and taken to The Hague last March.

Duterte’s counsel, Nicholas Kaufman, said in a statement that the defence was disappointed after being denied the chance to present its own medical evidence and to question the findings in court.

“The defence will seek leave to appeal this decision and argue that Mr Duterte was denied due process,” Kaufman said.

According to ICC prosecutors, Duterte created, funded and armed death squads during his war on drugs, when thousands of alleged narcotics peddlers and users were killed.

Judges also set a new date for his confirmation of charges hearing. Prosecutors want to charge Duterte with three counts of murder as a crime against humanity involving more than 75 victims, but under the ICC system judges must confirm the charges after separate hearings before the case can move to trial.

According to police, 6,200 suspects were killed during anti-drug operations under Duterte’s presidency. Activists say the real toll was far higher, and the ICC prosecutor has said as many as 30,000 people may have died.

Duterte has long insisted he instructed police to kill only in self-defence and has consistently defended the crackdown, repeatedly telling supporters he was ready to “rot in jail” if it meant ridding the Philippines of illicit drugs.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 03:51:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/2ad07288-3024-11f0-8979-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/000_46DE29D.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Carney walked back Davos comments in call with Trump, US treasury chief says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/canadas-carney-walked-back-davos-comments-call-with-trump-bessent-tells-fox-news-2026-01-27/</link><description>OTTAWA/ WASHINGTON, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, in a call with U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday, "aggressively" walked back some of the comments he made during a speech in Davos last week, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday.

"I was in the Oval (Office) with the president today. He spoke to Prime Minister Carney, who was very aggressively walking back some of the unfortunate remarks he made at Davos," Bessent said in an interview on Fox News' "Hannity" program.

Carney, whose office did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Monday, received a rare standing ovation in Davos for a speech in which he urged nations to accept the end of a rules-based global order.

After Carney's speech, Trump revoked Canada's invitation to join a so-called Board of Peace that the U.S. president says aims to resolve global conflicts. Trump also threatened on Saturday to impose a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa followed through on a trade deal with U.S. rival China .

At the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, Carney called on nations to accept that a rules-based global order was over and pointed to Canada as an example of how "middle powers" might act together to avoid being victimized by American hegemony.

Carney, during his speech in Davos, Switzerland, did not directly call out Trump or the U.S. by name. However, the prime minister said "middle powers must act together because if you are not at the table, you are on the menu."

Many world leaders and industry titans present responded with a standing ovation. Trump was critical of that speech.

"Of course, Canada depends on the U.S.," Bessent said in his interview.

The Canadian prime minister traveled this month to China to reset the countries' strained relationship and reached a trade deal with Canada's second-biggest trading partner after the U.S.

Bessent said on Monday "it would be a disaster for Canada" if Trump imposed further tariffs on Canadian goods.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 04:49:33 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PHANO5NMQZNRFCIP7IE3CIDTEM.jpg?auth=50f2bcf106d8a85b0c186a8f89acc4a7296953a36b98ebdaacdab4a5ba0b88e6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: Why has President Trump threatened to raise US tariffs on South Korea again?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/why-has-president-trump-threatened-raise-us-tariffs-south-korea-again-2026-01-27/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he was hiking tariffs on autos and other goods imported from South Korea to 25%, citing Seoul's failure to legislate a trade deal agreed last year that capped U.S. levies on the items at 15%.

It was not immediately clear what prompted Trump's outburst on social media platform Truth Social on Monday, but South Korea has faced delays implementing the deal and there has also been tension over perceived mistreatment of U.S. technology firms.

Under the deal that Trump and President Lee Jae Myung agreed when the U.S. leader visited South Korea in October 2025, Seoul pledged $350 billion of investments into strategic U.S. industries in return for tariffs being capped at 15%.

South Korean Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol this month told Reuters, however, "it is unlikely" that the investment could begin in the first half of this year, citing administrative reasons and currency market volatility.

Any investment decisions will need to follow a multi-layered governance structure involving the project management committee, orchestrated by South Korea's trade and finance ministers, who will then evaluate commercial viability and legal alignment.

The won's near 7% decline against the dollar in the past six months has been a major source of concern for the country's financial authorities, prompting them to verbally support the South Korean currency several times as it approaches levels unseen since the global financial crisis.

Authorities are worried that the planned $350 billion outflow of funds to the U.S. could further weaken the won. In his interview with Reuters on January 16, Finance Minister Koo said "not a lot (of investment) can be made under the current forex situation, at least for this year."

Bank of Korea Governor Rhee Chang-yong also said this month he would not agree to any investment outflows to the U.S. if currency markets became unstable.

For the U.S. trade deal, the South Korean government plans to establish a fund to raise foreign currency without destabilising the onshore dollar-won market, a step that needs a special law to be enacted through the National Assembly.

Debate had initially swirled over the need for parliamentary approval, with some officials arguing it was unnecessary since the memorandum of understanding with the United States was non-binding.

Some South Korean lawmakers demanded the bill be pushed through a fast-track process, a mechanism that allows bills to be voted on quickly, but given the scale of the investment involved the idea was opposed by many.

On November 26, the ruling Democratic Party submitted a bill to establish a policy investment vehicle and to define the fund's governance and operating rules, but the bill has been sitting at the parliament's standing committee for two months due to disagreements among lawmakers.

Although President Lee's Democratic Party holds the majority in the 300-member parliament, the bill must pass through the finance committee, which is currently chaired by the opposition People's Power Party.

On Tuesday, the finance ministry said it planned to ask parliament for cooperation and the ruling party said it was ready to work with the opposition to speed up the bill's passage.

Japan and South Korea had both agreed separate but somewhat similar trade framework deals with Washington last July, but Tokyo has implemented the agreement more quickly.

Japan's parliament approved its U.S. trade pact on December 3 and held the first panel consultation to discuss the first project on December 23 to kick-start Tokyo's planned $550 billion U.S. investment.
WHAT OTHER TRADE FRICTIONS ARE THERE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND SOUTH KOREA?

A source familiar with the internal U.S.-South Korea discussions cited the perceived mistreatment of U.S. tech companies as a trigger point.

A major data breach late last year at Coupang (CPNG.N) , opens new tab , a U.S.-listed e-commerce company operating in South Korea, has escalated into a dispute that now threatens to hurt broader trade relations between the countries.

Coupang, South Korea's largest online retailer, alleges that the country's regulators singled out the company with public criticism and raids, wiping out market value in a loss for U.S. investors.

South Korean Prime Minister Kim Min-Seok used his meeting with U.S. Vice President JD Vance in Washington last week to deny allegations of discriminatory treatment of the company.

Vance requested that the issue be managed well by the two governments to avoid misunderstanding and escalation, Kim said after the meeting.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:27:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XLDF45OT4FK6HM7UL6SFJKHLPI.jpg?auth=00715a4f4f109202695a33540a5cb57775c49483c497a069a5fe1e51f38875b0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Twenty-three soldiers died in Indonesia's West Java landslides, official says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/twenty-three-soldiers-died-indonesias-west-java-landslides-official-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Twenty-three soldiers trapped in landslides in Indonesia's West Java have been confirmed dead, a navy spokesperson said on Tuesday.

The decision was unanimously agreed during the House's plenary session on Tuesday, said deputy house speaker Saan Mustopa.

On Monday, a parliamentary commission overseeing finance had endorsed Thomas as the new deputy governor, eliminating two other career central bankers.

"Hopefully this mandate can be carried out with integrity and wisdom also give significant contribution in strengthening monetary policy, maintaining financial stability, and supporting sustainable economic growth," Mustofa said.

After the appointment, Thomas will be formally sworn in by the Supreme Court, though the timing is still unclear.

Thomas’s nomination had already sparked investor concerns about the independence of Bank Indonesia, driving the rupiah to a record low of 16,985 per dollar last week. It later recovered after BI kept rates unchanged in an effort to shore up the currency.

When asked about the market's concerns on Monday, Thomas said he can only be judged on his work, adding that he had already resigned from Prabowo's Gerindra party in December.

He also emphasised the importance of "synergy" between the central bank, fiscal policymakers and other authorities in supporting the country's economic growth. But he stressed that nothing should compromise the central bank's independence.

"The law (which regulates) Bank Indonesia's independence is very strong," he said. "Second, I went through all the processes required by the law."

Misbakhun said Thomas was approved because he was seen as a figure who "can be accepted by all parties" and has the vision of creating synergy between fiscal and monetary policies.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 05:28:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5PPJNLI3VFLF3ENLF42J3ZW34I.jpg?auth=2c46ef6be20b41bc4396e77d9988085d7a1ab2e72e17c3c46490410c83aa1f17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Xi says China, Finland should uphold international system, advance multipolar order</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-says-china-finland-should-uphold-international-system-advance-multipolar-2026-01-27/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China's President Xi Jinping told Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo on Tuesday that Beijing was ready to work with Helsinki to uphold a U.N.-centred international system and advance a multipolar world based on economic globalisation, according to state news agency Xinhua.

Xi also said Beijing hoped Finland would play a constructive role in promoting the healthy and stable development of China-EU relations, Xinhua reported.

Orpo's visit to China comes as U.S. President Donald Trump's volatile foreign policy decisions and confrontational approach toward allies push European countries to diversify their foreign relations.

It also comes amid heightened attention on Arctic security at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week, after Trump's threat to seize Greenland and prevent China and Russia from expanding their influence in the region.

Those threats appeared to have eased after Trump said the U.S. had secured permanent access to the Danish territory, but Arctic security remains a growing strategic concern for Finland, its NATO partners and China.

The Arctic is becoming increasingly important to international trade as shrinking ice packs open up new and faster shipping routes, cutting transit times between Asia and Europe nearly in half.

Speaking on the sidelines of Davos last week, Finland's President Alexander Stubb said he wanted NATO to agree to an Arctic security deal at its July summit, similar to the big increase in defence spending that it committed to last year.

One-third of Finland's territory lies above the Arctic Circle, while China calls itself a "near-Arctic state" and has ambitions to build a "Polar Silk Road".

Xi also called on Tuesday for the two sides to collaborate more in areas including energy transition, agriculture, and forestry, and welcomed Finnish enterprises to "swim freely" in the "vast ocean" of China's market.

Orpo, who is in Beijing from January 25 to 28, told Xi that he looked forward to continued discussions on bilateral cooperation and international issues.

Orpo referenced the "candid and constructive talks" Xi had with Finland's president during his 2024 state visit to Beijing.

In talks with Xi, Stubb raised an ongoing string of incidents involving damage to undersea power cables, gas pipelines and telecoms in which Chinese-registered ships have been implicated. A Chinese ship captain is facing allegations of criminal damage in a Hong Kong court in one of the cases.

Stubb also raised the issue of North Korean support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which he said NATO and the EU considered a provocation.

Orpo reiterated Stubb's invitation to Xi to visit Finland at a mutually convenient time, and said Finland's speaker of parliament Jussi Halla-aho had invited top lawmaker Zhao Leji to visit.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:38:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZSVDSLAZJNJJVBYTRI6O2UIEM4.jpg?auth=2b109c62635e88f20691c0554c6e307e3ee5fe0e7e6ed1ecef834bfcc3079e92&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel to seek new security deal with the US, FT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/israel-seek-new-security-deal-with-us-ft-reports-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - Israel is preparing for talks with the Trump administration on a new 10-year security deal, seeking to extend U.S. military support even as Israeli leaders signal they are planning for a future with reduced American cash grants, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

Gil Pinchas, speaking to the FT before stepping down as chief financial adviser to Israel's military and defence ministry, said Israel would seek to prioritise joint military and defence projects over cash handouts in talks that he expected to take place in the coming weeks.

The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment outside regular business hours.

"The partnership is more important than just the net financial issue in this context  ... there are a lot of things that are equal to money," Pinchas told the FT. "The view of this needs to be wider."

Pinchas said pure financial support - or "free money" - worth $3.3 billion a year, which Israel can use to purchase U.S. weapons, was "one component of the MOU (that) could decrease gradually."

In 2016, the U.S. and Israeli governments signed a memorandum of understanding for the 10 years through September 2028 that provides $38 billion in military aid, $33 billion in grants to buy military equipment and $5 billion for missile defence systems.

Earlier this month, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped to "taper off" Israeli dependence on U.S. military aid in the next decade.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:38:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PD6YXQ7XWZOMLBBWYYWUKJUSJU.jpg?auth=d174b0ab71f225df9bf1107999665dec554e9bbf3ab0a5a5bd514605216f608a&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US links security guarantees for Ukraine to peace deal ceding Donbas, FT reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-links-security-guarantees-ukraine-peace-deal-ceding-donbas-ft-reports-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Trump administration has signalled to Ukraine that U.S. security guarantees depend on Kyiv agreeing to a peace deal likely requiring it to cede the Donbas region to Russia, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing eight people familiar with the talks.

Washington has also indicated it could offer Ukraine more weapons to strengthen its peacetime army if Kyiv agreed to withdraw forces from the parts of the eastern region it controls, the newspaper said.

Reuters could not immediately verify the report. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Sunday that a U.S. document on security guarantees for Ukraine was " 100% ready " and Kyiv is now awaiting a time and place for it to be signed.

Zelenskiy has consistently said that Ukraine's territorial integrity must be upheld in any peace deal to end the war.

Ukraine is increasingly uncertain whether Washington will commit to security guarantees, a senior Ukrainian official told the Financial Times, saying the U.S. "stops each time the security guarantees can be signed."

Kyiv wants the guarantees confirmed before conceding any territory. However, the U.S. believes Ukraine must give up the Donbas for the war to end and is not pressuring Russian President Vladimir Putin to drop that demand, the report added.

"This is totally false — the US's only role in the peacemaking process is to bring both sides together to make a deal," Anna Kelly, the deputy White House press secretary, told FT.

A person familiar with the U.S. position told the newspaper that Washington was "not trying to force any territorial concessions upon Ukraine," adding that security guarantees depend on both sides agreeing to a peace deal.

The Kremlin said on Monday the question of territory remained fundamental to any deal to end the fighting in Ukraine, the TASS news agency reported after weekend talks in Abu Dhabi.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:38:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QDEOARKAI5J7HLJTFD6TEAA6GM.jpg?auth=22ff80174d58fc9c248f7c11512d406e9bdd0e0b5f3c3164f5c8f249d61971d3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Extreme cold, relentless snowfall grip millions in wake of deadly US storm</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260126-extreme-cold-grips-millions-as-us-digs-out-of-deadly-snowstorm</link><description>Perilously cold temperatures threatened millions of Americans Monday in the wake of a sprawling winter storm that left at least 23 people dead as it knocked out power and paralysed transportation.

A frigid, life-threatening Arctic air mass could delay recovery as municipalities from New Mexico to Maine tried to dig out following the storm, which dropped a vicious cocktail of heavy snow and wind, along with freezing rain and sleet.

Forecasters warned that much of the northern half of the country will see temperatures that are "continuously below freezing through February 1", and "record low temperatures tonight across the South are particularly dangerous in the wake of the weekend winter storm with many still without power", the National Weather Service said in an X post.

While skies began clearing in parts of the country, relentless snowfall in the northeast meant parts of Connecticut saw over 56 centimetres of snow, with more than 40.6 centimetres recorded in Boston, Massachusetts.

The storm was linked to at least 23 deaths, according to a compilation of state government and local media reports, with causes including hypothermia as well as accidents related to traffic, sledging, ATVs and snowplows.

One man was found in the snow unresponsive with a shovel in his hand.

In New York City, eight more people were found dead amid plummeting temperatures, and an investigation to determine the causes was underway. It was not known if all of these fatalities were storm-related.

Electricity began blinking back on across the south, but as of Monday evening, well over 550,000 customers remained without it, according to the tracking site Poweroutage.com.

Tennessee, Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana — southern states unaccustomed to intense winter weather — were especially impacted.

Approximately 190 million people in the United States were under some form of extreme cold alert, the National Weather Service (NWS) said.

The Great Lakes region's residents woke up to extreme temperatures that could cause frostbite on exposed skin within minutes. In parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin, the NWS reported early Monday morning temperatures as low as -30.6C, with windchills exacerbating the bite.

Over the weekend, nearly half of the states in the contiguous US received at least a foot of snow, 30.5 centimetres, and in many cases far more. The NWS said New Mexico's Bonito Lake accumulated the highest US total over the weekend with 78.7 centimetres.

Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell told journalists that trees were continuing to fall under the weight of encrusted ice across the Tennessee capital city — sometimes knocking out power that had already been restored.

Nashville and other municipalities across the country were establishing emergency warming shelters.

NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli told AFP this storm recovery was particularly arduous because so many states were impacted — meaning northern states with more winter supplies were unable to share their resources with less-prepared southern regions.

"A lot of those locations don't have the means or the resources to clean up after these events," she said. "We're particularly concerned about the folks in those areas that are without power right now."

At least 20 states and the capital Washington were under states of emergency in order to deploy emergency personnel and resources.

The snowfall and biting icy pellets that pummeled cities left impassable roads along with cancelled buses, trains and flights — thousands of departures and arrivals were scrapped over the weekend.

The storm system was the result of a stretched polar vortex, an Arctic region of cold, low-pressure air that normally forms a relatively compact, circular system but sometimes morphs into a more oval shape, sending cold air pouring across North America.

Scientists say the increasing frequency of such disruptions may be linked to climate change, though the debate is not settled and natural variability plays a role.

Dave Radell, a NWS meteorologist based in New York, said that the character of this storm's snow was "very dry" and "fluffy", meaning the wind could lash it around with ease, impeding roadway-clearing efforts and visibility.

"That makes it even more challenging," he said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 06:38:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/09957522-fae1-11f0-b258-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/b4737fa3600f6ccaa231ecad5a6268e0c7476228.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea fires projectile towards sea, South Korea's military says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-korea-fires-projectile-towards-sea-south-koreas-military-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 27 (Reuters) - North Korea launched an unidentified projectile towards the sea off its east coast, South Korea's military said on Tuesday.

President Donald Trump said he was placing his border czar, Tom Homan, in charge of the mission, with Homan reporting directly to the White House , after Bovino drew condemnation for claiming the man who was killed, Alex Pretti, had been planning to “massacre” law enforcement officers, a characterisation that authorities had not substantiated.

Saturday's fatal shooting of Pretti, an ICU nurse, by Border Patrol agents ignited political backlash and raised fresh questions about how the operation was being run.

Bovino’s leadership of highly visible federal crackdowns, including operations that sparked mass demonstrations in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and Minneapolis, has drawn fierce criticism from local officials, civil rights advocates and congressional Democrats.

A person familiar with the matter told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity that Bovino is among the federal agents leaving Minneapolis.

The departure accompanies a softer tone from Trump on the Minnesota crackdown, including the president's touting of productive conversations with the governor and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.

The mayor said he asked Trump in a phone call to end the immigration enforcement surge, and Trump agreed that the present situation cannot continue. Frey said he would keep pushing for others involved in Operation Metro Surge to go and planned to meet Homan on Tuesday.

Trump and Democratic Governor Tim Walz spoke in a phone call and later offered comments that were a marked change from the critical statements they had exchanged in the past.

“We, actually, seemed to be on a similar wavelength,” the president wrote in a social media post.

Walz, in a statement, said the call was “productive" and that impartial investigations into the shootings were needed. Trump said his administration was looking for “any and all” criminals the state has in their custody. Walz said the state Department of Corrections honours federal requests for people in its custody.

Meanwhile, attorneys for the administration, the state and the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul appeared Monday before US District Judge Katherine Menendez, who is considering whether to grant requests to temporarily halt the immigration operation.

She said the case was a priority, but in an order later Monday, she told the federal government’s attorneys to file an additional brief addressing, among other things, the assertion by the state and cities that the purpose of Operation Metro Surge is to punish them for their sanctuary laws and policies.

Lawyers for the state and the Twin Cities argued the situation on the street is so dire that it requires the court to halt the federal government’s enforcement actions.

“If this is not stopped right here, right now, I don’t think anybody who is seriously looking at this problem can have much faith in how our republic is going to go in the future,” Minnesota Assistant Attorney General Brian Carter said.

The judge questioned the government’s motivation behind the crackdown and expressed scepticism about a letter Attorney General Pam Bondi recently sent to Walz asking the state to give the federal government access to voter rolls, to turn over state Medicaid and food assistance records, and to repeal sanctuary policies.

“I mean, is there no limit to what the executive can do under the guise of enforcing immigration law?” Menendez asked. She noted that the federal requests are the subject of litigation.

At one point, while discussing the prospect of federal officers entering residences without a warrant, the judge expressed reluctance to decide issues not yet raised in a lawsuit before her.

The state of Minnesota and the cities sued the Department of Homeland Security earlier this month, five days after Renee Good was shot by an Immigration and Customs officer. Pretti's shooting added urgency to the case.

News of Bovino's departure didn't stop dozens of protesters from gathering outside a hotel where they believed Bovino was staying. They blew whistles, banged pots and one person blasted a trombone. Police watched and kept them away from the hotel entrance.

In court Monday, an attorney for the administration said about 2,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were on the ground, along with at least 1,000 Border Patrol officers.

The lawsuit asks the judge to order a reduction in the number of federal law enforcement officers and agents in Minnesota back to the level before the surge and to limit the scope of the enforcement operation.

The case has implications for other states that have been or could become targets of ramped-up federal immigration enforcement operations. Attorneys general from 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, led by California, filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting Minnesota.

In yet another case, a different federal judge, Eric Tostrud, took under advisement a request from the Justice Department to lift an order he issued late Saturday blocking the Trump administration from “destroying or altering evidence” related to Saturday’s shooting.

Attorneys for the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension told the judge they can’t trust the federal government to preserve the evidence, citing the lack of cooperation the state is getting from federal authorities after they said they were blocked from the scene.

But the federal government’s attorneys argued that the temporary restraining order should be dissolved because its investigators are already following proper preservation procedures, and they’d object to “micromanaging” from the court what evidence the state can examine while the federal investigation is ongoing.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:31:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0150f98c-fac7-11f0-8c54-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/063-2256971194.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU and India to announce 'mother of all deals' representing 25% of global GDP</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260126-eu-and-india-to-announce-mother-of-all-deals-representing-one-third-of-global-trade</link><description>India and the European Union announced Tuesday the "mother of all deals", a huge trade pact to create a market of two billion people, reached after two decades of negotiations.

EU chiefs and Prime Minister Narendra Modi hope the pact, which Modi said was concluded on Monday, will help shield against challenges from the world's two leading economies, the United States and China .

The agreement will cut or eliminate tariffs on almost 97 percent of European exports, saving up to 4 billion euros ($4.75 billion) annually in duties, the 27-nation bloc said.

“A mother of all deals," Modi said Tuesday in the capital New Delhi, where he met with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.

"This deal will bring many opportunities for India's 1.4 billion and many millions of people of the EU," Modi said, adding the agreement "represents about 25 percent of global GDP, and one-third of global trade".

The EU has eyed India – the world's most populous nation – as an important market for the future.

"Europe and India are making history today," von der Leyen said in a statement, a day after she and Costa were feted as guests of honour at India's Republic Day parade.

"We have created a free trade zone of two billion people, with both sides set to benefit."

EU officials said the deal was the most ambitious India had ever signed, and European companies would benefit from so-called "first mover advantage".

Europe's key agricultural, automotive and service sectors stand to gain.

New Delhi sees the European bloc as an important source of much-needed technology and investment to rapidly upscale its infrastructure and create millions of new jobs.

Bilateral trade in goods reached €120 billion in 2024, an increase of nearly 90 percent over the past decade, according to EU figures, with a further €60 billion in trade in services.

Under the agreement, India is expected to ease market access for key European products.

Tariffs on cars will be gradually lowered from a top rate of 110 percent to as low as 10 percent, while duties on wines progressively go down from 150 percent to as low as 20 percent.

Currently at 50 percent, tariffs on processed foods – including pasta and chocolate – will be eliminated, according to the EU.

Von der Leyen said she expected exports to India to double, and that the EU would "gain the highest level of access ever granted to a trade partner in the traditionally protected Indian market".

European firms will get privileged access to the Indian financial services and maritime transport market, the bloc said.

For India, it would boost sectors including textiles, gems and jewellery, and leather goods, as well as the service sector, Modi said.

Talks went down to the wire on Monday, focusing on a few sticking points, including the impact of the EU's carbon border tax on steel , according to sources familiar with the discussions.

The accord comes as both Brussels and New Delhi have sought to open up new markets in the face of US tariffs and Chinese export controls.

India and the EU were also expected to conclude an accord to facilitate movement for seasonal workers, students, researchers and highly skilled professionals, and a security and defence pact.

"India and Europe have made a clear choice. The choice of strategic partnership, dialogue and openness," von der Leyen wrote on social media. "We are showing a fractured world that another way is possible."

India is on track to become its fourth-largest economy this year, according to International Monetary Fund projections.

New Delhi, which has relied on Moscow for key military hardware for decades, has tried to cut its dependence on Russia in recent years by diversifying imports and pushing its own domestic manufacturing base.

Europe is doing the same with regard to the United States.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:31:56 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6709cf6e-f9d8-11f0-83ca-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/780c77f4c7d27ef869b427599e1265988633d46f.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Azerbaijan arrests three men for planning embassy attack at behest of Islamic State offshoot</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/azerbaijan-arrests-three-men-planning-embassy-attack-behest-islamic-state-2026-01-27/</link><description>BAKU, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Authorities in Azerbaijan said on Tuesday they had arrested three individuals planning an attack on a foreign embassy in the capital Baku at the instructions of Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), the Afghan offshoot of Islamic State.

In a statement, the State Security Service said the three men, whom it named, had conspired with members of ISIS-K, obtained weapons and planned to attack a foreign embassy before they were apprehended by security forces.

The statement did not name the foreign embassy. One of the men was born in 2000, and the two others in 2005.

Islamic State-Khorasan, or ISIS-K, claimed responsibility for the 2024 Crocus City Hall attack in Moscow which left at least 145 people dead.

There have been a number of Islamic State-linked plots foiled in the majority-Muslim regions of Russia, where the group is listed as a banned terrorist organisation, and in Central Asia.

Azerbaijan, a South Caucasus country of some 10 million people bordering Russia and Iran, is a secular country with a predominantly Muslim population, the majority of whom are Shiites.

In its statement, Azerbaijani authorities said the suspects had been arrested on charges of "preparation for terrorism" on the basis of religious hostility. They said the investigation was ongoing.

In a separate case, an Azerbaijani court sentenced a man affiliated with ISIS-K to 13 years in prison on terrorism charges last October after finding him guilty of plotting an attack on a synagogue in Baku with a Molotov cocktail in December 2024.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:51:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Hungary's opposition keeps poll lead, backed by younger generation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/hungarys-opposition-keeps-poll-lead-backed-by-younger-generation-2026-01-27/</link><description>BUDAPEST, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hungary's centre-right opposition Tisza party has kept its 10 percentage point opinion poll lead over Prime Minister Viktor Orban's Fidesz in January, a fresh poll showed late on Monday.

Fidesz had stronger support only among voters older than 59 and living in villages and small towns, the poll found.

Nationalist Orban, in power since 2010, faces a strong challenge for the first time in 16 years in a parliamentary election due on April 12. Tisza is led by former government insider Peter Magyar.

The vote is set to have major implications for Europe and its far-right political forces. Orban, an ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, has frequently clashed with the EU over the steady erosion of democratic values in Hungary, which he denies.

The new poll, conducted between January 19-24 by Zavecz Research and published on news website Telex, showed that among decided voters Tisza had 49% support, up from 47% in November, while Fidesz polled 39% up from 38% in November. The far-right Mi Hazank (Our Homeland) party was backed by 5% of decided voters.

According to the survey, Tisza had overwhelming support with 41% versus 22% for Fidesz among voters younger than 39, but Fidesz led 38% to 35% in the voter group aged older than 59. Among those with only primary school education, Fidesz led 38% to 27% for Tisza.

Most polls show Fidesz trailing Tisza despite voter-pleasing measures after three years of economic stagnation in Hungary. Pro-government pollsters show a Fidesz lead.

Orban has framed the 2026 election as a choice between war and peace, portraying Ukraine as undeserving of support and his government as the only safe choice.

Tisza, which swept into politics in 2024, has said it would curb corruption, unlock billions of euros of frozen European Union funds to boost the economy and firmly anchor Hungary in the EU.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 07:51:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/M6V7ORONRFPWNNOUUBVFOZHFO4.jpg?auth=c94e48fa00b3b8324da16042ac474a19a551fe34addb55150f73df46af5ddf08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Denmark and Greenland prime ministers to visit Berlin and Paris</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/denmark-greenland-prime-ministers-visit-berlin-paris-2026-01-27/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The prime ministers of Denmark and Greenland said on Tuesday they will visit Berlin and Paris to shore up support amid U.S. President Donald Trump's recent threats against the Arctic island.

Denmark's Mette Frederiksen and Greenland's Jens-Frederik Nielsen will meet with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Tuesday and French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday, official schedules showed.

Trump's demands for control of Greenland have shaken transatlantic relations and accelerated European efforts to reduce dependence on the United States, even as Trump last week withdraw tariff threats and ruled out taking Greenland by force.

Frederiksen and Nielsen will discuss "the current foreign policy situation and the need for a strengthened Europe" in their meetings, the Danish prime minister's office said.

"Our energy system came under attack and there was quite serious damage. All crews are at work to eliminate all the negative consequences quickly," Syniehubov said in a video posted on Telegram.

"About 80% of the city of Kharkiv and Kharkiv region ‍is without electricity," he added.

Russian President ​Vladimir Putin's special ⁠envoy, Kirill Dmitriev, said on Tuesday that Ukraine's ​withdrawal ‍from the Donbas ​region was the path ​to peace.

"Donbas withdrawal is the path to peace for Ukraine," Dmitriev said on X.

Russia ‍controls about 90 percent ​of the Donbas region and Putin has repeatedly ‌said that if Ukraine ‍does not give up the rest, then Russia will take it by force.

An ‍infrastructure ​facility in Ukraine's ⁠western region of Lviv came under ​Russian ‍attack, Regional Governor ​Maksym Kozytskyi said ​on Telegram.

Kozytskyi did not specify what type of ‍facility was attacked, ​adding that all relevant services were ‌working at the scene.

According to ‍preliminary information, no one was hurt in the attack, ‍he said.

Russian ​forces captured ⁠17 settlements and took control of more than ​500 ‍square kilometres of ​territory in Ukraine so ​far in January, Russia's top general, Valery Gerasimov, said in a video released on Tuesday.

Gerasimov made the claim while visiting troops in western Ukraine, where he "inspected the progress of combat missions conducted by formations and units of the Zapad (West) force group", the ministry wrote on Telegram, without providing details on when or where the visit took place.

In a video of Gerasimov's visit aired by the defence ministry, he said that Russian troops "continue their offensive along all lines".

FRANCE 24 was unable to immediately verify battlefield accounts from ‍either side.

The ‍Trump administration ​has signalled to Ukraine ⁠that US security guarantees would depend on Kyiv first ​agreeing to ‍a peace deal likely ​requiring it to cede the ​Donbas region to Russia, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing eight people familiar with the talks.

The deal is expected to double EU exports to India by 2032 by eliminating or reducing tariffs in 96.6% of traded goods by value, and will lead to savings of 4 billion euros ($4.75 billion) in duties for European companies, the EU said.

The EU will cut tariffs on 99.5% goods traded over seven years, with tariffs to be cut to zero on Indian marine goods, leather and textile products, chemicals, rubber, base metals and gems and jewellery, India's trade ministry said in a statement.

"Yesterday, a big agreement was signed between the European Union and India," Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said earlier.

"People around the world are calling this the mother of all deals. This agreement will bring major opportunities for the 1.4 billion people of India and the millions of people in Europe," he said.

The accord would open up India's vast and highly guarded market, with New Delhi slashing tariffs on cars to 10% over five years from as high as 110%, according to an EU statement, benefiting European automakers such as Volkswagen, Renault, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.

India is also slashing tariffs on alcoholic beverages like wines to 75% immediately from 150%, which would be lowered to 20% gradually. Tariffs on spirits will be lowered to 40%, the EU said.

The deal will also cut tariffs on a slew of EU goods coming to India including machinery, electrical equipment, chemicals and iron and steel, the EU said.

"Europe and India are making history today," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on social media. "This is only the beginning."

Trade between India and the EU stood at $136.5 billion in the fiscal year through March 2025.

The formal signing of the India-EU deal would take place after legal vetting expected to last five to six months , an Indian government official aware of the matter has said.

"We expect the deal to be implemented within a year," the official added.

The agreement comes days after the EU signed a pivotal pact with the South American bloc Mercosur, following deals last year with Indonesia, Mexico and Switzerland.

During the same period, New Delhi finalised pacts with Britain, New Zealand and Oman.

The spate of deals underscores global efforts to hedge against trade with the United States as President Donald Trump's bid to take over Greenland and tariff threats on European nations test longstanding alliances among Western nations.

An India-U.S. trade deal collapsed last year after a breakdown in communications between their two governments.

Talks between India and the EU were relaunched in 2022 after a nine-year lull, and gathered momentum after Trump put tariffs on several trading partners, including a 50% tariff on goods from India.

For India, the tariff cuts with the EU will lead to more exports in labour intensive sectors that will help partly offset the impact of U.S. tariffs, said Ajay Srivastava, a former Indian trade official.

He said the deal will also give an immediate price advantage for EU products in India because of relief from its high tariffs, for instance up to 110% on cars.

"At the Olympics, ICE's Homeland Security Investigations is supporting the US Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service and host nation to vet and mitigate risks from transnational criminal organisations," the agency said in a statement.

"All security operations remain under Italian authority."

It added: "Obviously, ICE does not conduct immigration enforcement operations in foreign countries."

The potential presence of ICE agents at the February 6-22 Games has sparked huge debate in Italy, following the outcry over the deaths of two civilians during an immigration crackdown in Minneapolis .

Italian authorities initially denied the presence of ICE and then sought to downplay any role, suggesting they would help only in security for the US delegation.

US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are attending the opening ceremony in Milan on February 6.

On Monday, the president of the northern Lombardy region, which is hosting some of the Olympic events, said their involvement would be limited to monitoring Vance and Rubio.

"It will be only in a defensive role, but I am convinced that nothing will happen," Attilio Fontana told reporters.

However, his office then issued a statement saying he did not have any information on their presence, but was responding to a hypothetical question.

Thousands of ICE agents have been deployed by President Donald Trump in various US cities to carry out a crackdown on illegal immigration.

Their actions have prompted widespread protests, and the recent killings of US citizens Renee Good and Alex Pretti , both 37, on the streets of Minneapolis sparked outrage.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 08:38:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/342e3576-fb59-11f0-84a7-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-26T112954Z-501327942-UP1EM1Q0VXSLA-RTRMADP-3-OLYMPICS-2026-PREVIEW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>A boat carrying 25 french tourists capsized off the Omani coast, three killed</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/boat-carrying-25-french-tourists-capsized-off-omani-coast-three-killed-2026-01-27/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A boat carrying 25 French tourists capsized off the Omani coast, three people were killed, the Omani police said on Tuesday in a post on X.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:33:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After 844 Days, Israelis to turn off clock marking time since October 7 attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/after-844-days-israelis-turn-off-clock-marking-time-since-october-7-attack-2026-01-27/</link><description>TEL AVIV/CAIRO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A clock in a Tel Aviv square that became a rallying point for Israelis demanding the release of hostages taken during the October 2023 Hamas attack will be turned off on Tuesday, 844 days after it began counting their captivity.

The shutdown follows the discovery in Gaza of the body of the last remaining hostage , which was announced by the Israeli military on Monday. Ran Gvili, 24, was an off-duty police officer recovering from an injury, who was killed fighting militants that had infiltrated Israel during the 2023 attack.

Gvili's mother, Talik, speaking to reporters late on Monday, after her son's body was recovered, thanked those who had supported the family during the 27 months since the 2023 attack.

"We have a closure. Rani returned home an Israeli hero, really, an Israeli hero and we're the most proud of him in the world," she said.

In Israel, the return of the last hostage has been anticipated as a moment of national healing. The Hamas attack, the bloodiest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, was widely seen as the most traumatic event in the country's history.

It also completes a core aspect of the initial phase of President Donald Trump's plan to end the war . The second stage, which Washington announced had started earlier this month, includes the reopening of Gaza's Rafah border with Egypt.

Nour Daher, a 31-year-old Palestinian in Gaza, said that he was waiting for the border to reopen so he could seek medical treatment for a heart defect outside of the war-torn territory.

"I have the medical referral papers. I registered with the WHO (World Health Organization). Now I’m waiting for my name to appear on their lists,” he said. “Last time I checked, they told me they were waiting for a country willing to take my case.”

"I am hopeful my problem will finally end," said Daher, describing near-daily bouts of severe palpitations.

Since October 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attacks, thousands of Israelis had gathered almost every week in Tel Aviv at a place that came to be known as Hostages Square, calling for the release of all of the hostages in captivity.

Ran Gvili's sister, Shira, along with former hostages and family members, is due to take part in a public ceremony at the Tel Aviv square Tuesday as the clock is turned off, The Hostages and Families Forum, which rallied public support for those taken on October 7 and their families, said.

Gvili was shot while defending Kibbutz Alumim, a community in Israel's south near the border with Gaza. He was taken to Gaza by militants from another Palestinian militant group that joined the Hamas attack, Islamic Jihad, according to Israeli officials.

Handing over all the remaining living and dead hostages was a core commitment of the first phase of the deal, though other parts have not been fulfilled. It is not clear how the next stage will be implemented, which includes the reconstruction and demilitarization of Gaza. The Israeli military remains in control of 53% of Gaza, with Hamas in control of the rest.

Four Israeli soldiers and over 480 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in October as part of the U.S. plan to end the war. Both Israel and Hamas have repeatedly accused each other of truce violations.

On Tuesday, Israeli forces killed four Palestinians in the northern Gaza Strip, according to the Al Ahli Hospital in Gaza. An Israeli military spokesperson said they were not aware of any incidents in northern Gaza on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 09:36:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7LC4QUMXYBOYBPFIQ3KEXOZIGE.jpg?auth=cf94389e9a67b42c9fdea04323ad057d8f1848186a11bb725fa4d1207dd3f82b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: Hamas seeks role for its police in Gaza ahead of disarmament talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-seeks-role-its-police-gaza-ahead-disarmament-talks-sources-say-2026-01-27/</link><description>CAIRO, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Hamas is seeking to incorporate its 10,000 police officers into a new U.S.-backed Palestinian administration for Gaza, sources say, a demand likely to be opposed by Israel as the militant group debates whether to surrender its arms.

Islamist group Hamas retains control of just under half of Gaza following an October ceasefire deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump . The agreement ties further Israeli troop withdrawals to Hamas giving up its weapons.

The 20-point plan to end the war , now in its second phase, calls for the governance of Gaza to be handed to the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, a Palestinian technocratic body with U.S. oversight that is meant to exclude Hamas.

In a letter to staff on Sunday, seen by Reuters, Gaza's Hamas-run government urged its more than 40,000 civil servants and security personnel to cooperate with the NCAG but assured them it was working to incorporate them into the new government.

That would include the roughly 10,000-strong Hamas-run police force, four sources familiar with the matter said, a demand that has not been previously reported. Many of them have been patrolling Gaza as Hamas reasserts its grip in areas under its control.

It was not immediately clear whether Israel, which has adamantly rejected any Hamas involvement in Gaza's future, would agree to the civil and security workers' inclusion in the NCAG.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Hamas' plans for its police force and workers point to wide gaps between Hamas and Israel, backed by the U.S., as Trump pushes ahead with his plans.

Last week, Trump hosted a signing ceremony to establish his "Board of Peace" that will serve as a transitional administration to set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza. The framework includes a provision barring "foreign terrorist organizations" from participating in governance.

Hamas spokesperson Hazem Qassem told Reuters the group was prepared to hand over governance to the 15-member NCAG and its chair, Ali Shaath, with immediate effect.

"We (have) full confidence that it will operate on the basis of benefiting from qualified personnel and not wasting the rights of anyone who worked during the previous period," Qassem said, referring to the inclusion of the 40,000 personnel.

The four sources said Hamas is open to the NCAG restructuring ministries and sending some workers into retirement. Mass dismissals risked chaos, the sources said.

Hamas and NCAG Chair Shaath have not yet met in person to discuss governance, a Hamas official said. Shaath's office did not respond to a request for comment.

Another issue was whether Sami Nasman, the former Palestinian Authority general assigned to oversee security under the NCAG, would be able to operate effectively, a Palestinian official said.

Nasman, originally from Gaza, moved to the occupied West Bank after Hamas routed Palestinian Authority forces from the enclave in 2007 following a brief civil war. A Hamas court in Gaza later sentenced him in absentia, accusing him of instigating chaos. Nasman denies this.

Trump's administration wants to see heavy weapons decommissioned immediately, with "personal arms registered and decommissioned by sector as (the) NCAG police become capable of guaranteeing personal security," according to a document shared by the White House last week.

A U.S. official said on Tuesday that Hamas fighters would be granted some sort of amnesty .

The militant group is still believed to possess rockets, which several diplomats estimated to number in the hundreds. It is also estimated to possess thousands of light weapons, including rifles.

Hamas recently agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions and with mediators, sources said. However, two Hamas officials told Reuters that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

A Palestinian official close to the disarmament talks said the U.S. had approached Hamas to explore potential disarmament mechanisms involving parties including Israel, Qatar, Egypt and Turkey.

"Hamas has spoken about the possibility of neutralising arms, which could be achieved if there is a truce, and it is ready for a long-term ceasefire — five years or a little longer," the official said.

"But Hamas strongly believes that a serious political negotiation process must begin on Palestinian statehood, whereby weapons and fighters would come under the authority of the State of Palestine," the official said.

Hamas is not the only militant group in the enclave to possess arms. A source in a Gaza faction allied with Hamas said other groups were discussing disarmament but worried about being left defenseless.

In remarks to parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that the next phase of the Gaza deal "is not reconstruction."

Rather, he said, "the next phase is demilitarization of the Strip and disarming Hamas."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:28:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HNZKFCVSCZI7NDGKKKMFGO2GIA.jpg?auth=94bda4059f42f9da4b7122324080e4b9a00f2d26274531b3b47a5e9513a42c26&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Indian tourist state of Goa weighs social media ban for children</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/society-equity/indian-tourist-state-goa-weighs-social-media-ban-children-2026-01-27/</link><description>NEW DELHI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - India's top tourist state of Goa is considering an Australia-like social media ban for children, as concerns grow over the risks of such use to their mental health in a nation with more than a billion internet users.

Among the top markets for tech giants such as Meta (META.O) , opens new tab , Google's YouTube and X, India is estimated to have many users younger than 18, but it lacks national curbs on social media, or even suggestions that the federal government plans one.

Authorities in Goa are examining Australia's law to study how to regulate minors' access to social media platforms, said Rohan Khaunte, the state's infotech minister.

"If possible, (we will) implement a similar ban on children below 16 for usage of social media," he told reporters this week. "Details will follow."

The southern state of Andhra Pradesh, with a population of more than 53 million, has said it is looking into similar measures. Goa by contrast, is the smallest state by area, with a population estimated at over 1.5 million.

India's IT ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Meta, Google and X also did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the plan.

Andhra Pradesh recently set up a panel of senior ministers to make recommendations within a month after studying such global regulation efforts, media said.

Last year, Australia became the first country to ban social media for children under 16, deactivating 4.7 million teen accounts in the first month.

France, Indonesia and Malaysia are among other countries watching the Australian rollout with a view to adopting similar laws.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:29:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EQQC5IGD3VNB3DWMSPE6MJHKVQ.jpg?auth=5b35449a594d090dc1c1c0bb1542fb1093d5c0d2c87bbd4d3d6a907c6892605e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan bids farewell to last giant pandas as pair leave for China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/japan-bids-farewell-last-giant-pandas-pair-leave-china-2026-01-27/</link><description>TOKYO, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hundreds of Japanese panda lovers bid an emotional farewell to the country's last two giant pandas, Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei, as they left Tokyo's Ueno Zoo for China on Tuesday.

Spectators, braving the winter cold and some wearing panda hats and waving flags, held up their smartphones to record the moment as a truck carrying the zoo's star attractions left for Narita Airport.

The departure of the four-year-old twins for a breeding facility in China leaves Japan with no giant pandas for the first time in more than five decades.

Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei have been beloved by so many people, and so my feelings are complicated," said Ueno Zoo's director, Yutaka Fukuda. "I feel gratitude and also anticipation at the possibility of future breeding endeavours, but I also feel sadness at their departure."

While their move to China has been planned for some time, the pandas' departure has been viewed as a reflection of deteriorating China-Japan relations in recent months.

In November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said a hypothetical Chinese attack on Taiwan could bring about a Japanese military response . That triggered a furious response from Beijing, which views the democratically governed island as its own territory.

China, in what has been called panda diplomacy, has a history of loaning out pandas to reward its allies, though it has sometimes taken them back to express displeasure. Native to China, giant pandas typically return home after the loan agreement ends - and cubs born overseas are no exception.

The twins were born in the zoo in June 2021 and have been its top draw since their parents departed in 2024.

Giant pandas first arrived in Japan from China in 1972 following the normalisation of diplomatic relations between the two countries.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 10:57:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IPMPMUHZZZIUVPCCVAAJJIWFWM.jpg?auth=f5c9653fb62779f72d2dec0977892a652f979ccef326bb057b35c694e4402e7b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>China calls for closer defence ties with Russia in ministers' talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-calls-closer-defence-ties-with-russia-ministers-talks-2026-01-27/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 27 (Reuters) - China's Defence Minister Dong Jun told his Russian counterpart on Tuesday that Beijing was willing to enhance strategic coordination with Moscow and jointly improve their capacity to respond to risks and challenges, state media reported.

The executive order establishing Golden Dome, signed on January 27, 2025, set an aggressive timetable to field a comprehensive homeland missile-defense system by 2028. A year later, however, the program has yet to spend much of the $25 billion appropriated last summer, as officials continue to debate fundamental elements of its space‑based architecture.

According to two U.S. officials, work to finalize the architecture of the missile defense shield is still underway, and large‑scale execution of funds has not begun. The money is available, the officials said, and significant amounts could be released in the coming days once key decisions are made.

“The Golden Dome office continues to meet the goals outlined in Executive Order," a Pentagon official said in response to Reuters' questions.

"The implementation plan and associated technologies are dynamic; however, the foundational elements of the architecture are now established. The specifics of architecture are classified.”

WEAPONS IN SPACE DEBATE

Golden Dome envisions expanding existing ground‑based defenses such as interceptor missiles, sensors and command‑and‑control systems while adding more experimental space‑based elements meant to detect, track and potentially counter incoming threats from orbit. These would include advanced satellite networks and still‑debated on‑orbit weaponry.

One source of delay has been internal debate over classified space‑based equipment, one of the officials said. A defense industry executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the systems under discussion likely involve communications standards. Another executive said they could be anti‑satellite capabilities, raising questions about how such weapons would align with a defensive missile shield.

The U.S. has historically opposed anti-satellite weapons over concerns about space debris, and criticized China in 2007 for conducting an anti-satellite missile test.

The space-based architecture remains one of the issues that must be decided before General Michael Guetlein, the program's director, can move forward with what is anticipated to be a series of procurement contracts for existing weaponry, the first U.S. official and industry executives said.

The Space Force awarded about a half dozen small-value Golden Dome contracts in November to build competing missile defense prototypes, including awards to Northrop Grumman (NOC.N) , opens new tab , True Anomaly, Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab and Anduril, sources previously told Reuters. Those contracts, valued around $120,000 each, represent the first tangible steps in a program Trump has said will eventually cost $175 billion.

Since December, there has been at least one classified briefing for defense companies on the architecture, the U.S. officials said.

Tom Karako, a weapons security expert at the Washington‑based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said much of the past year had been consumed by security reviews, staffing decisions and the approval of complex plans. He said the Golden Dome project was unlikely to be fully completed by 2028.

"There is a lot that can be done in the next three years in terms of better integrating what we already have, but there's no question that there will be things that will be implemented and evolve after 2028.”

Another unresolved issue surrounding Golden Dome is the role Greenland could play.

Trump has recently linked U.S. control of the Danish territory to the missile defense initiative, repeatedly saying that acquiring Greenland is “vital” to the project. Defense experts note, however, that existing agreements already allow expanded U.S. military operations on the island. One U.S. official said Greenland is not part of Golden Dome’s proposed architecture.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:29:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BFTJAXSVHJMDZKU2AVLHYI34UQ.jpg?auth=dab5b28b8f261133d9158594610c003ea124980a7f18bbcfa518d0cde05d51b8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Germany plans crackdown on far-left militants after Berlin power grid attack</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/germany-plans-crackdown-far-left-militants-after-berlin-power-grid-attack-2026-01-27/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Germany will step up efforts to fight left-wing militants after activists claimed responsibility for an attack on a power station in January that caused the longest electricity blackout in Berlin since World War Two, the interior minister said.

"Our security agencies will be significantly reinforced in the fight against left-wing extremism," the minister, Alexander Dobrindt, said on Tuesday.

He added that 1 million euros was on offer for information leading to the perpetrators of the January attack, which was suspected to have been carried out by a far-left activist organisation called the Volcano group. The incident left 45,000 households without power in freezing temperatures.

Germany's domestic intelligence agency will devote more staff to left-wing militancy, Dobrindt said, adding that new legislation is being prepared to expand the digital investigative powers of security authorities. The measures would cover automated data analysis, biometric facial recognition and the storage of IP addresses.

In its latest report, the domestic intelligence agency said left-wing motivated crime was up 38% in 2024 although the number of leftist violent crimes had fallen by 27%.

Dobrindt said the move, as well as a planned law to protect critical infrastructure, would not lead to a reduction in the fight against other forms of radicalism.

One is a spindly stick about 80 centimetres long that could have been used for digging in the mud. The other is a smaller, more mysterious handheld chunk of willow or poplar wood that may have been used to shape stone tools, according to research published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Scientists think ancient humans wielded a whole litany of tools made from stone, bone and wood. But it's particularly difficult to find evidence of wooden tools today because wood rots so quickly. Such tools are only preserved in specific environments like in ice, caves or underwater.

The newest tools, found in Greece's Megalopolis basin, were possibly buried quickly by sediment and preserved by a wet environment over time. For years, researchers have found other remnants at the site, including stone tools and elephant bones with cuts on them. While scientists didn't directly date the wooden tools, the site is about 430,000 years old, which provides insight into the objects' age.

“I’ve always just been thrilled to be able to touch these objects," said study author Annemieke Milks with the University of Reading.

Human remains haven't been found at the site yet, so it's not yet clear who used the tools. The owners could have been Neanderthals, early human ancestors or someone else.

The site in Greece probably has more gems from the past that are waiting to be found, said archaeologist Jarod Hutson with the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. But the unassuming appearance of these two new tools makes them harder to interpret.

“It’s difficult to get excited about these because they don’t strike you immediately as wooden tools. And we don’t know what they were used for,” said Hutson, who was not involved with the new study.

Other examples of ancient wooden tools include a set of spears from Germany and 300,000-year-old Chinese digging sticks that may have been used to harvest plants.

The new find offers a rare look into the varied collection of tools used to survive – a glimpse at a “little known aspect of the technology of early humans”, study author Katerina Harvati with the University of Tübingen said in an email.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 11:37:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8b9e148c-fb6a-11f0-a6a1-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026669508001.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Suspected Boko Haram militants kill seven Nigerian soldiers, capture 13, sources say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/suspected-boko-haram-militants-kill-seven-nigerian-soldiers-capture-13-sources-2026-01-27/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Suspected Boko Haram militants killed seven Nigerian soldiers and captured 13 others including their commanding officer on Monday in northeastern Borno state, two security sources said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:52:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/J2OT46IMSVO2LHG3HHCW3T5WGM.jpg?auth=1bb42dc711388997fd45b2f1aac58ca16ebd233c55b315fd77faa5f6343d7aff&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran summons Italian ambassador over push for EU clampdown on Revolutionary Guards, state media says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-summons-italian-ambassador-over-push-eu-clampdown-revolutionary-guards-2026-01-27/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Iran's foreign ministry summoned Italy's ambassador over Rome's efforts to place the Revolutionary Guards on the European Union's terrorist register , state media reported on Tuesday.

The clashes pitting government forces against fighters loyal to the Sudan People’s Liberation Army‑in‑Opposition (SPLA‑IO) are occurring at a scale not seen since 2017, according to the United Nations.

The government said its forces had repelled rebel advances in Jonglei, which stretches from the border with Ethiopia to central South Sudan.

“The ongoing security operation in Northern Jonglei State is a lawful and necessary measure aimed at halting the advance of rebel forces, restoring public order, and safeguarding civilians,” information minister and government spokesperson Ateny Wek Ateny said in a statement.

"The Government calls upon the SPLM/A in Opposition to immediately cease hostilities... Any actions that undermine the (2018) Agreement pose a serious threat to peace and jeopardize the ongoing transitional process," he added.

South Sudan's military on Sunday ordered all civilians and personnel from the U.N. Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) and other charities to evacuate three counties in Jonglei ahead of its operation against opposition forces.

A spokesman for the U.N. Secretary‑General Antonio Guterres said the mission had shared concerns that the fighting could put hundreds of thousands of civilians at risk.

"The mission also warns that escalating hate speech is fuelling ethnic tensions and risks drawing civilian communities into the conflict," the spokesman said.

UNMISS on Sunday said at least 180,000 people in Jonglei had already been displaced by the fighting.

The 2013-18 civil war between President Salva Kiir's forces and those loyal to his vice president, Riek Machar, was fought along largely ethnic lines and cost about 400,000 lives.

Machar is currently on trial for treason after an ethnic militia with historic ties to the SPLA-IO overran an army base in the northeastern town of Nasir last year.

He has denied the charges.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:55:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK, US, Germany and France urge adherence to ceasefire in Syria</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/uk-us-germany-france-urge-adherence-ceasefire-syria-2026-01-27/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 27 - Britain, the United States, France and Germany on Tuesday welcomed the 15-day extension of the ceasefire between the Syrian government and Kurdish forces, and urged all parties to strictly adhere to the agreement.

Thousands of kits, including pencils, exercise books and wooden cubes to play with, have now entered the enclave, UNICEF said.

"We have now, in the last days, got in thousands of recreational kits, hundreds of school-in-a-carton kits. We're looking at getting 2,500 more school kits in, in the next week, because they've been approved," UNICEF spokesperson James Elder said.

COGAT, the arm of the Israeli military that oversees aid flows into the Gaza Strip, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Children in Gaza have faced an unprecedented assault on the education system, as well as restrictions on the entry of some aid materials, including school books and pencils, meaning teachers had to make do with limited resources, while children tried to study at night in tents without lights, Elder said.

During the conflict some children missed out on education altogether, facing basic challenges like finding water, as well as widespread malnutrition , amid a major humanitarian crisis.

"It's been a long two years for children and for organizations like UNICEF to try and do that education without those materials. It looks like we're finally seeing a real change," Elder stated.

UNICEF is scaling up its education to support half of children of school age - around 336,000 - with learning support. Teaching will mainly happen in tents, Elder said, due to widespread devastation of school buildings in the enclave during the war which was triggered by Hamas' assault on Israel on October 2023.

At least 97% of schools sustained some level of damage, according to the most recent satellite assessment by the U.N. in July.

Israel has previously accused Hamas and other militant groups of systematically embedding in civilian areas and structures, including schools, and using civilians as human shields.

The bulk of the learning spaces supported by UNICEF will be in central and southern areas of the enclave, as it remains difficult to operate in the north, parts of which were badly destroyed in the final months of the conflict, Elder said.

The Hamas-led attack in October 2023 killed 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's assault has killed 71,000 Palestinians, Gaza's health authorities say. More than 20,000 children were reported killed, including 110 since the October 10 ceasefire last year, UNICEF said, citing official data.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:56:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/V2IWSTFNMZIETEANVTHADUBOEE.jpg?auth=895a53bf2319b48082a0abe12d9a0810239c34fb036732b428eaadc3bf898337&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Australia PM Albanese visits East Timor to discuss security, gas</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/australia-pm-albanese-visits-east-timor-discuss-security-gas-2026-01-27/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will flag Australia's desire for deeper security and energy ties when he addresses East Timor's parliament on Wednesday, in his first visit to the northern neighbour as leader.

The visit comes as the tiny Catholic nation, also courted by China, continues to push to build a liquefied natural gas plant on its south coast, instead of the Australian city of Darwin.

Albanese will address East Timor's parliament and meet its President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao.

According to excerpts of his speech shared in advance, Albanese will recall cooperation between Timorese and Australian soldiers during the World War Two as an example of the history and values that make the two nations friends.

"We look towards a shared future. A new deeper partnership in security, in energy and economic resilience," he is expected to tell the parliament.

Ramos-Horta said last month he was confident a major gas project would be developed with Australia after decades of delays.

Australia's Woodside Energy (WDS.AX) , opens new tab and East Timor agreed in December to study a 5 million metric ton project at the Greater Sunrise fields, an area containing an estimated 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas that Australia has been discussing, initially with Indonesia, since the 1980s.

The national oil company Timor Gap holds more than 56% of the field located about 140 km (87 miles) south of East Timor and more than 400 km from Darwin.

With a population of 1.4 million people, East Timor became a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in October and is seeking to build its fragile economy.

East Timor signed a strategic agreement with China in 2023 for infrastructure and development, which Ramos-Horta has previously said did not cover military cooperation.

Australia has been East Timor's largest aid and security partner since its independence from Indonesia in 2002, supported by Australian peacekeepers.

China's assertiveness in efforts to form security ties with developing countries in close proximity to Australia have raised alarm bells in Canberra, and a shake-up of Australia's defence has refocused on protecting its northern approaches.

East Timor is around 700 km (450 miles) north-west of Australia.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 12:56:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LURQF3VZYVLXPNU6XK75KYUAJM.jpg?auth=3dca36a16a6fd7a2774454c14104cb4fc7184544e6b7ddf758442679a10ea541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Honduras' Asfura to take office after razor-thin election</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/honduras-asfura-take-office-after-razor-thin-election-2026-01-27/</link><description>TEGUCIGALPA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Conservative politician and businessman Nasry Asfura will be sworn in as president of Honduras on Tuesday after a closely fought election marred by allegations of fraud and political tension fueled by U.S. interference .

Asfura, 67, will serve a four-year term until January 2030. He has pledged to fight poverty, corruption and crime, and to revive the economy in one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.

He also pledged to restore diplomatic relations with Taiwan, which were severed by outgoing President Xiomara Castro in 2023. Such a move would be a major diplomatic setback for China in Central America.

A former mayor of Tegucigalpa from 2014 to 2022, Asfura will be inaugurated after months of electoral chaos in Honduras, fueled by a last-minute endorsement from U.S. President Donald Trump, a deeply troubled vote-counting process and a razor-thin victory of 26,000 votes over centrist candidate Salvador Nasralla .

Washington said in recent days it aimed to begin negotiations "as soon as possible" on a bilateral trade agreement with Honduras.

Still, Asfura enters office facing a delicate balancing act. While his party holds a simple majority, he will need the support of rival parties - including those that alleged voter fraud - in order to ratify international treaties or amend the constitution.

Asfura campaigned on a message of "work and more work," promising to attract investment, create jobs and impose austerity in government spending. He is expected to emphasize that agenda in his inaugural address on Tuesday.

"In Honduras, everything is urgent," said political analyst Luis Leon in Tegucigalpa. "But two issues will determine whether people feel the government is responding: public health and investment to generate jobs."

Last year, government health workers went on strike for nearly a month to protest overdue pay as well as shortages of medicines and supplies.

A recent report by the World Bank, the Pan American Health Organization and journal the Lancet said Honduras' public health system has deep structural weaknesses that leave it highly vulnerable to health crises.

Outgoing leftist Castro leaves office after expanding public investment and social spending. Her administration oversaw moderate economic growth and declines in poverty and inequality, though both remain high.

The homicide rate fell to its lowest level in recent history, but human-rights groups criticized Castro for maintaining a prolonged state of emergency in parts of the country to combat gang violence and for expanding the role of the military.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:50:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KSD74TS6ZVLDZOQMEWRRYCKFFI.jpg?auth=11b1877ceda15bda14b1234d04517493186a60e4705f52c134a1bd62406ed112&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran's crackdown on protests killed more than 6,000, human rights group says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260127-iran-crackdown-protests-killed-more-than-6000-human-rights-group-says</link><description>Iran 's bloody crackdown on nationwide protests has killed at least 6,126 people while many others still are feared dead, activists said Tuesday, as a US aircraft carrier group arrived in the Middle East to lead any American military response to the crisis. Iran's currency, the rial, meanwhile fell to a record low of 1.5 million to $1.

The arrival of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and guided missile destroyers accompanying it provide the US the ability to strike Iran, particularly as Gulf Arab states have signalled they want to stay out of any attack despite hosting American military personnel.

Two Iranian-backed militias in the Middle East have signalled their willingness to launch new attacks, likely trying to back Iran after US President Donald Trump threatened military action over the killing of peaceful protesters or Tehran launching mass executions in the wake of the demonstrations.

Iran has repeatedly threatened to drag the region into a war, though its air defence and military are still reeling after the June war launched by Israel against the country. But the pressure on its economy may spark new unrest as everyday goods slowly go out of reach of its people.

Tuesday's new figures came from the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran. The group verifies each death with a network of activists on the ground in Iran.

It identified the dead as including at least 5,777 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 86 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating. The crackdown has seen over 41,800 arrests, it added.

Monitors and human rights groups have struggled to assess the death toll given authorities cutting off the internet and disrupting calls into the Islamic Republic.

Iran’s government has put the death toll at a far lower 3,117, saying 2,427 were civilians and security forces, and labelled the rest “terrorists”. In the past, Iran’s theocracy has undercounted or not reported fatalities from unrest.

That death toll exceeds that of any other round of protest or unrest there in decades, and recalls the chaos surrounding Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution .

The protests in Iran began on December 28, sparked by the fall of the Iranian currency, the rial, and quickly spread across the country. They were met by a violent crackdown by Iran’s theocracy, the scale of which is only starting to become clear as the country has faced more than two weeks of internet blackout – the most comprehensive in its history.

Iran’s UN ambassador told a UN Security Council meeting late Monday that Trump’s repeated threats to use military force against the country “are neither ambiguous nor misinterpreted”. Amir Saeid Iravani also repeated allegations that the US leader incited violence by “armed terrorist groups” supported by the United States and Israel , but gave no evidence to support his claims.

Iranian state media has tried to accuse forces abroad for the protests as the theocracy remains broadly unable to address the country's ailing economy, which is still squeezed by international sanctions, particularly over its nuclear program.

On Tuesday, exchange shops offered the record-low rial-to-dollar rate in Tehran.

Already, Iran has vastly limited its subsidised currency rates to cut down on corruption. It also has offered the equivalent of $7 a month to most people in the country to cover rising costs. However, Iran's people have seen the rial fall from 32,000 to $1 just a decade ago – which has devoured the value of their savings.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 13:52:32 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/3348bccc-fb85-11f0-83c1-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26012611948846.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain to pay $24 million in compensation to victims of high-speed train crash</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-pay-24-million-compensation-victims-high-speed-train-crash-2026-01-27/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Spain will pay out 20 million euros ($24 million) in compensation to the victims of last week's high-speed train crash that killed 45 people and left more than 150 injured, Transport Minister Oscar Puente said on Tuesday.

The nation is still reeling from the January 18 disaster in Adamuz near the southern city of Cordoba that caused one of the highest death tolls from a train crash in recent European history and the highest in Spain since 2013.

The families of those killed will receive 216,000 euros each within no more than three months, made up of 72,000 euros in tax-exempt aid from the government and an advance insurance payment of 72,000 euros. Another 72,000 euros will be paid from passengers' mandatory travel insurance.

"We know that ordinary procedures and legal timelines do not always respond to the vital urgency of a tragedy like this," Puente said, adding that victims could not afford to wait years to receive support.

"Economic uncertainty cannot be compounded on top of the emotional pain."

Payments to those injured will range from 2,400 euros to 84,000 euros, according to Puente.

The minister has come under public pressure since the Adamuz crash and other incidents that same week, including the death of a train driver in Catalonia and two other accidents without fatalities. The main opposition People's Party has demanded his resignation.

Asked about his future, Puente told reporters he had a calm conscience, performing his job to the best of his abilities and making every effort to communicate all available information to citizens.

Catalan commuter rail service Rodalies also faced heavy disruptions last week after many drivers refused to work over safety concerns, leaving thousands stranded, while a software failure collapsed its train traffic control centre on Monday.

European countries are in the midst of hiking defence spending , under pressure to do so by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and unnerved by Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

"These are weapons that can reach far behind enemy lines... this is decisive in modern warfare," Peter Froelich, the defence policy spokesperson for the opposition Conservatives, told parliament on Tuesday.

Norwegian daily Aftenposten, citing anonymous sources, on January 24 reported that the government has selected South Korean defence contractor Hanwha Aerospace's (012450.KS) , opens new tab Chunmoo artillery system, beating U.S. Lockheed Martin's (LMT.N) , opens new tab HIMARS.

Some members of Norway's parliament have said the Nordic country should help develop a European missile alternative, but this has been dismissed as too time-consuming and costly by government officials charged with making the selection.

The South Korean system met all requirements set by Norway for the ground-based artillery, including the ability to fire at a range of up to 500 km (310 miles), and had the quickest delivery time, according to the Aftenposten report.

Norway's defence ministry, which is expected to soon announce the contract winner, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ministry has said it plans to acquire 16 launch systems along with an undisclosed number of rockets for a total cost of 19.5 billion crowns ($2.0 billion).

Hanwha Aerospace last year signed an agreement with Polish defence company WB Electronics to form a joint venture producing missiles in Poland, including for the Chunmoo rocket artillery, ensuring manufacturing on European soil.

Niscemi, a town of about 25,000 in south-central Sicily, sits on a plateau that authorities say is gradually collapsing toward the plain below. More than 1,500 people have had to be evacuated.

Buildings were overhanging the edge after large sections of the slope gave way. A car was left with its front end poking into the chasm.

"Let's be clear: there are homes on the edge of the landslide that are uninhabitable," the civil protection head Fabio Ciciliano told reporters in Niscemi, saying residents from the affected areas would be permanently relocated.

"Once the water has drained away and the moving section has stopped or slowed, a more accurate assessment will be made ... The landslide is still active," he added.

On Monday, the Italian government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni declared a state of emergency for Sicily, Sardinia and Calabria, the three southern regions battered by the violent storm last week.

Extreme weather events have become more frequent in Italy in recent years. Floods have devastated cities across the country, killing dozens of people and amplifying risks of landslides and floods also in historically less exposed areas.

The administration set aside 100 million euros ($119 million) for the initial needs of the areas worst hit by the recent storm. But local authorities estimate damage at over 1 billion euros after powerful winds and waves pushed the sea inland overwhelming coastal defences, destroying homes and businesses.

In Niscemi, the sudden evacuations have fuelled anxiety and anger among residents, some of whom say earlier landslides went unaddressed.

"I have been told that I have to leave, even though I don’t have anything (collapse) in the house or underneath," Francesco Zarba said.

"We had the first landslide 30 years ago, and no one ever did anything."

European travel to the United States has dipped since President Donald Trump's election in November 2024, with many tourists deterred by greater scrutiny at border crossings.

Although a recent rise in violence tied to ICE detentions in the city of Minneapolis has amplified fears among some, data from World Cup watchers and Amadeus show that bookings are up, particularly among England and Scotland fans.

Of the bookings made for the time frame of the tournament, which will be held in the United States, Canada and Mexico from June 11 to July 19, 37% were in the month since the draw.

However, the data does not show whether more recent immigration raids in the U.S. have had an impact on 2026 bookings. And a major sports event does not guarantee a travel boost to the host country, as shown by the 2024 Paris Olympics .

"The tournament is a chance to see the most talented football players in the world and fans will go almost anywhere to watch the finest, whatever the policies and politics of the host country," said travel analyst Paul Charles.

"However, safety is a key factor too, so visitors will be hoping that calm prevails in host cities and that their travel insurance will remain valid for their planned trips in June and July," added Charles, who is CEO of consultancy The PC Agency.

The largest spike of bookings per day was seen for the first match in New York City between Brazil and Morocco, with over 2,500 flight bookings, the Amadeus data shows.

Hotel bookings in Canada and Mexico have also risen, with the average occupancy of hotels in Mexico City on the nights ahead of three planned matches there at 21%, up from 4% for the same time last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:30:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AKNC3K7RX5LUPDT32NBLISNKKY.jpg?auth=53f95d8490ff714f9a7181f20c821795e8318312cb8541664854bd40e53c1f57&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syria hopes to hold new integration talks with Kurdish forces on Tuesday</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/syria-hopes-hold-new-integration-talks-with-kurdish-forces-tuesday-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - The Syrian government hopes to hold new round of integration talks with Kurdish forces as early as today, a Syrian government official told Reuters on Tuesday.

"We call upon all parties to strictly adhere to the ceasefire ‍and to exercise their ​utmost restraint. We urge all external parties to join ‌us in pursuit of peace and de-escalation ‍of violence," the four nations said in a joint statement published by the UK government.

The joint statement was released following a meeting with French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot , British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper, German Minister of State Serap Guler, and US special envoy Tom Barrack.

Syria's government and Kurdish forces on Saturday extended a truce by 15 days after the Kurds lost large areas to government forces during weeks of clashes.

Days later, France, Germany, UK and the US called on "all parties to swiftly agree to a permanent ceasefire, and to resume as soon as possible negotiations aiming at the peaceful and sustainable integration of northeast Syria into a unitary and sovereign state that effectively respects and protects the rights of all its citizens".

The statement came as the ‍Syrian ​government on Tuesday said it hopes ⁠to hold new round of integration talks with ​Kurdish ‍forces as ​early as today, an official told Reuters.

The talks would focus on practical ‍ways to implement ​the ceasefire agreement mediated by the US, the official said. ‍

The recent clashes between Syria's military and Kurdish forces are a "setback" and a "plot" to derail the PKK peace process with Turkey , a spokesman for the Kurdish militant group told AFP on Tuesday.

"The developments in Syria and the larger Middle East have a direct effect on the peace process in Turkey," said Zagros Hiwa, spokesman for the political wing of the Kurdistan Workers' Party.

The attacks "against the Kurds are a plot and conspiracy against the peace process and they indicate a setback in the process", he said.

Following the SDF's recent loss of territory to Syria's government, the Kurdish forces in Syria find themselves now restricted to Kurdish-majority areas in the country's north.

Turkey is a close ally of Syria's new leadership that overthrew Bashar al-Assad in December 2024, and which is now seeking to extend state control across Syria.

Ankara is simultaneously leading a drive to reach a settlement with the PKK – listed as a terror group by Turkey and its Western allies.

Last year, the PKK said it was ending its four-decade insurgency in favour of democratic means but the process has largely stalled amid the stand-off in Syria.

Turkey accuses the Syrian Kurdish forces of being an offshoot of the PKK.

Hiwa said the PKK's "commitment to the peace process is a strategic issue".

But he added that "the new strategy does not exclude the urgency of self-defence against genocidal attacks".</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 14:31:52 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8bb9b436-fb87-11f0-8278-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026644019210.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Human trafficker who tortured migrants in Libya jailed for 20 years in Netherlands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/human-trafficker-who-tortured-migrants-libya-jailed-20-years-netherlands-2026-01-27/</link><description>THE HAGUE, Jan 27 (Reuters) - An Eritrean people trafficker who tortured African refugees and migrants in camps in Libya was jailed for 20 years on Tuesday by a Dutch court, with a judge saying he had "no regard for human dignity".

Judges said 42-year-old Amanuel Walid - known as Tewelde Goitom - ran a migration route to Europe via Libya. He was convicted on charges of membership of a criminal organisation, human trafficking and extortion.

Prosecutors, whose investigation focused on the period between 2014 and 2019, said Walid's group detained thousands of African migrants in warehouses and tortured them to extort ransoms from their families.

"You and your co-perpetrators have treated (migrants) in a ruthless and merciless manner with no regard for human dignity and this, it seems, only to extort as much money as possible from vulnerable and helpless people seeking a better future," presiding judge Rene Melaard said.

During his trial Walid, who was extradited to the Netherlands in 2022, only spoke to tell judges he was the victim of mistaken identity and to invoke his right to remain silent. Judges ruled on Tuesday that the man in the dock was Walid.

The trial is the largest human trafficking case ever in the Netherlands and one of the few in Europe looking into criminal networks trafficking migrants through Libya.

Since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi during a NATO-backed uprising in 2011, Libya has become a transit route for migrants fleeing conflict and poverty to Europe across the Mediterranean.

Under the concept of universal jurisdiction, Dutch law broadly allows cases to be brought against foreign nationals for crimes committed abroad if the victims are in the Netherlands.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:02:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UK prosecutors charge former lawmaker Conor McGinn with sexual assault</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/uk-prosecutors-charge-former-lawmaker-conor-mcginn-with-sexual-assault-2026-01-27/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - British prosecutors on Tuesday charged a former Labour Party member of parliament, Conor McGinn, with one count of sexual assault, following a police investigation into an alleged incident in July 2022.

McGinn, 41, was suspended as a Labour member of parliament in 2022 following a formal complaint and then sat as an independent MP until 2024 when he stood down from parliament at a national election.

McGinn could not immediately be reached for comment.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said the allegation of sexual assault was made by a woman in 2022, and prosecutors had determined there was sufficient evidence to bring a charge.

Jessica Walker, deputy chief crown prosecutor of CPS London South, said it was in the public interest to do so.

McGinn is expected to appear in court next month.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:02:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump administration sued over 2 deaths in boat strike off Venezuela's coast</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-sued-over-2-deaths-boat-strike-off-venezuelas-coast-2026-01-27/</link><description>BOSTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Family members of two men killed in a U.S. missile strike against a suspected drug boat near Venezuela filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Tuesday, alleging the pair were murdered in a "manifestly unlawful" military campaign targeting civilian vessels.

Civil rights lawyers filed the lawsuit in Boston's federal court, marking the first court challenge to one of the 36 U.S. missile strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean authorized by President Donald Trump's administration that have killed more than 120 people since September.

Family members of Chad Joseph and Rishi Samaroo—two Trinidadian men who were among six killed during an October 14 strike —in the lawsuit say the two men did fishing and farm work in Venezuela and had been returning to their homes in Las Cuevas, Trinidad when they were attacked.

"These are lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theater, which is why we need a court of law to proclaim what is true and constrain what is lawless," Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement.

His group and the American Civil Liberties Union filed the novel lawsuit under the Death on the High Seas Act, a maritime law that allows family members to sue for wrongful deaths occurring on the high seas, and the Alien Tort Statute, a 1789 law that allows foreign citizens to sue in U.S. courts for violations of international law.

The lawsuit was filed by Lenore Burnley, Joseph's mother, and Sallycar Korasingh, Samaroo's sister, and seeks only damages from the U.S. government for the two deaths, not an injunction that would prevent further strikes.

But the case could provide an avenue for a court to assess whether the October 14 strike was legal.

The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has framed the attacks carried out under U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's direction as a war with drug cartels, alleging they were armed groups. It has said its attacks comply with international rules known as the law of war or the law of armed conflict.

But the attacks have drawn scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans in Congress, which has not authorized attacks on the drug cartels, and condemnation from human rights groups. Legal experts have previously said the drug cartels do not fit the accepted international definition of an armed group.

Tuesday's lawsuit argues that the killing of Joseph and Samaroo outside of an armed conflict, while they were not taking part in military hostilities against the U.S. amounted to murder and should be deemed a wrongful death on the high seas and an extrajudicial killing under international law.

"If the U.S. government believed Rishi had done anything wrong, it should have arrested, charged, and detained him, not murdered him," Korasingh said in a statement. "They must be held accountable."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:53:07 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3BMUUAABTBOHJC5Y6UTR73HCE4.jpg?auth=a06fbde127a5bee7b0a2156990e63177fda4d4fe84bac927f5a6520b0a7ef3f2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Atomic scientists set 'Doomsday Clock' closer to midnight than ever</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/atomic-scientists-set-doomsday-clock-closer-midnight-than-ever-2026-01-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Atomic scientists set their "Doomsday Clock" on Tuesday closer than ever to midnight, citing aggressive behavior by nuclear powers Russia , China and the United States , fraying nuclear arms control, conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East and AI worries among factors driving risks for global disaster.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists set the clock to 85 seconds before midnight, the theoretical point of annihilation. That is four seconds closer than it was set last year. The Chicago-based nonprofit created the clock in 1947 during the Cold War tensions that followed World War Two to warn the public about how close humankind was to destroying the world.

The scientists voiced concern about threats of unregulated integration of artificial intelligence into military systems and its potential misuse in aiding the creation of biological threats, as well as AI's role in spreading disinformation globally. They also noted continuing challenges posed by climate change.

"Of course, the Doomsday Clock is about global risks, and what we have seen is a global failure in leadership," nuclear policy expert Alexandra Bell, the Bulletin's president and CEO, told Reuters. "No matter the government, a shift towards neo-imperialism and an Orwellian approach to governance will only serve to push the clock toward midnight."

It was the third time in the past four years that the scientists moved the clock closer to midnight.

"In terms of nuclear risks, nothing in 2025 trended in the right direction," Bell said. "Longstanding diplomatic frameworks are under duress or collapsing, the threat of explosive nuclear testing has returned, proliferation concerns are growing, and there were three military operations taking place under the shadow of nuclear weapons and the associated escalatory threat. The risk of nuclear use is unsustainably and unacceptably high."

Bell pointed to Russia's continued war in Ukraine , the U.S. and Israeli bombing of Iran and border clashes between India and Pakistan . Bell also cited continuing tensions in Asia including on the Korean Peninsula and China's threats toward Taiwan , as well as rising tensions in the Western Hemisphere since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office 12 months ago.

The last remaining nuclear arms pact between the United States and Russia, the New START treaty , expires on February 5. Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed in September that the two countries agree to observe for another year the limits set under the pact, which caps each side's number of deployed nuclear warheads at 1,550. Trump has not formally responded. Western security analysts are divided about the wisdom of accepting Putin's offer.

Trump in October ordered the U.S. military to restart the process for testing nuclear weapons after a halt of more than three decades. No nuclear power, other than North Korea most recently in 2017, has conducted explosive nuclear testing in more than a quarter century.

No country would benefit more from a full-scale return to such testing than China, given its continued push to expand its nuclear arsenal, according to Bell, a former senior official at the U.S. State Department's Bureau of Arms Control, Deterrence and Stability.

Trump has upended the world order . He sent U.S. forces to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, threatened other Latin American countries, vowed to restore U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere, talked about annexing Greenland and imperiled transatlantic security cooperation.

Russia launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and there is no end in sight. Among the weapons Russia has used is the nuclear-capable hypersonic Oreshnik missile . Russia released video in December of what it said was the deployment of the Oreshnik in Belarus, a move meant to boost the Russian ability to strike targets across Europe.

"Russia, China, the United States and other major countries have become increasingly aggressive and nationalistic," Bell said.

Their "winner-takes-all great power competition" undermines the international cooperation needed to reduce risks of nuclear war, climate change, misuse of biotechnology, potential AI-related hazards and other apocalyptic dangers, Bell said.

Bell also cited Trump's domestic actions against science, academia, the civil service and news organizations.

Maria Ressa, a 2021 Nobel Peace Prize recipient for her journalistic efforts exposing abuses of power in the Philippines including how social media platforms were used to spread disinformation, participated in the announcement.

"We are living through an information Armageddon - the crisis beneath all crises - driven by extractive and predatory technology that spreads lies faster than facts and profits from our division," Ressa said in a statement.

The Bulletin was founded in 1945 by scientists including Albert Einstein and J. Robert Oppenheimer.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:53:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/JVNHFNEXOJOVDJNV3Z25B45SJQ.jpg?auth=b62ae57b00dedaacbd8402d5b61c9b3fa2f8f1eef2d71d28e4b534aa8dfdefa3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Spain to grant around half a million undocumented migrants legal status</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/spain-grant-around-half-million-undocumented-migrants-legal-status-2026-01-27/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Spain's Socialist-led government presented a draft decree on Tuesday to expedite legal status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, in its latest move to integrate migrant workers even as other European countries curb immigration.

Spain's economic growth has by far outpaced most European peers in the past two years, at least in part boosted by an openness to immigration that has dynamised key sectors like hospitality and care, and bolstered the welfare state.

Migration Minister Elma Saiz told a news conference irregular migrants who have lived in Spain for at least five months as of the end of 2025 and have no criminal record, as well as those who had applied for asylum before the end of the year, would be eligible for the accelerated residence permit.

Some 500,000 people, mostly from Latin America, stand to benefit from the measure, according to government estimates.

The permit will be valid for a year - or five in the case of children -- and renewable. After 10 years, the migrants could become citizens, or even quicker if they are from Latin America countries or refugees.

"We are strengthening a migration model based on human rights and integration, compatible with economic growth and social cohesion," Saiz told reporters, noting that economists across the region have attributed Spain's falling unemployment and strong growth in part to its openness to migrants.

Research from think tank Funcas suggests that around 840,000 people, a third of all non-EU migrants in Spain, were undocumented at the start of last year, a sharp increase from eight years ago when the figure stood at roughly 100,000.

A citizen-backed proposal to legalise undocumented migrants signed by 700,000 people and backed by 900 rights groups and the Catholic Church was filed over a year ago, but stalled in parliament, where disputes with splinter parties across the political spectrum have crippled the government's ability to approve legislation.

In its current form, the decree can be enacted by the cabinet within a few weeks' time without parliamentary approval. Conservative opposition leader Alberto Nuñez Feijoo has vowed to overturn the government's migratory policies if his party wins the next election, taking place at the latest next year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:54:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sudan's army says it breaks siege of southern city, survivors recount hunger and death</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/sudans-army-says-it-breaks-siege-southern-city-survivors-recount-hunger-death-2026-01-27/</link><description>AL-OBEID, Sudan, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Sudan's army says it has broken a long siege of the southern city of al-Dalanj by RSF paramilitary forces, during which survivors said many people were killed in drone and artillery strikes as hunger spread and medicines became scarce.

One survivor told Reuters that residents had been reduced to eating leaves and animal skin, and that some children had died of hunger. Others said people had died because they could not get the medicines they needed or leave to get treatment.

The siege of al-Dalanj began soon after war broke out in April 2023 between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). It intensified after the RSF joined forces last year with the SPLM-N, a rebel group that controls territory in the region.

In a statement released late on Monday, the Sudanese army said "the armed forces and supporting forces were able to forcibly and decisively open the road to Al-Dalanj, after carrying out a successful military operation."

The RSF did not respond to a request for comment on the army statement. Residents of al-Dalanj reported heavy drone attacks on Tuesday.

The victory, if sustained could signal a momentum shift after several RSF gains late last year.

Al-Dalanj is one of the largest cities in oil-producing South Kordofan province on Sudan's southern border. Greater Kordofan has become the latest centre of fighting since the RSF captured al-Fashir , the army's last holdout in the western Darfur region, in October.

More than 25,000 people have been displaced from South Kordofan since then, according to the UN's human rights office.

During a visit to Sudan last week, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights warned Sudanese and RSF officials to ensure that "crimes" committed during and after the takeover of al-Fashir "are not repeated" in South Kordofan, according to a statement.

Residents who fled al-Dalanj before Monday described witnessing drone and artillery attacks, echoing accounts from al-Fashir during the RSF siege. Reuters was unable immediately to confirm their accounts.

"We left because of the hunger and humiliation," said Haja Bahareldin, who spoke to Reuters with other women sheltering in a camp outside the city of al-Obeid to the north. "We couldn't find work... we couldn't find food."

She said one of her children died of hunger along the way and her two twins died after her arrival.

"Now I have no small child to carry in my arms," she said.

The Kordofan towns of al-Obeid and Kadugli have also been the scene of intense recent fighting. In Kadugli, while drone attacks have eased in recent days, the siege has caused sky-high prices and a scarcity of medicine as doctors flee along with others who can afford to, aid workers say.

In November, Kadugli was declared by international monitors to be in famine. International experts said al-Dalanj was likely to be experiencing the same, though the siege made data-gathering impossible.

Tambula Silia, another woman from al-Dalanj, said residents of the city had been reduced to eating leaves and animal skin and added: "For four or five months I didn't have a single piece of bread for me or my child."

Zakia Ramadan, who said she fled to al-Dalanj from the nearby town of Habila after the RSF took it, said four of her children had died of hunger while sheltering there.

Salma Mohamed, a resident of al-Dalanj, told Reuters it had been impossible to get her father out of the city when he needed a heart operation.

"We had to roam around until he died, we didn't find a way to get him treatment," she said.

Those who do manage to flee face a dangerous journey, also mirroring the stories of those who fled al-Fashir . Silia said that, among those who fled with her from al-Dalanj, "some were taken by the RSF and we don't know where to."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:54:42 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Sheinbaum does not deny report Mexico halted oil shipment to Cuba</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/sheinbaum-does-not-deny-report-mexico-halted-oil-shipment-cuba-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Tuesday did not deny a media report that Mexico had halted a crude oil shipment to Cuba, saying that Mexico's oil shipments were a sovereign decision.

The closed town of Severomorsk, the headquarters of Russia's Northern Fleet on the Barents Sea's Kola Bay, is home to Russia's most important naval command. It controls Russia's biggest fleet of ballistic missile submarines and extensive arsenals of nuclear warheads, missiles and repair yards.

Andrei Chibis, the governor of the wider Murmansk region, said on Tuesday that power had been restored to Severomorsk. Electricity supplies were cut to the northern city of Murmansk and Severomorsk on January 23.

Five pylons, two of them almost 60 years old, collapsed about 7 km (4 miles) from Murmansk on January 23, according to local media. Two dated from 1966, two from 1982, and one from 1988, according to the Severomorsk online news site.

The five men, three women and three children had been held for 92 days after being abducted from the Gada Mallam Maman community in Kaduna state in October.

Troops from forward operating base Doka detected the group on January 26 using long-range surveillance equipment, the army said in a statement. Soldiers moved in after spotting the kidnappers escorting their victims along a bush track.

Kidnappings for ransom have become a major security challenge in northwestern and central Nigeria, including along the Kaduna–Abuja expressway, a major transport corridor linking the commercial capital with the federal capital territory.

Nigeria's security situation is under scrutiny from U.S. President Donald Trump who launched a Christmas Day airstrike over what he says is persecution of Christians. Last week, armed bandits kidnapped more than 160 worshippers from two churches in Kaduna.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:55:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>FIFA's ex-chief Sepp Blatter joins calls to boycott World Cup over Trump policies</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-fifa-ex-president-sepp-blatter-joins-calls-boycott-us-world-cup-over-trump-policies</link><description>"For the fans, there's only one piece of advice: stay away from the USA!" Blatter wrote in a post on social media platform X.

Blatter called for the boycott in a post quoting comments by Swiss attorney Mark Pieth, an attorney specialising in white-collar crime and an anti-corruption expert, in an interview last week with the Swiss newspaper Der Bund. Pieth chaired the Independent Governance Committee's oversight of FIFA reform a decade ago.

Blatter was president of the world's governing body for soccer from 1998-2015; he resigned amid an investigation into corruption.

In his interview, Pieth said warned of the dangers of travelling to the United States.

“If we consider everything we’ve discussed, there’s only one piece of advice for fans: Stay away from the USA ! You’ll see it better on TV anyway. And upon arrival, fans should expect that if they don’t please the officials, they’ll be put straight on the next flight home. If they’re lucky.”

Blatter quoted Pieth and added: “I think Mark Pieth is right to question this World Cup .”

The United States is co-hosting the World Cup with Canada and Mexico from June 11-July 19.

The international soccer community's concerns about the United States stem from Trump's expansionist posture on Greenland , and travel bans and aggressive tactics in dealing with migrants and immigration enforcement protesters in American cities.

Blatter's statement comes days after US citizen Alex Pretti was shot by ICE agents in Minneapolis .

Oke Göttlich, one of the vice presidents of the German soccer federation, told the Hamburger Morgenpost newspaper in an interview on Friday that the time had come to seriously consider boycotting the World Cup.

Travel plans for fans from two of the top soccer countries in Africa were thrown into disarray in December, when the Trump administration announced an expanded ban that would effectively bar people from Senegal and Ivory Coast following their teams unless they already have visas. Trump cited “screening and vetting deficiencies” as the main reason for the suspensions.

Fans from Iran and Haiti, two other countries that have qualified for the World Cup, will be barred from entering the United States as well; they were included in the first iteration of the travel ban announced by the Trump administration.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:56:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/de15c92c-fb91-11f0-93e3-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/Sepp-Blatter.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge orders ICE chief to appear 'personally' in court, threatens contempt</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-us-judge-orders-ice-chief-to-appear-personally-in-court-threatens-contempt</link><description>The chief federal judge in Minnesota says the Trump administration has failed to comply with orders to hold hearings for detained immigrants and ordered the head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to appear before him Friday to explain why he shouldn’t be held in contempt.

In a brief order dated Monday, Chief Judge Patrick J. Schiltz said Todd Lyons, the acting director of ICE, must appear personally in court. Schlitz took the administration to task over its handling of bond hearings for immigrants it has detained.

“This Court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result,” the judge wrote.

The order comes a day after President Donald Trump ordered border czar Tom Homan to take over his administration’s immigration crackdown in Minnesota following the second death this month of person at the hands of an immigration law enforcement officer.

It also follows a federal court hearing Monday on a request by the state and the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul for a judge to order a halt to the immigration law enforcement surge. The judge said she was prioritising the ruling but didn't give a timeline.

Schlitz wrote that he recognizes ordering the head of a federal agency to appear personally is extraordinary. “But the extent of ICE’s violation of court orders is likewise extraordinary, and lesser measures have been tried and failed,” Schlitz wrote.

“Respondents have continually assured the Court that they recognise their obligation to comply with Court orders, and that they have taken steps to ensure that those orders will be honoured going forward,” he wrote. “Unfortunately, though, the violations continue.”

Messages were sent Tuesday to ICE and a DHS spokesperson seeking a response.

The order lists the petitioner by first name and last initials: Juan T.R. It says the court granted a petition on January 14 from the person to provide him with a bond hearing within seven days. On January 23, the person’s lawyers told the court the petitioner remained detained.

The order says Schlitz will cancel Lyons’ appearance if the petitioner is released from custody.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 15:56:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/f30d28e0-fb8f-11f0-835c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/ICE-Todd-Lyons.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US judge threatens ICE chief with contempt, orders court appearance</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-judge-threatens-ice-chief-with-contempt-orders-court-appearance-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - The chief judge of Minnesota's federal court ordered the acting chief of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to appear in court on Friday to personally explain why that agency has not complied with dozens of court orders in recent weeks.

In a filing late Monday, Chief Judge Patrick Schiltz said acting ICE director Todd Lyons must explain why he should not be held in contempt after his agency missed a deadline to provide a detainee with a bond hearing.

"This court has been extremely patient with respondents, even though respondents decided to send thousands of agents to Minnesota to detain aliens without making any provision for dealing with the hundreds of habeas petitions and other lawsuits that were sure to result," Schiltz wrote. "The court’s patience is at an end."

The Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, was not immediately available for comment on Tuesday. Schiltz said he will cancel Friday's hearing if the detainee is released. The judge, who sits in Minneapolis, was appointed to the bench by Republican President George W. Bush.

Schiltz's order came as protesters complain about ICE's tactics to advance President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown.

The move to install Homan in place of top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino, who sources said is leaving after having led most of Trump's crackdowns in Democratic-led cities, is part of a broader reset by the president amid some advisers' concerns that the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti by federal agents could derail his immigration agenda.

Trump spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers to reassess the administration's response to Pretti's death on Saturday, according to a White House official and a source familiar with the talks.

The discussions included reducing the number of federal agents deployed to Minnesota, recalibrating the ICE mission in the state to focus more narrowly on deportations rather than broad enforcement operations and exploring greater coordination with state authorities. Trump also weighed whether immigration officers should be required to have body-worn cameras, as many police officers do, according to the White House official.

The killing of Pretti, an ICU nurse shot multiple times by Border Patrol agents on Saturday during protests, has become a full-blown political crisis for Trump, with even some Republicans in Congress calling for investigations.

Coupled with the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti's shooting prompted renewed anger over the aggressive tactics of some 3,000 federal agents who have been roving the streets of Minneapolis for weeks.

Late on Monday, Minnesota's chief federal judge ordered the acting head of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons, to appear for a contempt hearing on Friday after the judge said the agency failed to comply with court orders that some detainees receive bond hearings.

"The court's patience is at an end," U.S. District Judge Patrick Schiltz wrote.

Bystander video of Pretti's killing was widely shared, contradicting some Trump officials' initial claims that Pretti, who was legally carrying a concealed gun but never touched it prior to being shot, posed a threat to law enforcement.

Public support for Trump's immigration enforcement tactics appeared to be waning both before and after the Pretti shooting, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. Some Republicans have voiced concern that absent a shift in tactics, Trump's mass deportation push could cost the party its congressional majorities in November's midterm elections.

The president held a two-hour meeting with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in the Oval Office on Monday evening after Noem asked to meet, a source briefed on the matter confirmed. Noem's job is not in jeopardy, the source said. The New York Times first reported the meeting.

The typically combative Trump has also struck a more conciliatory tone in public remarks. He characterized private conversations with both Governor Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Monday as productive, while the two Democratic leaders offered similarly positive comments, a far cry from the vitriol the two sides had previously exchanged.

Walz's office said Trump had agreed to direct DHS to ensure state authorities could conduct their own investigation into the Pretti shooting, while Frey said on X that his understanding was that some federal agents would begin leaving the city on Tuesday.

Privately, Trump made clear to advisers he did not want to defend the agent's actions or attack Pretti, after Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller labeled Pretti an "assassin" and Bovino suggested he intended to "massacre" officers, among other attacks from administration officials. Video footage of the incident verified by Reuters contradicted those allegations.

Senior aides were asked not to target Pretti publicly, and the president discussed distancing himself from public comments made by Miller and Noem, the White House official said.

Bovino, who said the officers who killed Pretti were the true victims in Saturday's shooting, is expected to depart Minneapolis along with some Border Patrol agents deployed with him, a senior administration official told Reuters on Monday.

Another person familiar with the matter said Bovino had been stripped of his specially created title of "commander at large" of the Border Patrol and would return to his former job as a chief patrol agent along California's El Centro sector of the U.S.-Mexico border, before retiring soon after.

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin disputed those reports, posting on X on Monday: "Chief Gregory Bovino has NOT been relieved of his duties."

DHS officials described the incident as an attack by Pretti, saying agents fired in self-defense after he approached them with a handgun, even though video showed Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as agents wrestled him to the ground.

It also showed officers removing a firearm from his waistband after he was subdued, moments before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner.

In another sign that support for Trump's immigration drive in Minnesota was weakening, a leading Republican candidate for governor in the state, Chris Madel, dropped his bid on Monday, saying the crackdown had gone too far.

"I cannot support the national Republicans' stated retribution on the citizens of our state, nor can I count myself a member of a party that would do so," he said in a video statement.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:32:38 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KZ4FJHZTWZI5NFFJ3HT4AHNEBM.jpg?auth=8e977a6792a8bfd98ef6da32493a5845c22f8d874d9ed236ecf98c23b7cf0fa9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU adds India in rush for trade deals after Trump's return</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/eu-adds-india-rush-trade-deals-after-trumps-return-2026-01-27/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The European Union concluded negotiations on a free trade agreement with India on Tuesday, in the latest of a series of deals designed to offset the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and reduce reliance on China.

EU trade in goods with the United States was worth 873 billion euros ($1.04 trillion) in 2024 and with China 736 billion euros, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat, respectively 17% and 15% of the EU's trade with the rest of the world.

The following are the EU's concluded deals and ongoing negotiations:

The deal was struck with the South American bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in December 2024, just a month after Trump's re-election, and some 25 years after talks began.

The agreement is the EU's largest in terms of tariff reductions, removing over 4 billion euros of annual duties on EU exports such as cars and allowing EU companies to bid for public contracts in Mercosur on the same terms as local suppliers.

The deal has though proved contentious . Critics, such as France, say it will lead to cheap imports of South American foodstuffs, such as beef, undercutting EU farmers. Green groups also say it will lead to further deforestation.

The agreement was signed this month, but the European Parliament has referred it to the EU's top court , which could lead to a two-year delay. Proponents such as Germany want it to be applied on a provisional basis as soon as possible.

The European Commission says the agreement could boost EU exports to Mercosur by 39%. EU-Mercosur goods trade totalled 111 billion euros in 2024.

In January 2025, on the eve of Trump's inauguration, the EU revived a stalled free trade agreement with Mexico . The agreement updated a trade accord of 2000, which only covered industrial goods, by adding services, government procurement, investment and farm produce.

The EU believes the update, which awaits approval in the bloc, will increase trade between the two that has risen by over 300% since 2000. In 2024, their merchandise trade was worth 82 billion euros.

The EU finalised negotiations with Indonesia in September.

The deal will remove some 600 million euros of duties on EU products, including chemicals, machinery, milk powder and cheese.

Indonesia aims to grow its exports of palm oil, coffee and textiles and needs the deal as its economy grows and it loses the preferential access the EU grants to poorer developing countries.

EU goods trade with Indonesia was 27 billion euros in 2024. Indonesia has said it wants the pact to enter force by January 2027 and expects bilateral trade to double in the first five years.

The EU's trade agreement with India is less ambitious than those with other partners, not achieving full liberalisation in sectors such as cars and excluding government procurement, energy and raw materials or investments in manufacturing.

However, the two sides still refer to it as the "mother of all deals", with large-scale tariff reductions and a combined population of 2 billion people.

EU-India goods trade was 120 billion euros in 2024. The EU estimates its goods exports to India will double by 2032, with nearly 4 billion euros of tariff savings.

The European Union has also accelerated trade negotiations with other ASEAN countries. It resumed talks with Malaysia in January 2025, and had held three sets of negotiating rounds this year with both the Philippines and Thailand. EU trade chief Maros Sefcovic has said he wants to wrap up these negotiations by 2027 .

The EU launched negotiations with the United Arab Emirates in May 2025.

It has also said it expects to resume negotiations with Australia early this year after they were shelved in 2023. A deal could also see the EU increase its access to critical minerals like lithium and rare earths.

Combined EU goods trade with these countries was 211 billion euros in 2024.

The death in August of Raphael Graven, alias Jean Pormanove, live on the 200,000-follower video channel he shared with Owen Cenazandotti and Safine Hamadi shocked France and drew the ire of government ministers.

Cenazandotti, 26, and Safine, 23, have denied responsibility for 46-year-old Graven's death, which followed a 12-day live marathon of physical and verbal abuse against him.

But they are now being held on charges including assault, incitement to hatred, abuse of a vulnerable person and recording and broadcasting violent images, said Damien Martinelli, chief prosecutor in the Mediterranean city of Nice.

Prosecutors first opened a probe against the group in December 2024, months before Graven's death, when they encountered footage of him being insulted and struck, having his hair pulled and being shot with paintball guns .

All three streamers were held in January last year but released after they insisted the on-screen violence was all part of "an act aimed at creating buzz so as to earn money".

Graven died on August 18 during a livestream in which he and another man were struck and insulted by his younger colleagues, though an autopsy has since ruled out "intervention by a third party" playing a role in his death.

Ministers in August announced separate legal action against the Australia-based Kick platform, which is also under investigation by Paris prosecutors.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:33:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/fb87b0fe-fb93-11f0-a6c0-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/Capture-213.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Families of two killed in US strikes near Venezuela sue the Trump administration</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-families-of-two-killed-in-us-strikes-near-venezuela-file-suit-against-trump-administration</link><description>Family members of ‍two men killed in ​a US missile strike against a suspected drug boat near Venezuela filed a wrongful death lawsuit on Tuesday, alleging the pair were ⁠murdered in a "manifestly unlawful" military campaign targeting civilian vessels.

Civil rights lawyers filed the lawsuit in Boston's federal court, marking the first court challenge to one of the 36 US missile strikes on vessels in the Caribbean Sea and Pacific Ocean authorised ​by President Donald Trump 's administration that have killed more than 120 people since September.

Family members of Chad ‍Joseph and Rishi Samaroo – two Trinidadian men who were among six killed during an October 14 strike – in the lawsuit say the two men did fishing and farm work in ​Venezuela and had been returning to their homes in Las Cuevas, Trinidad when they were attacked.

"These ​are lawless killings in cold blood; killings for sport and killings for theater, which is why we need a court of law to proclaim what is true and constrain what is lawless," Baher Azmy, a lawyer for the plaintiffs at the Center for Constitutional Rights, said in a statement.

His group and the American Civil Liberties Union filed the novel lawsuit under the Death on the High Seas Act, a maritime law that allows family members to sue for wrongful deaths occurring on the high seas, and the Alien Tort Statute, a ‍1789 law that allows foreign citizens to sue in US courts for violations of international law.

The lawsuit was filed by Lenore Burnley, Joseph's mother, and Sallycar Korasingh, Samaroo's sister, ​and seeks only damages from the US government for the two deaths, not an injunction that would prevent further strikes.

But the case could provide an avenue for a court to assess whether the October 14 strike was legal.

The ‌Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Trump administration has framed the attacks carried out under US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth 's direction as a war with drug cartels, alleging they ‍were armed groups. It has said its attacks comply with international rules known as the law of war or the law of armed conflict.

But the attacks have drawn scrutiny from Democrats and some Republicans in Congress, which has not authorised attacks on the drug cartels, and condemnation from human rights groups. Legal experts have previously said the drug cartels do not fit the accepted international definition of an armed group.

Tuesday's lawsuit argues that the killing of Joseph and Samaroo outside of an armed conflict, while they were not taking part ‍in military hostilities against the US amounted to murder and should be deemed a wrongful death on the high seas and an extrajudicial killing ‌under international law.

"If the ​US government believed Rishi had done anything wrong, it should have arrested, charged, and detained him, not murdered him," Korasingh said in a statement. "They must be held accountable."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 16:33:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/5ecd0b04-fb95-11f0-8825-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25351715660539.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran welcomes any process to prevent war, president tells Saudi crown prince in phone call</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-welcomes-any-process-prevent-war-president-tells-saudi-crown-prince-phone-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian told Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in a phone call that Tehran always welcomes any process, within the framework of international law, that prevents war, Iranian media reported on Tuesday.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:30:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/L6Y6CSX3ZJOUFGDXNJIEQJBA4A.jpg?auth=283480254b11f0fbe0705e3815dcda2681de4cdeb92bc4b6e1c5f91f7ab9bd92&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Syrian Kurdish enclave on alert amid shaky ceasefire</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/syrian-kurdish-enclave-alert-amid-shaky-ceasefire-2026-01-27/</link><description>QAMISHLI, Syria, Jan 27 (Reuters) - With Syria's Islamist-led government bearing down on Kurdish forces, residents of their last major enclave are on alert, mindful of last year's violence against other minority groups and determined to preserve their self-rule.

In the Kurdish-majority city of Qamishli in the northeast, a mechanic, a storekeeper, and a student were among those taking part in a nighttime volunteer patrol this week, vowing to defend their area and putting little faith in a shaky ceasefire.

"We're going out to guard our neighbourhoods, to stand with our people and protect our land," said Yazan Ghanem, 23. "This is our land. We won't accept any outside interference in our areas."

It reflects simmering tensions despite the U.S.-backed ceasefire, which was extended on Saturday for 15 days. Some clashes have taken place since then.

Having taken swathes of the north and east from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), President Ahmed al-Sharaa's government is pressing its demand for the integration of the remaining Kurdish-run enclaves with the state.

The SDF is clinging on in its northeastern enclave - one of several where Kurds - an oppressed group under the ousted Assad dynasty - established de facto autonomy during the civil war.

While Sharaa has repeatedly vowed to uphold Kurdish rights - he recognised Kurdish as a national language earlier this month - the residents patrolling Qamishli on Monday had little confidence in the former al Qaeda commander.

"We have fears and doubts about the government because, quite simply, wherever it has entered, there have been massacres and killing," said Radwan Eissa, brandishing a gun.

Fears among Syrian minorities grew last year during several bouts of violence in which the Sunni Muslim-led government clashed with members of the Alawite community in Syria's coastal region, and Druze communities in Sweida province, with government-aligned fighters killing hundreds of people.

Sharaa has promised accountability.

A senior Syrian government official said Kurdish fears were "understandable" based on abuses committed by army personnel in Sweida and some violations carried out by troops as they pressed into Kurdish-held areas in recent weeks.

The official said two people had been arrested for the recent abuses and a third was on the run, but being pursued. “We are keen to learn from past experiences, and we did,” he added.

The prosecutor general last year pressed charges against some 300 people linked to armed factions affiliated with the Syrian army over the violence in the coastal region, and around 265 who belonged to Assad-era paramilitary groups.

Human Rights Watch said on January 25 that both parties appeared to have committed abuses that violated international law during the current escalation in the northeast.

Government forces have advanced to the outskirts of SDF-held Hasakah, an ethnically mixed city some 70 km (45 miles) south of Qamishli. They have also encircled Kobani, or Ain al-Arab, a Kurdish-held town at the Turkish border.

The SDF has vowed to protect Kurdish regions.

In an interview with Kurdish broadcaster Ronahi on Sunday, SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said dialogue continued with Damascus, and that after the 15-day period "serious steps" would be taken towards integration.

"Our forces are ready for war and political solutions," he said. "The Kurds must get their rights in this region, and join the Syrian state," he said.

The Syrian official said the January 18 integration deal aimed to reassure Kurds by stipulating that Syrian troops would not enter Kurdish areas and by spelling out how local communities would be able to delegate their own representatives.

The SDF's territory grew as it partnered with the United States against Islamic State in Syria.

But its position weakened as Washington deepened ties to Sharaa over the last year. President Donald Trump said on January 20 Washington was trying to protect the Kurds.

Syria's dominant Kurdish group, the PYD, follows a political doctrine emphasising leftism and feminism.

Giwana Hussein, a 23-year-old Qamishli student, said she hoped the ceasefire showed that both sides wanted a political solution. She urged Damascus to let Kurds run their own affairs, and said she was afraid that if the government took control, women's rights would be marginalised.

The Syrian official said the government wanted to ensure a new constitution addressed Kurdish concerns, but said that it could only come after an integration deal was agreed and implemented. "Once we merge, we can discuss everything," the official said.

Ivan Hassib, a Kurdish activist critical of the PYD, said Sharaa's decree recognising Kurdish rights was positive but only a first step, saying they must be enshrined in the constitution and not limited to cultural rights: "The lasting solution ... is for the Kurds and other groups to obtain some form of autonomy."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 17:30:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/Q3WTZK2XDFJAZNEOWEGG2DXW3Y.jpg?auth=ba3ac5e698ed5911be15bb22de0259dde7f9ffe16af6b2bef42ab46b5eac670e&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN experts denounce Switzerland for sentencing students over Gaza protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/un-experts-denounce-switzerland-sentencing-students-over-gaza-protests-2026-01-27/</link><description>GENEVA, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.N. human rights experts have protested to Bern after a group of students were sentenced for trespassing after taking part in pro-Palestinian protests at a Swiss-funded university, they said in a statement on Tuesday.

Around 70 students at the Swiss university ETH Zurich took part in peaceful sit-in in May 2024 , opens new tab as part of student demonstrations in several cities during the Gaza war before being dispersed by police.

Students who took part in the protests were opposing the Swiss facility's partnerships with Israeli universities, the U.N. experts said.

“Peaceful student activism, on and off campus, is part of students’ rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly, and must not be criminalised,” the U.N. experts said, adding that they had written to the Swiss government and the university to raise the issue.

A spokesperson for the Swiss Federal Ministry of Justice and Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An ETH Zurich spokesperson did not immediately respond.

Five students have so far been sentenced for trespassing, resulting in suspended fines of up to 2700 CHF ($3,516.08), legal fees of over 2,000 CHF ($2,604.85) and a conviction on their criminal records which are frequently sought by prospective employers, the U.N. experts said.

Ten others who appealed the charges await sentencing and two others were acquitted, they said.

“I’m always positive,” Lili Keller-Rosenberg says with a glint in her eye. She wears lipstick, has an impeccable blow-dry and wears a carefully chosen dress, because she insists on being elegant in all circumstances. "A lesson in dignity," as she puts it.

That philosophy has stayed with her from her experience in the concentration camps. "Every morning at Ravensbrück, my mother would wake us half an hour before the others, because she was absolutely determined that we wash ourselves. She would tell us: 'They've taken everything from us. We have nothing left, not even a name, but we must not bow our heads. Let's be dignified. Let's look proper,'" she remembers, 80 years later, at the hotel in Lille where we have arranged to meet.

Lili Keller-Rosenberg was born on September 15, 1932, in more hopeful times. "In a warm home with wonderful parents," she says. "They came from Budapest, Hungary, where there was already anti-Semitism . They chose to settle in France because it's the country of human rights . That's where we were born – in the north of France, my two brothers and I," she says.

But she later had her childhood stolen.

In the few family photos that survived World War II , there are smiling faces. Her mother, Charlotte, was a seamstress. Her father, Joseph, was employed in a dyeworks. It was a state of simple happiness in the small house in Roubaix. But the conflict gradually intruded into daily life. At 10 years old, in June 1942, Lili was forced to wear the yellow star of David.

"It didn't shock me. I thought it was pretty. I wore it without asking too many questions," she remembers.

The parents tried to protect their three children and never spoke of the war until the day when the threat became impossible to ignore. They decided to hide the children in different families in Tourcoing, helped by the priest of a parish in Roubaix.

"It was a wonderful gesture,” she says. “They risked being deported themselves. It was very courageous.”

'The Nazis were yelling, the dogs were barking, the children were crying'

But at the end of summer 1943, without her knowing the reason, her parents decided to bring them back home. “Perhaps they imagined that there was no longer any risk." Sadly, a few months later, on October 27, at 3 o'clock in the morning, violent knocks struck at the door. The Feldgendarmerie (German military police) burst into the Rosenberg home.

The moment is engraved in Lili's memory. "They followed us everywhere, even to the toilet. We couldn't be alone. They shouted, ' Schnell, los! ' (Move, quickly!). We had to gather what was most precious. We were frantic with fear." Her youngest brother, André, was only 3 years old: "I remember he took his favourite toy, a wooden duck on wheels. He put it under his arm and followed those soldiers who pushed us down the stairs," she remembers.

The family was first taken to Loos prison in Lille. The city was under the military administration of Belgium and Northern France, an entity created by Nazi Germany. The Rosenbergs were then transferred to Saint-Gilles prison in Brussels, then to the Malines internment camp in Belgium.

"In this camp there were German SS, but also Flemish ones. One of them was particularly cruel and distributed lashes of the whip generously," Keller-Rosenberg says.

The conditions were dreadful, but the worst was yet to come. On December 13, 1943, the SS informed them that they would have to leave the camp. A search was organised first, which Lili still remembers with disgust: "We all had to get naked. We were very uncomfortable. You know, back then, we were very modest. We had to spread our legs, and bend forward. They shone a flashlight at us from below to see if we had hidden precious objects. Jewellery, for example."

Cattle cars then awaited the deportees. It was chaos: "The Nazis were yelling, the dogs were barking, the children were crying. We were pushed into a wagon and it was only once the doors were closed that we realised papa wasn't with us." Joseph was transferred to the Buchenwald camp, while the rest of the family were sent to Ravensbrück.

'Our humanity was stripped away'

After an "atrocious journey of four or five days without eating or drinking", Lili, her mother and her two brothers arrived at the Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany, the largest for women under the Third Reich. They were pushed into prison blocks. "We had a quick, cold shower. We were all shaved. Our humanity was stripped away. We were given our prisoner clothing, those grey-and-blue-striped dresses, and our prisoner numbers. Mine was 25,612." In her small voice, she repeats it in German. Five numbers forever imprinted in her mind: "From that moment on, we were nobody."

At Ravensbrück, 80 km north of Berlin, the Rosenbergs met other French women, mostly resistance fighters – including Geneviève de Gaulle , General Charles de Gaulle 's niece, and Martha Desrumaux , a union activist from northern France. There were very few children because those who were there for political reasons were arrested alone, without their families. In this hell, Lili became aware of the fate that was reserved for them:

"I understood that we had been arrested because we were Jewish and that the Nazis wanted to destroy all the Jews of Europe."

All day long, she found herself left to her own devices with her little brothers, while their mother was sent into forced labour. "We didn't dare leave our blocks. We stayed inside for fear of seeing the Nazis and their dogs. They had no feelings. We saw the inhuman way they behaved with all the prisoners."

No more games, no more laughter, no more moments of carefree innocence. "Our entertainment consisted of killing lice. We were covered in vermin. The more we killed, the more appeared." Covered in boils, they also suffered from hunger. They survived on hard bread and a disgusting black liquid. Lili says they survived thanks to their mother's love. "Without her, we were lost. It was her presence that gave us the will to live. We waited for her to return every evening, and then we could breathe again."

The 'horror in those soldiers’ eyes' when they discovered Bergen-Belsen

In February 1945, exhausted, the family was told it was time to leave Ravensbrück. As the Soviets advanced, the prisoners were gradually evacuated. The Rosenbergs were again pushed into train wagons. After a chaotic journey, the doors opened and an atrocious smell grabbed them by the throat: "I couldn't even describe it to you. We arrived in a place that felt even more sinister than Ravensbrück,” remembers Lili. “There were corpses all over the ground. We had to step over them to move forward."

The living, dead and sick were all mixed together. With horror, Lili discovered the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, known as the "camp of slow death". It was in the midst of a typhus epidemic . "I can still see those wooden carts fitted with four posts and with a grey canvas curtain. With the wind, it would lift up. You could see an arm hanging here, a leg there, a skull there. It was a Dantesque vision."

In this apocalyptic setting, the family gradually lost strength. Charlotte contracted typhus and her children could not help her. "She lay on the ground next to us. When we spoke to her, she didn't answer us. She was so strange, she seemed to be in another world. We understood nothing. She had been so formidable at Ravensbrück, she couldn't imagine returning without one of us and so she deprived herself of her meager rations to give us an extra mouthful. There, she lay on the ground, unconscious, in a terrible state," Lili remembers with vivid emotion. "We wanted to die at that moment. Death would have been preferable to this beastly life they made us lead. We let ourselves go, nothing mattered to us anymore."

But the little Rosenbergs held on despite everything. On April 15, 1945, they witnessed the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen camp by British soldiers. "I can still see the horror in those soldiers' eyes. They didn't dare move. They took a few steps back, not daring to approach us. They were horrified.” Lili remembers the cans of corned beef and packets of sweet, condensed milk the soldiers distributed, once they had got over the initial shock. In the "camp of slow death", 60,000 survivors coexisted with thousands of corpses.

Lili and her brothers were finally repatriated to France, but their mother, too ill to be transported, remained in Germany. They arrived alone at the Hôtel Lutetia in Paris, a reception centre for freed prisoners. "No one came to collect us. We had no one. We were happy to be free and back in France, but at the same time we were so sad. We had no news of our parents. What was the point of living if we were to be orphans?"

After being taken in by an aunt, the children were sent to a sanatorium in Hendaye in the Basque Country to receive medical care. Against all odds, their mother found them there. "One day, the door to our room opened. Maman was there before our eyes, frighteningly thin. Life took on meaning for us again." The family was only partially reunited. A few months later, they learned that their father had been shot by the Nazis three days before the liberation of Buchenwald.

The number of survivors is dwindling

Their health was fragile and they had very little money, but the Rosenbergs had to resume the course of their lives. They returned to settle in the north of France. "Those were hard years," Lili remembers. The decades passed and silence fell on their experience in the camps.

"People seemed to doubt what we told them. It offended us greatly. We kept silent."

Lili became a secretary and never left the north. She continues to live in Lille today. She married and had a daughter.

It was only in the 1980s that she decided to speak out, she says, when “Holocaust deniers emerged – those who dared to say that it hadn’t existed.”

Lili began sharing her story in middle schools and high schools, "to her little messengers of peace", as she likes to call them.

Meeting young people energises her. "They listen, my little messengers. It gives me the desire to continue. They're sweet and ask me good questions."

She has lost count of how many schools she has visited over the course of more than 40 years. She has spoken to hundreds of thousands of students. "Sometimes, I speak to 2,000 schoolchildren all at once,” she says.

At 93, she admits "that she would like to take a little break" because it's "not so easy to keep going back to the past". Yet projects keep coming her way. After publishing her first book in 2021, "And We Came Back Alone," a comic book will soon be dedicated to her: "Lili, Always Standing, Until the End".

Regional authorities have acquired her former house in Roubaix, with plans to make it a memorial centre honouring deported children like herself.

Lili shows no signs of stopping. Her schedule for 2026 is already full with "requests from all over France and even abroad".

Survivors of the Holocaust are increasingly rare and she is one of the last in France who can still travel.

'One day peace will come'

Tirelessly, Lili shares her family’s story. Her younger brothers are still alive and she says she's prepared to continue bearing witness until she’s at least 100 years old. "After that, we'll see!" she says, smiling.

Mixing gentleness and strength, she describes the worst of humanity on a mission to spread peace.

"I tell the children to be vigilant because everything can come back in a different form. Evil is everywhere. We must fight racism at all costs, which is a scourge of our time – anti-Semitism, which unfortunately persists, as well as xenophobia."

Lili has known evil up close. But despite that, she believes in humanity. "We can't live entire lives in war. One day peace will come. And I'll see it from up above, and I’ll rejoice."

Preliminary estimates of the number of demonstrators killed range from 6,000 – the current total of an ongoing count being carried out by NGOs – and 20,000, according to the UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran , Mai Sato.

As our team observed by reviewing many videos filmed by eyewitnesses, the Kahrizak morgue in Tehran was flooded with hundreds of protesters’ bodies. According to partial counts carried out by the BBC and the NGO Human Rights Watch , the bodies of at least 200 to 400 demonstrators were brought to the site.

However, social media users and media outlets with links to the Iranian government began, the week of January 19, to explicitly deny that the massacres were taking place, claiming that the photos taken in the Kahrizak morgue were all generated by artificial intelligence.

The Fars News Agency, which is linked to the Iranian regime, has tried to make this point by sharing two images of the same moving scene: a young woman in mourning standing amidst the many wrapped bodies laid out in the morgue’s courtyard.

The first image – on the right in the screenshot above – was taken from a tweet by Israeli journalist Emy Schrader. The wide shot shows a young woman standing amidst the bodies from a distance.

The Fars News Agency said that the journalist had shared a “fake image” while claiming that “16,500 people had been killed in the riots". The agency further claimed:

"[The journalist] also used artificial intelligence to make her lie credible, but forgot to remove the Gemini AI label from the corner of the image”.

It is true that the image shared by Schrader was generated by artificial intelligence. You can see the logo for Gemini, Google’s artificial intelligence, which is added to images produced by Nano Banana, the AI image generator included in Gemini.

The second image is more zoomed in than the first and focuses on the woman in mourning. By including both images in the same post, Fars is saying that this closer up image is also fake.

However, this way of presenting the images as both false is misleading. Although the first image was indeed AI-generated, the second is authentic.

We were able to confirm that the first image – the one with the AI Gemini logo – was indeed generated by this tool by using the AI detection tool SynthID, which is integrated in the Google Lens search engine. When we uploaded this first image to Google Lens, it concluded that it was “created with Google AI” in the “about this image” section.

The second image that the Fars News Agency claimed was false is actually authentic. It is from the Telegram account of an Iranian blogger who shared the photo along with others taken in the Kahrizak morgue. The choice to include this authentic photo alongside the AI-generated image and claim that both are false is part of a strategy to deny the real repression happening in Iran.

Our team was able to verify the authenticity of a number of different videos from the Kahrizak morgue , some filmed in the same courtyard where the woman in the photo is standing. These videos helped us confirm that the scene captured in the photo did take place. Other videos and photos taken from different angles also show that there were many bodies laid on the ground of the morgue’s courtyard.

This footage allows us to establish that the image of the woman in mourning was indeed taken at the Kahrizak morgue. Using a satellite image of the morgue that was provided to our team by the satellite image company Vantor, as well as two verified videos filmed in the courtyard of the morgue, it is possible to establish where the young woman was standing: in front of the entrance to a large building with a red roof. A brown-and-beige wall appears in both videos and the photo. Moreover, a white building in the background of the photo of the young woman can be seen in the satellite image.

It is likely that the AI-generated image was produced using the authentic photo, as the woman in the AI-generated image appears very similar to the woman in the real image.

However, it seems as if the Fars News Agency was using the AI-generated image to also discredit the authentic image and, thus, the reality of the massacres believed to have been committed by the Iranian security forces. Implying that all photos of the Kahrizak morgue are false because some false images have been circulating is a manipulative narrative that the Iranian authorities are using to try to discredit any accounts of their brutal crackdown.

Jose Jeri, who took office in October after the removal of former President Dina Boluarte, has denied any wrongdoing in the three meetings he acknowledged holding between December and January with businessman Zhihua Yang.

The businessman owns Chinese import shops and holds a concession for an energy project. He has also previously been named in congressional investigations as allegedly providing logistical support to Chinese firms suspected of corruption.

The controversy has coincided with a stepped-up U.S. influence campaign in the region aimed at curtailing China's deep ties in Latin America.

"It wouldn't be surprising to see the Trump administration questioning China's investment in Peru. It did so in Mexico and Panama, and potentially using pressure tools to nudge Peru away from China," said Martin Cassinelli, a trade and investment analyst at the Atlantic Council think tank.

The case, dubbed "Chifagate" by the local media, has prompted opposition lawmakers to file impeachment motions seeking to oust Jeri, who is tasked with completing the current government's term through July. The public prosecutor's office has opened a preliminary investigation into Jeri for alleged influence peddling, which he has denied.

Peruvians will head to the polls to elect a new president on April 12. Peru, which has seen seven presidents since 2018, has nonetheless enjoyed one of the strongest growth rates in Latin America thanks in part to steady mining income.

Washington's recent capture of Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro, an ally of China and Russia, sent a message that it aims to exclude extra-regional powers from the Western Hemisphere, analysts said, a stance that places additional pressure on governments like Peru's as they navigate internal crises.

"Criticism of a Chinese businessman is also, practically, criticism of China," said Jhon Valdiglesias of the Center for Asian Studies at Peru's National University of San Marcos.

"I think it definitely casts a shadow over all relations with China," he added.

Still, disrupting Peru's deep China commercial ties won't be easy. A free trade pact, signed in 2009, propelled China to outpace the U.S. as Peru's top trading partner starting in 2015.

According to government data through November of last year, China accounts for 33% of Peru's trade, compared with 14% with the U.S.

China also controls one of Peru's largest copper mines and buys about 70% of the country's output of the metal. Chinese firms own Peru's largest power generators, and in late 2024 began operating the Chancay megaport, creating a new direct South America–Asia trade route.

Former Peruvian ambassador to China, Juan Carlos Capunay, said the South American country's economic relations with Beijing are "perhaps among the best structured administratively and politically" in recent years.

"We have several key instruments that sustain them, including a free trade agreement in force with China," he said, adding that would make it a challenge for the U.S. to dismantle or even weaken in the long term.

Even so, the Chifagate scandal has put a spotlight on some of the seamier aspects of the relationship.

"If Peruvians, who up until now looked favorably upon Chinese investment projects, are to question the credibility of that investment, new Chinese investments and government contracts will be less welcome by a society sensitive to allegations of corruption and undue favoritism for foreign companies," Cassinelli said.

Representatives of China's embassy in Peru did not respond to a request for comment.

Support appears to be eroding for Jeri, whose approval rating has dropped from 51% to 41% since the scandal broke, according to polling firm Datum Internacional.

As many as 78% of Peruvians responded to an Ipsos poll over the weekend that they perceive signs of corruption in Jeri's meetings with the businessman.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:27:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/6HRFGHKWXJPC3BVNU34WIKISKM.jpg?auth=e47e81bf46b5235675e43fddb9084004a80d02469dc303435cecfc78d8eb2b51&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Captain of seized Venezuela-linked tanker now aboard U.S. vessel, wife's lawyer says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/captain-seized-venezuela-linked-tanker-now-aboard-us-vessel-wifes-lawyer-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The captain of a Venezuela-linked crude oil tanker seized by the U.S. earlier this month has been taken from British territorial waters and is now aboard a U.S. coast guard vessel, a lawyer for the captain's wife said on Tuesday.

The U.S. Coast Guard and U.S. military special forces, bearing a judicial seizure warrant, apprehended the Russian-flagged Marinera in the Atlantic near Iceland on January 7 after pursuing it for more than two weeks as part of Washington's efforts to block Venezuelan oil exports.

After its capture the tanker was moved to a location off the coast of Scotland.

Despite legal attempts to stop their removal, its captain Captain Avtandil Kalandadze, a Georgian, and the boat's First Officer had been taken away from Scottish jurisdiction to the U.S. coast guard vessel Munro, Aamer Anwar, the lawyer for Kalandadze's wife Natia Dzadzama, said.

On Monday, a Scottish court issued an interim order preventing the captain's removal pending a judicial review of his detention, but that was recalled in the early hours of Tuesday after hearing that Kalandadze was already outside British territorial waters, Anwar said.

"Our client's judicial review can no longer be enforced now her husband has, in essence, been abducted by the U.S. government on Scottish and British territory," he said in a statement.

There was no immediate comment from the U.S. coast guard, the devolved Scottish government nor the British government's Scotland Office.

Anwar said the other 26 crew of the Marinera, formerly known as the Bella-1, had been processed at a British army centre in Inverness. Five had chosen to travel to the United States, while the others had chosen alternative travel arrangements to their home countries, Anwar said.

Last week, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow had expected the U.S. to free the crew members which he said included two Russians, as well as Ukrainians, Georgians and Indians.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7LC7RDHUGJPY7FCSXGBAUZBMYA.jpg?auth=9b30ab024a1087fdda755df29fbd45e418e7680db721fc8f8a40dff947cf2fd2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israeli president to meet Bondi Beach shooting families during Australia trip</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/israeli-president-meet-bondi-beach-shooting-families-during-australia-trip-2026-01-27/</link><description>TEL AVIV, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Israeli President Isaac Herzog will meet the families of victims of the Bondi Beach shooting and members of the Australian Jewish community during a visit to the country next month, his office said on Tuesday.

The attack targeted a Jewish Hanukkah celebration in December, killing 15 people in Australia's worst mass shooting in decades.

"President Herzog will visit Jewish communities across Australia to express solidarity and offer strength to the community in the aftermath of the attack," his office said in a statement.

Herzog, who as president holds a largely ceremonial role, is also scheduled to meet Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He will set off on February 8 and the visit will conclude on February 12.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:29:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/3B2NOGWNAJKI5H5HQB3URU2GEE.jpg?auth=61025bad7e9bc3ac1cdc67e5fa5861f80cd2661764bf06808d51bab9f4ba51c8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Explainer: What do Democrats and Republicans want in fight over ICE operations?</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/what-do-democrats-republicans-want-fight-over-ice-operations-2026-01-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Funding for the Department of Homeland Security and several other U.S. government agencies could expire this week if Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Congress do not resolve a dispute over immigration agents' aggressive enforcement efforts.

President Donald Trump is waging a massive campaign to deport immigrants who are in the country illegally, which also has snared some immigrants with legal status and U.S. citizens.

Trump's administration has surged agents to several Democratic-led cities including Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte, and most recently Minneapolis and St. Paul.

In Minneapolis, residents have been angered by several incidents, including the killing of two U.S. citizens, the detention of a U.S. citizen who was in his shorts, and the detention of school children, including a .

Meanwhile, six deaths in Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention centers are known to have occurred just this month.

Democrats have long been calling for tougher controls over immigration agent operations and practices. In the wake of Saturday's shooting of U.S. citizen Alex Pretti, they are demanding that such reforms be attached to legislation that funds the Department of Homeland Security through September.

That bill was approved last week in the House of Representatives over the objection of most Democrats. The DHS funding was attached to broader legislation that also funds agencies ranging from the Defense Department to those operating medical research, housing and education programs.

Democrats are seeking: a prohibition of ICE detentions or deportations of American citizens; a ban on masks worn by ICE agents; a requirement to wear body cameras; explicit prohibitions on excessive use of force; prohibitions on raids of churches, mosques, synagogues and other places of worship, as well as hospitals and schools; and no absolute immunity from prosecution of agents violating codes of conduct.

Other Democrats have also urged improved training for agents and requiring court-issued warrants for immigration searches and detentions.

Democrats are also seeking to separate DHS spending from the larger package, to avoid disruption to other agencies. They have offered to agree to a temporary funding measure to provide more time for the two parties to find a compromise on additional ICE restrictions.

Republicans do not want to change the funding bill and are pushing to pass it in the Senate by the January 30 deadline.

Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee, said on Monday that the sprawling package already contains guardrails on ICE behavior.

For example, it provides $20 million for body-worn cameras, lays out protections for pregnant women in DHS custody, and prohibits the destruction of evidence involving the deaths of people in custody.

Immigration enforcement would likely be unaffected. During the last shutdown in October, DHS deemed 258,000 of its 272,000 employees "essential," which meant they stayed on the job after funding expired. While essential employees typically do not get paid during a shutdown, Trump's administration kept pay flowing for immigration agents and other federal law enforcement.

DHS has another stream of funding as well. Last year's "One Big Beautiful Bill," which was opposed by most Democrats, includes $75 billion in additional funding for ICE that allows it to significantly increase the size of its workforce and expand detention facilities, as DHS aims to meet Trump's goal of deporting 1 million people annually.

That money would be available even if Congress does not pass the DHS funding bill.

A large, widespread winter storm has hindered the ability of lawmakers to return to Washington to work on the spending legislation. Senators are expected back in town late on Tuesday, and Republicans and Democrats on Wednesday are scheduled to hold their separate policy lunches. That will be the next opportunity for the 53 Republican senators and 47 members of the Democratic caucus to try to chart their strategies in this battle.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:29:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZC6CDN3HLRN3XBG3KDFVEJLEEM.jpg?auth=618062f4fa2c7b421544bf31d8dd9f7c88a45be6838c5ac371f718a324fc23cc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>EU expected to approve new Iran sanctions in response to crackdown</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/eu-expected-approve-new-iran-sanctions-response-crackdown-2026-01-27/</link><description>BRUSSELS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The EU is expected to sanction some 20 Iranian individuals and entities under its human rights rules this week but is not expected to add Iran's Revolutionary Guards to its terrorist list due to opposition from France, officials said on Tuesday.

European Union foreign ministers will discuss the situation in Iran when they gather in Brussels on Thursday, and are expected to sign off on the new sanctions.

The new measures are expected to include export restrictions on components that Iran can use for the production of drones and missiles, bringing limitations into line with EU policy on Russia. Some Iranian individuals and entities will also be sanctioned for providing support to Russia, the officials said.

Set up after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces and was put in charge of Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.

While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU's terrorist list, others have been more cautious fearing that it could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran.

Iran's protests and the authorities' violent response , however, revived the debate ahead of the EU ministers' meeting this week.

Anti-government protests that swept across Iran since December have triggered the bloodiest crackdown by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, drawing international condemnation.

Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Monday that he will call for placing the IRGC on the EU's terrorist list, signaling a shift in Rome's position and leaving Paris as the one major holdout.

As a result, while some of the individuals expected to be sanctioned will include members of the IRGC, adding the group as a whole to the bloc's terrorist list looks unlikely for now as that would require unanimity.

"France has made it clear that they do not believe it would be useful to list the IRGC for now and want to keep communications open," said one European diplomat, adding that Paris was also worried it could harm efforts to bring back two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:29:18 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/NTMCCZNAENKJDBGADE6K32G6HM.jpg?auth=6b144f29c74d77026d1842ae23957c00f6582f0be3a455d45c149422f8204ffb&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Person critical after being shot in Border Patrol incident in Arizona, NBC News reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/person-critical-after-border-patrol-shooting-arizona-nbc-news-reports-2026-01-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The U.S. Border Patrol was involved in a shooting in Arizona on Tuesday, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said in a statement, adding that his office was working with the FBI and Customs and Border Protection to look into the incident.

NBC News earlier reported, citing a Pima County Sheriff spokeswoman, that a person was in critical condition after being shot in an incident involving the Border Patrol in the county that includes Tucson and is located along the U.S.-Mexico border.

The circumstances of the incident were not immediately clear. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The incident comes after the killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse shot multiple times by federal immigration agents on Saturday in Minnesota.

Coupled with the fatal shooting of Renee Good, also 37, earlier this month by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti's shooting has become a full-blown political crisis for President Donald Trump and sparked renewed anger over the aggressive tactics of the federal agents who have been roving the streets of Minneapolis for weeks.

Trump has pursued a hardline immigration agenda since taking office last year and has surged immigration agents into major U.S. cities, where they swept through neighborhoods and clashed with residents.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:29:26 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drone strike on passenger train in Kharkiv region kills three, prosecutors say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/russian-drone-strike-passenger-train-kharkiv-region-kills-three-prosecutors-say-2026-01-27/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A Russian drone strike killed three people and wounded two more aboard a passenger train in Ukraine's northeastern Kharkiv region, prosecutors said on Tuesday.

The prosecutors said two drones struck an area alongside the train and a third hit one of the train's wagons.

Deputy Prime Minister Oleksiy Kuleba had earlier described the attack by three drones as a "direct act of Russian terror."</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:29:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MHGNRWQG4FMO3PEXUQYYOUUCOE.jpg?auth=d3aa50fa176352784f95ab7c5f1ca8ff7f867b6de40a3b5b2ed7f92ce44b81cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel plans large camp for Palestinians in southern Gaza, retired general says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-plans-large-camp-palestinians-southern-gaza-retired-general-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>JERUSALEM, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Israel has cleared land in southern Gaza for the construction of a camp for Palestinians potentially equipped with surveillance and facial recognition technology at its entrance, a retired Israeli general who advises the military said on Tuesday.

Retired reservist Brigadier-General Amir Avivi told Reuters in an interview that the camp would be built in an area of Rafah cleared of tunnels built by Hamas, with entry and exit tracked by Israeli personnel.

Avivi is founder of the influential Israel Defense and Security Forum, a group representing thousands of Israeli military reservists. He does not speak on behalf of Israel's military, which declined to comment. The Israeli prime minister's office did not immediately provide comment on any plans to build a camp in Rafah.

Avivi said the camp would be used to house Palestinians who wish to leave Gaza and cross into Egypt as well as those who wish to stay.

His comments come as Israel prepares for a "limited reopening" of Gaza's Rafah border crossing with Egypt, a key requirement under U.S. President Donald Trump's plan to end the Gaza war.

Sources told Reuters this month that Israel wants to ensure more Palestinians leave Gaza than are allowed in. Israeli officials have spoken in the past about encouraging Gazans to emigrate, though they deny intending to transfer the population out by force - a highly sensitive issue for Palestinians.

"There are no Gazans, almost at all, in Rafah," Avivi said. The area fell under complete Israeli military control following an October Israel-Hamas ceasefire, and most Palestinians fled for areas held by Hamas.

"You need to build infrastructure in Rafah that can host them, and then they can choose if they want to go or not," Avivi said. He said the structure would likely be "a big, organized camp" capable of hosting hundreds of thousands of people that could enforce ID checks including facial recognition.

In July, Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz told Israeli media that he had ordered troops to prepare a camp in Rafah to house Gaza's population. Officials have not spoken publicly about such plans since then.

Ismail Al-Thawabta, head of the Hamas-run Gaza government media office, told Reuters in a statement that the idea amounted to cover for "forced displacement".

Palestinians in Gaza , shattered by two years of Israeli attacks in the enclave, have long faced restrictions on their movement and monitoring of their online activity and phone calls by Israeli surveillance agencies.

Nearly all of Gaza's 2 million people have been forced into a narrow coastal strip from which Israeli forces withdrew under the ceasefire and where Hamas has retained control.

Trump's plan for Gaza, now in its second phase , calls for Gaza's reconstruction to start in Rafah and for Hamas to lay down its arms in exchange for further Israeli troop withdrawals from the territory.

Avivi said Israel's military was preparing for a new offensive against Hamas if it refuses to give up its weapons. This could include relaunching attacks on Gaza City, the enclave's largest.

The camp in Gaza could be used to house Palestinians fleeing a renewed Israeli assault, Avivi said.

"Plans are set. The army is ready to get the command from the government, from the cabinet to renew its maneuvers in Gaza," Avivi said.

Israel's military says it has continued to carry out operations in Gaza since the ceasefire to thwart what it describes as planned attacks by militants and destroy Hamas' tunnel network under Gaza.

Israeli attacks since the ceasefire have killed more than 480 Palestinians in Gaza, health authorities there say, while the military says four soldiers have been killed in militant attacks.

Avi Dichter, a minister in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet and former head of Israel's domestic intelligence service, said disputes over disarmament could lead Israel back into war in Gaza.

"We have to get prepared for the war in Gaza," Dichter told Reuters, adding that the disarmament issue "will have to be solved by Israeli troops, the hard way."

Hamas has publicly refused to lay down its weapons. Two Hamas officials told Reuters this week that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

According to a document shared by the White House last week, the Trump administration wants to see heavy weapons decommissioned immediately, with "personal arms registered and decommissioned by sector" as the police under an interim technocratic administration in Gaza "become capable of guaranteeing personal security".

Trump has repeatedly warned Hamas that it would have "hell to pay" if it does not lay down its weapons.

A U.S. official said on Tuesday that disarmament could come along with some sort of amnesty for Hamas members.

Speaking to Israel's parliament on Monday night, Netanyahu said the next phase of the ceasefire would not include reconstruction of Gaza.

"The next phase is demilitarization of the Strip and disarming Hamas," Netanyahu said.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:49:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/74456BJTOJNB3CSYVWT4HHFDEE.jpg?auth=121c22dff096495c25fb9110b53f6e314b5b4d01387651906dfde9d9bfabede9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French government survives no-confidence votes on expenditure part of 2026 budget</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/french-government-survives-no-confidence-votes-expenditure-part-2026-budget-2026-01-27/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - The French government survived two votes of no-confidence in parliament on Tuesday over its decision to ram through the expenditure part of the 2026 budget without giving the National Assembly the final say.

A total of 267 lawmakers voted in favour of the no-confidence motion presented by the hard-left France Unbowed together with the Greens and Communists, whereas 289 votes were required to bring down the government. Only 140 lawmakers backed a second no-confidence motion, brought by the far right.

Last week the government also survived two no-confidence motions on the spending part of the bill.

The full 2026 budget bill now goes to the Senate upper house and will then have to go back to the lower house again.

Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu is then expected to again invoke article 49.3 in the Constitution to force through the full budget for 2026, which will likely trigger further votes of no confidence.

President Emmanuel Macron's government is having to circumvent parliament after months of negotiations failed to deliver a deficit-taming finance bill that would pass in a lower house where no party has a working majority.

Lecornu says the budget deficit will not exceed 5% of national output, less than the 5.4% deficit seen in 2025 but still well above the European Union's 3% cap.

The government expects the entire budget to be definitively adopted in the first half of February.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 19:49:35 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ALVWBWLUNZNN7KMZ5IHD6MOGBQ.jpg?auth=f9a035a92d95974a7f183c1a2e7ec3cd17d24a02bd510b930a29c42c53734f90&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French PM Lecornu survives no-confidence votes as budget moves forward</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260127-french-pm-lecornu-survives-no-confidence-votes-as-budget-moves-forward</link><description>The French ‍government on Tuesday survived two ​votes of no-confidence in parliament over its decision ⁠to ram through the expenditure part of the 2026 budget without giving the National Assembly, France's lower house, the final say.

​Only 140 lawmakers backed a second no-confidence motion, brought by the far right National Rally party.

The motions came days after Prime Minister Sébastien Lecornu weathered two separate, largely symbolic no-confidence challenges on Friday, triggered by his decision to ram through the income section of the 2026 state budget without a parliamentary vote.

He then announced he would do the same with the expense part of the budget, prompting the hard left to file another no-confidence motion.

The National Assembly on Tuesday rejected that motion, along with a separate one tabled by the far right.

Lecornu on Tuesday defended his decision, touting what he called a "breakthrough" budget that would boost defence spending by €6.5 billion ($7.78 billion) and urging a "long-term" view.

The bill must now be reviewed by the upper house before returning to the lower house National Assembly for final adoption.

He will have to use the same constitutional power to force the whole bill into law, which will expose him to more no-confidence votes.

The decision to use the constitutional tool known as Article 49.3 marked an about-face for Lecornu, who pledged last year to seek parliament's approval, in a bid to avoid the fate of his two predecessors who were ousted over budget negotiations.

Trump officials quickly painted the two recently shot dead - Renee Good and Alex Pretti - as aggressors and said the shootings were justified. But video and other evidence soon emerged that contrasted sharply with these accounts, fueling questions about the credibility of federal officials and doubts about their willingness to fully investigate these and other incidents.

The Reuters review included these two incidents and four others in recent months that, collectively, show a pattern in which officials rushed to defend immigration officers without waiting for key facts to emerge – in what former immigration officials called a clear break with past practice for federal agencies in such situations.

These initial representations have been challenged by video footage or other evidence, sometimes in court. In one non-lethal shooting in Minnesota, court documents emerged showing the incident began with a case of mistaken identity. A death in a detention center that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security described as an attempted suicide was later ruled a homicide by a county medical examiner.

"They are trying to control a narrative from the very start, and they don't seem to care when they're proven wrong," said David Lapan, who was the DHS press secretary in 2017, during Trump's first administration.

In response to a Reuters request for comment, DHS pointed to previous statements about the incidents involving their officers, stressing the need for officer safety as they carry out Trump's crackdown.

"We have seen a highly coordinated campaign of violence against our law enforcement," DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said, adding that the department aims to "give swift, accurate information to the American people."

Here is a look at six incidents in Minneapolis, Chicago and Texas:

After Pretti, 37, was shot and killed during an encounter with U.S. Border Patrol agents in Minneapolis on Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security issued a statement noting that Pretti was carrying a firearm but did not say that it remained holstered. The statement said the encounter “looks like a situation where an individual wanted to do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”

DHS said Pretti “approached US Border Patrol officers with a 9 mm semi-automatic handgun” in a post on the social network X, sharing a photo of the alleged weapon.

“The officers attempted to disarm the suspect but the armed suspect violently resisted,” DHS said.

White House aide Stephen Miller, the architect of Trump’s immigration agenda, said on X that Pretti was a “domestic terrorist” and “would-be assassin.”

Video of the encounter verified by Reuters showed Pretti holding a cell phone and not a gun as he was wrestled to the ground by the agents. Video evidence also showed that an officer removed Pretti’s gun from his body shortly before the first shots were fired. He had a legal permit to carry the weapon.

In response to a Reuters request for comment on Monday, DHS said in a statement that Pretti “committed a federal crime while armed as he obstructed an active law enforcement operation” and that the situation was “evolving.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a briefing on Monday that Trump "wants to let the investigation continue and let the facts lead."

Homeland Security described Good, the 37-year-old woman shot by an ICE officer in Minneapolis on January 7, as a “violent rioter” who had “weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them - an act of domestic terrorism.” It said the officer who killed her “saved his own life and that of his fellow officers.”

Trump said Good “ran over the ICE officer,” who he said shot her in self-defense.

Videos of the shooting taken from several vantage points – including cell phone video recorded by the officer who shot Good – conflicted with those claims .

The videos show Good in her car as agents rushed up toward her as her vehicle partly blocked the street. One of the agents, Jonathan Ross, positioned himself near the front of her car; another was standing by the driver-side window. The videos show the car moving forward, its wheels turned away from Ross, who drew his weapon and fired three shots at Good as her car went past, killing her.

Video reviewed by Reuters appeared to show Ross and the vehicle making contact, but Reuters could not determine whether Ross touched the vehicle or if it struck him.

On January 15, DHS said officers “were conducting a targeted traffic stop” in Minneapolis for Venezuelan immigrant Julio Sosa-Celis when he sped away, crashed his car and fled on foot to an apartment building.

DHS said at the time that Sosa-Celis and two other men hit an ICE officer who pursued him with a snow shovel and broom handle, prompting the shooting.

Court documents unsealed last week , opens new tab told a different story.

An FBI affidavit said the ICE officers had scanned a license plate registered with a different person suspected of an immigration violation, leading them to chase the wrong person before the alleged assault and shooting.

The affidavit said another man was driving the car and was the sole occupant - not Sosa-Celis. The car's actual driver - another Venezuelan immigrant - crashed and fled to an apartment building where Sosa-Celis was present, it said.

At the apartment building, an ICE officer trying to detain the car's driver was struck by him and Sosa-Celis with a broom – and a third man with a shovel – before the officer fired his weapon, the FBI affidavit said.

While DHS said initially that the officer “fired a defensive shot to defend his life” during the ambush, the FBI affidavit said the alleged attackers dropped the broom and shovel when they saw the officer draw his gun and were fleeing toward the apartment as he fired.

Robin Wolpert, an attorney representing Sosa-Celis, said he would plead not guilty if indicted.

Wolpert said the affidavit established that the ICE officer shot Sosa-Celis from 10 feet away as he was fleeing, which showed the officer "was not in immediate danger."

DHS did not address the FBI affidavit with the different account of the incident when asked for comment.

When U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced the death of Cuban immigrant Geraldo Lunas Campos in a Texas detention center on January 3, it said he experienced “medical distress” and that the incident was being investigated.

A January 15 report , opens new tab in the Washington Post said the El Paso County medical examiner’s office was likely to rule it a homicide, with the preliminary cause of death “asphyxia due to neck and chest compression.” The Post cited a witness who said guards were choking Lunas, who said he could not breathe, details that were absent from ICE’s statement.

DHS issued a new statement after the article was published that said Lunas tried to commit suicide and then resisted security officers and died.

The medical examiner released a report last week that found the death was a homicide due to asphyxia from neck and torso compression, according to the Post.

The death was one of six deaths in ICE detention in January, an unusually high number.

A federal judge wrote in a November opinion restricting immigration agents' use of force in Chicago that the government’s “widespread misrepresentations call into question everything that defendants say they are doing in their characterization” of the crackdown.

In one instance, Homeland Security posted on X that “rioters surrounded law enforcement” and “attacked” a van carrying detainees, an encounter that escalated until someone threw a rock at Border Patrol commander-at-large Gregory Bovino, hitting him in the head. Five days later, Bovino said in court that the rock had not hit him when he first deployed tear gas.

“It did almost hit me,” he said.

U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis said Bovino “lied multiple times” about why he needed to throw a tear gas canister at protesters.

Neither DHS nor Bovino responded to requests for comment about the incident and the comments by Ellis.

In the same case, Ellis also questioned authorities’ claims that they needed to use tear gas so that they could leave the scene of another operation in October, saying the agents themselves had prolonged the encounter through their actions.

“Every minor inconsistency adds up, and at some point, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to believe almost anything” the government said, Ellis wrote.

Homeland Security said in a statement after the ruling that officers were facing “rioters, gangbangers and terrorists” and that they had shown “incredible restraint in exhausting all options before force is escalated.”

GOVERNMENT DROPS CASE AGAINST U.S. CITIZEN SHOT BY BORDER AGENT

On October 4, Homeland Security said that several drivers “rammed” law enforcement officers in Broadview, a Chicago suburb where an immigration detention center has been the site of clashes between protesters and immigration agents.

DHS said one of the drivers, a woman, was “armed with a semi-automatic weapon” and that law enforcement was “forced to deploy their weapons and fired defensive shots at an armed U.S. citizen.”

The woman, U.S. citizen Marimar Martinez, was shot by an agent five times. She survived and was indicted on charges of impeding a federal officer with a deadly weapon.

The officer later boasted of his marksmanship in text messages shared in court.

Martinez's lawyer, Christopher Parente, told the court that footage from one of the agents' bodycams contradicted the DHS account. Martinez, 30, said that one of the agents actually rammed her vehicle with his.

Parente told Reuters Martinez left her gun in her purse on the passenger seat and never brandished it. DHS was wrong about the location of the incident – it occurred in the Chicago neighborhood of Brighton Park, not Broadview.

The storm started to develop on Friday and dumped snow across a large region over the weekend. The snow snarled road traffic and led to widespread flight cancellations and power outages before subsiding Monday, leaving behind bitter cold that is expected to linger.

By Tuesday, cities were mobilizing emergency responders and resources to ensure that residents, particularly homeless people, were safe, even as more than 550,000 homes and businesses across the country lacked electricity .

Ten of the storm's fatal victims were in New York City, where temperatures were the coldest they had been in eight years, Mayor Zohran Mamdani said at a news conference on Tuesday, when the low hit 8 degrees Fahrenheit.

While the 10 victims were found outside, it was not clear whether they were homeless. Mamdani told reporters Monday that some of the dead "had had interactions with our shelter system in the past. It is still too early to share a broader diagnosis or a cause of death."

New York City postponed from this week until early February an annual count of its homeless population required by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development

"Outreach workers should be focused on bringing New Yorkers inside, not on data collection," Mamdani said. "Here is the bottom line, New York City: Extreme weather is not a personal failure."

Around 500 of the more than 4,000 homeless people estimated to live in the city's streets and subway have been placed in shelters since January 19, Mamdani said. Outreach workers were checking every two hours on 350 homeless people who are at particular risk due to underlying medical conditions.

In Nashville, Tennessee, a city of about 680,000 where more than 135,000 homes and businesses remain without power, the temperature is expected to drop to 6 degrees Fahrenheit by Wednesday morning with below-zero wind chills.

"Let's be clear about what this is," Nashville Mayor Freddie O'Connell said at a Tuesday press conference. "It is an historic ice storm."

Nashville officials said about 1,400 homeless people had filled all three of the city's homeless shelters and two overflow shelters, with police and firefighters working overtime and emergency workers checking the streets.

The Nashville Rescue Mission, a homeless charity that feeds, clothes and offers shelter year-round, typically might have about 400 people a night, but in the cold snap that number has swollen to about 7,000.

"We're always full, but we never turn anyone away," an attendant who was not authorized to speak to reporters so did not give a name told Reuters by telephone. "When the weather is bad, people come in out of the cold."

Across the country, storm-related causes of death ranged from hypothermia and exposure to cardiac incidents while clearing snow.

In Bonham, Texas, about 55 miles northeast of Dallas, three young boys died after falling in an ice pond over the weekend, though the exact circumstances were unclear, according to the local fire department.

Several hours away in Austin, Texas, a person died of apparent hypothermia while trying to shelter at an abandoned gas station, authorities said. Other hypothermia deaths were reported from Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee and Michigan, local media reported.

Almost 200 million Americans remain under some form of winter cold warning at least through February 1.

Forecasters are watching for another possible winter storm to impact the eastern U.S. this weekend, said David Roth, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:19:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/KEJ2DPLQXVP6HBN2VTUY3KR25Q.jpg?auth=8ddeea3a49df239d29d430007ac1d07cadd6b976e2f876b1b98b6d718769f1ad&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says 'Cuba will be failing pretty soon'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-cuba-will-be-failing-pretty-soon-2026-01-27/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday "Cuba will be failing pretty soon," adding that Venezuela , once the island's top supplier, has not recently sent oil or money to Cuba .</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:20:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QNPVODQV6FOCBDJIC4M5DDUMIQ.jpg?auth=a68c574de27116967628ee687541e24ef0eee52f8d91701de9733d5f886b3ea2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>'Doomsday Clock' moves closer than ever to midnight, a year into Trump's term</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-doomsday-clock-moves-closer-than-ever-to-midnight-a-year-into-trump-s-term</link><description>The "Doomsday Clock" representing how near humanity is to catastrophe on Tuesday moved closer than ever to midnight as concerns mount on nuclear weapons , climate change and disinformation.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which set up the metaphorical clock at the start of the Cold War , moved its time to 85 seconds to midnight – four seconds closer than a year ago.

The announcement comes a year into President Donald Trump 's second term, in which he has shattered norms – ordering unilateral attacks abroad, deploying force at home in defiance of local authorities and withdrawing from a slew of international organisations.

Russia, China, the United States and other major countries have "become increasingly aggressive, adversarial and nationalistic", said a statement announcing the clock shift, determined after consultations with a board that includes eight Nobel laureates.

"Hard-won global understandings are collapsing, accelerating a winner-takes-all great power competition and undermining the international cooperation critical to reducing the risks of nuclear war, climate change, the misuse of biotechnology, the potential threat of artificial intelligence and other apocalyptic dangers."

The Doomsday Clock board warned of heightened risks of a nuclear arms race, with the New START nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and Russia set to expire next week.

"For the first time in over half a century, there will be nothing preventing a runaway nuclear arms race," Daniel Holz, a University of Chicago physicist who chairs the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, told a virtual news conference.

Trump has threatened to resume nuclear testing and is pushing a costly "Golden Dome" missile defence system that would further militarise space.

The board members also voiced alarm over Trump's crackdown in Minnesota, where he has deployed a phalanx of masked, armed anti-immigration agents who have aggressively repressed protesters and shot dead two people.

"History has shown that when governments become unaccountable to their own citizens, conflict and misery follow," Holz said.

The board also noted record emission levels of carbon dioxide, the key driver of the planet's warming temperatures, as Trump sharply reverses US policy on fighting climate change and a number of other countries have backtracked in turn.

Underpinning the threats, board members warned of a dangerous fracturing of global trust.

"We are living through an information Armageddon – the crisis beneath all crises – driven by extractive and predatory technology that spreads lies faster than facts and profits from our division," said Maria Ressa , the Filipina investigative journalist and Nobel Peace Prize winner who faced intense pressure from iron-fisted former Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte , now awaiting trial at the International Criminal Court.

Ressa pointed to Trump's use of force in Minnesota and threats to seize Greenland as examples of losing "the battle for information integrity" with memes turning into reality.

"The men who control the platforms that shape what billions believe have merged with the men who control governments and militaries," she said.

The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, founded by Albert Einstein, Robert Oppenheimer and other nuclear scientists at the University of Chicago, initially placed the clock at seven minutes to midnight in 1947.

It was moved closer last year but by only one second, amid guarded hopes on newly reinaugurated Trump's promises to pursue peace and cooperation.

"The problem is that rhetoric has not matched actions at all," said Alexandra Bell, president and CEO of the Bulletin.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:22:47 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/6bd48a44-74cb-11f0-956c-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/e0e11439ebae56a9cb7969dbcb3b4892be931faf.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Dutch politicians reach agreement on rare minority government, NOS reports</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/dutch-politicians-reach-agreement-rare-minority-government-nos-reports-2026-01-27/</link><description>AMSTERDAM, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Leaders of political parties in the Netherlands have agreed to form a rare minority government, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported on Tuesday citing sources close to the parties.

"I'm hearing that the Great Country of Iraq might make a very bad choice by reinstalling Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister," Trump wrote on Truth Social.

"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos. That should not be allowed to happen again. Because of his insane policies and ideologies, if elected, the United States of America will no longer help Iraq," Trump wrote.

He added that the country, without U.S. help, would have "zero" chance of success.

Trump's comments are the starkest example yet of the Republican president's campaign to curb Iran-linked groups' influence in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

Reuters was not able to immediately reach Maliki for comment.

His warning comes days after the alliance of Shi'ite political blocs that hold a majority in Iraq's parliament picked Maliki, who previously served two terms as the country's prime minister, for the post.

As part of Trump's pressure campaign, Washington has also threatened senior Iraqi politicians with U.S. sanctions targeting the Iraqi state should armed groups backed by Iran be included in the next government, Reuters reported last week.

Maliki is a senior figure in the Shi'ite Islamist Dawa Party. His tenure as Iraq's prime minister from 2006 to 2014 was a period marked by sectarian violence, a power struggle with Sunni and Kurdish rivals, and growing tensions with the U.S.

He stepped down after Islamic State seized large parts of the country in 2014 but has remained an influential political player, leading the State of Law coalition and maintaining close ties with Iran-backed factions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:46:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TUXWTCCMYVJRVF5ALDR7PHQBDM.jpg?auth=8c94d741fbb0124e7a4cf674379823d6481cb17e0c378d2f564a0f28dfa4f781&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘We are just not stopping’: How Minnesotans turned the tables on ICE</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260127-we-are-just-not-stopping-how-minnesotans-turned-the-tables-on-ice</link><description>On the streets of the Twin Cities, Minnesotans have turned the surveillance state inside out. As thousands of masked, armed and armoured Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents continue to seize and detain people accused of lacking the legal status to live and work in the US, they find themselves followed and filmed at every turn by thousands of volunteers monitoring their every move.

Bound by the hope that the weight of public scrutiny will keep their neighbours safe from harm, these observers have taken to the streets to record and document the massive ICE deployment dubbed “Operation Metro Surge”, a weeks-long action that has sent some 3,000 federal agents to the North Star state.

Since December, these officers have arrested around 3,400 people through traffic stops as well as militarised raids on homes and workplaces . Many of those taken have been sent to an overcrowded detention centre on the other side of the country in Texas.

By holding these faceless agents fixed in a smartphone’s unflinching eye, many of those mobilising on the streets of Minneapolis and Saint Paul hope to one day hold their agencies accountable for their actions.

Watch more Above the law? Outrage over ICE killings in Minneapolis

These observers are only the most visible sign of a surge in non-violent resistance to ICE’s operations that has brought community and faith-based organisations, trade unions and centres for immigrant workers together in response to the raids.

As workers stay home for fear of being stopped by ICE during their commute and schools switch to remote learning as parents pull their children from class, many of these groups have set up mutual aid networks to deliver groceries and supplies straight to their doors.

Chelsie Glaubitz Gabiou, the president of the Minneapolis Regional Labor Federation that brings together unions representing some 80,000 workers, said that Minnesotans’ readiness to turn out in force has its roots in the widespread demonstrations that followed the 2020 police killing of an unarmed black man, George Floyd .

“This isn't the first time Minneapolis has had to respond in a powerful way under the watchful eye of the entire nation,” she said. “We're coming up on six years now, almost, of the murder of George Floyd in our communities, and we were just getting back to vibrancy and feeling like we had rebuilt from that crisis."

Glaubitz Gabiou said the aftermath of Floyd's murder laid the groundwork for how Minnesota residents would organise in the future.

In the years since, "our community groups, our unions have never ceased to continue to try to work together and create inflection points", she explained. "So we have a high level of trust. We don't all agree on everything that we're working on together here, but we know we cannot be fractured – and that we have to do this together.”

Somewhere between 50,000 and 100,000 people took part on Friday in what some organisers – though not the unions, many of whom have “no-strike” clauses in their collective bargaining agreements – dubbed a general strike following the fatal shooting of poet and mother Renee Good. Some 700 hundred businesses also closed their doors for the day of action.

ICE agent Jonathan Ross shot Good three times as she drove away from a traffic stop – a shooting that quickly spread across social media, filmed from several different angles.

As the ICE operation drags on, unions and community organisations continue to organise regular trainings on nonviolent direct action , as well as “constitutional observer” trainings that encourage participants to document law enforcement interactions – without, the trainers stress, obstructing or escalating the situation.

Glaubitz Gabiou said that the urgency of recording what was happening on the streets was hammered home during the starkly partisan coverage of the protests that followed Floyd’s killing.

“There have been a lot of untruths, even going back to George Floyd and a lot of things that have happened in our community without the cameras rolling,” she said. “And so now that the cameras are rolling … this is about people telling the truth. People are making up lies … they're trying to make you not believe what you’re seeing with your own eyes – and it cost a life. But we need to tell people, ‘Believe what you are seeing. This is what is happening.’ And that person should still be here with us today.”

That person, of course, is Alex Pretti . Pretti, a registered intensive care nurse at the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs hospital and a member of the American Federation of Government Employees union, was shot dead by a federal Border Patrol officer on Saturday while filming ICE agents with his phone.

After standing between a woman and the agent that pushed her down, Pretti was dragged to the ground, disarmed of the handgun he was legally entitled to carry and shot 10 times .

“Our union members and our workers are a part of this amazing, beautiful constitutional observer network that is out filming what is happening in our communities – and it got one of our union members killed on Saturday,” Glaubitz Gabiou said.

In the wake of Pretti’s killing, senior figures within the Trump administration insisted the agents had been acting in self-defence . Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, a staunch advocate for militarised mass deportations , both accused Pretti of being a “ domestic terrorist ” without offering any evidence to support their claims.

Then commander-at-large for the US Border Patrol, Gregory Bovino, accused Petti of attempting to “ massacre ” the ICE agents. As more and more footage of the shooting made its way onto social media, these claims quickly fell apart. Bovino was later transferred from Minneapolis.

Stephanie Schwartz, assistant professor of international relations at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said that on-the-ground efforts to record ICE’s often brutal encounters with the public might not necessarily find the audience they needed.

“I think we need to be mindful of what we see, what is algorithmically put on my feed and other’s feeds, and how we already know  – and there's been reporting – on how some of those images have been altered.

Not only are today's algorithms highly personalised, she notes, but fake images made with AI are more prevalent than ever.

"So we don't necessarily know what different audiences are seeing,” she said.

“There is an effort from folks on the ground in Minnesota – and this is so exceptionally important – to provide that kind of ... truth of images and description of what is actually happening, contrary to some of the distorted images that have been circulated, including by government accounts.”

The footage of federal immigration agents shooting two people dead seems to have fuelled more significant opposition to Trump’s agenda. Senate Democrats have said they will not vote for a spending bill this week that would further fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees both ICE and CBP.

Blocking the package would lead to a partial government shutdown – although both agencies would likely continue operating , with last year’s "One Big Beautiful Act" having already allocated $170 billion over four years for immigration enforcement.

Schwartz said that despite the deepening public backlash to Trump’s high-profile campaign of mass deportations, the administration's continued efforts to swell the ranks and budget of ICE was not just about cracking down on undocumented migrants.

“The question of whether that spectacle is backfiring for the administration – I don't think so,” she said. “I think that if we take a step back and look at what the goals are here, it’s to consolidate executive power. And they've consolidated executive power in a number of other ways that are unrelated to immigration. But what immigration does through organisations or arms of the federal government, like Customs and Border Protection and ICE, is give them coercive power and the threat of the use of force.”

She cited a letter from Attorney General Pam Bondi to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz , urging him to allow the Department of Justice access to the state’s voter rolls in return for putting an end to ICE’s crackdown. Critics say voter data could be used to cast doubt on future election results or disenfranchise certain voters.

While resisting at the grassroots level is important, Schwartz said, more action is needed among the political class.

“What we need is leadership to attenuate the broader structure of how the executive is using ICE and immigration enforcement to consolidate power,” Schwartz said. “So, for example, that starts with funding for ICE and an evaluation of ICE’s mission. I wouldn't say that [the public response in Minnesota] is not an important counterweight – it’s an absolute necessity. But it is not sufficient with these broader patterns in mind.”

In the Twin Cities, the struggle continues. Glaubitz Gabiou said that Pretti’s killing had only galvanised a public already set on holding ICE to account for a crackdown that has now claimed the lives of at least two Minnesotans.

“It's having the opposite of a chilling effect,” she said. “After the murder of Renee Good, the desire for our non-violent direct-action trainings and our constitutional observer trainings went through the roof. We are training thousands of people across this community every day, and as quickly as we can get the trainings up and staffed and posted, they are filling up."

The momentum is on the side of the protesters, she said.

“I think this is why you're starting to see some of the cracks in the administration now – because we just are not stopping.”</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 21:47:25 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/38b74538-fbb8-11f0-843d-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26025054091259.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>North Korea's Kim: party congress to unveil plans for nuclear-war deterrent, KCNA says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/north-koreas-kim-party-congress-unveil-plans-nuclear-war-deterrent-kcna-says-2026-01-27/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said the upcoming congress of the ruling Workers' Party will unveil next-stage plans for further strengthening the country's nuclear war deterrent, KCNA state news agency reported on Wednesday.

Kim directed a successful test of a large-caliber multiple-rocket launch system on Tuesday, KCNA said. The drill demonstrated significant upgrades to the weapon's strike power, mobility and accuracy, it quoted him as saying.

It is an important policy of the ruling Workers' Party to build a reliable offensive capability and deterrence strategy to thwart an enemy attempt to spark an armed conflict, he said.

"This test will be a source of excruciating mental agony and serious threat to the forces that attempt to provoke a military confrontation with us," Kim said.

South Korea and Japan on Tuesday condemned the launch of possible short-range ballistic missiles by the North towards the sea off its east coast. North Korea has defied a United Nations ban against it on ballistic missile development.

Kim did not elaborate on his comment about the upcoming congress of the ruling party, which is expected to take place some time in the next several weeks.

Arce, who was also one of the nine Sandinista commanders that governed the Central American nation in the 1980s, was found guilty alongside his personal assistant, Ricardo Bonilla. Arce's wife and her brother, who are both in exile, were named as co-conspirators in the scheme.

Arce has been imprisoned for six months, after he was detained in July . The ruling against him comes three days after his family from exile told newspaper El Pais that he had been arrested without a warrant, held incommunicado and subjected to mistreatment, and now fear for his life due to his age and serious health conditions.

According to the family, Arce was not formally charged or brought before a judge. Nicaragua's government has not said when or if Arce faced a trial, and on Tuesday did not provide a sentence.

Judges said the defendants ran a long-running $2.71 billion money-laundering scheme that involved tax fraud and used shell companies, bank accounts and financial transactions to hide the origin and destination of funds.

Arce had been the last of the Sandinista commanders to back Ortega, who has increasingly been cracking down on dissidents and isolating the country from global diplomacy.

Relatives told El Pais that Arce is a political prisoner caught in an internal purge led by Ortega's wife Rosario Murillo against figures seen as obstacles to a family succession of power. Murillo now holds the role of co-president alongside Ortega.

Murillo, who also serves as the government's spokesperson, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:25:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>French ex-senator found guilty of spiking MP's drink to sexually assault her</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/france/20260127-french-ex-senator-found-guilty-of-spiking-mp-s-drink-to-sexually-assault-her</link><description>A French court Tuesday found a former senator guilty of drugging a woman lawmaker with ecstasy with intent to sexually assault her, and sentenced him to four years in prison, of which 18 months must be behind bars.

The high-profile trial of former senator Joel Guerriau comes months after France was stunned by a case that saw Frenchman Dominique Pelicot jailed for 20 years for repeatedly drugging his then-wife so he and dozens of strangers could rape her.

Guerriau, 68, has been on trial since Monday for allegedly using a synthetic drug known as MDMA or ecstasy to spike a glass of champagne that National Assembly MP Sandrine Josso was drinking in November 2023.

Josso said shortly after late Tuesday's verdict that it was a "huge relief". Guerriau's lawyers said he would appeal.

French prosecutors had sought a four-year prison sentence for the former senator, who described the drugging of his friend of 10 years as an accident and called himself an "idiot".

Guerriau, who has denied any sexual motivation against Josso, resigned from the upper house in October. He was expelled from the centre-right Horizons party soon after.

On Monday, a visibly distressed Josso, 50, said she thought she would die after going to see Guerriau at his apartment in the French capital's chic 6th district.

She told the Paris court that she had gone to see Guerriau "with a light heart to celebrate his re-election. As the evening went on, I discovered an attacker".

She was the only guest at his Paris home that evening, and after he poured her a glass in the kitchen, she noted it tasted sweet and sticky.

"I thought maybe it was a bad champagne. Then he insisted that we toast again. I found that odd," she said in court.

Josso described soon feeling unwell with a racing heart rate, and she left hurriedly before going to hospital.

A toxicology report revealed a high dose of the drug in her blood and ecstasy was also found at Guerriau's flat.

Her lawyer, Arnaud Godefroy, said the lawmaker has struggled with the consequences of what had happened to her.

"Six months off work, physical treatment, psychological and psychiatric follow-up, nightmares, flashbacks, dissociation," said Godefroy.

Josso said she had to have four teeth removed because of the stress that caused her to grind her teeth.

Guerriau said he had poured the powdered ecstasy into a glass the day prior to their celebration to help calm a panic attack, but then decided against taking it, placing the glass back in the cupboard.

"In short, I am an idiot," he concluded.

Earlier Tuesday, prosecutor Benjamin Coulon argued that Guerriau "deliberately placed" MDMA in Josso's champagne and requested a five-year ban from public office.

He also demanded that the former senator be placed on the sex offenders' register, in addition to the jail term.

Guerriau, who served as a senator from 2011 to 2025, had voted for the law creating the offence of administering a harmful substance with intent to commit rape or sexual assault , Coulon said.

The prosecutor stressed that, as an elected official, Guerriau was duty-bound to "set an example".

But he also said that Guerriau had no criminal record and had "devoted part of his life to the functioning of French democracy".

The centrist politician "did not act on his intentions, it is true, no gestures were made towards Ms Josso, but he did administer drugs to her with the aim of raping her", argued Coulon.

If he drugged her, he said ironically, was it "to steal her wallet?"

One of the politician's lawyers, Henri Carpentier, said that as soon as the case came to light, "the emotion was unanimous, the disgust legitimate".

"Emotion is a bad adviser, it erases all nuance," he warned.

France last year adopted the principle of consent into the definition of the crime of rape, following other European countries like the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 22:28:20 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7c975106-fad9-11f0-8ad3-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26026473862799.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Netanyahu vows to disarm Hamas, demilitarise Gaza after last hostage returned</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20260127-netanyahu-vows-to-disarm-hamas-demilitarise-gaza</link><description>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday that Israel would shift its focus to disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza following the return of the last hostage from the Palestinian territory.

He added that no reconstruction work would take place in Gaza until those two objectives were achieved.

Netanyahu also vowed to block the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza, insisting Israel would maintain security control over both the territory and the occupied West Bank, despite widening international recognition of Palestinian statehood.

The US-sponsored Gaza ceasefire plan, in effect since October 10, stipulated the return of all hostages held in the territory under its first phase, and Hamas’s disarmament under the second.

“Now we are focused on completing the two remaining tasks: disarming Hamas and demilitarising Gaza of weapons and tunnels,” Netanyahu said during a televised press conference.

“It will be done the easy way or it will be done the hard way. But in any case it will happen.

“I’m hearing even now claims that Gaza’s reconstruction will be allowed before demilitarisation – this will not happen,” he said.

Militants took 251 hostages during the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that sparked the Gaza war . Israeli forces on Monday brought home the remains of the last captive, Ran Gvili.

Though Hamas said the return of Gvili’s body showed its commitment to the ceasefire deal, it has so far not surrendered its weapons.

The group has repeatedly said disarmament is a red line, but has also suggested it would be open to handing over its weapons to a Palestinian governing authority.

In his remarks on Tuesday, Netanyahu said the establishment of a Palestinian state in Gaza “hasn’t happened and it will not happen”, claiming credit for having “repeatedly blocked” the implementation of a two-state paradigm.

The war in Gaza, which has left much of the territory in ruins, has accelerated international calls for Palestinian statehood, with several Western countries last year formally recognising a Palestinian state.

But Netanyahu insisted Israel would continue to “exercise security control from the Jordan River to the sea, and that applies to the Gaza Strip as well”.

The premier also alluded to recent remarks by US President Donald Trump on Iran, which he has previously threatened to attack over its deadly crackdown on anti-government protests.

The United States has deployed an aircraft carrier strike group to the region, prompting warnings from Iran that it would not hesitate to defend itself.

“President Trump will decide what he decides; the State of Israel will decide what it decides,” Netanyahu said.

But, he added, “if Iran makes the grave mistake of attacking Israel, we will respond with a force that Iran has never seen”.

Trump told the Axios news site on Monday that the United States had “a big armada next to Iran”, but said he believed talks were still an option.

“They want to make a deal. I know so. They called on numerous occasions,” he said.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian criticised US “threats” in a call with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on Tuesday, saying they were “aimed at disrupting the security of the region”.

Israel fought a 12-day war with Iran last June, striking military targets across the country and killing a number of the Islamic republic’s senior military leaders and nuclear scientists.

Iran responded with ballistic missile attacks targeting Israeli cities.

The United States briefly joined the conflict with strikes on key nuclear facilities before declaring a ceasefire.</description><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jan 2026 23:25:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1c0f4b12-fbcf-11f0-bacf-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25363751835660.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US intelligence raises doubts about Venezuela leader's cooperation</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/us-intelligence-raises-doubts-about-venezuela-leaders-cooperation-2026-01-28/</link><description>NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.S. intelligence reports have raised doubts about whether interim Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez will cooperate with the Trump administration by formally cutting ties with U.S. adversaries, four people familiar with the reports said in recent days.

U.S. officials have said publicly they want the interim president to sever relations with close international allies like Iran, China and Russia, including expelling their diplomats and advisers from Venezuela.

But Rodriguez, whose swearing-in ceremony was attended by representatives of those countries early this month, has yet to publicly announce such a move. She became president after the U.S. captured former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on January 3.

The U.S. intelligence reports said it was not clear if she is fully on board with the U.S. strategy in her country, according to the sources, who declined to be identified by name.

CIA Director John Ratcliffe traveled on January 15 to Caracas, where he discussed the country's political future with Rodriguez. Reuters could not determine if those conversations changed the intelligence agencies' opinion.

Washington wants to rein in its foes' influence in the Western hemisphere, including in Venezuela, where Trump seeks to exploit the OPEC nation’s vast oil reserves.

If Rodriguez were to break ties with the U.S. rivals, it would open more opportunity for U.S. investment in Venezuela’s energy sector. But failure to control Rodriguez could undercut Washington’s efforts to direct the country’s interim rulers from afar and avoid a deeper U.S. military role.

The Central Intelligence Agency and the Venezuela government did not respond to requests for comment.

Asked for comment, a senior Trump administration official, who declined to be identified, said U.S. President Donald Trump "continues to exert maximum leverage" over Venezuela's leaders and "expects this cooperation to continue."

The CIA has previously assessed that officials loyal to Maduro, including Rodriguez, were best positioned to govern the country following his ouster.

But critics of Trump's Venezuela strategy have expressed doubts about the wisdom of keeping Maduro's loyalists in place as the country's interim leaders. The concerns about Rodriguez' reliability were present prior to the U.S. military operation, said two sources.

For Venezuela, the U.S. directive means abandoning its closest allies outside the region. Iran has helped Venezuela repair oil refineries while China has taken oil as repayment for debt. Russia has supplied weaponry, including missiles, to Venezuela's military.

Trump has also cited communist-led Cuba as another U.S. foe he wants Venezuela to abandon. Havana has provided security and intelligence support while receiving cut-rate Venezuelan oil.

Since Maduro's removal, Rodriguez, whose deep ties to the oil sector are crucial to keeping the country stable, has taken steps to stay in favor with Washington including releasing political prisoners and authorizing the sale of 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil to the United States.

In a speech on Sunday, Rodriguez said she has had “enough” of U.S. intervention. Still, U.S. officials have also held positive calls with her in recent days, according to two of the sources.

The Trump administration does not see an immediate alternative to working with Rodriguez, given it has publicly backed her so strongly, two of the sources said.

But U.S. officials are developing contacts with senior military and security officials in case they decide to change their approach, a source briefed on Venezuela policy said.

The recent intelligence reports also found that opposition leader Maria Corina Machado is not currently able to run the country successfully in part because she lacks strong ties to the country’s security services or oil sector, the sources said.

Some observers and Machado's movement say it won a 2024 election that year by a huge margin, though the state backed a Maduro victory. She remains popular with Venezuelans.

Trump told reporters last week he wanted Machado “involved” in the country’s leadership, without providing details.

One person familiar with the administration’s discussions with Machado said she is well-liked by the White House and is considered a longer-term option for a leadership position in Venezuela.

The separate source briefed on Venezuela policy suggested that for now, Machado could be considered for an advisory role but no firm decision had been made. Representatives for Machado did not respond to a request for comment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:49:21 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K7MFX3Z5AROMTDDXXYUQBL4UXI.jpg?auth=a20dc16f4bd5485f4989153ac1316093f4841e853f87e3a383b01cd4b45a004c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>After toppling Hasina, young Bangladeshis turn back to old guard</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/after-toppling-hasina-young-bangladeshis-turn-back-old-guard-2026-01-28/</link><description>DHAKA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Dhaka University student Sadman Mujtaba Rafid defied his parents and police to join protests that toppled former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina , convinced the rallies were essential to ensure democracy prevailed over dynastic rule.

But ahead of the February 12 parliamentary election - the first since the upheaval - some of Rafid’s optimism has faded.

“We dreamt of a country where all people regardless of gender, race, religion would have equal opportunity,” the 25-year-old said. “We expected policy changes and reforms, but it is far away from what we dreamt of.”

Tens of thousands of young Bangladeshis, frustrated by years of repression and a lack of jobs and economic opportunity under Hasina’s rule, poured into the streets in 2024, eager for radical change and a “New Bangladesh”.

But while the elections will deliver a government without Hasina for the first time since 2008, there has been no major reform and no new viable alternative party has emerged, according to many, leaving the battle for government mostly between former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami .

Opinion polls put the established, but tarnished, parties as frontrunners.

Reuters spoke to more than 80 students under 30, mostly in the capital Dhaka. Most expressed excitement about voting in a freer election but were disappointed with the choice of candidates.

Under 30s, popularly known as Gen-Z, drove the uprising and make up more than a quarter of Bangladesh’s 128 million voters.

“They are politically active and will in all likelihood go to vote and affect the electoral outcome,” said political analyst Asif Shahan, who teaches at Dhaka University.

Most were expected to back the newly-formed National Citizens Party (NCP), spearheaded by some of the uprising's leaders, but it has struggled for their support .

An alliance with the hardline Jamaat-e-Islami may have further undermined its appeal.

"They have lost the moral high ground,” said Shudrul Amin, a 23-year-old archaeology student at Jahangirnagar University. "Voters who wanted a ‘New Bangladesh’ free from the baggage of the past now feel they are being forced to choose between the old guard and a student‑Islamist alliance.”

Shama Debnath, a 24-year-old Hindu, said politics remained “trapped in an ‘either this or that’ framework” with no new vision or choices.

The interim government of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has also disappointed many in Gen-Z after it failed to rein in mob violence targeting journalists and minorities.

“After a year, I feel the spirit of the July revolution is completely lost,” said Hema Chakma, a 23-year-old Buddhist student. “I am not saying the previous situation was good, but I feel the violence has increased a lot and the interim government is not taking any steps."

Interviews with young Bangladeshis also betrayed unhappiness with the economy, the spark for the revolt that led to Hasina’s eventual exile in India.

NCP’s spokesperson Asif Mahmud, 27, who rose to prominence during the protests and served in Yunus’ government, said the party was constrained by being new and having mostly younger members. It also lacked resources, grassroots organisation and financial muscle, he added.

Mahmud stressed the alliance with Jamaat was strategic rather than ideological and there would be no move towards sharia law.

“We will work to fulfill expectations of the youth in the present and also in the future as promised," he said.

Despite their misgivings, most Gen-Z Bangladeshis told Reuters they remained hopeful about the election itself, where 300 seats are being contested.

There will be a simultaneous referendum on reforms to state institutions, including term limits for prime ministers, stronger presidential powers and greater independence for the judiciary and election authorities.

Willingness to vote was as high as 97% among those aged 18 to 35, with an almost even split between BNP and Jamaat, according to a recent poll by the Bangladesh Youth Leadership Center, a youth‑focused leadership platform.

“People are going to vote and that is enough,” said 26-year-old student activist Umama Fatema, a key figure in the 2024 uprising, adding that only a democratically elected “stable government” could steer Bangladesh.

For some, that means the BNP.

“Given that the new students’ party has shattered our hopes, I have decided to vote for BNP," said 25-year-old Maisha Maliha, saying she believed the country needed a strong, united political party with enough people on the ground.

Others say the Islamists should have a chance. “We have seen BNP before, so Jamaat seems like a new option,” said 20-year-old Erisha Tabassum.

Tasnim Jara, a doctor who returned from Britain to join the NCP but quit because of the Islamist alliance, is now contesting as an independent, determined to help foster what she calls a “genuinely new political culture”.

The 31-year-old spent two frantic days going door-to-door to collect the 5,000 signatures required to validate her nomination.

"The July uprising created hope that people like us, who were never part of the old political guard, could finally enter politics and change how it is practised," said Jara.

"I do believe there is hope for a genuine political alternative in Bangladesh. But it will not emerge overnight," she said.

Such efforts still resonate with some young voters.

H.M. Amirul Karim, a 25-year-old English literature student, said: "I continue to dream that even if not now, the desire for a new political structure will become a reality. I am not ready to give up.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:49:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/W4XRVJP44RNX7P26R2LK7AWP5Y.jpg?auth=f09a0cd59a0cdd8a173fcd63ee5e5f90076b21cbc43ebc2579c28a38b52e0403&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>UN experts condemn US move to strip migrant children of legal aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/un-experts-condemn-us-move-strip-migrant-children-legal-aid-2026-01-27/</link><description>Jan 27 (Reuters) - U.N. human rights experts on Tuesday denounced the Trump administration's decision last year to cut legal aid for unaccompanied children in U.S. immigration proceedings.

The condemnation came days after U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk urged the Trump administration to ensure that its migration policies respect individual rights and international law.

"Denying children their rights to legal representation and forcing them to navigate complex immigration proceedings without legal counsel is a serious violation of the rights of children," said the independent experts, who are appointed by the U.N. Human Rights Council.

The White House dismissed the experts and said it had made attempts to locate children it says were smuggled into the United States under the previous administration, without elaborating with specific examples.

"No one takes the U.N. seriously because of their extreme bias and selective outrage – they should be praising the Administration for protecting children, not lying about our policies," Abigail Jackson, a spokeswoman for the White House, said.

In February, the U.S. Department of the Interior ordered legal service providers working with the children to stop work and cut their funding. The providers sued over the move and a federal judge later temporarily restored the funding for the program.

The cuts came amid President Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown , including an effort to deport hundreds of thousands of migrant children who entered the U.S. without their parents.

The U.N. experts called the deportations unlawful and said they breached international human rights law prohibiting the removal of vulnerable groups, including children at risk of human trafficking.

They also condemned the administration's $2,500 offer to get the unaccompanied children to voluntarily leave the U.S.

"Child-sensitive justice procedures should be guaranteed in all immigration and asylum proceedings affecting children," said the experts, who have been in contact with the U.S. government on the issue.

More than 600,000 migrant children have crossed the U.S.-Mexico border without a parent or legal guardian since 2019, according to government data.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:49:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EXASSVHJ3ZO5RJ4VMQVMJ6PU6Y.jpg?auth=9a113b89c5711e05b231e2b2f6f68996e3b2174dfcc864f780fed584c0bf38cd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump backs down on immigration enforcement push after Minneapolis shootings</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260128-trump-backs-down-on-immigration-enforcement-push-after-minneapolis-shootings</link><description>President Donald Trump ’s border czar, Tom Homan, met with the Minneapolis mayor and the Minnesota governor on Tuesday in a show of detente, as the White House sought to ease unrest gripping the city after two US citizens were shot dead by federal agents.

Homan was put in charge of the Minneapolis immigration enforcement surge in place of US Border Patrol "commander at large" Gregory Bovino, who sources said was being demoted and reassigned after having overseen most of Trump’s crackdowns in Democratic-led cities.

The move was part of a broader reset by the Republican president – who faces mounting political pressure – to soften his administration’s aggressive deportation tactics.

Some advisers have expressed concern that national outrage over Saturday’s killing of 37-year-old Alex Pretti, and the administration’s immediate defence of the agents who shot him, could derail Trump’s broader immigration agenda.

As they did after the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Good earlier this month, some administration officials initially responded to Pretti’s killing by accusing him of "domestic terrorism," a claim belied by witness video verified by Reuters that showed he posed no threat.

Homan’s job in Minneapolis is to "recalibrate tactics" and improve cooperation with state and local officials, a source with ties to the White House said, adding: "The goal is to scale back, eventually pull out."

Speaking of the Minnesota situation on Fox News on Tuesday, Trump said his administration was "going to de-escalate a little bit."

"I don’t think it’s a pullback. It’s a little bit of a change," the president said. Asked whether he retained confidence in US Homeland Secretary Kristi Noem, whose role in the crisis brought calls for her dismissal or impeachment from leading Democrats on Capitol Hill, Trump said: "I do."

The president met with Noem, at her request, for two hours in the Oval Office on Monday evening, a source briefed on the matter confirmed.

A senior Trump administration official said Homan would move away from the broad, public neighbourhood sweeps that Bovino had conducted in Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis and other cities and adopt a more traditional, targeted approach.

In a statement, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said he had reiterated to Homan his request that the enforcement action, known as Operation Metro Surge, "come to an end as quickly as possible," and that city leaders would remain in touch with Homan. The 30-minute meeting included the city’s police chief.

In a separate meeting with Homan, Governor Tim Walz said he had outlined the state’s priorities, including impartial investigations into the two shootings and a reduction in the 3,000-strong force of federal agents deployed to the city. Homan and Walz agreed to continue working toward those goals, the governor said.

Announcing his plan to send in Homan, the subject of a US Justice Department bribery probe that was abruptly closed last year, Trump on Monday sought to cast his designated "border czar" as a neutral figure in the Minnesota crisis who "knows and likes many of the people there."

In weekend talks between the president and his advisers, discussions included reducing the number of agents in Minnesota, focusing the mission more narrowly on deportations, and exploring greater co‑ordination with state authorities, according to a White House official.

The killing of Pretti, a veterans hospital intensive care nurse shot multiple times by Border Patrol agents during daytime protests, has turned into a full-blown political crisis for Trump, with even some Republicans in Congress calling for investigations.

Coupled with the January 7 shooting of Good, a mother of three, by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Pretti’s death sparked renewed anger over the heavily armed federal agents on the Minneapolis streets.

Late on Monday, Minnesota’s chief federal judge threatened to hold the acting head of ICE , Todd Lyons, in contempt for his agency’s failures to comply with court orders that some detainees receive bond hearings.

Public support for Trump’s immigration enforcement tactics appeared to be waning both before and after the Pretti shooting, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed. The issue has put Republicans on the defensive ahead of November’s midterm elections , when the party’s narrow congressional majorities are at stake.

The typically combative Trump characterised private conversations with both Walz and Frey on Monday as productive, while the two Democratic leaders offered similarly positive comments, a far cry from the vitriol the sides had previously exchanged. Walz and Frey were among several Democratic state and local officials subpoenaed one week ago in a Justice Department probe into whether their opposition to Operation Metro Surge amounted to a crime.

At the White House on Tuesday, Trump expressed sympathy for Pretti’s family and said he would be "watching over" the investigation into his killing.

While Trump stood by Noem, the three top Democrats in the US House of Representatives and the ranking Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee said they would seek to initiate impeachment proceedings against her unless she was fired. Any impeachment would require some level of support from Republicans, who control the House, to move forward.

Privately, Trump has made clear to advisers he did not want to defend the agents’ actions or attack Pretti, after Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller labelled Pretti an "assassin" and Bovino suggested he intended to "massacre" officers.

Widely shared video contradicted those claims , showing Pretti holding a phone, not a gun, as agents wrestled him to the ground.

It also showed officers removing a firearm from his waistband after he was subdued, seconds before they fatally shot him. Pretti was a licensed gun owner who lived half a mile from the scene.

Speaking with reporters in Iowa on Tuesday, Trump said that Pretti "certainly shouldn’t have been carrying a gun" at the time, comments that put him at odds with gun rights groups and some Republicans .</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:50:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/a58d508a-fbd6-11f0-9e8b-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26024612046944.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>TikTok settles landmark social media addiction lawsuit ahead of trial</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/technology/20260127-tiktok-settles-landmark-social-media-addiction-lawsuit-ahead-of-trial</link><description>TikTok agreed to settle a landmark social media addiction lawsuit just before the trial kicked off, the plaintiff’s attorneys confirmed.

The social video platform was one of three companies – along with Meta’s Instagram and Google’s YouTube – facing claims that their platforms deliberately addict and harm children. A fourth company named in the lawsuit , Snapchat parent company Snap Inc., settled the case last week for an undisclosed sum.

Details of the settlement with TikTok were not disclosed, and the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

At the core of the case is a 19-year-old identified only by the initials “KGM,” whose case could determine how thousands of other, similar lawsuits against social media companies will play out. She and two other plaintiffs have been selected for bellwether trials – essentially test cases for both sides to see how their arguments play out before a jury and what damages, if any, may be awarded, said Clay Calvert, a nonresident senior fellow of technology policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute.

Joseph VanZandt, co-lead counsel for the plaintiff, said in a statement Tuesday that TikTok remains a defendant in the other personal injury cases, and that the trial will proceed as scheduled against Meta and YouTube.

Jury selection starts this week in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. It's the first time the companies will argue their case before a jury, and the outcome could have profound effects on their businesses and how they will handle children using their platforms. The selection process is expected to take at least a few days, with 75 potential jurors questioned each day through at least Thursday.

“This was only the first case – there are hundreds of parents and school districts in the social media addiction trials that start today, and sadly, new families every day who are speaking out and bringing Big Tech to court for its deliberately harmful products,” said Sacha Haworth, executive director of the nonprofit Tech Oversight Project.

KGM claims that her use of social media from an early age addicted her to the technology and exacerbated depression and suicidal thoughts. Importantly, the lawsuit claims that this was done through deliberate design choices made by companies that sought to make their platforms more addictive to children to boost profits. This argument, if successful, could sidestep the companies' First Amendment shield and Section 230, which protects tech companies from liability for material posted on their platforms.

“Borrowing heavily from the behavioral and neurobiological techniques used by slot machines and exploited by the cigarette industry, Defendants deliberately embedded in their products an array of design features aimed at maximizing youth engagement to drive advertising revenue,” the lawsuit says.

Executives, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg , are expected to testify at the trial, which will last six to eight weeks. Experts have drawn similarities to the Big Tobacco trials that led to a 1998 settlement requiring cigarette companies to pay billions in health care costs and restrict marketing targeting minors.

“Plaintiffs are not merely the collateral damage of Defendants’ products,” the lawsuit says. “They are the direct victims of the intentional product design choices made by each Defendant. They are the intended targets of the harmful features that pushed them into self-destructive feedback loops.”

The tech companies dispute the claims that their products deliberately harm children , citing a bevy of safeguards they have added over the years and arguing that they are not liable for content posted on their sites by third parties.

“Recently, a number of lawsuits have attempted to place the blame for teen mental health struggles squarely on social media companies,” Meta said in a recent blog post. "But this oversimplifies a serious issue. Clinicians and researchers find that mental health is a deeply complex and multifaceted issue, and trends regarding teens' well-being aren't clear-cut or universal. Narrowing the challenges faced by teens to a single factor ignores the scientific research and the many stressors impacting young people today, like academic pressure, school safety, socio-economic challenges and substance abuse."

A Meta spokesperson said in a statement Monday the company strongly disagrees with the allegations outlined in the lawsuit and that it's “confident the evidence will show our longstanding commitment to supporting young people.”

José Castañeda, a Google Spokesperson, said Monday that the allegations against YouTube are “simply not true.” In a statement, he said “Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work."

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.

The case will be the first in a slew of cases beginning this year that seek to hold social media companies responsible for harming children's mental well-being. A federal bellwether trial beginning in June in Oakland, California, will be the first to represent school districts that have sued social media platforms over harms to children.

In addition, more than 40 state attorneys general have filed lawsuits against Meta, claiming it is harming young people and contributing to the youth mental health crisis by deliberately designing features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms. The majority of cases filed their lawsuits in federal court, but some sued in their respective states.

TikTok also faces similar lawsuits in more than a dozen states.

In New Mexico, meanwhile, jury selection begins next week for trial on allegations that Meta and its social media platforms have failed to protect young users from sexual exploitation, following an undercover online investigation. Attorney General Raúl Torrez in late 2023 sued Meta and Zuckerberg, who was later dropped from the suit.

Prosecutors have said that New Mexico is not seeking to hold Meta accountable for its content but rather its role in pushing out that content through complex algorithms that proliferate material that can be harmful, saying they uncovered internal documents in which Meta employees estimate about 100,000 children every day are subjected to sexual harassment on the company’s platforms.

Meta has said it uses sophisticated technology, hires child safety experts, reports content to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and shares information and tools with other companies and law enforcement, including state attorneys general, to help root out predators.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 01:50:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/33600438-d626-11f0-8f3f-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2025-12-09T031523Z-863589627-RC2QCIAR4COP-RTRMADP-3-AUSTRALIA-SOCIALMEDIA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador says ICE agent tried to enter consulate in Minneapolis</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-says-ice-agent-tried-enter-consulate-minneapolis-2026-01-28/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 27 (Reuters) - A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent tried to get into Ecuador's consulate in Minneapolis on Tuesday but was prevented from entering the premises by consulate staffers, the country's Foreign Ministry said.

The attempted entry prompted the Foreign Ministry to send a "note of protest" to the U.S. Embassy in Quito, the Ecuadorean capital, demanding such incidents "not be repeated," the ministry said in a statement.

The statement carried a headline referring to the incident as an "attempted incursion into the Ecuadorean Consulate in Minneapolis by ICE agents."

It said the consulate staff members' actions to prevent ICE entry ensured the protection of Ecuadorean nationals who were in the building at the time.

The incident occurred during a mass deportation operation being conducted by some 3,000 heavily armed agents of ICE and the U.S. Border Patrol deployed to Minnesota under orders of President Donald Trump several weeks ago.

Neither the State Department nor the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE and the Border Patrol, immediately responded to requests from Reuters for comment.

Ecuador's Foreign Ministry provided few other details. But eyewitnesses working in retail shops near the consulate said they saw immigration agents try to enter the building.

"I saw the officers going after two people in the street, and then those people went into the consulate and the officers tried to go in after them," said one woman, who asked not to be named, citing a fear of retribution by the federal government.

The agents "weren’t able to enter the consulate, from what I could see," she said.

Under an international treaty, a country's embassies, consular offices and other diplomatic compounds are regarded as sovereign territory of that nation, protected under diplomatic immunity from unauthorized entry by agents of other governments.

Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, Trump's immigration enforcement drive in Minneapolis has led to fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens on the streets of Minnesota's most populous city, sparking weeks of protests there and across the country.

As political pressure for a de-escalation of tensions mounted, Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, met on Tuesday with the mayor of Minneapolis and the governor of Minnesota, seeking to defuse the crisis.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 03:45:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/24BJC65WGJLAHDM6H4I6H3MCFA.jpg?auth=39ba8499ac6fde5ba64802fd9c16a14122e8b819fb7b08420e5b3c213ed28c86&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Search for 32 people missing in Indonesia landslide hampered by rain as death toll rises to 34</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/death-toll-indonesias-landslides-rises-34-official-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Search operations for the 32 people still missing after a landslide in Indonesia's West Java were hampered by rain on Wednesday morning, the country's disaster mitigation agency said, as it raised the death toll to 34.

The landslide hit Pasir Langu village in Bandung Barat region early on Saturday, triggered by heavy rains starting a day earlier.

The village was located in a hilly area of the province about 100 km (62.14 miles) southeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.

"It's raining in the landslide site this morning but all the rescuers are ready to continue the search, waiting for the right timing," the agency's spokesperson Abdul Muhari told Reuters.

The death toll rose to 34 from the previous count of 20. Another 23 people survived the disaster.

Twenty-three soldiers were killed while conducting border patrol training, the Indonesian Navy said on Tuesday.

It was not immediately clear whether the latest death toll included those soldiers, Muhari said.

A team is currently working at the scene to identify the bodies found by rescuers, Muhari added.

At least 800 rescuers, military and police personnel along with nine excavators have been deployed to find the remaining missing people.

Nearly 700 residents of the stricken village have been evacuated to local government buildings, the agency said earlier.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 03:45:57 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CHKQ67G7HFLN7N3YTWC7FUFT4M.jpg?auth=b2cd79284f51efb53594776d579b4b16d522a8ef5b7bc6a2764c02c1c9ee810c&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court set to rule in bribery trial of former first lady</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-court-set-rule-bribery-trial-former-first-lady-2026-01-28/</link><description>SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A South Korean district court is set to deliver on Wednesday its ruling in the trial of Kim Keon Hee, the wife of ousted ex-President Yoon Suk Yeol, who could face a jail term if found guilty on charges that include bribery.

The ruling, which can be appealed by the former first lady or prosecutors, comes in a series of trials following investigations into Yoon's brief imposition of martial law in 2024 and related scandals involving the once-powerful couple.

Prosecutors demanded 15 years in jail and fines of 2.9 billion won ($2 million) over accusations that include accepting luxury Chanel bags and a diamond necklace from South Korea's Unification Church in return for political favours.

Other charges to be decided by the Seoul central district court include manipulation of stock prices and violations of political funding laws, by receiving opinion polls from a power broker in return for influencing the choice of poll candidates.

Kim "took advantage of the status of the president's spouse to receive money and expensive valuables, and has been widely involved in various personnel appointments and nominations," special prosecutor Min Joong-ki said in December.

Kim had denied all the charges.

The Unification Church said the gifts were delivered to her without expecting anything. Its leader Han Hak-ja, who is also on trial, has denied that she directed it to bribe Kim.

Yoon, who was ousted from power last April, also faces eight trials on charges including insurrection, after his failed bid to impose martial law in December 2024.

He has appealed against a five-year jail term handed to him this month for obstructing attempts to arrest him after his martial law decree.

Video showed a man surging toward the U.S. lawmaker at the lectern and spraying a stream of liquid at her. A large man immediately grabbed him and took him to the ground. Omar took a few steps toward the man with her hand raised before he was subdued and she continued her presentation after a brief break.

Minneapolis police said officers at the scene observed the man use a syringe to spray an unknown liquid at Omar. Police immediately arrested him for third-degree assault and said Omar was uninjured. Forensic scientists responded to process the scene, police said.

"He sprayed something on her," a woman at the town hall could be heard saying, while at least one woman commented on the foul odor. "I need a napkin," Omar remarked as the man was taken away, before she said, "We will continue."

Omar was criticizing ICE and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem when the man charged at her and called for her to resign in the wake of the shooting death of two U.S. citizens in Minneapolis in recent weeks during President Donald Trump's immigration enforcement surge.

"ICE cannot be reformed, it cannot be rehabilitated, we must abolish ICE for good, and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem must resign or face impeachment," Omar said as the crowd in the town hall applauded.

The man then charged at her and sprayed the liquid at her before saying: "You must resign."

Omar has frequently come under political attack from Trump, who once called her "garbage."

During a speech in Iowa on Tuesday, Trump said Omar did not love the United States.

"They have to show that they can love our country, they have to be proud," Trump said when talking about immigrants. "Not like Ilhan Omar," he added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 03:46:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/C47OO74JPFJVLHCAA26RP6L244.jpg?auth=3d2f95915624fa0872124cbe19fd761d2e907d8f814cac9b53364a981263eced&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Japan-born pandas Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei arrive home in China's Sichuan</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/japan-born-pandas-xiao-xiao-lei-lei-arrive-home-chinas-sichuan-2026-01-28/</link><description>BEIJING, Jan 28 (Reuters) - China's giant pandas Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei arrived safely in Sichuan on Wednesday, China's panda research base said in a social media post, following an emotional goodbye from fans in Tokyo where the pair were born and raised.

Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei arrived at Chengdu's Tianfu International Airport on 1 a.m. on Wednesday, a WeChat post by the China Conservation and Research Centre for the Giant Panda showed. They reached the centre in Ya'an, Sichuan, at 6 a.m. on Wednesday, where they will undergo quarantine.

The twin pandas were born in Tokyo's Ueno Zoo in 2021. Their parents Shin Shin and Ri Ri returned to China in 2024.

Since its founding in 1949, China has used panda diplomacy to boost its international image and cement ties with other countries by gifting or loaning out pandas. The pandas typically return home after the agreement ends, and pandas born overseas like Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei usually go to a Chinese breeding program between the age of two and four.

Pictures on the WeChat post showed the pandas' crates being unloaded from a Sichuan Airlines plane and then transported to a truck while workers in white protective suits look on.

Xiao Xiao and Lei Lei have "continuously put up bridges of friendship between the people of China and Japan" and "made a positive contribution to promoting friendship between the peoples of the two countries", the research centre said.

The panda's journey coincided with a low point in Sino-Japanese relations. In November, Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said Japan would respond militarily in the event of a Chinese attack on democratically governed Taiwan. China, which regards Taiwan as a wayward province, reacted angrily to the comment and advised citizens against travelling to Japan .</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 04:44:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HDZBB5RBPNLWJK5Z74SQIMKB7Q.jpg?auth=0a0c15da3296afe5219df185236d63572475938af673420392979f3ff8635dbc&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Thai parties tap nationalist mood as Cambodia clashes roil rural voters</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/thai-parties-tap-nationalist-mood-cambodia-clashes-roil-rural-voters-2026-01-28/</link><description>KANTHARALAK, Thailand, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Thai lawmaker Phumin Leethiraprasert has switched party allegiances in his re-election campaign for a February 8 poll , aiming to show voters he can make tough decisions to help border communities scarred by clashes with neighbouring Cambodia.

"I am not running for Pheu Thai this time around because of the border conflict," said Phumin, 62, referring to the party of billionaire former premier Thaksin Shinawatra that dominated swathes of Thailand's mainly agrarian northeast for decades.

Nationalist sentiment has surged across Southeast Asia's second largest economy after a perception that the Pheu Thai-led administration's handling of a border crisis led to the worst fighting with Cambodia in decades, killing 149 people.

"Bombs hit our homes, and our people died," the former doctor, who has forged new ties with one of the political parties racing to harness the nationalist fervour in the final stretch of the campaign, told a small crowd at a rally.

Voters angered by the damage in his district of Kantharalak had urged Phumin to defect, he said last week.

So he is now running as a candidate of the Kla Tham Party, an ally of the ruling Bhumjaithai, which took power after the border row led to the removal of Thaksin's daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra , who was then prime minister.

Anger and anxiety linger in the area after 19 Thais were killed and hundreds of thousands evacuated from border communities, such as Kantharalak, in two bouts of fighting in July and December.

"We have to make them afraid," said Uthai, a 58-year-old in the village of Sam Meng, referring to Cambodia. "We have been too soft."

Thailand and Cambodia agreed to a second ceasefire in late December, ending weeks of clashes following the collapse of a July truce brokered with the help of U.S. President Donald Trump .

Many voters are backing the Thai army's plans for a border wall along parts of the 817-km (508-mile) land frontier, Phumin said, though construction has yet to begin.

"They don't want to see border crossings reopened or trade with Cambodia resume."

In the midst of the intense border fighting, Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul dissolved parliament in December after fewer than 100 days in power, setting the stage for snap polls, designed to gain from the wave of intense nationalism unleashed.

At rallies, Anutin and his Bhumjaithai expressed strong support for the military and the construction of the border wall, a policy echoed by other conservative, pro-army groups.

That has forced key rivals, the progressive People's Party, which is leading in the polls, and Pheu Thai, to redraw campaign planks to avoid appearing unpatriotic, said political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.

"They are being portrayed as not nationalist enough, not patriotic enough, and not anti-Cambodian enough," he said, describing the efforts of pro-military parties to undercut the competition.

The People's Party, long associated with calls for military reforms, has softened its anti-establishment stance, underlining plans to exert diplomatic pressure on Cambodia to ensure stable ties with Thailand.

Pheu Thai, facing widespread criticism over Thaksin's once- close ties with former Cambodian premier Hun Sen, is redoubling efforts to show it is committed to defend Thailand's sovereignty.

"We can live alongside them," said Samrong Narasa, whose home in the village of Sam Meng, about 10 km (6 miles) from the border, was destroyed by Cambodian shelling in December.

"But we don't want to be friends with them," added the 52-year-old, who wants the new government to do more to protect people and their livelihoods.

Under the deal, agreed between the two countries before Starmer took office, Rwanda would have been paid to take in migrants who had illegally arrived in Britain.

Rwanda's government said in a statement posted on X that it had submitted a notice to The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration, arguing Britain had breached the financial arrangements of the deal.

Rwanda said that Britain had in 2024 requested it to forgo two payments of 50 million pounds ($69 million) due in April 2025 and April 2026 in anticipation of the formal termination of the treaty underlying the deal.

The East African country said it was prepared to agree, provided that the treaty was terminated and new financial terms were negotiated and agreed.

"Discussions between Rwanda and the United Kingdom did not however ultimately take place and the amounts remain due and payable under the treaty," the government said on X.

The request, which Reuters is the first to report, is the latest sign of efforts by the administration of President Donald Trump to influence health policy globally.

Anti-vaccine groups, including one founded by U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have for decades claimed that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative used in vaccines, is linked to autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, despite many studies showing no related safety issues .

In June last year, Kennedy cut $300 million in annual funding for Gavi, which helps the world's poorest and lower-income countries buy vaccines to prevent diseases such as measles and diphtheria.

Kennedy, who has long promoted anti-vaccine views contrary to scientific evidence, says the group ignores safety issues with the immunizations it provides. Gavi says vaccine safety is its utmost concern.

“Until a plan for removal of thimerosal-containing vaccines is developed and the plan initiated, the United States will withhold future new funding,” an official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told Reuters.

The official would not comment on when the request was made, but claimed Gavi has so far refused to develop such a plan. A Gavi spokesperson confirmed the request to remove thimerosal from its portfolio, and said the group remained in contact with the U.S. government on the subject.

"While we very much hope to find a pathway to welcoming the U.S. back as a donor, any decision related to Gavi’s portfolio would require a decision by Gavi’s board and input from preceding governance committees, which will be guided by scientific consensus," the spokesperson said.

Thimerosal is mainly used to ensure vaccines in multi-dose vials remain stable. That helps immunization campaigns in low- and middle-income countries because multi-dose vials are cheaper and simpler to distribute, Gavi and the World Health Organization say.

The preservative has largely been phased out in high-income countries, where vaccines usually come in a single-use format, although its use is not prohibited. Under Kennedy, the U.S. moved last summer to stop use of influenza vaccines containing thimerosal, representing around 5% of flu shots given in the country, despite U.S. health agencies having declared them safe.

The U.S. official said the request of Gavi aims to bring its policies in low- and middle-income countries in line with the U.S., Canada, and most European nations.

The safety of thimerosal has been studied for decades, after concerns were raised in the 1990s about exposure to mercury in vaccines, according to the WHO.

No compelling scientific evidence has been found to suggest that there is a risk, particularly when compared to the dangers of keeping children unprotected against deadly diseases, the WHO says.

The U.S. request applies both to the remaining $300 million that the Biden administration had pledged to Gavi with Congressional approval, but which is still outstanding, and to any future funding, the official said.

The U.S. previously contributed around 13% of Gavi’s funding, and the organization has embarked on a series of cost-cutting measures to try to address the shortfall, which has been exacerbated by cuts from other high-income nations.

The Trump administration has cut billions of dollars in health funding internationally and withdrawn from the WHO .

The U.S. government has said it is still committed to global health and is pursuing bilateral agreements with countries under Trump's ‘America First’ agenda.

Last week, the U.S. health department said a hepatitis B vaccine study in Guinea Bissau would help inform global policy.

The study, funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is now undergoing further ethical review after international criticism.

The U.S. CDC last month withdrew its longstanding recommendation that all newborns should get the hepatitis B vaccine, drawing a swift rebuke from vaccine experts.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 06:39:22 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7UKKPZVJBVLWPEFURBF7I6U4AA.jpg?auth=59e65cfaf1a7e4bda4ab61bb6d56715679a9e64d0e49abd6ce30c0625f4346ae&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Philippines maritime council calls for restraint amid heated exchanges between Manila and China diplomats</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/china/philippines-maritime-council-calls-restraint-amid-heated-exchanges-between-2026-01-28/</link><description>MANILA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The Philippines' maritime council called for "restraint" on Wednesday amid heated public exchanges between its officials and the Chinese embassy in Manila, adding it "does not seek provocation or escalation".

On the plane to China for the first visit by a British leader since 2018, Starmer said the country cannot afford to ignore the economic opportunities presented by China, the world's second-largest economy, while it must remain vigilant about potential security threats.

"It doesn't make sense to stick our head in the ground and bury it in the sand when it comes to China, it's in our interests to engage," he said. "It's going to be a really important trip for us and we'll make some real progress."

Travelling with a delegation of more than 50 business leaders, Starmer will meet with President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Qiang on Thursday before travelling to Shanghai on Friday for talks with local executives.

The visit could mark a critical shift in ties between Britain and China after years of deep acrimony over Beijing's crackdown on political freedoms in Hong Kong, China's support for Russia in the Ukraine war and allegations by British security services that China regularly spies on politicians and officials.

For China, the visit offers the country a chance to portray itself as a stable and reliable partner at a time of global disorder.

The trip comes at a time when there is a flurry of diplomacy between Western countries and China as they hedge against the unpredictability of the U.S.

Starmer's trip follows weeks of tensions with Trump over his threats to seize Greenland, his criticism of Britain's deal to cede sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago - including an island with an important U.S.-UK air base - to Mauritius, and his comments that NATO allies avoided front-line combat during the war in Afghanistan.

Starmer will arrive just days after Trump threatened to impose a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if that country's prime minister, Mark Carney, signed a trade deal with China.

But Starmer insisted Britain could continue to strengthen economic ties with China - without angering Trump - because of his country's long history of working closely with the U.S.

"The relationship we have with the U.S. is one of the closest relationships we hold, on defence, security, intelligence and also on trade and lots of areas," he said.

Starmer was reluctant to be drawn on what he would discuss with Chinese leaders, or if he would bring up the fate of Jimmy Lai, the former Hong Kong media tycoon who was convicted in December of national security crimes. He also declined to say whether he would ask China to pressure Russia to end the Ukraine war.

Asked if Britain and China could strike a deal that would allow more visa-free travel, Starmer said he hoped to make some "progress" in that area.

Starmer repeatedly defended his decision to visit China, saying it would help him deliver on his plan to drive economic growth and improve living standards in Britain.

But his strategy has drawn fierce criticism from some British and U.S. politicians who say he is underestimating the security threats posed by China.

Starmer distanced himself from comments made by Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week when he said the rules-based global order was a thing of the past and called on the world's middle powers to work together to avoid being victimised by American hegemony.

"I'm a pragmatist, a British pragmatist applying common sense," Starmer said, rejecting the idea that his government must choose between the U.S. and Europe.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:27:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IHG3WBBX4BJ5VOEKNEMLKAEJBM.jpg?auth=699b789340d9b7d00253c7578b740946fd2639473da0c0f50d847e58a3fc7e4d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Taiwan shows off F-16 jets rapid response amid tensions with China</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/taiwan-shows-off-f-16-jets-rapid-response-amid-tensions-with-china-2026-01-28/</link><description>CHIAYI, Taiwan, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Taiwan's air force showcased its ability to rapidly replenish and get back in the air its most advanced F-16 fighter jets in a readiness drill on Wednesday, designed to demonstrate combat-oriented training.

Taiwan's air force scrambles on an almost daily basis to monitor and warn off Chinese aircraft which routinely fly around the island. Taipei views the incursions as part of an ongoing harassment campaign to test and tire out the much smaller Taiwanese forces and exert political pressure.

President Lai Ching-te's administration, as part of a defence modernisation programme, has pushed for more combat-realistic training that relies less on set-piece performances and more on simulating actual combat.

At the Chiayi air base in southern Taiwan, personnel loaded up U.S.-made AIM-9M Sidewinder and AIM-120 AMRAAM anti-aircraft missiles onto a Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) , opens new tab F-16V fighter jet to get the aircraft quickly back in the air.

"This ensures that, in the shortest possible time, the aircraft can complete ammunition resupply and refuelling and quickly go out on the attack," weapons loading officer Wu Bo-jhih told reporters.

Taiwan routinely holds drills ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday, which starts next month, though these are the first to take place in front of the media since China held its latest round of war games around the island in late December.

Pilot Shih Shun-de said it was important to let people know just how fast the air force can react.

"The scramble drill lets the public see the results of the air force's realistic, combat-oriented training," he said.

China views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, despite the objections of the government in Taipei.

The repeated scrambling to see off China's air force also gives real-life experience for Taiwan's fighter pilots in terms of seeing China's air force and tactics up close.

During the height of the Cold War the two air forces had regular dogfights over the Taiwan Strait, but no shots in anger have been fired in decades.

Speaking at the presidential office in Taipei on Wednesday during a promotion ceremony for senior officers, Lai said that the military's training must be more practical, more flexible, and closer to real combat.

"At the same time, we must develop a range of enemy-defeating strategies with agility, using technology and artificial intelligence to build a defence force that is effective, credible, and modernised," he added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:28:31 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/OMLGSNIGXFLBDHUVJMSMRVVU5Q.jpg?auth=f56f4d36d54947788c8cfbf6ad31566d9b20e4873eb937b33e62a34f78d93f30&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran executes man accused of spying for Israel</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-executes-man-accused-spying-israel-2026-01-28/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Iran executed a man on Wednesday who was accused of spying for Israel, the Iranian judiciary's media outlet Mizan reported, naming him as Hamidreza Sabet Esmaeilipour.

Entangled in a decades-long shadow war with Israel, Iran has executed many people it has accused of having links with the Israeli intelligence service and facilitating its operations in the country.

"Hamidreza Sabet Esmaeilipour who was arrested on 29 April 2025, was hanged for the crime of espionage and intelligence cooperation in favour of a hostile intelligence service (Mossad) through ... the transfer of classified documents and information, after the verdict was confirmed by the Supreme Court and through legal procedures," Mizan said.

Executions of Iranians convicted of spying for Israel have significantly increased since last year following a direct confrontation between the two regional enemies in June, when Israeli and U.S. forces struck Iran's nuclear facilities.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:28:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: EU, Vietnam to agree to boost work on minerals, chips, "trusted" 5G, draft document says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/eu-vietnam-agree-boost-work-minerals-chips-trusted-5g-draft-document-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>HANOI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The European Union and Vietnam want to boost trade and investment in critical minerals, semiconductors and infrastructure, according to a draft joint statement seen by Reuters that is set to be adopted on Thursday as the two sides upgrade diplomatic relations.

The eight-page document, still subject to change, says the EU will also explore the possible transfer of defence technology to Hanoi, as both sides seek closer cooperation on "trusted" telecom networks - at a time when Chinese companies have won contracts in Vietnam's 5G development.

The statement is scheduled to be signed when the European Council President Antonio Costa meets Vietnam's leaders in Hanoi on Thursday, days after the ruling Communist Party reappointed To Lam as the country's top leader.

The two countries will upgrade diplomatic ties to Vietnam's highest level, similar to the United States, China and Russia. An EU-Vietnam free trade agreement entered into force in 2020.

While not binding, the document carries political weight and includes indirect criticism of the international strategies of the United States, China and Russia.

The European Council declined to comment on the draft document and Vietnam's government did not respond to a request for comment.

Vietnam has significant but largely untapped deposits of rare earths and gallium. Hanoi has signalled interest in developing processing capacity for rare earths, whose global supply and refining is dominated by China. But progress has been limited, in part because Vietnam lacks the technology to fully exploit its resources.

The EU and Vietnam want to promote "trade and investment in goods, services, and technologies that support sustainable mining and processing" for critical minerals, as they eye closer cooperation in the sector, the document said.

Vietnam is also a key supplier of tungsten, a hard metal used in defence and electronics, and Western diplomats have warned of the risk of Chinese interest in a major mine in Vietnam. China's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

The draft statement identifies semiconductors as another priority area for deeper cooperation, including supply chains.

Vietnam is a major player in chip packaging, testing and assembling, hosting operations by Intel (INTC.O) , opens new tab and Amkor Technology (AMKR.O) , opens new tab among others. Earlier this month Vietnam began building its first semiconductor production facility.

Suppliers of ASML (ASML.AS) , opens new tab , the Dutch global leader in chipmaking machines, have moved some production to Vietnam, and the company is exploring expanding its supply chain and supplying potential customers there, the Vietnamese government said earlier this month after a high-level meeting in Hanoi. ASML was not immediately available for comment.

Expanding cooperation on "trusted communications infrastructure" is also a priority, said the document, citing 5G and satellite connectivity. European firms Ericsson (ERICb.ST) , opens new tab and Nokia (NOKIA.HE) , opens new tab are developing Vietnam's 5G network, but last year Hanoi awarded smaller construction contracts to Chinese companies, including Huawei, despite Western concerns about security.

Both sides intend to boost security cooperation, while the EU will consider the transfer of "non-sensitive technology and know-how", the document said.

EU nations are also interested in investing in Vietnamese infrastructure, including railways, according to the document, as Vietnam wants to build a nationwide high-speed network, its largest-ever project.

EU President Costa warned of "coercive trade practices" and "challenges to sovereignty and international law" in an opinion piece published by Vietnam's state news agency on Wednesday.

The draft statement reaffirmed support for a "rules-based international order" and for strengthening the World Trade Organization, at a time when the U.S. imposes tariffs and undermines multilateral bodies.

It urged respect for "territorial integrity" and called for a "just and sustainable peace in Ukraine", which is under attack from Russia, a long-time close partner of Vietnam. It also said the two countries agreed to consider deeper maritime security cooperation, as they called for stability in the South China Sea, where China's territorial claims conflict with Vietnam's.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:29:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/5C34JBJJH5PPFM47TV3YIUV7SE.jpg?auth=d5d7253068f003046e76082124e46e14ca7d2c10aeb4935b57bb095f391f7d9b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian drones damage port infrastructure, hurt three in Ukraine's Odesa, governor says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-drones-damage-port-infrastructure-hurt-three-ukraines-odesa-governor-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - Russian drones damaged port infrastructure in Ukraine's southern region of Odesa, on the Black Sea coast, the regional governor said on Wednesday.

The White House is also evaluating whether the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents who gunned down a nurse failed to follow "clear guidance" to "create a physical barrier between the arrest teams and the disruptors", deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told AFP.

"We are evaluating why the CBP team may not have been following that protocol," Miller said in a statement.

At the town hall Tuesday night, Omar had just spoken about the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and demanded that Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem "resign or face impeachment," when a man sprang up from the front row, made a remark and sprayed the lawmaker, as security leapt to grab him.

Omar raised a fist and stepped toward the attacker before returning to the podium to say: "Here's the reality that people like this ugly man don't understand: We are Minnesota strong. And we will stay resilient in the face of whatever they might throw on us."

Omar is a frequent target of President Donald Trump – who continues to defend Noem despite her oversight of federal immigration agents who shot and killed two US citizens this month, saying Noem would not step down and was doing a "very good job".

But after days of protests following 37-year-old Alex Pretti's death , Trump told Fox News "we're going to de-escalate a little bit", while adding that it was not a "pullback".

Trump also admitted that Gregory Bovino, a hardline Border Patrol commander who is now expected to leave Minneapolis , was "a pretty out-there kind of a guy" whose presence may not have helped the situation, and sent top US border security official Tom Homan to meet with officials in the city.

Trump told reporters that he rejected the "assassin" label used by a top aide to describe the 37-year-old nurse, adding that he wants "a very honorable and honest investigation".

But he criticized Pretti for carrying the licensed firearm that was taken off him before he was shot.

"I don't like that he had a gun, I don't like that he had two fully loaded magazines," the president said.

After meeting with Homan Tuesday, Mayor Jacob Frey said in a statement they discussed the "serious negative impacts this operation has had on Minneapolis," and the city "will not enforce federal immigration laws."

Just weeks after federal immigration agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good in Minneapolis, Pretti's death sparked national outrage and added to a litany of complaints of abusive tactics.

Good, a mother of three, was shot by an agent at point blank range in her car on January 7.

The killings capped months of escalating violence in which masked, unidentified, and heavily armed ICE and border patrol agents have grabbed people they accuse of violations off the streets.

Despite multiple videos showing that Pretti posed no threat, Bovino and Noem initially claimed Pretti had intent to kill federal agents, calling him a "domestic terrorist."

Republican Senator Rand Paul said Tuesday that agents involved in the shooting should be put on administrative leave, later adding that the immigration enforcement leaders would testify before the Congress next month.

Centrist Democratic Senator John Fetterman said "grossly incompetent" Noem should be fired.

The turmoil could even result in a fresh US government shutdown, with Democrats calling for broad reforms to federal immigration operations at DHS and threatening to block approval of it funding, as part of the spending bills that go up for votes in the Senate later this week.

The judicial branch also pushed back on Trump's actions in Minneapolis Tuesday, when a US judge blocked the deportation of a five-year-old boy and his father who were detained last week in another incident that went viral.

Liam Conejo Ramos – wearing a fluffy blue hat and his school backpack – was photographed being detained by a federal agent, who school officials said was using the preschool student as "bait" to draw out his family, who are asylum seekers from Ecuador .

At a protest at the Minnesota State Capitol Tuesday, veteran Brian Furgen, 55, told AFP that Americans need immigration and customs enforcement agents who "know how to do the job without harming the community, without killing people, without hurting people, without imprisoning people that are law abiding."

"That's what they are doing here, that's ridiculous."</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 07:29:58 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/68abab3e-fc04-11f0-a5e4-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/4bde21b7aa4389804d7e8a26fb7000aa4bf77f13.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Fire hits luxury hotel in French Alps, scores evacuated</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/fire-hits-luxury-hotel-french-alps-scores-evacuated-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Scores of people were evacuated after a fire swept through a five-star hotel in the ski resort of Courchevel in the French Alps late on Tuesday, officials said.

No one was injured in the blaze which started in the attic of the Hotel des Grandes Alpes at around 7 p.m. (1800 GMT), the Prefecture of Savoie region said on its website.

Officials said over 90 people were evacuated from the hotel last night, while the nearby Hotel Le Lana, which has nearly 200 guests, was also being evacuated on Wednesday morning due to risk as the fire was still ongoing. Staff and guests took refuge in other hotels, the local government said.

131 firefighters have been deployed, it said.

While Trump's policies have strained ties with traditional U.S. allies, China has turned its focus to fostering ties with key partners, including Canada and India, analysts say.

As a result, the world's second-largest economy's trade surplus hit a record $1.2 trillion in 2025, monthly forex inflows touched $100 billion, the largest ever, and the global usage of China's currency, the yuan, has expanded.

When British Prime Minister Keir Starmer lands in China on Wednesday evening hoping to reinvigorate recently strained business ties, analysts and experts say Beijing is expected to further expand its global political and economic influence.

Backed by its $20 trillion economy and $45 trillion worth of stock and bond markets, China is emerging as a "steady partner" for many countries, said Aleksandar Tomic, economics professor at Boston College.

"I think China has done a good job and rightly so to position itself as the reliable and stable trade partner," said Derrick Irwin, co-head of intrinsic emerging markets equity at Allspring Global Investments.

"They basically said, look, you've got a massive trade partner in the U.S. that's become a little more uncertain. We can offer predictability and certainty. And I think that's very fair."

Starmer's four-day visit to China will be the first by a British prime minister since 2018 and follows that of Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney earlier this month, the first Canadian prime minister to visit Beijing since 2017.

During Carney's visit the two nations signed an economic deal to tear down trade barriers and forge a new strategic relationship. Carney described China as "a more predictable and reliable partner".

But China is not alone in eyeing new trade pacts to de-risk from the United States. India and the European Union struck a long‑delayed trade deal on Tuesday that will slash tariffs on most goods, boosting two‑way trade to potentially double European exports to the South Asian country by 2032.

While the world's two largest economies have been locked in geopolitical disputes for the past few years, Trump's return to the White House in January 2025 sharply escalated tensions on multiple fronts, including trade and technology.

Trump raised tariffs on China to over 100% in April, before partially reversing and settling for a temporary truce, while Beijing boosted its exports to non-US markets and rolled out support measures for its private enterprises and markets.

Chinese shipments to the U.S. fell 20% in 2025, but rose 25.8% to Africa, 7.4% to Latin America, 13.4% to Southeast Asia and 8.4% to the European Union last year.

"Many countries previously have not been China-friendly are now kind of pivoting to China ... because the United States is becoming a lot less predictable," Tomic said. "The more the U.S. gets difficult to deal with, the more it opens up for China."

Despite the trade tensions with the U.S., China's economy, under deflationary pressure at home due to weak domestic consumption and a long-term property sector slump, has met the government's target of 5% growth in 2025.

In recent months China has taken a raft of measures to boost foreign investment, including pilot programmes in Beijing, Shanghai and other regions to expand , opens new tab market access in services such as telecoms, healthcare and education.

The country recorded the largest-ever monthly forex inflows of $100.1 billion in December, according to bank settlement data from its forex regulator. Its official forex reserves hit a 10-year high of $3.36 trillion.

Its financial market has emerged robust from trade disputes with the Shanghai index climbing 27% over the past year, outperforming U.S. equities, the market turnover hitting a record high and the yuan expanding its global usage.

With the dollar becoming less appealing to investors due to Trump's erratic approach to trade and international diplomacy, Beijing is also pushing ahead with its ambition to bolster the global usage of yuan, said bankers with knowledge of the matter.

Some of the big global banks are scrambling to boost yuan liquidity in offshore hubs and put in place frameworks for faster payment settlements in yuan in trade corridors of China and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, they added.

"We have seen quite a few cycles of China trying to internationalise yuan and then pulling back," said a banker at a global bank with China presence. "This time it's different ... Trump policies are very conducive for boosting yuan usage."

More than half of China's cross-border transactions are now settled in yuan, from almost none 15 years ago, while nearly half of China's overseas bank lending is now in renminbi, according to the latest data from the PBOC and SAFE.

But some foreign policy analysts caution against China's new, friendlier economic and political playbook.

Despite the new trade pacts, Patricia Kim, a foreign policy fellow at Washington-based Brookings Institution, said distrust of the U.S. does not translate into trust in Beijing for U.S. allies and partners.

"Many of these countries harbour deep concerns about China's approach to trade, its use of economic coercion, and unresolved maritime and historical disputes," Kim said.

"In the current moment, China may appear more restrained or pragmatic when compared with the Trump administration's extreme rhetoric and actions. But Beijing's actual behaviour has not been especially reassuring."</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 08:33:43 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/MSPYQIX35ZJGDPLHBD55WBRDOI.jpg?auth=ab4c8da757543fb784acdeea8a69a2ac9d492c72ae53db5e35c515499dc8f838&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Record-breaking Australia heatwave fuels bushfires, cuts power to thousands</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/record-breaking-australia-heatwave-fuels-bushfires-cuts-power-thousands-2026-01-28/</link><description>SYDNEY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A record-breaking heatwave baked Australia's southeast for a fifth straight day on Wednesday, fanning bushfires and straining the power grid, leaving thousands of properties without electricity.

The heatwave is the worst seen in Victoria, Australia's second-most populous state, since the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires that killed 173 people and is not expected to ease until the weekend, authorities said.

"We are now into day five of the severe to intense heatwave here in Victoria and we are starting to see some of those impacts," said Victorian Emergency Management Commissioner Tim Wiebusch.

"An extreme heat warning is still in place, and we are expecting to see eight consecutive days of severe to extreme intensity heatwave."

David Crock, a forecaster from Australia's Bureau of Meteorology, said the heat was being driven by climate change and called the temperatures "very unusual".

"The severity of this heatwave is comparable to the heatwave in January 2009, and also the heatwave in January 1939," Crock said.

"The data shows a long-term increase in heatwave frequency and intensity, particularly since the year 2000 due to climate change."

Crock said a host of temperature records had been broken in Victoria on Tuesday. "About 20 stations, mostly across western Victoria saw either all-time records or January records fall," he said.

Towns in the Mallee region reached a high of 48.9 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit), the hottest temperature ever recorded in the state.

The conditions in Victoria had eased slightly on Wednesday, while the upper western region of the state of New South Wales and south-western Queensland state recorded temperatures above 48 C (118 F) by the late afternoon.

Around 11,000 properties were without power in Victoria, down from 105,000 a day earlier. Firefighters were also battling six major fires, with three out of control.

A blaze at Carlisle River in the Otways region has burnt more than 11,000 hectares (27,181 acres) and destroyed at least 16 buildings.

"This fire at Carlisle River is a long way from over," said Chris Hardman, the chief fire officer of Forest Fire Management Victoria.

"We are early in the summer. We'll see the heating of the environment and winds come again well before that fire is fully contained."

Many communities in the state are still recovering from large bushfires at the start of the month, also triggered by a severe heatwave. More than 400 homes and 400,000 hectares of land have been lost so far.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 08:33:51 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/CPVEWZJN3JO4JCWOGCJWQT6KH4.jpg?auth=d064b3800463650245864564f731688ce23a0ac83b6f2c4b7b1cc9e7f4dc8e09&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Britain's Starmer spoke to Ukraine's Zelenskiy Tuesday afternoon</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/britains-starmer-spoke-ukraines-zelenskiy-tuesday-afternoon-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Keir Starmer spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy Tuesday afternoon, a Downing Street spokesperson said in a statement.

Albanese, on his first visit as leader to Australia's northern neighbour, struck a new partnership agreement with Gusmao on Wednesday covering deeper defence ties between the two nations, border security and economic development.

The visit comes as the tiny Catholic nation, which is being courted by China, continues its push to build a liquefied natural gas plant on its south coast instead of piping the gas to a plant in the Australian city of Darwin.

After decades of delays, Australia's Woodside Energy (WDS.AX) , opens new tab and East Timor agreed in December to study a 5 million metric ton project for the Greater Sunrise fields, an area containing an estimated 5.1 trillion cubic feet of gas that Australia has been discussing, initially with Indonesia, since the 1980s.

A joint statement from the two leaders, distributed by Australia, said the two countries "share an ambition for Greater Sunrise to be developed as soon as possible for the benefit of both states."

Australia said it will establish an infrastructure fund in East Timor, allocating 10% of total state revenue from the project, "funded entirely from Australia’s share of future revenue."

"This commitment will see at least a third of Australia’s revenue from the project being provided to Timor-Leste via the Infrastructure Fund," the statement said.

The statement noted East Timor's preference for the onshore processing of gas.

"Australia will support any commercially viable solution to develop Greater Sunrise proposed by the Sunrise Joint Venture consistent with the Maritime Boundary Treaty," the statement said.

The national oil company Timor Gap owns more than 56% of the field, located about 140 km (87 miles) south of East Timor and more than 400 km from Darwin.

The governments will accelerate negotiations for the project and they urged the Sunrise Joint Venture to present a development concept as soon as possible, the statement said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 08:34:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LURQF3VZYVLXPNU6XK75KYUAJM.jpg?auth=3dca36a16a6fd7a2774454c14104cb4fc7184544e6b7ddf758442679a10ea541&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Montenegro could face fuel shortages due to truckers blockade</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/montenegro-could-face-fuel-shortages-due-truckers-blockade-2026-01-28/</link><description>BELGRADE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Montenegro could face fuel shortages due to region-wide protests and a blockade of the Adriatic port of Bar by truck drivers over restrictive EU entry rules that have left them facing deportation for exceeding Schengen visit limits.

The port of Bar is the biggest entry point for overseas fuel imports into Montenegro, which has no oil refining capacity of its own. It also houses the country's largest fuel depots.

Blockades of border crossings in Serbia, Bosnia, Montenegro and North Macedonia that began on Monday have halted transport along a critical road corridor linking the EU with Turkey and the Middle East.

In a statement late on Tuesday, the Montenegrin Energy Ministry said it asked oil companies for information on stocks, and on the estimated period during which regular fuel supplies could be maintained.

It said current supplies had effectively been reduced to the fuel available at petrol stations, which would allow the market to operate for only a few more days.

The ministry also urged people to avoid purchasing excessive quantities of fuel at petrol stations.

Montenegrin police said earlier the truckers have a permit to protest until midday on Thursday.

The truckers are demanding an extension of the allowed stay in the Schengen free travel area, saying that with the large volumes of freight they transport, they reach the visit limit quickly.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:35:23 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Israel to hold funeral for last hostage recovered from Gaza</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-hold-funeral-last-hostage-recovered-gaza-2026-01-28/</link><description>MEITAR, Israel, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The remains of the last Israeli captive recovered from the Gaza Strip were set to be buried on Wednesday in a funeral that will help Israel turn the page after one of the most tramautising periods in its history.

Ran Gvili, an off-duty police officer, was killed fighting militants during the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. He was then seized and taken back into Gaza by the Islamic Jihad militant group, Israeli officials say.

Gvili was among about 250 people abducted during the attack, which killed around 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and set off the war in Gaza in which Palestinians health authorities say Israel kill more than 71,000 Palestinians.

Many of the hostages were released during two short ceasefires, but dozens died in captivity. Under the terms of an October deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Hamas and other groups agreed to return the remaining hostages, alive or dead, in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners.

Gvili, who was the last to be released, will be buried in his hometown of Meitar in southern Israel. His casket will be driven there in a procession beginning in Camp Shura, a facility where Israel has identified victims of the October 2023 attack.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Isaac Herzog were expected to deliver eulogies at the funeral, expected to began at 10:30 a.m. (0830 GMT)

The return of the last hostage and his burial will mark a moment of national healing for Israelis. The Hamas attack, the bloodiest killing of Jews since the Holocaust, was widely seen as the most traumatic event in the country's history.

It also completes a core aspect of the initial phase of Trump's plan to end the war. The second stage, which Washington announced had started earlier this month, includes the reopening of Gaza's Rafah border with Egypt.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:36:49 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/75BNR334GJNZ3BWSCUCTQLQS2A.jpg?auth=78fdb7deedc05fb3a6f90f3763bb84f8b256bbee7cefad82e2177f0806ed8440&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey urges US to resolve Iran disputes one by one, says Iran ready for nuclear talks</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/turkey-urges-us-resolve-iran-disputes-one-by-one-says-iran-ready-nuclear-talks-2026-01-28/</link><description>ANKARA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkey's foreign minister on Wednesday urged the U.S. to resolve its disputes with Iran "one by one" instead of through a sweeping deal, saying this would avoid humiliating Iranian officials, and added that Tehran was ready for talks on its nuclear programme.

U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that Washington had an "armada" heading toward Iran but hoped he would not have to use it, as he renewed warnings to Tehran against killing protesters or restarting its nuclear programme.

Tehran brutally cracked down on anti-government protests earlier this month, leading to the death and arrest of thousands of people. Officials blamed the unrest on "armed terrorists and rioters" linked to Iran's foes, the United States and Israel. Rights groups describe the protests as the biggest since the 1979 revolution.

Speaking to Al Jazeera, Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan reiterated that Turkey opposed any foreign intervention or attack on Iran, saying it would be "wrong to start the war again."

"My advice always to the American friends: close the files one by one with Iranians. Start with nuclear, close it, then the other, then the other," Fidan said.

"If you put them as a package all of them, it will be very difficult for our Iranian friends to digest," he said. "It sometimes might seem humiliating for them. It will be very difficult to explain to not only themselves, but also to the leadership."

In June, the United States struck Iran's nuclear facilities amid heightened regional tensions with Israel over the war in Gaza. Talks on Tehran's nuclear programme - which it says is for peaceful purposes - have made little progress.

Turkey, a NATO member that shares a border with Iran, has said it reached out to both U.S. and Iranian officials. Ankara has said Tehran must be allowed to handle its domestic issues on its own, warning that any destabilisation would exceed the region's capacity to manage at this time.

Fidan has also said Israel was still looking to attack Iran.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:37:34 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/XSKIDK3U3BJF3HB6YLZUAPFBLE.jpg?auth=7ab0404c755cbcd9068c77a6d0a0d9bb6f508d2355dfa650db17ca39a31cb0de&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Post-war recovery agreement with US needs more work, Zelenskiy says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/post-war-recovery-agreement-with-us-needs-more-work-zelenskiy-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine has identified areas in an agreement with the United States on post-war recovery that need to be worked through in more depth, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on Wednesday.

The Northern Territory government sold Darwin Port to Chinese company Landbridge for A$506 million in 2015, a move criticised by the United States.

The awarding of the contract came just a few years after the United States posted the first of a rotating group of U.S. Marines in Darwin. The U.S. and Australia are expanding air bases in Australia's north to host U.S. bombers.

Speaking in East Timor on an official visit on Wednesday, Albanese said his government had made it clear it wanted the port returned to Australian ownership .

"We are committed to making sure that that port goes back into Australian hands because that is in our national interest," he said.

The port's owner, Landbridge Australia, did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but said in November the port was in a strong financial position.

China's ambassador in Canberra, Xiao Qian, told reporters at an annual press briefing on Wednesday that Beijing would "take measures to protect the Chinese company's interests" if a sale of the port were forced.

"Should Landbridge be forced to leave that port, I think it might also affect the substantive investment, cooperation and trade between Chinese companies and that part of Australia," the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported Xiao as saying.

It is not the first time Xiao has criticised Albanese's election pledge last year to return the strategically located northern port to local ownership.

"China would like to reiterate that the relevant Chinese enterprise obtained the lease for the Port of Darwin through market means," Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said at a regular news conference in Beijing.

"Their legitimate rights and interests should be fully protected," he added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:38:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HPIWLG73TNPC5FCONECQDICXRE.jpg?auth=85124917808a08323b84d2526124e69cac29233a829c886e2e70c6a2722b8897&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Iran says it did not request negotiations with US</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-says-it-didnt-request-negotiations-with-us-foreign-minister-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>DUBAI, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requesting negotiations, state media reported on Wednesday.

U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday another "armada" is floating toward Iran and that he hopes Tehran would make a deal with Washington.

The U.S. deployed additional military assets in the Gulf following nationwide protests in Iran which led to the country's bloodiest crackdown since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

"There was no contact between me and Witkoff in recent days and no request for negotiations was made from us," Araqchi told state media, adding that various intermediaries were "holding consultations" and were in contact with Tehran.

"Our stance is clear, negotiations don't go along with threats and talks can only take place when there are no longer menaces and excessive demands."

Hamidreza Sabet Esmailpour, who had been convicted of passing information to a Mossad agent, was hanged at dawn, the judiciary's Mizan news agency said.

Rights groups have previously said 12 people have been hanged on similar charges in the wake of Israel's 12-day war with Iran in June.

They have also expressed concern that protesters arrested in the wave of demonstrations this month could also face execution. The judiciary has already indicated some of those arrested could face charges of capital crimes.

Protests erupted in late December sparked by concern over the rising cost of living but turned into a mass movement against the Islamic republic that was followed by a crackdown that has seen at least thousands killed and tens of thousands arrested, according to rights groups.

Mizan said Esmailpour had been convicted of sharing intelligence with Mossad, purchasing equipment with the aim of helping Israel carry out "sabotage operations" at Iranian missile sites and moving vehicles rigged with explosives.

The last execution in Iran on charges of spying for Israel was on January 7 when a man named Ali Ardestani was put to death after being convicted of sharing information with Mossad.

Iran is the world's most prolific executioner after China , according to rights groups. Last year it hanged at least 1,500 people, according to figures from NGO Iran Human Rights.

Since the war, Iran has promised swift trials for those arrested on suspicion of collaborating with Israel.

Iran, which does not recognise Israel, has long accused its foe of conducting sabotage operations against its nuclear facilities and assassinating its scientists.

But the June war exposed Israel's deep intelligence penetration of Iran, with several key Iranian military and security figures killed in targeted strikes based on intelligence over their whereabouts.

However, rights groups have long expressed concern that innocent people are executed on the basis of confessions obtained under torture , while Israeli agents carrying out the fieldwork remain undetected.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:44:01 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/8852467a-fc20-11f0-b5fb-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-24T070503Z-1523816638-RC2J7JART8LJ-RTRMADP-3-IRAN-TRUMP-USA-MILITARY.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>South Korea court sentences ex-first lady to 20 months in prison for corruption</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-south-korea-ex-first-lady-sentenced-20-months-prison-corruption</link><description>The wife of South Korea’s ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol was sentenced to 20 months in prison for corruption Wednesday, as her husband awaits a verdict on high-stakes rebellion charges that could result in the death penalty or life imprisonment .

The presidential couple suffered a spectacular fall from grace after Yoon’s martial law debacle in December 2024 led to his impeachment and eventually his removal from office.

They have been jailed separately for months prior to facing criminal trials, Yoon over his martial law imposition in December 2024 and other allegations and Kim over corruption charges. Investigators say Kim wasn’t involved in Yoon's martial law enforcement.

On Wednesday, Seoul Central District Court sentenced Kim for receiving luxury gifts like a Graff diamond necklace and a Chanel bag from the Unification Church in return for promises of business favours.

“Staying close to a president, a first lady can exert significant influence on him and is a symbolic figure who represents the country together with a president,” the court said in a live broadcast of the verdict. “But the defendant exploited her position to seek personal gains.”

The ruling was still a surprise after independent counsel Min Joong-ki called for a 15-year prison term for Kim on the charges involving bribery, stock price manipulation and political funding law violations. The court acquitted Kim of charges of stock price manipulation and political funding law violations, citing a lack of evidence and other reasons.

Min's team responded that it cannot accept the ruling and will appeal to a higher court. The governing liberal Democratic Party, which led Yoon's ouster, slammed the verdict as sending a wrong signal that “abuse of power like Kim Keon Hee's can be tolerated”.

Kim’s defence team thanked the court for its verdict but said the 20-month prison term for her bribery charges was “relatively high”. Lawyer Choi Ji-woo said Min's investigation was politically driven and his team will discuss whether to appeal.

Kim has been in jail since August when the Seoul court approved a warrant to arrest her, citing the chance she might destroy evidence.

Days before her arrest, Kim apologised for causing public concern but still hinted that she would deny the allegations against her, portraying herself as “someone insignificant”.

The ruling against Kim was made about three weeks before the court delivers its verdict on a rebellion charge against Yoon for imposing martial law briefly in December 2024.

Cho Eun-suk, another independent counsel, has demanded the death sentence for Yoon.

When Yoon was in office, Kim was embroiled in a slew of scandals that severely hurt Yoon’s approval rating and provided relentless political ammunition to his rivals. The scandals included the three charges the court dealt with Wednesday.

Many observers speculated Yoon opted to place the country under a military rule to protect his wife from possible investigations. But after a six-month probe into Yoon’s decree that wrapped up in December, independent counsel Cho's team downplayed conjecture that Kim’s troubles drove Yoon to declare martial law.

Yoon plotted for over a year to declare martial law so he could eliminate his political opponents and monopolise power and there was also no evidence of Kim's involvement, Cho’s team said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 09:44:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7be40baa-fc1e-11f0-849a-005056bfb2b6/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028052283427.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump says 'we'll work something out with South Korea' after tariff threat</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-says-well-work-something-out-with-south-korea-after-tariff-threat-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON/SEOUL, Jan 28 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday the United States ​and South Korea would work out a solution, in response to a query about his surprise threat a day ‌earlier to step up tariffs to 25% on imports from the Asian ally.

The news rattled officials in Seoul who said Trump caught them by surprise with a social media post on Monday vowing higher duties on autos and other goods because South Korea had not lived up to its part in the trade deal struck last year.

As he left the White House to give a speech in Iowa, Trump told reporters, "We'll work something out with South ‌Korea." But he did not elaborate.

Trump's chief trade negotiator, Jamieson Greer, said the U.S. had cut to 15% ​its tariff rate on South Korean goods from 25%, in exchange for Seoul's pledge to invest $350 billion in the United States, allow more U.S. cars into South Korea, and eliminate some non-tariff barriers.

"But, in the meantime, they haven't been able to get a bill through to ‍do the investment ," Greer said on Fox Business Network, adding that the export-heavy economy had not met commitments on agriculture, industry and digital services.

Greer said the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea, which had ballooned to $65 billion during the Biden administration, was "not sustainable and it has to change."

South Korea's parliament is not expected to hold ⁠a plenary session until February to vote on bills.

Five bills that would enact the U.S. investment are pending and ruling Democratic Party members ‍have expressed hope to approve them in February.

The United States has also expressed concern that a South Korean law passed last year tightening oversight of digital ‌services ‌and proposed legislation to regulate online platforms could discriminate against U.S. companies.

A source familiar with internal discussions between the countries has said Trump may have been prompted by recent Korean regulatory actions against Coupang (CPNG.N) , opens new tab , a U.S.-listed company that has said the moves are unfair and discriminatory .

On Wednesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said Seoul reached out to the U.S. State Department after Trump's vow to raise tariffs, adding, "It is our conclusion ⁠there is no direct link to ⁠Coupang or the (proposed) online platform ​law."

South Korea's policy chief Kim Yong-beom said he hopes parliament will approve bills required to kickstart the investment in February, although outflows could take monthsto begin.

"If we are asked to review a specific (investment project), we can look at what it is," Kim said.

"But conducting a proper review requires some serious manpower and ‍budget, meaning we cannot deep dive on those reviews unless relevant law exists."

Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol told Reuters this month that South Korea plans to adopt the investment package as soon as possible, while warning it could be affected by uncertainty over a U.S. Supreme Court ruling expected soon on Trump's tariffs.

But he highlighted prospects ​for the timeline to be stretched with remarks that the planned investment of $350 billion ‍was unlikely to kick off in the first half of 2026, against a backdrop of weakness in the won currency.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:30:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LOFRHYRBGVLJFDNEJVV65EI6M4.jpg?auth=8785324ad13b5699ae2cf3c85b8abd4f9624546438fef3df866f31bee1655282&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Pope Leo appeals against rising anti-Semitism in weekly audience</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/pope-leo-appeals-against-rising-anti-semitism-weekly-audience-2026-01-28/</link><description>VATICAN CITY, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Pope Leo appealed against the global rise of anti-Semitism on Wednesday, marking the annual commemoration of the Holocaust during his weekly audience at the Vatican with a prayer for a world without prejudice or racism.

Various people were questioned, the Office of the Attorney General, or OAG, said in a statement, adding that the probes relate to suspected electoral fraud involving about 30,000 signatures flagged as suspicious since 2022.

The signatures were gathered for around 20 so-called popular initiatives, the OAG said.

Such national initiatives, if backed by 100,000 valid signatures within 18 months, are put to public votes under Switzerland's system of direct democracy.

Prosecutors did not say what changes to the Swiss constitution the 20 initiatives were about.

The OAG said investigation are complicated by the fact that signature collectors are not legally required to identify themselves and are often young people living abroad.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:31:45 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French senator found guilty of drugging lawmaker to assault her</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-french-senator-found-guilty-drugging-lawmaker-assault-her-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A former French senator was found guilty by a Paris court late on Tuesday of having spiked a lawmaker's drink with ecstasy with the intention of sexually assaulting her.

The court, in its ruling, rejected the defence's argument that Joel Guerriau, 68, may have "inadvertently" administered lawmaker Sandrine Josso with "a substance liable to alter her discernment or control over her actions, in order to commit rape or sexual aggression".

Guerriau, who resigned as a senator over the case in October 2025, was also found guilty of possession and use of ecstasy.

The case has resonated in France following the 2024 conviction of Dominique Pelicot , who was found guilty of repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, Gisele, and inviting dozens of strangers to assault her while she was unconscious.

The Pelicot trial attracted headlines worldwide and raised awareness about drug-facilitated assaults .

Because of "the particular gravity of the offences committed and the high dose of ecstasy administered to Sandrine Josso without her knowledge", the court sentenced Guerriau to four years in prison, with two-and-a-half suspended, with a deferred detention order - meaning he will not go to jail as he appeals the ruling.

One of his lawyers said Guerriau intended to appeal. "The debate will resume in front of the appeals court, notably on the intention of assaulting, which my client completely contests," Henri Carpentier told Reuters.

Josso had told investigators she felt unwell after drinking a few sips from a glass of champagne offered to her by Guerriau at his apartment to celebrate an electoral win.

She said the champagne did not taste normal and that if she had not managed to leave the flat she was certain Guerriau would have assaulted her.

In its ruling, the court said that the intention to commit a rape or a sexual assault could be inferred from several elements, including Guerriau's insistence that Josso drink the ecstasy-spiked drink, his unusual and inappropriate behaviour, and browser searches on drugs and their effects in the context of sexual assault.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:58:03 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ZDFEK5NLGJJR5LBQTAV2JBWVSY.jpg?auth=bafc58523a0312de61a3e24adced0dc00a8d78c54e732fafe0ef65e9961d29ac&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US singer Chris Brown in UK court ahead of October assault trial</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/us-singer-chris-brown-uk-court-ahead-october-assault-trial-2026-01-28/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. singer Chris Brown appeared in a London court on Wednesday for a brief hearing ahead of his trial later this year on charges of attacking a music producer in a London nightclub.

Brown last year denied attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm, and also a less serious charge of assault causing actual bodily harm, over what prosecutors say was an "unprovoked attack" with a bottle in 2023.

The 36-year-old attended London's Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday and spoke only to confirm his name.

Brown entered the dock and shook hands with his co-defendant Omololu Akinlolu, 39, who has also denied the charges against him. Around a dozen supporters sat in the public gallery behind them and waved as he left the dock.

The pair's trial is due to begin in October. They were both granted bail ahead of a further preliminary hearing in April.

Brown, a two-time Grammy Award winner known for hits such as "Loyal", "Run It" and "Under the Influence", was granted bail in May after paying 5 million pounds ($6.89 million) in order to begin his "Breezy Bowl XX" tour, which ended in October.

The R&amp;B star was arrested at a hotel in Manchester, northern England last year after returning to Britain for the first time since the incident.

In his latest direct intervention in another country’s politics, Trump on Tuesday warned Iraq that if it picked the Iranian-backed Maliki as its prime minister again Washington would no longer help the major oil producer and close U.S. ally.

"Last time Maliki was in power, the Country descended into poverty and total chaos. That should not be allowed to happen again," Trump wrote, citing what he called Maliki's "insane policies and ideologies".

Trump's comments are the starkest example yet of his campaign to curb the influence of Iran-linked groups in Iraq, which has long walked a tightrope between its two closest allies, Washington and Tehran.

They came after Iraq's main alliance of Shi'ite political blocs, which holds a majority in parliament, picked Maliki -- Iraq's first elected prime minister after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003 -- as its nominee for the post following an election .

That came as a surprise for many Iraqis who have accused Maliki of pursuing sectarian policies favouring majority Shi'ites, and of driving Sunnis into the arms of ultra-violent Islamic State militants who seized a third of Iraq as security forces crumbled.

A senior figure in the Shi'ite Islamist Dawa Party, Maliki previously served two terms as prime minister from 2006 to 2014, a period marked by sectarian violence, a power struggle with Sunni and Kurdish rivals, growing tensions with the U.S., and poor public services and graft.

Maliki was pressured to step down in 2014 by an unusually broad array of critics -- the U.S., Iran, Sunni leaders and Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric -- after Islamic State's rapid territorial gains.

In 2015, an Iraqi parliamentary panel called for Maliki and dozens of other top officials to stand trial over the fall of the northern city of Mosul to IS.

But Maliki, who is in his mid-70s, remained an influential political player, leading the State of Law coalition and maintaining close ties with powerful Iran-backed factions.

He used shrewd political skills to quietly build influence through ties to armed militias, the security services and the judiciary, analysts say.

Maliki was born in 1950 in Janaja, a southern village among date groves on the Euphrates, into a politically engaged family - his grandfather wrote poetry inciting rebellion against Iraq’s British occupiers and his father was a fervent Arab nationalist.

He was briefly arrested in 1979 and then fled, narrowly escaping Saddam’s police. His family’s land was seized and dozens of his relatives were killed over the next decade. He did not see his home village again until after the U.S.-led invasion.

His political roots stretch back decades, shaped by opposition to Saddam’s authoritarian rule and a long exile that forged his ideological convictions.

Sentenced to death under Saddam for his role in the outlawed Dawa, Maliki spent nearly 25 years in exile, mostly in Syria and Iran, agitating for the dictator’s downfall. Like many exiles, he came back to Iraq after Saddam’s fall — the end of a Sunni-led regime that had long oppressed Shi'ites, and Kurds.

Little-known in Iraq before his return, Maliki was a compromise pick to lead a wobbly coalition government in 2006.

Months after becoming prime minister, Maliki signed Saddam's execution order in red ink, allowing masked gunmen to hang him. He had fulfilled his lifelong goal of wresting power from the country’s Sunnis, but his drive to entrench Shi’ite dominance would later prove his downfall.

Initially seen as a Shi'ite Islamist, Maliki's willingness to put aside sectarianism and quell violence was called into question in a leaked U.S. government memo.

"Despite Maliki's reassuring words, repeated reports from our commanders on the ground contributed to our concerns about Maliki's government," National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley wrote to President George W. Bush in the memo.

He went on to list problems including non-delivery of services to Sunni areas and the removal of Iraq's most effective commanders on a sectarian basis.

Sunni leaders blamed the dour Maliki for not reining in Shi’ite militias and focusing instead on restless Sunni provinces such as Anbar in western Iraq.

Maliki threw down the gauntlet with stunning speed in 2011 when his Shi’ite-led government demanded the arrest of a Sunni Muslim vice president -- seemingly moments after the departure of U.S. troops in December that year.

To detractors, the move called into question Maliki’s commitment to any sort of democracy.

Maliki denied having a sectarian outlook.

"I am not fighting in Anbar because they are Sunnis, as I have also fought Shi’ite militias. Al Qaeda and militias are one - they both kill people and blow them up," he told Reuters in 2014.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 10:58:46 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/P5LTGA7R3FMYXIT4IJOOFUDTHM.jpg?auth=bff1b54af73c9f8696813aaca094832e628aca0870d73329dd8a1e488432cd59&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Budget slashed for Indonesia's rescue agency despite disaster surge</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/budget-slashed-indonesias-rescue-agency-despite-disaster-surge-2026-01-28/</link><description>JAKARTA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Indonesia's main rescue agency had its funding cut by a parliamentary panel on Wednesday as part of a plan to divert government expenditure to other programmes, despite concerns over the number of disasters the agency has to deal with.

Ministries and agencies have been ordered to cut budgets to make room for areas that President Prabowo Subianto has prioritised, such as his flagship free meals programmes and higher defence spending.

The parliamentary panel approved a 69.38 billion rupiah ($4.15 million) - or 4.5% - reduction in rescue agency Basarnas' budget from 1.55 trillion rupiah in the initial allocation to 1.48 trillion rupiah, commission head Lasarus said during a meeting.

Indonesia sits on the "Pacific Ring of Fire", an area of high seismic activity atop multiple tectonic plates, making it susceptible to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.

In January alone, the sprawling archipelago was hit by floods and landslides. At least 34 people were killed in landslides in West Java province over the weekend, and the rescue agency is rushing to see if it can rescue 32 others who are missing.

Cyclone-induced floods and landslides on the island of Sumatra late last year killed 1,200 people and displaced over one million residents.

The cuts in the rescue agency's budget were proposed by the Finance Ministry and required approval from the parliamentary panel.

The agency's head Mohammad Syafii, who attended the meeting, accepted the decision but said many improvements were needed to optimise his agency's functions and ability to respond quickly.

For example, he said all regions should have their own local office of the rescue agency given the frequent natural disasters in the country.

There are 514 regions in Indonesia. Currently the agency has 38 offices - one in each province.

The committee acknowledged that a series of natural disasters had struck Indonesia last year and the agency required more funds, but went ahead with the cut anyway.

"The work of Basarnas has been outstanding but their capacity to handle the problems will be limited if the budget is not sufficient," the committee's deputy head Ridwan Bae said.

What was once his most potent campaign issue is now driving unease among voters unsettled by the administration’s aggressive tactics in its immigration crackdown , including the targeting of U.S. citizens and violent measures against peaceful protesters.

Illegal immigration and inflation were the twin issues that helped Trump win the election. Now, opinion polls show a growing number of Americans, including key independent voters, are unhappy with Trump's handling of both, putting Republicans on the defensive ahead of the midterms.

The polling shows most Republicans still back Trump’s push for mass deportations, but a sizeable minority are uneasy with a heavy-handed approach by federal immigration agents, which led to the shooting deaths of a mother of three and a nurse in Minneapolis this month.

Just 39% of Americans approve of Trump's handling of immigration, the lowest since his inauguration, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Monday. While 84% of Republican respondents said they support Trump on the issue, a fifth of them said federal agents had gone "too far" in their crackdown.

If those sentiments persist, they could spell trouble for Republicans in November, when Democrats are aiming to take control of Congress and block the president's agenda.

"This was one of the president's number one advantages and it has become a political liability for him," said John Feehery, a Republican strategist. "The base is still pretty comfortable with what Trump is doing. But it's not just about the base, it's about swing voters."

White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson defended the administration's approach to immigration.

"President Trump wants all Americans to feel safe in their communities. That guiding principle is why the President has promised to remove dangerous criminal illegal aliens from our country, urged local Democrat leaders to work with federal law enforcement, and called for a fact-based investigation into the tragic death of Mr. Pretti," she said in a statement.

Dubbed Operation Metro Surge, the December deployment of nearly 3,000 federal immigration agents to Minneapolis and St. Paul provoked a national uproar with the fatal shootings of Renee Good on January 7 and then Alex Pretti on January 24. Both were killed during confrontations with immigration agents at protests.

Trump has taken steps in recent days to ease tensions in Minneapolis, dispatching his border czar to oversee the operation and signaling a willingness to work with state officials.

It remains unclear whether these moves reflect a recognition of the political risks to Republicans in November midterms, or are simply an effort to regain control of an operation that has produced daily images of masked federal agents responding aggressively to protesters confronting them in the streets.

Trump spent the weekend huddling with senior advisers about how to recalibrate his immigration strategy, according to a White House official and a source familiar with the talks. The discussions included a possible reduction of agents deployed to Minnesota and narrowing the focus there to deportations rather than broad enforcement operations, the sources said.

Some Republican strategists warned that a renewed focus on deporting the “worst of the worst,” as Trump promised during the campaign, was necessary to retain support from moderate Republicans and independents in November.

"Americans support secure borders, and they're willing to forgive mistakes when you're cleaning up the previous administration's fiasco - provided you're seen as targeting criminals," said Giancarlo Sopo, a Republican media strategist who worked on Hispanic outreach for Trump's 2020 campaign.

"The margin for error narrows dramatically if you’re perceived as going after gardeners and taco truck ladies."

Trump's softening of his tone and sidelining of Gregory Bovino - a top Border Patrol official and a lightning rod for opponents of the crackdown - followed days of criticism from a number of Republican lawmakers and governors.

A Republican candidate for Minnesota governor, Chris Madel, made headlines for his decision to quit the race over the tactics being used by federal agents in Minneapolis and what he described as indiscriminate arrests.

Zach Duckworth, a Republican state senator who was recently activated in the Minnesota Army National Guard to support local law enforcement, said he was so alarmed by top Trump officials labeling Pretti a "domestic terrorist" that he wrote to FBI Director Kash Patel , Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and others to object to the characterization.

He told Reuters that was a "tipping point," saying many of his constituents in the Minneapolis suburbs are centrists and support removing violent criminals, but are alarmed by the scope and tactics of Trump’s operations, which have also swept up people in the country legally.

Democratic strategists see opportunity for their party, which polls show is not trusted by most Americans to handle immigration, especially after former President Joe Biden's slow reaction to stem immigrants entering the country illegally.

Michael LaRosa, a former Biden White House official, told Reuters the overwhelming opposition by Democrats to Trump's crackdown would help to drive both progressive and moderate voters to the polls in November.

While an increasing number of traditional, moderate Republicans now oppose Trump's immigration crackdown, Democrats are at risk of misdiagnosing the moment and overplaying their hand, said Scott Rasmussen, a veteran pollster.

"Where the left is making a mistake on this issue is they think they're winning a fight to build support for illegal immigrants," Rasmussen said. "Where the right, especially the MAGA right, is wrong, is they are thinking everybody voted for what's happening in Minneapolis."

In interviews with eight Trump supporters in Delano, a Republican-leaning town just 10 miles (16 km) west of downtown Minneapolis, all said they stood squarely behind the president's immigration crackdown and would vote Republican in the midterms.

But they also acknowledged that immigration agents appeared poorly trained and ill-prepared for the task before them, and expressed worries that widespread criticism of ICE's tactics could hurt Republicans at the ballot box.

Jake Blackowiak, 33, worried the controversy could contribute to the party losing at least one chamber of Congress in the midterms.

"The Republicans aren't going to be able to pass any more laws or advance the agenda he promised," he said.

Former Republican Minnesota congressman Gil Gutknecht urged the White House to clarify its enforcement targets.

"To say that all the people who are being rounded up are violent criminals is an exaggeration," Gutknecht said in an interview. "They're not all murderers and rapists."

He said it was too early to tell whether the deaths in Minnesota would impact the midterms, but the White House should continue its immigration enforcement operation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:28:14 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/ILHTO3MIWFLBVH42QPUIGY4SXA.jpg?auth=731e64944482759727adf2644957392d57f47e85848dd92b1a93dae4e326ddf2&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio to face former US Senate colleagues on Venezuela policy</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/rubio-face-former-us-senate-colleagues-venezuela-policy-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is due to testify in the Senate about President Donald Trump's Venezuela policy on Wednesday, after scrambling to keep his former colleagues from passing a resolution to rein in the administration's war powers.

Rubio, a former Florida senator and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is likely to face a far less friendly reception than he did a year ago, when the Senate approved him unanimously to serve as the nation's top diplomat.

It will be the first time Rubio has publicly faced lawmakers' questions over the January 3 raid to seize Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Two weeks ago, Trump's fellow Republicans narrowly blocked a resolution that would have barred Trump from further military action in Venezuela without Congress' authorization, with Vice President JD Vance forced to break a tie.

Rubio is set to tout the success of the military operation and insist there was no war with Venezuela and no U.S. occupation there, according to prepared remarks submitted to the committee.

"We will closely monitor the performance of the interim authorities as they cooperate with our stage-based plan to restore stability to Venezuela," Rubio said in the remarks. "Make no mistake, as the President has stated, we are prepared to use force to ensure maximum cooperation if other methods fail."

Several members of Congress, some Republicans as well as Democrats, have expressed frustration with the lack of communication from Trump officials about major operations, including the capture of Maduro and the elimination of many foreign aid programs supported by Congress.

Committee Chairman Jim Risch, a Republican senator from Idaho, was expected to praise Rubio for explaining to him the administration's plans for Venezuela, despite "confusion over how it will be done."

"Today is the opportunity to publicly explain the administration’s plan for the future of Venezuela," Risch will say, according to a copy of his opening remarks shared with reporters. "After our lengthy engagements in the Middle East in years past, many Americans are concerned about so-called 'forever wars'. I know this Administration is laser-focused on avoiding these experiences."

The war powers resolution had appeared to be on track to pass the Senate after five Republicans joined Democrats in voting to advance it, in rare Republican opposition to Trump.

But Trump railed at the five, saying they should never again be elected to public office. He and Rubio made repeated calls encouraging senators to change their votes by insisting there were no U.S. troops in Venezuela, and with promises including Rubio's agreement to come before the Senate committee. Two of them, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Todd Young of Indiana, flipped their positions.

The close vote reflected concern in Congress about Trump's foreign policy and growing support for the argument that Congress, not the president, should take back the power to send U.S. troops to war, as spelled out in the Constitution.

Members of Congress, including some of Trump's fellow Republicans, said Rubio had insisted the administration did not plan regime change in Venezuela just days before U.S. troops removed Maduro, and that oil company executives were told about the operation before lawmakers.

Democratic Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, a senior committee member, said he had "maybe 20 questions" he would like to ask on a range of issues, including Venezuela.

Coons said the administration never presented evidence tying alleged drug trafficking to the United States or to justify acting without consulting Congress.

"No evidence was proffered to explain or justify the Article Two urgent national security concern that would justify an action by the president of the United States without timely consultation with Congress, something the secretary from his 15 years of service in the Senate knows full well should have happened," Coons said on a recent call with reporters.

Trump this month said the U.S. will run Venezuela for years, told Iranians protesting against their government that "help is on the way," and threatened military action to take Greenland, a territory of NATO ally Denmark.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:30:28 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/O3E45AITMZM47A2Z5KFU5ENLSA.jpg?auth=9dcac1a0e48efcb4d28c628446608150bc33624a63f5c13fbf00cabfb668e549&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Eastern German region of Saxony-Anhalt elects new state premier</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/eastern-german-region-saxony-anhalt-elects-new-state-premier-2026-01-28/</link><description>BERLIN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The parliament of the eastern German state of Saxony-Anhalt elected Economy Minister Sven Schulze on Wednesday to succeed outgoing premier Reiner Haseloff, who stepped down ahead of elections in September that could see the far-right AfD win control of the state.

Schulze, from Chancellor Friedrich Merz's centre-right Christian Union (CDU), was elected comfortably in the first round of voting, avoiding the need for run-off votes that could have embarrassed the coalition of the CDU, centre-left Social Democrats and the Free Democrats.

Haseloff, 71, had previously announced his intention to step down after 15 years in office to allow his successor time to prepare for the September election, which is expected to test the so-called "firewall" strategy of mainstream German parties that have vowed not to work with the AfD.

Saxony Anhalt, which has lagged many other German regions with a struggling economy and a range of social problems, including a declining population, has seen a surge in support for the AfD, which could win control of a state legislature for the first time in September.

According to an opinion poll published on Tuesday, the AfD stands well ahead of any of the other parties in Saxony-Anhalt with 39% support, followed by the CDU with 26%, the Left Party with 11% and the SPD with 8%.

The small hard-left BSW party, which shares some of the AfD's priorities including restricting immigration and opposition to German support for Ukraine, stood at 6% and may fall under the 5% threshold for entry to parliament, potentially helping the AfD further.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:46:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/IXFDX7NOEJLL5IPX4VXB3YSHNI.jpg?auth=897a6be276cfa8111a6b4d35867e3a6ca04cb3538732e02bdd51e53cf5410c17&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Russian-Uzbek billionaire Usmanov wins lawsuit against German newspaper, documents show</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/russian-uzbek-billionaire-usmanov-wins-lawsuit-against-german-newspaper-2026-01-28/</link><description>MOSCOW, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Russian-Uzbek billionaire Alisher Usmanov has won a legal complaint against German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung over an article it published about him, court documents obtained by Reuters show.

In a ruling dated January 23, a Hamburg court prohibited FAZ from disseminating several statements, including allegations about Usmanov's links to top Russian officials, from an April 2023 article titled "On the Kremlin's instructions".

Usmanov has a net worth of $18.8 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, and is subject to European Union and U.S. sanctions and a travel ban that were imposed after the start of the war in Ukraine .

He has launched multiple lawsuits in Europe with the ultimate goal of having the sanctions lifted. In some, his lawyers contested statements in the media that were used as the grounds for sanctions.

Usmanov's lawyer, Joachim Steinhofel, said in remarks about the Hamburg court's decision that the statements banned from further dissemination "repeated essential parts of the reasoning behind the sanctions against Mr Usmanov."

"This (the court decision) allows for the legally substantiated assessment that the EU sanctions' reasoning is nothing more than an accumulation of defamatory, groundless, and thus illegal allegations," he added.

Last month, Germany agreed with Usmanov to close an investigation into alleged foreign trade law violations, provided that he pay 10 million euros ($11.98 million). In 2024, German prosecutors dropped a money laundering investigation against him.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:46:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/WXXBLI4KFNLOLHOGUV2PACGVNA.jpg?auth=3bfb5fec84ede7dd2692d1eaa16aaf1da8b1dc5cd7e4becc29ffef2de21256b6&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Storm Kristin knocks out power to 800,000 in Portugal and barrels into Spain</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/storm-kristin-knocks-out-power-800000-portugal-barrels-into-spain-2026-01-28/</link><description>LISBON/MADRID, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Storm Kristin left more than 800,000 people across central and northern Portugal without electricity early on Wednesday, toppling trees and utility posts, damaging homes, and disrupting motorway and rail traffic before moving inland to Spain, authorities said.

At least one person died when a tree fell on their car in Vila Franca de Xira, on the outskirts of Lisbon, according to emergency services.

Civil protection authorities reported around 1,500 weather‑related incidents, triggered by wind gusts of up to 150 km/h (93 mph), heavy rain and even snowfall in the country of nearly 11 million people.

Grid operator E-Redes said technical teams were working to reestablish power supplies to some 855,000 clients after their initial efforts were hindered by the severe weather.

The storm then pushed east into Spain, which is still dealing with the impact of a previous system, Storm Joseph. In the coastal town of Torremolinos, strong winds felled a palm tree on Tuesday, killing a woman.

More than 160 roads across Spain were affected by snow on Wednesday, including 27 motorways on the main highway network, such as the A‑6 linking Madrid with the northwest. Snow also blanketed rooftops in parts of central Madrid but caused no major disruptions.

Spain's national weather agency AEMET warned that large areas of the country would face very strong winds, with some gusts reaching hurricane force. Authorities in parts of southern Almeria province issued a red alert due to the intensity of the winds.

Local authorities closed parks, and in some areas outdoor sports and educational activities were suspended.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 11:47:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DW7VJCD2ARNEZFIWS5RC6UYMRQ.jpg?auth=d8644f68255ad6e8b2aae1264e64dc412d22fd76cb9be1159243ae9c8625a58d&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Uganda court releases prominent rights activist on bail</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/uganda-court-releases-prominent-rights-activist-bail-2026-01-28/</link><description>KAMPALA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A Ugandan court on Wednesday released on bail a prominent rights activist whose detention was seen by campaign groups as part of a widespread crackdown on dissent ahead of the country's general election that was held on January 15.

Sarah Bireete, who heads the Centre for Constitutional Governance, a Kampala-based pressure group, was detained on December 30 after questioning the accuracy of the voter register to be used in the poll. She was later charged with offences related to alleged unlawful disclosure of voters' information.

On Wednesday Magistrate Winnie Nankya Jatiko released her on bail saying "the applicant satisfied all the relevant requirements for the grant of bail".

The official results of the poll showed long-ruling incumbent Yoweri Museveni securing 71.6% of the votes. Opposition leader Bobi Wine, who is in hiding and is being sought by the military, has rejected the results.

After Bireete's detention, CCG said she was being persecuted for helping to "amplify the voices of the oppressed and marginalised". International rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been demanding her unconditional release.

The 81-year-old Museveni, already Africa's third longest-ruling head of state, will have been president of the East African country for 45 years by the time his term ends in 2031.

Rights groups and the opposition have long accused his government of using the military to suppress dissent.

The budget, as well as an accompanying economic plan, faces an uphill battle for approval as the government has become increasingly polarized. By law it must be approved by the end of March or a snap election would be triggered.

For more than two years, parties in Netanyahu's coalition have splintered over the war in Gaza , the ceasefire in October that has halted it, and demands by ultra-Orthodox Jewish parties to exempt Jewish seminary students from mandatory military service.

Netanyahu told reporters on Tuesday evening he hoped the budget would pass and was concerned over the prospect of an election ahead of an October 2026 schedule.

"We are in a very sensitive situation and I think the last thing we need right now is elections," he said at a press conference. "We'll have elections later on this year, but I think it's a mistake to have them now, and I hope that people understand that and act sensibly."

A vote was expected later on Wednesday or early Thursday morning, following what is expected to be a long debate on the floor of parliament.

The main issue threatening to topple the coalition is a military conscription bill .

Netanyahu relies on ultra-Orthodox , or Haredi, parties for support and the bill to exempt seminary students from serving has been a thorn in the coalition for months.

Haredi parties have threatened to vote against the budget if a bill is not passed. But Netanyahu's other right-wing coalition partners - as well as the opposition - feel Haredi men must share in the burden, especially after two years of fighting in Gaza and Lebanon where nearly 1,000 Israeli soldiers were killed.

A spokesperson for Moshe Gafni, who heads the United Torah Judaism party, said UTJ had not yet decided whether to support the budget in the vote. Other Haredi parties did not immediately provide comment.

Israeli media reported that Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told ultra-Orthodox parties that he would not link the budget vote to the draft law and that if they did not vote for the budget, Israel should have an election.

A spokesman for Smotrich, who has said the Haredi parties would benefit from extra spending this year, did not comment on the reports.

Even if the budget gets preliminary approval, it still needs to pass two more votes by March 31 to become law.

In all, state spending would be 662 billion shekels ($214 billion) excluding debt servicing. The deficit ceiling was set at 3.9% of gross domestic product, a level the Bank of Israel deems as too high since it does not allow for a reduction in the debt burden.

"Despite all my reservations and everything included in the budget ... it must be passed," Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron said on Wednesday at a meeting of parliament's finance committee.

"The deficit target must not creep up, especially given the possibility of additional expenditures due to geopolitical developments."

The budget deficit slipped to 4.7% of GDP in 2025 from 6.8% in 2023. A spike in defence costs due to the Gaza war pushed the deficit higher the past two years.

While an October ceasefire has halted most fighting, it has not stopped entirely and both sides have accused each other of violating the deal's provisions.

France, Poland, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands have been invited to take part in the video conference , which follows ridicule from officials in Donald Trump 's administration over the time it takes for the 27-country bloc to make a decision.

The idea of forging ad-hoc coalitions allowing some EU countries to pursue projects without all of them having to agree has long tempted some of its members, and has already been applied to key projects including the euro currency.

It is gaining new momentum as Europe confronts widening insecurity, sluggish growth and deep political divergences.

"Now is the time for a Europe of two speeds," German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil said on Tuesday in Berlin ahead of the video conference of finance ministers.

Klingbeil wants the countries invited to the call, which is scheduled for 3 p.m. (1400 GMT), to set a concrete agenda to strengthen the sovereignty, resilience and competitiveness of Europe, a letter seen by Reuters showed.

"To survive in an increasingly unpredictable geopolitical situation, Europe must become stronger and more resilient," Klingbeil wrote in the letter to his counterparts dated Monday, adding that continuing as before could not be an option.

The invitation said it is meant as a "kick-off," and a follow-up meeting in person in the margins of the next Eurogroup should follow.

"Due to the geopolitical situation, the EU simply cannot afford to wait for all 27 members anymore," said Nicolai von Ondarza, European expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP).

He pointed to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's toughening stance and willingness to press ahead in Europe without unanimity, be it on the Mercosur trade deal or Ukraine.

The move by Germany's finance minister to include only six countries for Wednesday's call could alienate other EU members, but German officials said the approach was flexible.

The advance-group approach would work in different formats, depending on who wants to join, and will not be restricted to the six countries, they said.

France has long pushed for willing EU countries to go forward without the others and is expected to join the call, as is Italy's Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti.

"An effort is being made to find a framework for discussions to seek solutions to more complex situations in a restricted format," an Italian source said.

Germany's letter includes a four-point plan to push forward an EU capital markets union, strengthen the euro and better coordinate investment in defense and secure raw materials.

Klingbeil said the coalition also needs to move faster on a Savings and Investment Union to create better financing conditions for European businesses.

On the euro, he called for cuts to red tape and enhanced sovereignty in the payment sphere to highlight the currency's role as a safe haven based on predictability and rule of law.

He urged better cooperation on defence, which he said should be firmly embedded as a priority in the next EU multiannual budget, "turning defence into an engine for growth".

Supply chain resilience for critical minerals must also be strengthened, with greater strategic engagement with international partners, he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HBOORRBXWBJ27HQYDL3D6P7L5Q.jpg?auth=c47a803347e4618cc940e1cdb193bf6b66b535afbf2f5d781cec5e1658f41e48&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukraine summons Hungary ambassador over election meddling allegations</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraine-summons-hungary-ambassador-over-election-meddling-allegations-2026-01-28/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ukraine's foreign ministry said it summoned Hungary's ambassador to Kyiv on Thursday to protest over Budapest's allegations of Ukrainian meddling in the upcoming Hungarian parliamentary election.

Nationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has intensified criticism of Ukraine in recent weeks, seeking to associate Hungary's opposition leader Peter Magyar with Kyiv and the European Union executive as the election campaign heats up.

Orban and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy have engaged in a public war of words, with Zelenskiy accusing Orban, without naming him directly, of trying to "sell out European interests."

In response, Orban called his counterpart "a man in a desperate position" as Ukraine approaches its fourth anniversary of full-scale war since Russia invaded in February 2022.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto criticised the Ukrainian protest on Facebook on Wednesday.

"Based on what was said at the summoning of the ambassador, we must be prepared for the Ukrainians to continue their open and crude interference in the April elections in the interests of the (opposition) Tisza party."

Orban, in power since 2010, is facing a strong challenger for the first time with most polls consistently showing Magyar's centre-right Tisza party ahead of the premier's right-wing nationalist Fidesz after three years of economic stagnation.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:29 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Brussels greenlights $3.4 billion Spanish state aid for highly efficient power</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/brussels-greenlights-34-billion-spanish-state-aid-highly-efficient-power-2026-01-28/</link><description>MADRID, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The European Commission has approved a 3.1 billion euro ($3.4 billion) Spanish state aid scheme to support electricity output from highly efficient power plants, it said on Wednesday, amid an EU push to cut greenhouse gas emissions.

Support will cover new or substantially refurbished combined heat and power (CHP) plant projects using natural gas, bioliquids, biogas and solid biomass.

Natural gas projects must include equipment enabling the use of at least 10% renewable hydrogen by volume to avoid perpetuating reliance on the fossil fuel.

The European Union has current targets to cut net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 and achieve climate neutrality by 2050, and is pushing more broadly to reduce final energy consumption to mitigate the effects of climate change.

The Spanish scheme will run for 10 years and be open to operators of CHP installations that meet the definition of high-efficiency cogeneration under the EU's Energy Efficiency Directive, the Commission said in a statement.

Aid will be granted as a remuneration premium to compensate for investments in bringing CHPs onstream and for operating costs calculated and updated quarterly, the Commission said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:52:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/QKG6UKCY7BKHHI2UTXKQ5GULFQ.jpg?auth=75029be756b6171ff8146623af2fe7aebc1fb0b4894de0d062788ec5e875d4c4&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs defence reinforcement in the Arctic, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-backs-defence-reinforcement-arctic-macron-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France supports the reinforcement of the defence position in the Arctic, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, ahead of a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

But what is Nipah virus, and how worried should people be?

Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40% to 75%, depending on the local healthcare system's capacity for detection and management, the World Health Organization says.

However, while it can also spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Candidate vaccines are under development, although none have been approved yet.

Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999. Since then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh. India also sees sporadic outbreaks. According to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, a group that tracks emerging disease threats and funds the development of medical tools to protect against them, as of December 750 cases had been recorded in all, and 415 of the patients died.

Reuters traced the spread of Nipah in a 2023 series, Bat Lands .

When first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs or contaminated tissues. Since then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its natural host: fruit bats.

More specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products - like raw date palm juice - containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection, the WHO says. Human-to-human spread has been found, mainly after close contact between a sick patient and their family or caregivers.

The initial symptoms of Nipah such as fever, headaches and muscle pain are not specific and can be confused with other diseases. These can then be followed by neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and some people experience severe respiratory problems. Seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to a coma in days. Most people who get better make a full recovery, but some experience long-term neurological problems.

While Nipah is a dangerous disease with a high fatality rate, it has not yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans or spreading easily worldwide, scientists say.

However, it remains a significant public health concern, according to the WHO, particularly in countries where outbreaks are more common. It can also lead to the mass culling of farm animals such as pigs that are susceptible to the virus.

Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally - and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period.

There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although a number of candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the COVID-19 vaccines.

Their Nipah vaccine uses the same technology, and began phase II testing in Bangladesh in December in collaboration with the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, and with funding from CEPI.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 12:53:08 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs defence reinforcement in the Arctic, Macron says</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/france-backs-defence-reinforcement-arctic-macron-says-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France supports the reinforcement of the defence position in the Arctic, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday, ahead of a meeting with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen.

Rajabi's home is surrounded by buildings that have raised large Israeli flags - a sign they are owned by settlers , who he said began buying homes in 2004, and have obtained about 40 buildings in Silwan now, many via forced evictions.

Settler group Ateret Cohanim had offered to buy him and other Palestinians out, he said, but most had refused.

He said he was among 32 families in the neighborhood who have now been ordered to leave, with him and his brothers given until the end of Ramadan - mid-March - to depart under an order from Israel's Supreme Court that he showed Reuters.

"They want to force me out of the house I was born in, where my eyes first opened to life," said Rajabi, explaining that his family had lived there since 1967 and bought the land from a Jordanian officer.

Daniel Luria, the executive director of Ateret Cohanim, called Palestinians in Silwan "illegal squatters", saying the land was owned by Yemeni Jews before 1929 and that moving back was rectifying a historical injustice. Rajabi said that account was untrue.

The Supreme Court did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Palestinians seek East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war, for a future state and say that leaving their homes there could put an end to their hopes for ever. Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich has said the aim is to 'bury' the idea of a Palestinian state.

Israel deems all of Jerusalem its capital - a status not recognised internationally - and has encouraged Jewish settlement of predominantly Palestinian areas . Settler incursions, sometimes violent , have ramped up since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023 triggered the Gaza war.

Silwan is particularly contentious due to its proximity to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a longtime flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions.

Rajabi said that Ateret Cohanim had offered him a blank check to leave, an offer he refused. "I wouldn't sell them even a grain of soil. They told me, 'Put whatever number you want and we're ready to pay'," he said.

He said that some people in the neighborhood had sold their homes, but that most families had refused.

Luria said that Ateret Cohanim had offered Silwan residents compensation for leaving. "This is part of an unfolding Zionist dream," said Luria of the purchase of homes in Silwan.

Numerous UN Security Council resolutions have called on Israel to halt all settlement activity, but successive Israeli governments have said settlements are critical to the country's security. If Palestinians refuse orders to leave, armed police go in to evict them and diggers demolish their homes.

Rajabi said that with the high prices for rent in Jerusalem, he does not know where he and his family will go.

"People will live in the streets," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:06 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/HK4GVZSJVBIRNOLOIHRJ6V7KMM.jpg?auth=41b55fb42c9506a21d1d2449e2ec571d40f2af9e592bd12fd5ee425146175eb8&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Greenland says more surveillance and security needed in region</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland-says-more-surveillance-security-needed-region-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Greenland's prime minister said on Wednesday there were red lines that could not be crossed in discussions with the United States, but acknowledged that more needed to be done to boost security in the region in the face of a more aggressive Russia.

Jens-Frederik Nielsen and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen were in Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron to shore up support over U.S. President Donald Trump's push to take over the Arctic island that has been Danish territory for centuries .

Macron said France shared the view that it was necessary to reinforce defence in the Arctic.

"Given Russia's stance in the Far North, China's economic presence, and the strategic consequences of this rapprochement, we agree on the need to strengthen our defence posture in the Arctic," he said.

France also supported increased NATO vigilance and activity in the Arctic, he said. "We are ready to join."

Talks between Greenland, Denmark and the United States are due to take place to try to find a solution to the crisis, but Nielsen said Greenland had some red lines that could not be crossed, even if he hoped to come to some sort of agreement, without elaborating.

"We are under pressure, serious pressure. We are trying to push back from the outside. We are trying to handle our people who are afraid, scared," he said in a joint conversation with Frederiksen at Sciences Po University.

But he also said: "We need to do more surveillance and security in our region because of the way Russia acts now."

The U.S. demand for control of Greenland has shaken transatlantic relations and accelerated European efforts to reduce dependence on the United States, even as Trump last week withdrew tariff threats and ruled out taking Greenland by force.

Frederiksen said that what the crisis had shown was that the majority of Europeans were on the same page and had been able to unite to push back on Trump's demands, notably his threat of additional tariffs on some European states.

"I think there are some lessons learned in the last couple of weeks for Europe," she later said at a press conference with Macron and Nielsen.

Saying the world order had changed forever and questioning what may happen in Washington in the future, Frederiksen said it was vital for Europe to become stronger, but also urged transatlantic unity given it was clear Russia did not want peace.

"If we allow Russia to win in Ukraine, they will continue," she said. "The best way forward for the United States, Europe is to stick together."

The diplomatic rift between Denmark and the United States, both founding members of NATO, had seemed in recent weeks to threaten the future of the military alliance, although the conflict has since been moved to a diplomatic track.

Half of the landmass in the Arctic is Russian territory . Since 2005 Moscow has re-opened and modernised tens of Soviet-era military bases, both on its Arctic mainland and on the islands off its northern coast.

Russia says talk of Moscow and Beijing being a threat to Greenland is a myth to whip up hysteria.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:11 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/7BKVULUVVZLBLNFI35KW5C24II.jpg?auth=0047a7b8746880b65bb67cc660b628a1fcfae3fce4fef596c0ba4a6110ecb0d7&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump tells Iran to make nuclear deal or next attack will be 'far worse'</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-tells-iran-make-nuclear-deal-or-next-attack-will-be-far-worse-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump urged Iran on Wednesday to come to the table and make a deal on nuclear weapons or the next U.S. attack would be far worse.

"Hopefully Iran will quickly 'Come to the Table' and negotiate a fair and equitable deal - NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS - one that is good for all parties. Time is running out, it is truly of the essence!" Trump wrote in a social media post.

The Republican U.S. president, who during his first White House term pulled out of world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, noted that his last warning to Iran was followed by a military strike in June.

"The next attack will be far worse! Don’t make that happen again," Trump wrote. He also repeated that a U.S. "armada" was heading toward the Islamic Republic.

Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said he had not been in contact with U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff in recent days or requested negotiations, state media reported on Wednesday.

Trump said a U.S. naval force headed by the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, was approaching Iran. Two U.S. officials told Reuters on Monday that the Lincoln and supporting warships had arrived in the Middle East.

The warships started moving from the Asia-Pacific region last week as U.S.-Iranian tensions soared following a bloody crackdown on protests across Iran by its clerical authorities in recent weeks.

Trump has repeatedly threatened to intervene if Iran continued to kill protesters, but the countrywide demonstrations over economic privations and political repression have since abated.

He has said the United States would act if Tehran resumed its nuclear program after the June airstrikes by Israeli and U.S. forces on key nuclear installations.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:16 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/TO3IMSYUEJIKHNQ3CCOCOQ6AWY.jpg?auth=2ca6bd1a9ebae916c0f5e59d3e248ee5738cdb3b50588a0a4a094dd92d5dd8e9&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Turkey aims to lift trade volume with Nigeria to $5 billion</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/turkey-aims-lift-trade-volume-with-nigeria-5-billion-2026-01-28/</link><description>ABUJA, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Turkey aims to lift its trade volume with Nigeria to $5 billion from about $2 billion, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday following a meeting with visiting Nigerian President Bola Tinubu.

Turkey exports aircraft, helicopters, machinery, iron and steel, and chemical products to Nigeria, while Nigeria supplies crude oil and agricultural commodities to Turkey.

The two countries signed agreements covering defence cooperation, infrastructure development, trade and investment, as well as joint efforts to tackle insurgency in Africa’s Sahel region.

Erdogan did not give a timeline for reaching the new trade target but said talks had begun.

“We see significant potential in the fields of trade and investment. In today’s meetings, our commitment is to the $5 billion trade volume target, and we discussed the steps needed,” he said.

Tinubu has been promoting foreign investment to spur growth in Africa’s largest economy following reforms introduced shortly after he took office in 2023.

Tinubu said "trade, business, no restrictions, giving opportunities to those who are ready to learn, work and prosper" is critical to his growth ambition. "How do we build an inclusive economy together? How do we involve vulnerable people? How do we ensure peace in the world?" the Nigerian leader asked.

Erdogan said Turkey would support Nigeria’s fight against insurgency, drawing on its own experience combating militant groups.

"Terrorist organisations emerging particularly in Africa’s Sahel region pose a threat to the peace of the entire continent,” he said. “We discussed opportunities for closer cooperation in military training and intelligence, and we are ready to share our country’s significant experience.”

Nigerian officials are expected to hold meetings with leading Turkish defence industry companies during the visit, Erdogan added.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 13:50:27 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/SOCUBISPWJLMFM4SWLYXPIPNYU.jpg?auth=ac056a6d1d3d2e6cea1697976ddc0cc4209355ed8eb994a7df88f890cc668464&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Saudi Arabia weighs expansion of premium residency program to lure rich</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-weighs-expansion-premium-residency-program-lure-talent-2026-01-28/</link><description>Jan 28 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is drafting plans to extend its premium residency program to a wider selection of desirable individuals, including superyacht owners, those looking to live in the kingdom's flagship development projects and top students, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The deliberations, which have not yet been finalized, are part of efforts to attract foreign capital and visitors under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 plan to diversify the country's economy away from oil and transform society.

The person said that people purchasing real estate at Vision 2030 construction projects, such as Riyadh's $60 billion Diriyah development, could be eligible.

Potentially offering premium residency to ultra-wealthy individuals who moor superyachts in Saudi Arabia's waters appeared aimed at encouraging visitors to the new luxury Red Sea resorts.

High-achieving students may also be included.

Premium residency is currently available based on varying criteria.

It includes executives earning more than 80,000 Saudi riyals ($21,300) per month and specialized health and science professionals earning more than 35,000 riyals per month, according to an online brochure marketing the program.

Benefits include entry without a visa, the ability to work and the ability to extend premium residency status to family members.

The Saudi Premium Residency program did not immediately respond to emailed questions from Reuters.

The move would be the latest step in trying to make Saudi Arabia more attractive to foreign visitors.

The kingdom has already implemented rules affording premium residency to anyone purchasing a property worth more than $1 million.

Last year, the once ultra-conservative kingdom loosened restrictions on alcohol , allowing non-Muslim premium residents and high-earners to purchase alcoholic beverages at a designated Riyadh store.

Since January 22, non-Saudis have been allowed to own residential and commercial property in certain parts of the kingdom, though regulations have not yet been fully rolled out.

No one was ‍injured in the blaze which started in the attic of the Hotel des Grandes ​Alpes at around 7pm (18:00 GMT) on Tuesday. It was ​still burning and belching thick clouds of smoke late on Wednesday morning, the Prefecture of the Savoie region, where Courchevel is located, said on its website.

Officials said around 200 people were evacuated from the hotel last night, while the nearby Hotel Le Lana, was ‍also being evacuated on Wednesday morning due to risk as the fire was still ​ongoing. Staff and guests took refuge in other hotels, the local government said, while 131 firefighters have been deployed.

"They are working in ‌very difficult conditions," Vanina Nicoli, the prefect of Savoie, told reporters. Four of them were harmed by the ‍smoke, she said.

Firefighters managed to prevent the fire from spreading to other buildings so far and no further evacuations were planned at this stage, Nicoli said.

The Gendarmerie was looking into what caused the fire.

Corneille Nangaa, who leads the Alliance Fleuve Congo (AFC), was referring to a strategic partnership agreement signed in Washington on December 4, under which the United States would obtain greater access to the Democratic Republic of Congo's critical minerals in exchange for investment and security cooperation.

In an interview with Reuters in Goma on Monday, Nangaa said the plan suffered from a lack of transparency and legal shortcomings, citing what he called "the opacity surrounding the negotiations" and "procedural flaws, particularly the violation of the Constitution and the law."

Nangaa's criticism of the deal raises further questions about the feasibility of U.S. investment in war-hit eastern Congo one year after M23 seized Goma, the region's biggest city, as part of a lightning offensive.

Most of eastern Congo’s key minerals, including coltan, lie in areas now held by M23, which has seized major mining zones such as Rubaya in North Kivu.

Mining sites offered to Washington could later become the subject of disputes because they may already have been granted to other partners, Nangaa said.

"The Americans may have signed it, but they should know that they signed it with an illegitimate regime, and a corrupt one at that," he said.

Asked for comment, the Congolese presidency rejected Nangaa's accusations, saying the partnership “fully falls within the constitutional prerogatives” of the elected president and government.

It called concerns over potential disputes with existing contract holders “speculative”, and said any cooperation would respect valid contracts and comply with Congo's mining regulations.

Congo's government has said the partnership will be presented to lawmakers for approval in March. "We have a sound majority in parliament, so we believe that we will get the parliament's approval", Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Economy Daniel Mukoko Samba told Reuters in Davos last week.

In the interview with Reuters, Nangaa said the AFC worked with neighbouring Rwanda and Uganda on security issues but denied receiving support from Kigali.

Rwanda denies backing M23, though a report by a United Nations group of experts in July assessed that it exercised command and control over the rebels.

Last week, Rwanda's ambassador to the United States said in a statement that Kigali engages in "security coordination" with AFC/M23.

The capture of Goma, a city of more than two million people on Congo's border with Rwanda, marked one of the biggest escalations in years of fighting in eastern Congo.

Nangaa told Reuters that security had improved in areas under rebel control since the takeover, adding that schools and hospitals were operating normally and that displaced people had returned home.

The U.N. Human Rights Office says M23, Congolese armed forces and other armed groups have committed serious rights violations , some of which may amount to war crimes. All sides deny wrongdoing.

Nangaa accused Kinshasa of blocking peace efforts, saying ceasefire commitments discussed in talks in Doha, mediated by Qatar with U.S. backing, had not been implemented. The Congolese government rejects those claims, blaming the rebel group for the continued violence.

M23 forces briefly entered the town of Uvira in December saying it sought to stop attacks on civilians, but later withdrew. Nangaa warned that further action could not be ruled out if insecurity continued.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:36 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/BYNLJ4FIVVMBJKQ7PTAN3OIBHY.jpg?auth=34b3882a35dbf0c5827a7318c75e658a3ba098c655a4c21f2f77a1961ffd5fd0&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Gunmen kill three policemen in ambush in Nigeria's Katsina state</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/gunmen-kill-three-policemen-ambush-nigerias-katsina-state-2026-01-28/</link><description>MAIDUGURI, Nigeria, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Three police officers were killed and two others wounded when suspected armed gang members ambushed a routine patrol in northwest Nigeria's Katsina state on Tuesday, the police said on Wednesday.

The incident was part of a surge in attacks , including mass kidnappings by armed gangs operating from forest hideouts who have raided villages, schools and places of worship in the predominantly Muslim northwest.

Tuesday's ambush, the second in a week , highlights the region's persistent insecurity, where gangs known as bandits continue to hit rural communities and security forces despite ongoing military operations.

Katsina police spokesperson Abubakar Sadiq Aliyu said the officers came under heavy fire at about 1144 GMT along the Guga-Bakori road while on patrol. The team "responded bravely,” repelling the assault, but lost three officers in the shootout, Aliyu said in a statement.

Two wounded officers are being treated at a nearby hospital, he said.

U.S. President Donald Trump has accused Nigeria of failing to protect Christians. Nigerian authorities say Muslims are targeted as well as Christians and that they are doing their best to stop the violence in difficult circumstances.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:41 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nipah virus fears trigger airport checks across Asia after India confirms two cases</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/india-reports-two-nipah-virus-infections-thai-malaysia-step-up-screening-2026-01-28/</link><description>NEW DELHI/BANGKOK/SINGAPORE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Authorities across Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia have taken urgent steps to stop the highly lethal and epidemic‑prone Nipah virus spreading beyond India, rolling out airport temperature checks and other screening measures.

Nipah is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organization because of its ability to spark fast‑moving outbreaks, its fatality rate of 40% to 75%, and the fact that there is no approved vaccine or cure.

Two infections were confirmed in India in late December.

The virus, carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can trigger a deadly brain-swelling fever in humans and can also spread directly from person to person through close contact. Several vaccines are in development but remain in testing.

The two people infected in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal in late December were health workers and both are under treatment at a local hospital, a district health officer told Reuters.

Authorities have identified and traced 196 contacts linked to the two cases with none showing symptoms and all testing negative for the virus, the Indian health ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday.

"Speculative and incorrect figures regarding Nipah virus disease cases are being circulated," the statement said. "Enhanced surveillance, laboratory testing, and field investigations were undertaken ... which ensured timely containment of the cases."

Reports of the infections put authorities on alert in neighbouring Southeast Asian nations as well as Nepal and Hong Kong.

Singapore's Communicable Diseases Agency said on Wednesday that it will set up temperature screening at its airport for flights arriving from areas affected by the infections in India.

The Ministry of Manpower is stepping up surveillance over newly arrived migrant workers from South Asia, and engaging primary care providers to increase vigilance, it said.

"We are also reaching out to our counterparts in South Asia, to better understand the situation. Work is ongoing to establish a global platform for countries to report genome sequencing of detected cases," the agency said in a statement.

A Hong Kong airport authority spokesperson said it was facilitating enhanced health screening measures enforced by the health department at Hong Kong International Airport, including temperature check at gates for passengers arriving from India.

Thailand earlier this week tightened airport screening measures, with neighbouring Malaysia following suit.

Thailand has assigned designated parking bays for aircraft arriving from areas with Nipah infections, its health ministry said, while passengers must complete health declarations before clearing immigration.

Malaysia's health ministry said it was boosting preparedness through health screening at international ports of entry, particularly for arrivals from countries deemed at risk.

"The ministry remains vigilant against the risk of cross-border transmission following sporadic infections in several other countries," it said in a statement on Wednesday.

China's disease control authority said on Tuesday that no Nipah infections had been detected in the country but there were risks of imported cases, state broadcaster CCTV said on Tuesday .

Nepal, which shares a busy border with India, said it was on "high alert" and had tightened screening for travellers. Health ministry officials said border points with India and China had been notified to remain vigilant and check suspected cases.

Nipah was first identified in 1998 during an outbreak among pig farmers in Malaysia and Singapore, although scientists believe it has circulated in flying foxes for millennia and warn that a mutated, highly transmissible strain could emerge from bats.

India regularly reports sporadic infections, particularly in the southern state of Kerala , considered among the world's most at-risk regions for Nipah outbreaks. The virus has been linked to the deaths of dozens of people in Kerala since it first appeared there in 2018.

The West Bengal cases are the state's first in nearly two decades, following five fatal infections in 2007, local media reported.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:44 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/4ZR2GTZ2D5LYBFSXVRQF7S3ZEI.jpg?auth=9a1928b373a36781709c8ccc54405c104af9030ef3cdbc6c471c1ef107cbb3e3&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Switzerland to boost defence spending, funded by sales tax hike</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/switzerland-boost-defence-spending-funded-by-sales-tax-hike-2026-01-28/</link><description>ZURICH, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Switzerland plans to inject an additional 31 billion Swiss francs ($40.38 billion) into defence and security spending starting from 2028 and will increase sales tax for a decade to help fund it, the government said on Wednesday.

Citing a deterioration in the geopolitical situation, the governing Federal Council said defence must be strengthened in Switzerland, where spending on the military is not currently scheduled to reach 1% of gross domestic product until 2032.

Under the new plan, sales tax is to be increased by 0.8 percentage points for 10 years starting in 2028, it said.

"The world has become more volatile and insecure, and the international order based on international law is under strain," the government said, noting various European countries have responded by strengthening their defence capabilities.

Swiss officials and lawmakers warn that conflicts including Russia's invasion of Ukraine, U.S. rivalry with China and tensions in the Middle East pose a risk to the country, through threats such as spying, cyberattacks and even terror attacks.

The government said current financial planning no longer reflected increases in the cost of arms, which have been driven by inflation and greater demand.

The government's plan would need to pass parliament and faces a referendum that could take place next year, it said.

According to the plan, the spending priorities should also encompass investment in IT, cybersecurity and electromagnetic reconnaissance, as well as police and border protection.

In a statement, the Egyptian foreign ministry said four Egyptian crew members were currently on board the Reem alKhaleej vessel at Iran's Bandar Abbas port.

Iran said last month that it had seized a foreign oil tanker carrying 4 million litres of smuggled fuel near the Iranian island of Qeshm in the Gulf. It did not name the vessel or disclose its nationality, but said that 16 foreign crew members had been detained on criminal charges.

Iran, which has some of the world's lowest fuel prices due to heavy subsidies and a sharp fall in the value of its national currency, has been seeking to curb widespread fuel smuggling by land to neighbouring countries and by sea to Gulf states.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:53 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Small island states rate China as top development partner as West cuts aid</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/cop/small-island-states-rate-china-top-development-partner-west-cuts-aid-2026-01-28/</link><description>LONDON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - A survey of small island ‌developing nations such as Mauritius and the Maldives showed China rated as the top bilateral development assistance partner amid U.S. aid cuts and Washington's pivot away from climate change, a report by ODI Global found.

Data from an ODI survey to which officials from 29 small island developing states responded found that in the aggregate, governments saw China as the most ‌valued bilateral partner - a view that has geopolitical implications, according to lead author Emily ​Wilkinson.

"These countries are important to different donors for geopolitical reasons," Wilkinson told Reuters.

China's showing among Caribbean countries - where Beijing historically had less involvement than the likes of the United States or the United Kingdom - was surprising, ‍she added.

The survey, conducted between July and November 2025, includes countries spanning from the Caribbean to the South China Sea, including the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea, Barbados, Cabo Verde, Mauritius and the Maldives.

Nations grouped under the small island developing nations moniker as ⁠defined by the World Bank also include some non-island states such as Belize and Guyana.

While small, some ‍are strategically located for the world's superpowers along key maritime routes.

A breakdown shows a more nuanced picture. The UK topped the ‌list ‌for half of the Caribbean respondents while Australia topped the list in the Pacific. China was number one for the Atlantic, Indian Ocean and South China Sea island states.

ODI's analysis of finance flows capturing data between 2020 and 2023 shows Beijing provided $6 billion in developmental aid to small island states in the period, outstripping official ⁠development finance from Australia, ⁠at $4.78 billion, the United ​States at $3.17 billion and Japan at $2 billion.

Those figures came before U.S. President Donald Trump's return to office in January 2025, when he largely shuttered USAID - the vehicle for most American aid spending - and has scaled back any funds for climate ‍change.

The survey also found that while donor nations increasingly push innovative financing, such as debt swaps and debt pause clauses when climate disasters strike, there is limited take-up.

"The bigger vulnerability these countries say is the disproportionate impact on the extreme weather events ​have on their economies and the fact that they have, many ‍of them, very limited access to concessional finance," she said, adding the instruments do not get to the root of the problem ​because they don't actually reduce the level of debt.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:33:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/PLIXCC2MFVOABJRRKV2OPHSUNE.jpg?auth=104db9976a832007a7f79ae43ad09722db166bb73d852964b92099bbe217df97&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>German police search Deutsche Bank offices in money-laundering probe</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/business/20260128-german-police-search-deutsche-bank-offices-in-money-laundering-probe</link><description>German prosecutors and police on Wednesday searched Deutsche Bank's headquarters in Frankfurt and its office in Berlin in an investigation over suspected money laundering offences, officials said.

According to the Sueddeutsche Zeitung daily , the probe is connected to suspected offences in the bank's dealings with companies linked to Russian billionaire businessman Roman Abramovich.

Prosecutors confirmed the raids at the premises of Germany 's biggest bank but did not say who was being targeted.

The Frankfurt prosecutors' office said it was carrying out an "investigation into unknown responsible parties and employees of Deutsche Bank on suspicion of money laundering... and related additional allegations under the Anti-Money Laundering Act".

"In the past, Deutsche Bank maintained business relationships with foreign companies that... are themselves suspected of having been used for the purpose of money laundering," a spokesman for the office said in a statement to AFP.

It said the investigation was being carried out by a specialist economic crime unit along with the federal police.

A spokesman for Deutsche Bank confirmed the searches, and the bank said it was "cooperating fully with prosecutors" but refused to comment further.

News site Der Spiegel said the search in Frankfurt involved around 30 plainclothes investigators.

According to financial sources, the probe relates to alleged offences committed between 2013 and 2018.

Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Deutsche Bank was being investigated on suspicion of failing to report possible money laundering in a timely manner.

The daily reported that the investigation involves both payments that Deutsche Bank received via a Russian correspondent account and the bank's previous dealings with Abramovich's own companies.

Abramovich has been sanctioned by the EU following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

The raids come on the eve of the publication of the bank's results for the fourth quarter of 2025.

Deutsche Bank has faced scrutiny on several occasions in recent years over suspicious transactions.

In 2022, its offices were raided over "suspicious activity reports filed by the bank", again in relation to money laundering.

Media reports at the time said that the investigation centred on a transaction involving Rifaat al-Assad , the uncle of Syria 's then leader Bashar al-Assad .

In 2019, US Congressional committees issued subpoenas for Deutsche Bank's records on US President Donald Trump, including suspicious activity reports.

The bank reportedly lent more than $2 billion to Trump's businesses in the 1990s when other lenders wouldn't, in deals that piqued the interest of regulators .

The Trump family subsequently sued the bank to stop it from complying with the subpeonas.

The Frankfurt-based group also came under scrutiny for its role as a correspondence bank that handled foreign transactions for Danske Bank's Estonian branch, at the centre of a 200-billion-euro ($212-billion) money-laundering affair between 2007 and 2015.

Deutsche Bank subsequently agreed to pay a fine of 13.5 million euros for failing to report suspicious activity quickly enough, after an investigation by Frankfurt prosecutors.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 15:34:15 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/1eec1a08-fc57-11f0-aacf-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-28T132931Z-1361127052-RC2CAJAD8Q13-RTRMADP-3-DEUTSCHE-BANK-RAIDS.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>‘As in wartime’: Iranian doctors recount deadly crackdown on protesters</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-as-in-wartime-iranian-doctors-recount-deadly-crackdown-on-protesters</link><description>One month after Iran launched a bloody crackdown on nationwide protests that has left thousands dead, information and witness accounts are beginning to emerge.

The protests started on December 28 over a rise in the cost of living following a sharp fall in the Iranian rial and rapidly spread nationwide. They were met with a violent response, the full extent of which only began to surface after more than two weeks of an unprecedented nationwide internet blackout.

Several Iranian doctors who have since left the country told FRANCE 24 they were mobilised at the height of the protests, on the evenings of January 8 and January 9.

Their accounts converged, describing scenes of unprecedented chaos that some called "apocalyptic", and injuries resembling those seen in war. Medical facilities were quickly overwhelmed as dozens of wounded patients poured into each department, forcing staff to prioritise treatment according to the severity of injuries, they said.

"Just imagine: It was Thursday evening, there was no internet, communications were cut, and it was extremely difficult to reach doctors and ask them to come urgently to deal with this influx of people shot by bullets," one doctor said.

As the situation worsened, he said there was a wave of solidarity, with private hospitals – usually expensive – opening their doors.

"They were also overwhelmed. They refused no one and treated patients for free. Doctors said they did not want to make money, care had to be accessible to everyone."

Those injured over the two nights came from all age groups. "There was a 70-year-old man shot in the back, but also children and teenagers as young as 14," the doctor said.

Most wounds were concentrated on the head, face, abdomen, lower abdomen and flanks.

From midnight on January 8, the nature of the injuries changed, the doctor said. Live ammunition was now being used. "It was as if [the security forces] had received orders to shoot everyone, as in wartime," he said, adding that he was still operating at 2am.

The following night he was called in again to serve as reinforcement. "On Friday, they called to say a patient had arrived with a live round wound. From that moment on, there were only live rounds."

"The injuries suggested people were trying to flee, that they were hit by shots into the crowd without any specific target, at an angle. These are not the injuries seen in isolated clashes, for example between thieves and the police," he added.

Another doctor, deeply shaken, said he was unable to recover from what he witnessed. “My back is literally bent. I have never seen anything like this in my life,” he said, comparing the scenes to the Holocaust .

Videos authenticated by the France 24 Observers team showed the bodies of patients who died from severe injuries lined up, and in some cases stacked, in hospital corridors, reflecting the high number of fatalities.

According to Amnesty International , which has collected videos, photos and witness accounts, Iranian security forces used a wide array of lethal weapons – assault rifles and automatic or semi-automatic machine guns – firing continuously and indiscriminately into crowds. Evidence collected by the NGO indicated the authorities "committed mass unlawful killings on an unprecedented scale amid the shutdown".

In addition to those who were seriously wounded who flooded into Iranian healthcare centres on those nights, a number of protesters chose to avoid hospitals for fear of being arrested.

Some were treated clandestinely in private homes, "under extremely difficult conditions due to a lack of equipment", while painkillers quickly became unavailable, Iranian health workers told the French daily Libération.

Another witness told FRANCE 24 that an 18-year-old protester shot in the leg was admitted to hospital under a false name. Amid chaos and heightened security, her parents ultimately took her home, where a doctor operated on her.

One of the doctors interviewed by FRANCE 24 said he answered nearly 600 calls in two days, providing remote medical advice without intervening directly.

"It is impossible to know the exact number of deaths," he said. "Many died in the street without reaching hospital. Families took them home to keep them away from the authorities, then buried them secretly, out of sight."

According to a tally published Wednesday by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 6,221 people were killed , including 5,858 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 100 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating. The crackdown has seen more than 42,300 arrests, it added.

The agency, which has been accurate in multiple rounds of unrest in Iran, verifies each death with a network of activists on the ground.

Two senior officials from Iran’s health ministry, quoted by Time magazine , said up to 30,000 people may have been killed in Iranian streets on January 8 and 9 alone.

One doctor said he did not witness direct intervention by security forces during treatment at the public hospital in Tehran where he worked. "But I saw people trying to obtain information about patients operated on during the night."

According to testimonies collected by Le Monde , some doctors deliberately entered false diagnoses – such as "liver surgery" – in medical files to protect patients, while intelligence agents reportedly collected radiology images showing bullet wounds.

In a voice note heard by FRANCE 24, a protester said he feared for his safety after accompanying a severely injured friend to hospital.

"I have never seen anything like this! They brought Dushkas (Soviet-made DShK heavy machine guns) into the street. They fired in continuous bursts, constantly changing ammunition. They spared no one," he said.

"My friend was standing next to me. I suddenly saw him fall. He was shot in the foot," he recounted tearfully. "I used my belt as a tourniquet and said to him, ‘Get up! Stand up!’ But he didn't say anything, he didn't answer me. Then I saw he had been shot again in the chest," he explained.

"We took him to hospital, where they told us it was already over for him and that we should take him away before [the security forces] came to collect his body."

That night haunts him, and he knows he is still not safe.

"The hospital surveillance cameras filmed us," he said, noting that Iranian authorities analyse CCTV footage. "Since then, I shake whenever I step outside. I fear that facial recognition software identified me. I haven't gone home. I'm afraid, and I don’t know what to do."

Security forces were known to target hospitals earlier in the unrest. On January 3, before the peak of the protests, they attacked Khomeini Hospital in Ilam, western Iran, firing teargas inside the building and arresting protesters from their hospital beds, triggering clashes outside.

Many injured protesters are still waiting for care, particularly those shot in the eyes with lead pellets fired from shotguns.

Amnesty International said such weapons were sometimes used at distances of less than two metres with protesters “repeatedly” targeted, particularly in the face.

At Farabi Hospital in Tehran, the capital’s main ophthalmology centre, "We received 55 patients from the provinces – from Qom, Hamedan and Aligoudarz – in recent days,” said hospital director Dr Ghassem Fakhrai in an interview with the official ISNA news agency.

"In the early hours of Friday morning, a large number of patients arrived with eye injuries, some with injuries to both eyes […]. By Saturday, we had treated 700[…]. Including transfers elsewhere, the total is nearly 1,000 patients. They require emergency surgery. This excludes those with just torn eyelids," he said.

"At Kasra Hospital in Karaj, in a single night from Thursday to Friday (January 8-9), around 40 eyes were removed," a first responder told Libération . "Numerous amputations caused by live rounds and crushed bones have also been reported."

Medical workers were also targeted in the crackdown. One doctor told FRANCE 24 that a colleague was killed on his way to the hospital.

Others were reportedly arrested for treating the wounded . Dr Alireza Golchini, a general surgeon at Dehkhoda Hospital in Qazvin in central Iran, was reportedly arrested for providing humanitarian assistance, according to several human rights advocates.

He has now been accused of espionage and faces the death penalty.

"Protocols are prepared, files are complete, and committees are in place to oversee the handover, ensuring a complete transfer of governance in the Gaza Strip across all sectors to the technocratic committee," Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem told AFP.

The 15-member National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) is a team of Palestinian technocrats created as part of the US-sponsored ceasefire agreement which came into effect on October 10.

It is charged with managing the day-to-day governance of post-war Gaza and will work under the supervision of the "Board of Peace", which US President Donald Trump will chair.

The NCAG, headed by former Palestinian Authority deputy minister Ali Shaath, is expected to enter the Gaza Strip once the territory's Rafah crossing, on its border with Egypt , reopens.

Hamas spokesman Qassem added that the Rafah crossing "must be opened in both directions, with full freedom of exit and entry to the Gaza Strip, without any Israeli obstacles".

Rafah is Gaza's only gateway to the outside world that does not lead to Israel and is a key entry point for both people and goods.

It has been closed since Israeli forces took control of it in May 2024, except for a limited reopening in early 2025, and other bids to reopen have failed to materialise.

NCAG head Shaath announced last week that Rafah would reopen in both directions the following week.

Qassem told AFP the "independent national committee's announcement of the opening of the Rafah crossing is important".

"What is more important is that we monitor this committee's handling of citizens' departures and entries in full freedom in accordance with the agreement, and not according to Israeli conditions," he added.

Israel has said it would only allow pedestrians to travel through the crossing as part of its "limited reopening" once it had recovered the remains of the last hostage, Ran Gvili.

Israeli forces brought back Gvili's remains on Monday and his funeral was held in the southern town of Meitar on Wednesday.

Qassem said Wednesday that "it is clear that Hamas is committed to the agreement to stop the war on the Gaza Strip", which began after the militant group's deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023.

"It has carried out everything required of it in the first phase and is ready to enter all tracks of the second phase," he added.

With the technocratic committee's creation and the last hostage held in Gaza returned to Israel, the ceasefire deal's next important milestones will be Hamas's disarmament and Israel's withdrawal from Gaza.

Though Hamas said the return of Gvili's body showed its commitment to the ceasefire deal, it has so far not surrendered its weapons.

The group has repeatedly said disarmament is a red line, but it has also suggested it would be open to handing over its weapons to a Palestinian governing authority.

Neither Israel nor Hamas have committed to a clear date or strategy for withdrawal or disarmament.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 16:38:19 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/7ab58472-fc5d-11f0-9113-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-28T123002Z-1752778568-RC2AAJALUHY0-RTRMADP-3-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-GAZA.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ukrainians face tough weeks as Russia targets power sector during freeze</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainians-face-tough-weeks-russia-targets-power-sector-during-freeze-2026-01-28/</link><description>KYIV, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Life will be particularly tough for Ukrainians over the next three weeks due to plunging temperatures and intense Russian attacks on the energy system that have already deprived millions of light and heat, a senior lawmaker said on Wednesday.

Despite progress in peace talks that has led to trilateral negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the United States for the first time, Russia has stepped up bombardments beyond the front line that stretches across eastern and southern Ukraine.

Temperatures of below -20 degrees Celsius (-4°F) are expected in the northern and eastern part of Ukraine next week, according to official forecasts, extremely low for the country.

"The bad news is that there will indeed be frosts, and it will be difficult," Andriy Gerus, the head of the parliament's energy committee, told the national TV channel, Marathon.

"The good news is that we need to hold out for three weeks, and then it will get easier," he added, citing predicted warmer temperatures and increased solar power from longer days.

The last two Russian missile and drone attacks on the capital Kyiv in January left about a million people without electricity and 6,000 apartment buildings without heating. After weeks of repairs, about 700 buildings still lack heat.

That picture is replicated across the country, with northern and eastern Ukraine, home to major cities including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Chernihiv and Sumy, regularly targeted, resulting in power restrictions for industry and power cuts for consumers.

Attacks on power stations, the energy transmission system and the gas sector have long been key elements of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine launched by Russia in February 2022. Moscow says it is seeking to undermine Ukraine's ability to fight.

The head of Ukraine's largest private power producer DTEK told Reuters last week that Ukraine is nearing a "humanitarian catastrophe" due to the damage to its energy systems amidst the freezing temperatures, calling for a ceasefire on attacks on energy assets. Kyiv has targeted Russian oil processing infrastructure to reduce state revenues funding the war.

Ukraine's solar energy association said around 1.5 gigawatts of new solar capacity was commissioned by Ukraine in 2025 and the total installed solar capacity in Ukraine exceeded 8.5 gigawatts, including residential installations.

The volume is higher than the installed capacity of all three Ukrainian-controlled nuclear power plants of 7.7 gigawatts - and helped the country cope during repairs to those plants last summer - but output depends on the weather.

President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said this month Ukraine's damaged energy system was meeting only 60% of the country's electricity needs this winter, with electricity generation capacity of 11 gigawatts against a need of 18 gigawatts.

Maximum electricity imports from EU countries, combined with power cuts across entire regions, are allowing the system to remain balanced nevertheless.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:33:48 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/K2L3XBF3PZM5XLZMI4K2WF6WVA.jpg?auth=1e9f0fcf49017741f01a6180eb4af3b75a356148ec12100281c02e4d4ae310dd&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Former French PMs Philippe and Attal favoured centrist candidates for next presidential election -poll</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/former-french-pms-philippe-attal-favoured-centrist-candidates-next-presidential-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Former French Prime Ministers Edouard Philippe and Gabriel Attal are the favoured candidates to lead the centrist challenge in next year's presidential election, said an Elabe/BFM TV poll on Wednesday.

The centrist French political bloc close to President Emmanuel Macron lost its grip in the lower house of parliament after Macron called a snap parliamentary election in 2024, and it has faced unyielding pressure from both the far-right National Rally (RN) and far-left France Unbowed (LFI) parties.

Philippe - Macron's first prime minister - has consistently portrayed himself as a 2027 presidential candidate .

He has also increasingly criticised Macron in recent years, as Macron's attempts to get a budget through parliament has faced consistent challenges from opposition parties.

The Elabe/BFM TV poll added that former Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau was seen as the favoured candidate from the traditional, conservative right-wing camp for the 2027 election.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 17:35:04 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/AHFQNP6MCJNRNPECF4MUWEX6UI.jpg?auth=930138880960deabab0a0983df94381b65430cfd8f59f84b07e08c53497d9296&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US tells UN: Gaza demilitarization to include internationally funded buyback program</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/us-tells-un-gaza-demilitarization-include-internationally-funded-buyback-program-2026-01-28/</link><description>UNITED NATIONS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The demilitarization of Gaza will include decommissioning weapons through an agreed process "supported by an internationally funded buyback" program, the United States told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday.

Palestinian militant group Hamas retains control of just under half of Gaza following an October ceasefire deal brokered by U.S. President Donald Trump . The agreement ties further Israeli troop withdrawals to Hamas giving up its weapons.

The United States - along with the 26 countries who have so far joined Trump's so-called Board of Peace and in consultation with the Palestinian National Committee that it oversees - will apply pressure on Hamas to disarm, according to the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Mike Waltz.

"Hamas must not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly or indirectly, in any form, period," he told the 15-member council. "All military terror and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt.

"International, independent monitors will supervise a process of demilitarization of Gaza to include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning and supported by an internationally funded buyback and reintegration program," he added.

Waltz did not elaborate and the U.S. mission to the U.N. did not immediately respond to a request for more detail on the independent monitoring and proposed buyback program.

Hamas recently agreed to discuss disarmament with other Palestinian factions and with mediators, sources have said. However, two Hamas officials told Reuters that neither Washington nor the mediators had presented the group with any detailed or concrete disarmament proposal.

A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Monday Washington believes disarmament by Hamas militants would come with some sort of amnesty for the Islamist group.

Hamas remains heavily armed, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told the Security Council.

"It still holds thousands of rockets, anti-tank missiles, and tens of thousands of Kalashnikov rifles. In total, Hamas still holds roughly 60,000 assault rifles," Danon said. "These weapons are used not only against Israel but against Gazans who oppose Hamas rule."

The Security Council in November mandated Trump's Board of Peace through 2027 and solely focused on the Gaza Strip. Russia and China abstained, complaining the U.S.-drafted resolution did not give the United Nations a clear role in Gaza's future.

The resolution described the board as a transitional administration "that will set the framework and coordinate funding for the redevelopment of Gaza" under Trump's peace plan until the Palestinian Authority has satisfactorily reformed. It also authorized the board to deploy a temporary International Stabilization Force in Gaza.

"We salute and thank our friends who have agreed to contribute to the international stabilization force," Waltz said. The United States has not yet announced which countries have agreed to contribute.

"The ISF will begin to establish control and stability, so that the Israeli Defense Forces can withdraw from Gaza based on standards, milestones and time frames linked to demilitarization," said Waltz.

He added that these would be agreed upon by the Israeli military, the ISF and the guarantors for the ceasefire agreement - the United States, Egypt and Qatar.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:39:02 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2PXLTPH2YZLPDGMS27MGBRNP4E.jpg?auth=7dab38a281158cbd5ab12cf2dd1bc646dc6d60d15bb99afceb68ff894d62ca08&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Trump warns Minneapolis mayor over lack of cooperation with immigration agents</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-warns-minneapolis-mayor-over-lack-cooperation-with-immigration-agents-2026-01-28/</link><description>MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday he was "playing with fire" after the Democratic leader reiterated that his city would not help federal agents enforce immigration law, a day after the president said his administration would "de-escalate a bit" in the city.

Tensions remained high in Minneapolis, where observers and activists say immigration raids appear to have been more targeted and less confrontational over the last 24 hours. The city has been convulsed by unrest after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by federal officers, including Saturday's killing of nurse Alex Pretti.

Trump's administration has signaled it will soften its approach, dispatching border czar Tom Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism.

A senior administration official said Homan's arrival would mark a shift to more traditional targeted operations rather than the broad sweeps Bovino has led in multiple cities. Yet it remained unclear how much would change in a city where federal agents have regularly clashed with protesters.

Observers and activists told Reuters that Immigration and Customs Enforcement activity appeared to slow somewhat on Tuesday before resuming in full on Wednesday. They said there did now appear to be more of an emphasis on targeted exercises.

On Wednesday, ICE agents were seen in several parts of the city rolling up to homes and businesses in caravans of three vehicles with six to eight agents in total, then knocking on doors and looking around, seemingly for a specific person.

If that person was not found, observers said, the agents were seen leaving. In past weeks, agents might have begun randomly stopping people and demanding to see proof of legal status, a practice that has enraged community members and led to heated encounters.

It is difficult to know precisely how many raids are taking place. Authorities do not share that information, and volunteers who track ICE and Border Patrol vehicles say many of their encrypted communication chats have broken into atomized, hyper-local groups, partly to avoid infiltration by federal agents.

"They definitely shift around," said Patty O'Keefe, a community ICE observer in south Minneapolis. "Let up for a few days so people let their guard down, I think."

One observer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe the change in tone from Trump meant there would be a meaningful slowdown in detentions.

"Like everybody out here, though, we can hope that maybe the change of having Homan come in could mean that ICE will shoot and kill less, that they won't attack people like us keeping watch on them," he said.

In one sign that political tensions remain heated, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, a Minneapolis Democrat and a frequent Trump target, was sprayed with a foul-smelling liquid by a man with a syringe during a Tuesday town hall, where she called for the abolition of ICE.

Omar was unharmed, and Minneapolis police arrested the suspect, Anthony Kazmierczak, 55, for third-degree assault. It was not clear whether Kazmierczak, who was booked into Hennepin County Jail, had an attorney.

Separately, Ecuador's foreign ministry sent a note of protest to the U.S. embassy in Quito after the ministry said an ICE agent tried to enter its Minneapolis consulate on Tuesday.

Under mounting political pressure, Trump had dialed back his attacks on Frey and Governor Tim Walz after speaking with both Democrats in the wake of Pretti's killing, vowing to work with them to lower the temperature.

But on social media on Wednesday, Trump faulted Frey for saying the city would not enforce immigration laws: "Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!"

Trump has threatened to cut off funding for states that include so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, which limit how much cooperation they give federal immigration authorities.

In response, Frey wrote on social media, "The job of our police is to keep people safe, not enforce fed immigration laws."

Pretti, 37, was shot dead during protests near his home on Saturday, and some administration officials immediately accused him of planning to kill law enforcement officers, citing the handgun he was carrying.

But video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot a restrained Pretti in the back.

The killing, coupled with the earlier fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer, has become a major political crisis for Trump. A growing number of Republicans in Congress, who rarely buck Trump, have called for independent investigations into the shooting.

Stephen Miller, the White House adviser widely seen as the architect of Trump's immigration policy, said in a statement reported by CNN that agents "may not have been following" protocol before Pretti was shot. Miller had previously described Pretti as an "assassin" and "terrorist" immediately after the shooting.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 18:40:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/DTBLHQTWSZNTHNII6SD2R5YPW4.jpg?auth=79bdba2327cca2703c042a05e029124203472784dfbdf4c17a275f75f320af4b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio says territorial issue over Donetsk yet to be bridged between Russia, Ukraine</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rubio-says-territorial-issue-over-donetsk-yet-be-bridged-between-russia-ukraine-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Territorial issues over Donetsk are the remaining item that still require a bridging of views at U.S.-mediated talks to end Russia's war in Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on Wednesday, describing the issue as "a very difficult one."

FBI agents were searching the Fulton County Election Hub and Operation Center in Union City, the agency said in a statement, a facility that state officials opened in 2023.

Democrat Joe Biden defeated Trump in the 2020 election, including winning in Georgia. Trump returned to the White House for a second term last year after winning the 2024 election.

Representatives for Fulton County's election office referred queries to the county's external affairs office, which did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The U.S. Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.

The Democratic-leaning county is home to Atlanta, Georgia's biggest city, and backed Biden by a wide margin in the 2020 election.

Trump unsuccessfully sought to overturn the election result, pressuring the state's top election official to "find" him votes that would allow him to claim victory. Earlier this month he asked a state court for $6.2 million in legal fees he said he spent fighting criminal charges of election interference filed by the county's chief prosecutor, District Attorney Fani Willis.

The prosecution of Trump by Willis for alleged racketeering foundered after revelations that she had a romantic relationship with one of the lawyers she hired, and the case was dismissed last year. The New York Times reported last year that the U.S. Justice Department has issued subpoenas for records related to Willis.

Under Trump, the Justice Department has also sued several states, demanding that they turn over large volumes of voter data.

China's defense ministry said on Saturday that Zhang Youxia, second-in-command under President Xi Jinping as vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), is under investigation. It is the latest and highest-profile purge of the country's top military leadership amid Xi's crackdown on corruption in the armed forces.

For Washington, Zhang's surprising demise removes a respected and well-known figure within China's military at a time when successive U.S. administrations have worked to build senior-level contacts to avoid mishaps between the world's two most powerful militaries.

Several former senior U.S. officials told Reuters that Zhang's dismissal came as a shock.

Xi allowed Zhang to communicate with the U.S. during the Biden administration after a 17-month-long period during which China had cut off nearly all military-to-military communications following a visit to Taiwan by then-Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi.

Such a senior-level connection - in China's political system, Zhang outranks the defense minister - was seen as an important relationship and a channel that remained viable for further talks.

One of just a few leading officers with combat experience from China's invasion of Vietnam in the late-1970s, Zhang was seen in the U.S. as a competent adviser to Xi, who sits atop the Central Military Commission, now staffed by only one general, a career political commissar Zhang Shengmin.

"Who does Xi Jinping convene in a crisis if there's only one person on his commission?" said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore who engaged with Zhang as a former U.S. defense official.

Thompson said he believed Zhang was the one active-duty PLA officer who could give Xi objective advice about China's military capabilities and shortcomings, as well as the human cost of conflict.

"There's a risk that Xi Jinping is given bad advice by sycophants who tell him what he wants to hear," he said. "That creates a risk of miscalculation."

A senior U.S. administration official said the White House had nothing to share regarding "reports of palace intrigue" in China, adding that the Trump administration is "building a military capable of denying aggression anywhere in the First Island Chain."

The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Washington also did not respond.

U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has held talks multiple times with China's Defense Minister Dong Jun - who does not sit on the CMC - since September, part of U.S. efforts to improve communications with China over its military modernization, nuclear weapons build-up, and more aggressive posture toward U.S. allies and actions in the Indo-Pacific.

But American officials have long prized contact with vice chairs of the CMC over the country's Defense Ministry, which lacks command authority over China's armed forces.

Among senior Chinese generals, Zhang was a known quantity to U.S. officials, having joined a week-long military delegation to the U.S. in May 2012 when he was a lower-level general.

David Stilwell, a former U.S. Air Force General who served as the State Department's top diplomat for East Asia in the first Trump administration, recalls that Zhang was the only Chinese officer who wanted to fly in one of the U.S. military's Osprey aircraft on that trip.

"He is very different from his fellow PLA brothers. He could have fit in very well in the U.S. military," Stilwell said, noting that he was keen to talk to U.S. soldiers and try out U.S. weapons, and struck the Americans as a professional rather than political soldier.

Still, Stilwell said senior-level engagement with CMC generals was typically perfunctory. Without Zhang to advise Xi, his main concern was that the PLA was more likely to believe a self-constructed narrative that they were ready for a "Taiwan adventure."

"I think what you lose with Zhang Youxia gone is a voice of reason," Stilwell said.

U.S. interactions with senior CMC generals have been an infrequent feature of bilateral diplomacy over the past two decades.

Biden administration national security advisor Jake Sullivan was the last known senior U.S. official to meet Zhang when the two held talks in August 2024 in Beijing.

Eric Hundman, a Chinese military expert at Washington-based security consultancy BluePath Labs, said military-to-military exchanges under Xi, even at the CMC level, tended to be scripted.

"The PLA knows its capabilities fairly well and is not interested in moving on Taiwan before they think they're ready. My question mark has always been how much Xi Jinping listens to them on that point," Hundman said.

"To the degree that he's getting worse advice, that would worry me," he said.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:30:24 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/E5SXHVYSAZK5HBSIUT4UETO55Y.jpg?auth=49e9f03fcb0a818bf53e5ac0587f24992b2e6b7290d5ec3e2ac040a00862f117&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>In U-turn, France backs move to put Iran's Guards on EU terrorism list</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/u-turn-france-backs-move-put-irans-guards-eu-terrorism-list-2026-01-28/</link><description>PARIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - France will now support the inclusion of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the European list of terrorist organisations, a move that Paris has always been hesitant to back for fear that it could cut ties with Iran.

European Union foreign ministers meet in Brussels on Thursday and were already due to sign off on new sanctions in response to a crackdown on protests that has seen thousands killed and thousands more arrested.

But even until earlier on Wednesday, France had been hesitant to back the majority in the bloc, who have pushed to add the IRGC to the EU's terrorist organisation list following the United States.

"The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered. The extraordinary courage they have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain," Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on X, adding that France would now back the listing.

The French presidency had earlier announced the decision.

Set up after Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution to protect the Shi'ite clerical ruling system, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has great sway in the country, controlling swathes of the economy and armed forces, and was put in charge of Iran's ballistic missile and nuclear programmes.

With France, Italy and Germany now in favour, the decision is likely to be approved politically on Thursday.

While some EU member states have previously pushed for the IRGC to be added to the EU's terrorist list, others, led by France have been more cautious.

They have feared that it could lead to a complete break in ties with Iran, impacting diplomatic missions, but also hurting negotiations to release European citizens held in Iranian prisons.

Paris has been especially worried about the fate of two of its citizens currently living at the embassy in Tehran after being released from prison last year.

Anti-government protests that swept across Iran since December have triggered the bloodiest crackdown by authorities since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, drawing international condemnation.

Other diplomats backing the move said the magnitude of the crackdown meant Europe had to send a very strong political signal given the IRGC's role in the clampdown, but also its activities overseas, which they said was tantamount to terrorist activity.

"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck then it’s probably a duck and it’s good to call that out," said one senior EU diplomat.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:30:55 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/2JQPB2T3MRKJ5HDX62DU5ME5UQ.jpg?auth=411f96352a3bcc0d77a34294b8d38c343c9139497aedaed9489cf9439cbf4f1b&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>France backs push to put Iran's Revolutionary Guards on EU terrorism list</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/asia-pacific/20260128-france-backs-push-eu-list-iran-revolutionary-guards-terrorist-group</link><description>France is to back a move led by Italy for the European Union to list the Iran 's Revolutionary Guards as a "terrorist organisation", the French presidency said Wednesday, after the force was accused of taking a leading role in a deadly crackdown on protests .

France "supports the inclusion of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) on the European list of terrorist organisations," the Élysee Palace said.

"The unbearable repression of the peaceful uprising of the Iranian people cannot go unanswered," Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot added in a post on X, confirming that France would back the listing.

"The extraordinary courage (the Iranian people) have shown in the face of the blind violence unleashed upon them cannot be in vain," Barrot said.

France had previously been hesitant to back such a move for fear it could cut all ties with Tehran.

The IRGC is seen as Iran's ideological army with the mandate to ensure the survival of the 1979 Islamic revolution. It is already listed as a terror group by Australia, Canada and the United States but not yet by the EU or UK.

A terrorist group designation by the EU would subject IRGC members to travel bans, asset freezes and "a prohibition on making funds or economic resources available to those listed", according to rules established by the European Council.

Iran's latest protests started on December 28 over a rise in the cost of living and rapidly spread nationwide . They were met with a violent response , the full extent of which only began to surface after more than two weeks of an unprecedented nationwide internet blackout.

According to a tally published Wednesday by the US-based Human Rights Activists News Agency, at least 6,221 people were killed , including 5,858 protesters, 214 government-affiliated forces, 100 children and 49 civilians who weren't demonstrating.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:32:17 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/767ea0f2-7980-11ef-b008-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/AP24265261045326.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Ecuador raids leftist politicians' homes over alleged Venezuela campaign funds</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/ecuador-raids-leftist-politicians-homes-over-alleged-venezuela-campaign-funds-2026-01-28/</link><description>QUITO, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Ecuador's prosecutor's office raided homes of politicians from former President Rafael Correa's leftist party on Wednesday, investigating alleged illicit money from Venezuela used to finance the 2023 presidential campaign.

The raids targeted presidential candidate Luisa Gonzalez and other members of the Citizens' Revolution party as part of a probe into alleged organized crime and money laundering, the prosecutor's office said.

• Prosecutors allege cash from Venezuela was used to finance the campaign, without providing further details.

• President Daniel Noboa recently said money linked to ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro entered Ecuador through local party campaign financing. The Venezuelan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

• Maduro was captured in Venezuela this month in a U.S. military raid and faces federal drug trafficking charges.

• "Citizens' Revolution and Luisa Gonzalez have not received a single cent from Venezuela, from any cartel, or from anyone," Gonzalez told reporters, calling it political persecution.

• Gonzalez said her party submitted campaign expenses to electoral authorities and accused the prosecutor's office of lacking evidence.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:55:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US agents involved in fatal shooting of Alex Pretti in Minneapolis placed on leave</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260128-us-agents-involved-in-fatal-shooting-of-alex-pretti-in-minneapolis-placed-on-leave</link><description>Two immigration agents involved in the fatal shooting of a protester in Minneapolis have been placed on leave, a US Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said Wednesday, as President Donald Trump battles backlash over the incident.

"The two officers involved are on administrative leave. This is standard protocol," the spokesperson told AFP in a statement.

Intensive care unit nurse Alex Pretti was shot multiple times on Saturday after being forced to the ground by camouflaged officers in a scuffle captured on video.

His death, which followed the deadly shooting of another female protester by an immigration officer earlier in January, sparked nationwide and bipartisan outrage.

Trump has called for an "honorable and honest investigation" into Pretti's death and suggested he would "de-escalate a little bit" the administration's immigration crackdown in the city in the northern state of Minnesota.

Stephen Miller – a powerful figure who leads Trump's hardline immigration policy – told AFP Tuesday that the agents may have breached "protocol" before the shooting.

The White House later said Miller was referring to "general guidance" to immigration agents operating in Minnesota, not the specific incident involving Pretti.

Foreign nationals with clean criminal records who arrived before the end of 2025, and who can prove they’ve lived in Spain for at least five months, will soon be eligible for renewable one-year residence permits. People who applied for asylum in the country before December 31 will also be able to apply. Migration Minister Elma Saiz said Tuesday that she expects applications to open April through June.

This extraordinary mass regularisation – the first in Spain in more than 20 years – was born from a citizen-backed proposal signed by some 700,000 people and supported by hundreds of civil society groups, including the Catholic Church .

While most immigrants in Spain have legal status, the country’s booming economy has also drawn hundreds of thousands of largely working-age people from across the world to work in the country’s underground economy. Undocumented migrants work on construction sites, on farms, in shops and restaurants or in people's homes, cooking and cleaning and caring for children.

The bulk of these workers come from the country’s former colonial holdings across Latin America and North Africa such as Venezuela , Colombia , Ecuador and nearby Morocco .

And while footage of migrants scrambling over the barbed-wire fences surrounding Spain’s North African exclaves or lurching towards the Canary Islands in flimsy dinghies weigh heavily on the public imagination, the reality is usually less dramatic.

Most undocumented migrants are people who entered Spain legally , going on to overstay their visas and find cash-in-hand work in what has become known as the country’s “black economy”.

The decision sits in stark contrast to a hardening approach to irregular immigration that has flourished across Europe and the US in recent years as the far right gains ground.

Despite declining numbers of irregular arrivals, European Union states in December last year backed harsher migration measures that would allow rejected asylum seekers to be deported to offshore “return hubs” or countries with which they have no connection.

In France, last year’s figures show rising numbers of deportations paired with fewer cases of undocumented migrants being granted legal pathways to work.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has maintained that – far from being a drain on the country’s social services as critics claim – migrants play a crucial role in keeping the country’s welfare state standing. Bringing half a million workers into the formal economy, he argues, will only strengthen the country’s social security system.

Migration Policy Institute Europe deputy director Jasmijn Slootjes said that Spain’s decision was partly in response to fears that the ageing native-born population won’t be capable of sustaining the kind of workforce the country needs to thrive.

“If you look at the demographic decline, the fertility rate in Spain is the lowest in Europe – so it's really, really low,” she said.

“There were a lot of skill shortages, labour shortages, and de facto a lot of irregular migrants are working, although in informal work. And through regularising you can, of course, get more tax payments, and you also get better matching [to] their skills – because people can actually work at their skill level. So it’s a very pragmatic approach.”

She said that the Sanchez government – which announced this decision as part of a deal struck with its erstwhile coalition partners, the leftist PODEMOS party – was championing migration as a fundamental driver of the country’s flourishing economy.

Official data released on Tuesday indicated that 52,500 of the 76,200 people who raised employment numbers in the final quarter of 2025 were born overseas, with that same quarter marking Spain's lowest unemployment rate in 18 years.

“That’s really something that's being mentioned time and again – this link to the economy, maintaining social welfare access and a healthy, competitive country. That is really a core argument in all of this, and the evidence is indeed pointing that way,” Slootjes said.

“I think one quote of [Sanchez's] is very clear in clarifying their approach – he says, ‘Spain needs to choose between being an open and prosperous country, or a closed-off and poor country’,” she said.

Since the last mass regularisation in 2005 – the sixth such amnesty since the fall of the Franco dictatorship – Spain has pursued a less dramatic approach to undocumented migrants, offering them a step-by-step pathway over several years towards gaining a legal right to live, work and eventually become a Spanish citizen.

Despite a turbulent 20 years of boom and bust as Spain weathered the 2008 global financial crisis and then the Covid-19 pandemic, the country has largely avoided the rising anti-immigration sentiment that has pushed far-right parties into prominence – and sometimes power – across Europe and beyond.

That changed in 2018 with the arrival of Vox on the political scene. Born out of a broader backlash to Catalan separatism, the far-right party won the third-most seats in parliament in 2019 on an increasingly anti-immigration platform.

Unsurprisingly, Vox party leader Santiago Abascal was incensed by the announcement.

“The tyrant Sanchez hates the Spanish people. He wants to replace them ,” he posted on social media, adding that Sanchez wants to " accelerate the invasion ”, echoing oft-repeated right-wing narratives.

Abascal instead called for “remigration” – another far-right rallying cry that champions the mass deportation of people born overseas, sometimes including naturalised citizens .

Alberto Nunez Feijoo, leader of the conservative People’s Party – which oversaw several of the amnesties in previous decades – has also criticised the decision, as the party struggles to head off rising support for the anti-immigration Vox.

Slootjes said that while Spain was not immune from the rising tide of nativist sentiment, levels of anti-immigration feeling had not reached the same heights as in other parts of Europe.

“Spain is also witnessing similar trends that we’ve been seeing in other countries in Europe and also across the Atlantic, of course, which is this increasing restrictive narrative around migration and a rise of support for the far right,” she said.

“This is really a moment where Vox is very vocal and really pushing this issue. So for those who are anti-migrant and agree with them, of course this can bolster their support."

Spanish think-tank Funcas in May last year found that local support for immigration was among the highest in Europe , with just 28 percent of respondents favouring restricted immigration in 2024. Those attitudes appeared to endure even as the country reeled from mass unemployment in the wake of the 2008 crash.

"Even during years when unemployment exceeded 25 percent, support for immigration remained largely stable," the report said.

And with more and more countries across Europe facing similar demands for workers, giving those people already practicing their livelihoods without legal protections a pathway out of precarity could well be a way forward, she noted.

“It's food for thought for policymakers across Europe and across the world, especially as this competition for talent and skill shortages, and ageing and demographic decline are plaguing our economies and societies, and it will all ramp up,” she said. “So it's going to be interesting to see how this may become more of a tool in the future, maybe if the tides are shifting and Spain is really testing it out and really creating this evidence to build future policies on how to do it – and how to do it well.”</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 19:57:30 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/0610f774-fc66-11f0-a4e9-005056bf30b7/w:1280/p:16x9/AP25295334634240.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Nigerian police fire tear gas, protester injured in Lagos floating slum protests</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/nigerian-police-fire-tear-gas-protester-injured-lagos-floating-slum-protests-2026-01-28/</link><description>LAGOS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Nigerian police fired tear gas to disperse residents protesting in Lagos on Wednesday over demolition work in one of Africa's largest floating slums that has displaced thousands of people, with one protester reportedly injured.

Lagos state officials, with the help of armed police and excavators, have been demolishing homes in the Makoko slum on the edge of the commercial capital, arguing that residents illegally built their houses - mostly wooden shacks built on stilts above the water - near high-voltage power lines.

On Wednesday, more than 1,000 angry residents and affected families marched to the Lagos State House of Assembly to express their outrage over the demolitions.

The demonstrators refused a police order to disperse and instead demanded to be addressed by the Lagos state governor, whose office is nearby.

Police fired tear gas to disperse the gathering. One person sustained a leg injury and was taken to hospital.

"We were tear-gassed at Alausa. Look at this person, he left his house and now he has become disabled," protester Yawo Gburo said, referring to the injured demonstrator.

Lagos police did not immediately comment.

Makoko, which is home to thousands of mostly poor Nigerians, began life as a fishing village more than 100 years ago. There is no official data on its population, with estimates ranging between 80,000 and 200,000 residents, according to nonprofit groups.

The megacity of Lagos, with an estimated population of more than 20 million, has suffered from a serious shortage of housing, leading to the development of many informal and illegal settlements.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 20:38:05 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/EXQ5CELYPZMVVM7PMXXUMDGOLY.jpg?auth=72d71605256bf511a264b696526644657f23099d41dd259ecc213be709189dda&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>US, Greenland and Denmark start diplomatic talks to ease Trump tensions</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/us-greenland-denmark-start-diplomatic-talks-ease-trump-tensions-2026-01-28/</link><description>COPENHAGEN, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Talks between the United States, Greenland and Denmark began on Wednesday, the Danish foreign ministry said, as the three parties seek to resolve a diplomatic crisis over President Donald Trump's threats against the Arctic territory.

"Flight NSE 8849, covering the Cucuta-Ocana route, which took off at around 11:42 a.m. and was scheduled to land at around 12:05 p.m., reported its last contact with air traffic control at 11:54 a.m. today," Satena said in a statement.

Newspaper El Tiempo reported that lawmaker Diogenes Quintero and Carlos Salcedo, a candidate to Congress ahead of elections in March, were aboard the aircraft.

Representatives for Quintero said in a statement that they had not had contact with the politician or his assistant, Natalia Acosta Salcedo, since the plane took off.

"We are praying for our friends right now," the statement said.

Colombia's Transportation Minister Mafe Rojas said protocols were put into place aimed at tracking down the plane.

The plane lost contact in a mountainous area planted with coca leaves, the raw material for cocaine, and where illegal armed groups such as the National Liberation Army (ELN) and a dissident faction of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) operate.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:30:37 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/466BJJQ7PVGY5O53NZ3KL65MHM.png?auth=b9c3bf166c40a6778eb5672993fde7c30a15f48329026674eff92afd8da1d0ca&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Rubio details Trump administration's plan to control sale of Venezuelan oil</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260128-rubio-details-trump-administration-plan-to-control-sale-of-venezuelan-oil</link><description>The Trump administration soon will allow Venezuela to sell oil now subject to US sanctions, with the revenue initially dedicated to basic government services such as policing and health care and subject to Washington's oversight, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday.

The United States will retain control in the short term to ensure the oil revenue is used to stabilize Venezuela , Rubio said at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. He noted that the interim leaders of the South American country will submit “a budget” every month of what they need funded.

“The funds from that (oil sales) will be deposited into an account that we will have oversight over,” Rubio said, adding that the US Treasury would control the process. Venezuela, he said, “will spend that money for the benefit of the Venezuelan people.”

Rubio offered new insight into how the US is planning to handle the sale of tens of millions of barrels of oil from Venezuela, which has the largest proven reserves of crude in the world, and oversee where the money flows. After the US raid that captured then-President Nicolas Maduro this month, the US is working to influence the next steps in the South American country through its vast oil resources.

The US will not subsidize oil industry investments in Venezuela, Rubio said, and is only overseeing the sale of sanctioned petroleum as an “interim step.”

“This is simply a way to divide revenue so that there isn’t systemic collapse while we work through this recovery and transition,” Rubio said.

Democrats and some Republicans on the committee pressed Rubio for more details about Trump’s plans for Venezuela’s oil. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked for assurances from Rubio that the sale of Venezuelan oil will be fair and open, not rigged to benefit oil companies allied with Trump.

“You are taking their oil at gunpoint, you are holding and selling that oil … you’re deciding how and for what purposes that money is going to be used in a country of 30 million people,” Murphy said. “I think a lot of us believe that that is destined for failure.”

Under Maduro, Rubio said Venezuela's oil industry benefited the country's corrupt leaders and countries such as China, which purchased Venezuelan oil at a discount. Now, Venezuela's interim leaders are assisting the US in seizing illegal oil shipments, he said.

The US will give Venezuela's current leaders instructions on how the money can and cannot be spent and conduct audits to ensure it is used as intended, Rubio said. He said Venezuela could use the money to pay for policing or to buy medicine.

The fund was initially set up in Qatar to avoid having the proceeds seized by American creditors and because of other legal complications that stem from the US not considering Maduro’s government legitimate, Rubio said.

Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been set aside and as much as $3 billion more is anticipated, he said.

“It’s an account that belongs to Venezuela, but it has US sanctions as a blocking mechanism,” Rubio said. “We only control the dispersal of the money, we don’t control the actual money.”

Earlier this month, acting Venezuelan President Delcy Rodriguez said cash from oil sales would flow into two sovereign wealth funds: one to support crisis-stricken health services and a second to bolster public infrastructure, including the electric grid.

The country’s hospitals are so poorly equipped that patients are asked to provide supplies needed for their care, from syringes to surgical screws. They also must pay for lab and imaging tests at private hospitals.

On Tuesday, during a televised event to announce the revamping of various health care facilities, Rodriguez said her government and the US administration “have established respectful and courteous channels of communication” since Maduro was captured.

Neither Rodriguez nor her government’s press office immediately comment on Rubio’s remarks Wednesday.

At Rodriguez’s request, Venezuelan lawmakers last week began debating an overhaul of the country’s energy law. The proposed changes are meant to create conditions to attract much-needed private foreign investment.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 21:56:59 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/223dac42-fc90-11f0-9d77-005056a97e36/w:1280/p:16x9/AP26028576651081.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>Exclusive: US handing over seized tanker to Venezuela, officials say</title><link>https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/us-handing-over-seized-tanker-venezuela-officials-say-2026-01-28/</link><description>WASHINGTON, Jan 28 (Reuters) - The United States is handing over a tanker to Venezuela that it seized this month, two U.S. officials told Reuters on Wednesday, the first known instance in which President Donald Trump's administration has returned such a tanker.

The United States has been carrying out a months-long effort to seize oil tankers linked to Venezuela - carrying out seven apprehensions since late last year.

The officials, who were speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the tanker that is being handed to Venezuelan authorities was the Panama-flagged supertanker M/T Sophia. They did not say why the tanker was returned.

The U.S. Coast Guard, which leads interdiction and seizure operations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Sophia was interdicted on January 7 by the Coast Guard and U.S. military forces. At the time, the administration said the Sophia, which is under sanctions, was a "stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker."

Trump has focused his foreign policy in Latin America on Venezuela, initially aiming to push Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from power. After failing to find a diplomatic solution, Trump ordered U.S. forces to fly into the country to grab him and his wife in a daring overnight raid on January 3.

Since then, Trump has said the U.S. plans to control Venezuela's oil resources indefinitely as it seeks to rebuild the country's dilapidated oil industry in a $100 billion plan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 22:56:10 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://www.reuters.com/resizer/v2/LNFG5IQXXRJ2HE2BCXK6NWYA54.jpg?auth=3efbdd55dc7e06047a8e334ee4b3a3f652b32a42fd944d8d360811fe53a78265&amp;height=1005&amp;width=1920&amp;quality=80&amp;smart=true" type="image/jpeg" /></item><item><title>ICE role at Winter Olympics in Italy to be advisory only, US ambassador says</title><link>https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20260128-ice-winter-olympics-italy-advisory-us-ambassador</link><description>A branch of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sent to Italy for the Winter Olympics will not carry out patrols and will have only an "advisory" role, Washington's ambassador to Rome said on Wednesday.

News of its deployment for the February 6-22 Games in Milan-Cortina has sparked anger in Italy, after the agency's involvement in an often brutal crackdown on immigration in the United States.

But US ambassador to Italy Tilman J. Fertitta said ICE's Homeland Security Investigations unit will be "strictly advisory and intelligence-based, with no patrolling or enforcement involvement".

"At the Olympics, HSI criminal investigators will contribute their expertise by providing intelligence on transnational criminal threats, with a focus on cybercrimes and national security threats.

"All security operations will remain the responsibility of Italian authorities, " he said after meeting Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi.

ICE operations in a number of US cities have triggered large-scale protests, and the recent killings of two demonstrators have caused outrage.

Agents accused of violence there are from a different division than that earmarked for the Olympics.

Fertitta said the HSI focuses on "cross-border criminal activity, ranging from investigating human smuggling, narcotics trafficking, child exploitation, financial crimes, intellectual property right theft, to recovering stolen art and antiquities".

The Italian authorities initially denied speculation that ICE would be present at the Games, then played down their role, suggesting that they would only be helping with security for the US delegation.

US Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio are expected at the opening ceremony at Milan's San Siro stadium on February 6.

Italy's political opposition has asked the government to refuse the deployment, and protests are expected in the coming days in Rome and Milan.</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 22:57:12 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://s.france24.com/media/display/ad4268f2-fba3-11f0-8975-005056a90284/w:1280/p:16x9/2026-01-26T142529Z-798936652-UP1EM1Q0VXAL9-RTRMADP-3-OLYMPICS-2026-PREVIEW.jpg" type="image/jpeg" /></item></channel></rss>
